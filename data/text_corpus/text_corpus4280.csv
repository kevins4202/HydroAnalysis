pulsation 1 introduction a cycloidal propeller is a special type of marine propeller it is typically used on ships with special maneuverability and mobility requirements such as tugboats ferries and submersibles a cycloidal propeller usually consists of three to six blades which are mounted outside the hull and are perpendicular to the hull surface the blades are equally spaced along the circumference of the propeller and rotate around their centers of rotation while revolving around an axis perpendicular to the hull surface their trajectory when the ship advances from which their name is also derived is cycloidal a cycloidal propeller can produce thrust in any direction above the water surface and has the advantages of good maneuverability a great capacity for resisting wind waves and a quick response time cycloidal propellers have garnered considerable research interest in recent years particularly owing to their excellent maneuverability therefore investigating the hydrodynamic performance of such propellers is of great value for engineering applications the focus of this work is on the impact of motion parameters on the hydrodynamic performance of cycloidal propeller early research on cycloidal propellers was focused on their time averaged hydrodynamic performance the classical numerical method proposed by zhu 1982 considered the impact of the trajectory curve and blade rotation on the coefficients of drag and lift and linearizations were removed to increase computational accuracy their numerical results agreed well with the experimental results obtained using the nsbm model at most eccentricities newer methods have also gradually been developed for example yun et al 2007 performed an experiment and numerical analyzed a cycloidal blade system during which the time averaged hydrodynamic performance yielded from the experiment was highly consistent with that of the numerical prediction jürgens et al 2010 further optimized a cycloidal propeller using a vortex lattice method developed for three dimensional foils and improved its efficiency by 4 8 a lower order unsteady hydrodynamic model was more recently developed by halder et al 2018 which incorporates nonlinear lifting theodorsen s approach polhamus leading edge suction analogy and a modified double multiple streamtube d ms model with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd the transient hydrodynamics of cycloidal propellers have become the subject of increasing research interest for instance siegel et al 2007 studied the unsteady dynamic lift produced by a one blade cycloidal propeller at medium reynolds numbers and the distribution of unsteady flow fields and vortices behind the propeller palm et al 2011 experimentally compared the ventilation behaviors of rudder and cycloidal propellers through a scaled model test and revealed many details regarding the mechanism of flow behind the thruster by employing a cfd approach using numerical models validated against wind tunnel test results yu et al 2017 discussed the effects of blade number and advance ratio on the forward flight characteristics of a cycloidal rotor they found that as the number of blades increased the thrust pulsation and the induced vibration decreased they also found that the maximum forward flight efficiency typically occurred at a medium high advance speed more recently reed et al 2019 investigated the thrust and power consumption of the blade of a cycloidal propeller with and without rotation and revealed the importance of dynamic stall in the generation of thrust and drag singh and páscoa 2019 studied the impact of numerical turbulence models on the computation of the hydrodynamic performance of a single cycloidal propeller blade and compared the evolution of vortices at the leading and trailing edges for different models in recent years the effects of the geometric and motion parameters of propeller blades on their efficiency have been investigated regarding geometric parameters hu et al 2019 explored the effects of blade aspect and taper ratios on the efficiency of a cycloidal propeller their experimental and numerical results both demonstrated that aspect ratio had an insignificant effect on efficiency and that larger taper ratios led to higher efficiencies because they resulted in longer chords their study has provided valuable qualitative guidance for the design of cycloidal propeller blades additionally fasse et al 2019 numerically simulated a cycloidal propeller using a simplified two dimensional model and computed the effect of inter blade distance on the highest efficiency at given geometric and operational parameter settings in order to optimize inter blade distance they also analyzed foil to foil interactions to determine the effect of the number of blades on propulsion efficiency during operation the oncoming flow velocity vector of a cycloidal propeller blade continuously changes with the blade orbit angle it also differs under different parametric settings at a given blade orbit angle considering this phenomenon prabhu et al 2019 computed the hydrodynamic load on the rotating blade disc of a cycloidal propeller as well as the effect of a simplified hull boundary on propeller hydrodynamics in a viscous fluid previously analytical and experimental studies on cycloidal propellers have mainly been focused on the optimization of their time averaged hydrodynamic performance and efficiency however their engineering applications require more in depth explorations of the instantaneous load upon and the flow field around their blades in this study the impacts of various operating parameters i e center of blade rotation eccentricity and advance coefficient on the blade load pulsation and efficiency of a propeller were analyzed using a simplified two dimensional numerical model the model was developed based on an extensive analysis of its convergence and was resolved using a cfd method our study provides insights that can serve as a basis for further optimizing cycloidal propellers and for improving their efficiency 2 theory and data 2 1 governing equations for

domain of the model the side boundaries are two symmetric planes and the distance between the center of the cycloidal propeller and the two planes is 6d the distance between the velocity inlet and the center of the cycloidal propeller is also 6d the fluid passes the cycloidal propeller and flows out through the pressure outlet the distance between the outlet and the center of the cycloidal propeller is 20d the boundaries are located far enough from the rotational domain of the cycloidal propeller thereby minimizing the boundary effects on the computational results the surface of the blade was defined as a non slipping wall surface and the viscosity of the fluid was considered 3 1 2 grid convergence a structured gridding scheme was adopted for the computational domain with the discretization of the cycloidal propeller refined in a step wise manner as shown in fig 3 zone c fig 3 the far fluid domain was gridded with a basic mesh of 0 0625 m in size zone b the fluid domain near the area of rotation was refined with a mesh of 0 03125 m finally zone a the blade operation area was further refined with a mesh of 0 015625 m or 3 125 of the chord length i e the length from the leading edge to trailing edge of the blade this gridding scheme resulted in 230 000 cells occurring in zone a the boundary layer for the blade surface was also gridded using a prism mesh and a data exchange mode for overlapping grids was adopted fig 4 shows the gridding in the vicinity and surface of the blade using a finer prism mesh a more refined gridding scheme is better able to capture the instantaneous load on an operating blade validation of the convergence of the gridding scheme was based on the parametric settings eccentricity e 0 8 advance speed v 6 knot rotary speed 37 rpm advance coefficient j 0 759 and re 1 5 106 k tx1 k ty1 and k q1 were the dimensionless coefficients for the thrust t x1 lateral thrust t y1 and torque q 1 respectively 20 k t x 1 t x 1 π 2 2 ρ n 2 d 3 21 k t y 1 t y 1 π 2 2 ρ n 2 d 3 22 k q 1 2 q 1 π 2 2 ρ n 2 d 4 to validate the gridding scheme the convergence of the basic mesh of the computational domain was validated by first setting the size of the mesh for refining zone a fig 3 equal to 3 125 the chord length which translated into 230 000 cells the basic mesh was then scaled up and down two times to compute the thrust and torque of a single blade respectively the results yielded by the different gridding schemes were reasonably consistent with maximum inconsistencies of 1 85 for the thrust fig 5 and 2 1 for the torque fig 6 coefficients the inconsistency between the lowest thrust coefficients yielded by the original gridding scheme and the up scaled scheme was 1 85 while that between the original gridding scheme and the down scaled scheme was 0 422 indicating that inconsistency decreased with mesh size the thickness of the first layer of the boundary layer mesh was denoted as y in simulating intense boundary layer flows the value of y had an important impact on the results thus the convergence of the thickness of the first layer of the boundary layer mesh on the solid wall surface was validated by separately computing the thrust coefficients k tx1 at y values of 0 35 1 and 3 the results for the three different y values were reasonably consistent as shown in fig 7 a in particular k tx1 first decreased gradually from 0 at θ 0 then decreased rapidly from θ 144 before reaching its minimum value and then increasing at θ 171 to reach 0 at θ 180 the peak value occurred at θ 230 the inconsistency among the three curves was the largest 0 636 at the bottom the curve for y 3 bottomed out at the largest value while that for y 0 35 bottomed out at the smallest value and exhibited the sharpest turning point fig 7 b this confirmed the convergence of the thrust computation thus y was set to 0 35 for the subsequent calculations the computed torque coefficients k q1 at the three different y values were consistent and varied in patterns similar to the thrust coefficients as shown in fig 8 a in particular the torque coefficient was negative at θ 180 and positive at θ 180 it first decreased from 0 at θ 0 bottomed out and began increasing rapidly at θ 169 5 and then peaked at θ 230 the largest inconsistency between the three k q1 curves occurred at the bottom 0 801 wherein the k q1 curve for y 3 bottomed out at the largest value while that for y 0 35 did so at the smallest value fig 8 b additionally the inconsistency between the curves for y 1 and y 0 35 was less than that between the curves for y 1 and y 3 this confirmed their convergence for torque computation notably the boundary layer greatly impacted the shear force of the fluid and the boundary layer of the wall surface had a greater impact on the computation of moment force than of thrust 3 1 3 convergence of time step length a suitable time step length is required to capture the load on a blade during its rapid rotation therefore the instantaneous load on a blade at its maximum swing speed was computed using time step lengths δt of 0 0002 s 0 0005 s and 0 0008 s the thrust and torque coefficients obtained using these three different time steps were reasonably consistent as shown in figs 9 a and 10 a the greatest inconsistencies between the smallest thrust and torque coefficients obtained using these lengths were 2 67 and 2 52 respectively figs 9b and 10b additionally the coefficients yielded by a smaller time step bottomed out at smaller values and decreased to and increased from the bottoms at higher slopes than those yielded by larger time steps therefore the time step length was set to 0 0005 s for subsequent computations 3 2 effects of the center of rotation on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation fig 11 shows the center of rotation r of the propeller blade as shown l is the distance between r and the leading edge of the blade c is the chord length and l c l c fig 12 a shows the thrust coefficients of a single blade at different values of l c 25 60 during a circle of rotation with θ changing from 0 to 360 at all different values of l c the thrust of the blade was negative as θ increased from 0 to 180 and positive as θ further increased from 180 to 360 the mean thrust coefficient is almost unchanged while the peak of instantaneous thrust coefficients reaches largest at l c 25 a position closest to the leading edge as the center of blade rotation moved toward the trailing edge the thrust coefficient bottomed out at a smaller value and the turning point for rapid decreasing occurred at a value of θ closer to 180 at a l c value of 55 or 60 the thrust coefficient exhibited an increasing trend at the turning point as θ increased from 180 to 360 a smaller value of l c also led to a larger thrust coefficient exhibiting a pattern similar to that as θ increased from 0 to 180 at l c 60 a position closest to the trailing edge the thrust coefficient also bottomed out and began increasing rapidly at θ 180 fig 12 b shows the mean maximum minimum and standard deviation of the thrust coefficient of a single blade at different values of l c as the value of l c increased from 25 to 60 the mean coefficient varied insignificantly while the maximum and minimum coefficients decreased the standard deviations represented the magnitude of fluctuations in thrust the period over which thrust fluctuated was only related to the rotary speed and number of blades and the magnitude of fluctuation was markedly affected by the position of the center of rotation in particular the magnitude of fluctuation notably decreased as the value of l c approached 50 the variance of the load was given by the following equation 23 σ 2 1 m x i x 2 m where m is the sample size x i is the i th sample and x is the mean of the sample the sample consisted of the measured instantaneous loads on the blade at every time step obtained from two cycles the standard deviation is the square root of sample variance and provided a measure of the dispersion of the set of measurements indicating how close they were to the mean of the set the overall thrust of the cycloidal propeller during a cycle of its rotation at different values of l c is shown in fig 13 the cycle can be divided into five phases one for each blade fig 13 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the thrust coefficient at different values of l c when the blade revolved to the 12 o clock position of the eccentric point θ 180 the thrust and torque changed drastically these changes occurred once every 72 of propeller rotation fig 14 a shows the overall torque consumption of the propeller during a cycle of rotation at different values of l c the cycle can be divided into five phases according to the number of propellers fig 14 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the torque coefficient at different values of l c as the value of l c increased both the thrust and torque first decreased then bottomed out at l c 55 and finally increased notably the thrust at l c 55 did not exhibit drastic within phase fluctuations as compared with the thrust at other values of l c indicating that a value of l c closer to 50 led to smaller fluctuations considering that the load on the blade was continuously increasing the standard deviation of the thrust coefficient k tx during the decreasing phase was defined as positive and that during the increasing phase was defined as negative as shown in fig 13 a when l c 25 there is a trough between θ 0 36 and the thrust first decreases and then increases and when l c 55 there is a peak between θ 0 36 and the thrust first increases and then decreases in the interval θ 0 36 if there is a trough in the thrust then the variance is set to positive in the interval θ 0 36 if there is a peak in the thrust and the thrust increases first and then decreases then the variance is set to negative fig 15 shows the efficiency thrust and torque of the propeller at different values of l c a smaller value of l c led to both a larger standard deviation in hydrodynamic performance and a lower propeller efficiency fig 16 a shows the lateral thrust of a single blade during a cycle of cycloidal propeller rotation while fig 16 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the lateral thrust coefficient of a single blade at different values of l c the lateral thrust on a single blade varied symmetrically around the point of θ 180 more specifically the lateral thrust first increased slowly and then began to increase or decrease at θ 144 and peaked or bottomed out at θ 180 at l c 50 a smaller value of l c led to a higher peak at l c 50 a larger value of l c led to a lower bottom fig 17 a shows the overall lateral thrust of the propeller during a cycle of rotation at different values of l c the circle can be divided into five phases one for each propeller the lateral thrust fluctuated drastically when the blade revolved to the 12 o clock position of the eccentric point θ 180 and this fluctuation occurred every 72 of propeller rotation the lateral thrust varied smoothly during the intervals between these periodic fluctuations fig 17 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the overall lateral thrust coefficient at different values of l c as the value of l c increased the thrust and torque first decreased then bottomed out at l c 55 and finally increased indicating that a value of l c closer to 50 led to smaller pulsations the effects of center of rotation on thrust and torque of cycloidal propeller are similar as the center of rotation approaches the trailing edge from leading edge the rotational speed of leading edge increases and that of trailing edge decreases this causes the variation of instantaneous hydrodynamic forces from figs 12 14 it can be seen that an optimal lc can dramatically mitigate the force and torque pulsation for present study the pulsations reach their minimum as lc 0 55 however the mean values of thrust and torque are not affected very much from fig 14 it can be seen that there is also an optimal lc for maximum efficiency for present study it is about 0 5 3 3 impact of advance speed on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation the thrust torque and efficiency of the modeled cycloidal propeller at different advance speeds between 4 and 7 knots were computed in order to compare its hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsations at these different speeds fig 18 shows the thrust and torque coefficients at different advance speeds within a circle of propeller rotation the torque and thrust varied in similar patterns in particular the torque and thrust fluctuated drastically in the vicinity of the bottoms of the rotation curves and decreased slowly from the peaks to the bottoms the thrust and torque coefficients at different advance speeds peaked and bottomed out at consistent phase angles the ranges of such fluctuations and the mean values of thrust at different advance speeds are shown in fig 19 as the advance speed increased both the amplitudes means and range of variance for both thrust and torque decreased fort instance when the advance speed reached 7 knots the thrust reversed direction thus providing no forward power as the advance speed increased the thrust efficiency first increased peaked at 5 knots and then decreased overall fluctuation in the thrust of the cycloidal propeller decreased as the advance speed increased the effect of advance speed on hydrodynamics of a cycloidal propeller is not very much different from that of a conventional screw propeller as advance speed increases both the pulsation and the mean thrust increases accordingly comparing to the thrust the torque varies quite nonlinearly with advance speed meanwhile the thrust decreases more rapidly with advance speed than the torque 3 4 impact of rotary speed on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation the hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsations of the cycloidal propeller at a given advance speed and different rotary speeds were computed fig 20 shows the overall thrusts and torques at different rotary speeds as the rotary speed increased the advance coefficient j decreased and the time required for one cycle of rotation decreased fig 20 a within 1 2 s the propeller had completed the five phase cycle of rotation at a rotary speed of 56 rpm but had completed only three phases at a rotary speed of 32 rpm and thus only part of the cycle as the rotary speed increased the thrust and torque increased gradually the efficiency first increased rapidly was sustained at approximately 70 and then slowly decreased additionally the thrust pulsation increased gradually as shown in fig 21 higher rotary speeds led to larger magnitudes mean values and fluctuations in both the thrust and torque larger fluctuations at the curve peaks and bottoms and markedly larger fluctuations in thrust a change in either the rotary or advance speed resulted in a change in the advance coefficient j which was decreased by increasing the advance speed or by decreasing the advance velocity of the oncoming flow as the advance coefficient increased the thrust and torque decreased the corresponding efficiency first increased peaked at a medium high advance coefficient and then decreased overall thrust pulsation decreased 3 5 impact of eccentricity on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation eccentricity affects blade rotary speeds β a larger eccentricity resulted in a higher rotary speed when the blade revolved to the 12 o clock position of the eccentric point θ 180 subsequently the hydrodynamic performance of the cycloidal propeller at an advance speed v of 6 knots a rotary speed of 37 rpm and at different eccentricities e 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 was computed as the eccentricity increased the mean values and magnitudes of both thrust and torque coefficients increased as shown in fig 22 in particular the thrust and torque coefficients at e 0 8 were markedly larger than those at the other three eccentricity values this indicates that with constant advance and rotary speeds a larger eccentricity resulted in a larger thrust and a larger torque consumption at e 0 2 0 4 or 0 6 the thrust and torque coefficients were negative resulting in a thrust direction opposite to the advance direction the thrust coefficients at e 0 2 and e 0 4 varied in similar ways peaking and bottoming out at similar phase angles more specifically the thrust coefficients at e 0 2 and e 0 4 bottomed out at the phase angles at which the thrust coefficient at e 0 8 peaked the standard deviation of thrust decreased as e increased from 0 2 to 0 6 but decreased markedly as e further increased to 0 8 fig 22 b additionally the standard deviation at e 0 8 was much larger than that at e 0 2 0 4 or 0 6 fig 23 shows the variations in the thrust and lateral thrust of a single blade at the four different eccentricities in one cycle of propeller rotation as eccentricity increased the overall thrust on a single blade increased at θ 180 a smaller eccentricity resulted in larger variations in thrust a smaller bottom value and a smaller phase angle at which the thrust bottomed at θ 180 a larger eccentricity resulted in a larger amplitude and mean thrust the positive thrust of the propeller was provided by the blades rotating at phase angles from 180 to 360 fig 23 b shows the lateral thrusts of a single blade at different eccentricities at e 0 8 as the propeller rotated the lateral thrust first increased monotonically peaked significantly at θ 180 and then decreased monotonically at e 0 2 0 4 or 0 6 the lateral thrust bottomed out once before and after the propeller rotated to θ 180 as eccentricity increases the thrust and toque increases accordingly this indicates that the cycloidal propeller can generate more thrust without increasing the rotational speed from fig 22 it can be seen that there is an optimal eccentricity for considerable thrust with minimum pulsation the effect of smaller eccentricity on toque is not as significant as that on thrust too large eccentricity can lead to dramatic variation of lateral thrust the fluid mechanism of the effect of rotary speed and advance speed on the hydrodynamic performance of cycloidal propellers is quite conventional and similar as advance speed increases the relative speed between the blade and the fluid is counteracted which leads the reduction of thrust and torque by increasing the rotary speed the relative speed and angle of attack of blade is enlarged this leads more significant pressure difference between pressure side and suction side and thus to increase the hydrodynamic loading of cycloidal propeller however the thrust is more easily subjected to the advance speed and rotary speed thus there is an optimal advance coefficient for maximum efficiency the effect of varying eccentricity and rotation center on hydrodynamic performance of cycloidal propeller is quite complicated as eccentricity increases the angle of attack of blade increase dramatically as well as the angular velocity of the blade in this case strong flow separation and vortex shedding will occur considering that the vortex shedding is directly related to the lift and drag of the blade the increase of eccentricity will considerably enlarge the hydrodynamic loading of cycloidal propeller as the rotation center approaches to trailing edge the vortex shedding from the leading edge is restricted and that from trailing edge is strengthened thus the average thrust and torque are not affected very much however the pulsation can be mitigated for a proper rotation center 3 6 flow field and vortex distribution the flow fields and vortices behind cycloidal propellers have unique attributes and distributions owing to their structures and working principles the simplified two dimensional model of a cycloidal propeller used in this study was able to accurately simulate its unique flow field and vortex shedding mechanism to characterize its flow field the simplified two dimensional model was used to simulate the cycloidal propeller under the following operating conditions center of blade rotation l c 40 advance speed v 6 knots rotary speed 37 rpm eccentricity e 0 8 advance coefficient j 0 759 and re 1 5 106 fig 24 a shows the resultant velocity distribution in the flow field behind the cycloidal propeller the blades interfered with the lower half of the flow field less and thus this section exhibited a relatively uniform distribution owing to the smaller angles of attack and rotary speeds of the blades conversely the upper half exhibited drastic variations in flow field velocity owing to the rapid rotation of the leading edge of the blades in particular the inter blade flow field gradient was large and exhibited periodic high velocity and low velocity zones with the former located below and in contact with the low velocity zone the high and low velocity zones moved away from the propeller in the direction of the oncoming flow while slightly contracting toward the center additionally the velocity gradient between the high and low velocity zones decreased as the distance from the center of the cycloidal propeller increased fig 24 b shows the distribution of vorticity vor corresponding to the flow field shown in fig 24 a the vorticity exhibited a similar distribution as the flow field velocity more specifically vortices were clear observed in the upper half of the field vortices were shed off from the trailing edge of the blades and moved along the intersection between the high and low velocity zones in the direction of the oncoming flow vorticity was dissipated and decreased as the distance from the propeller increased in contrast the vorticity in the lower half was relatively low additionally vorticity was concentrated at the trailing end of the blades fig 25 shows the streamlines for the flow field distribution of the cycloidal propeller with its blades rotating rapidly at a phase angle of θ 177 83 when a blade revolved above the eccentric point its rear side experienced relatively large velocities whereas the interior side experienced relatively low velocities as shown in fig 25 a and b the streamlines on the rear side originated from the blade surface bypassed the leading edge and then moved forward in the direction of the oncoming flow the streamlines near the trailing edge on the interior side originated from a faraway region ran around the bend at the trailing edge and terminated at the blade surface the streamlines near the leading edge on the interior side originated from the wall surface and moved in the direction of the oncoming flow while those at the middle of the blade on the rear side both originated from and terminated at the wall surface exhibiting a v shaped pattern streamlines changed direction when passing the rapidly rotating blade exhibiting wave trajectories but a smaller angle of attack led to smaller changes in streamline direction and thus smaller waves as shown in fig 26 the vorticities at the bottoms of the streamlines were relatively large as shown in figs 24 a and 25 a the flow field exhibited drastic variations in velocity and direction and the streamlines changed direction on the interior side near the trailing edge fig 25 b fig 27 shows the variation in vortex formation and shedding before and after the blade revolved to a phase angle of θ 180 during this time significant variations in vorticity and vortex shedding occurred the vortex on the exterior side of the leading edge gradually enlarged as the phase angle increased and finally shed off from the leading edge there were two vortices shed off from the trailing edge 1 a trailing edge vortex that occurred behind the trailing edge and which was formed by the force of the rapidly rotating blade and thus was strong near the trailing edge and 2 a boundary layer vortex occurring on the interior side of the airfoil which moved toward the trailing edge and finally shed off at a sufficiently large phase angle fig 26 shows the distribution of flow field velocity around the blade at the moments corresponding to fig 27 d and f the velocity gradient in the flow field around the blade was large the blade rotation speed decreased as the phase angle increased from θ 180 thus the blade rotation speed shown in fig 26 a ω 4 04 rad s was larger than that in fig 26 b ω 1 86 rad s the low velocity zone near the leading edge moved gradually from the interior to the exterior side as the phase angle increased and the vortex shed off from the trailing edge moved along the interface between the high and low velocity zones as the blade rotation speed decreased the velocity gradients on both the exterior and interior of the blade decreased as indicated by the greater distance between the velocity contours shown in fig 26 b than in fig 26 a additionally the high velocity zone on the exterior side of the blade moved gradually toward the trailing edge of the blade its distance from the low velocity zone at the leading edge increased and the vortex disappeared as shown in fig 26 b 4 conclusions in depth research on cycloidal propellers has vital implications for the design and operation of these structures due to their widening range of applications in this study the hydrodynamics of a cycloidal propeller were numerically simulated using a simplified two dimensional model with the feasibility of the computational method validated the impacts of multiple operating parameters on the thrust pulsation and efficiency of the modeled propeller were analyzed and the velocity field and distribution of vortices around the propeller were characterized the results showed that the variation in flow fields and the distribution of vorticity behind the propeller were mainly determined by the rapid rotation of the blade in the 12 o clock direction of the eccentric point in particular rapid blade rotation resulted in vortices forming on and then being shed off from the blade surface thus causing drastic changes in the velocity field thrust and torque pulsations could be reduced by increasing the advance speed reducing the rotary speed or adjusting the center of rotation of the blade these findings can therefore

pulsation 1 introduction a cycloidal propeller is a special type of marine propeller it is typically used on ships with special maneuverability and mobility requirements such as tugboats ferries and submersibles a cycloidal propeller usually consists of three to six blades which are mounted outside the hull and are perpendicular to the hull surface the blades are equally spaced along the circumference of the propeller and rotate around their centers of rotation while revolving around an axis perpendicular to the hull surface their trajectory when the ship advances from which their name is also derived is cycloidal a cycloidal propeller can produce thrust in any direction above the water surface and has the advantages of good maneuverability a great capacity for resisting wind waves and a quick response time cycloidal propellers have garnered considerable research interest in recent years particularly owing to their excellent maneuverability therefore investigating the hydrodynamic performance of such propellers is of great value for engineering applications the focus of this work is on the impact of motion parameters on the hydrodynamic performance of cycloidal propeller early research on cycloidal propellers was focused on their time averaged hydrodynamic performance the classical numerical method proposed by zhu 1982 considered the impact of the trajectory curve and blade rotation on the coefficients of drag and lift and linearizations were removed to increase computational accuracy their numerical results agreed well with the experimental results obtained using the nsbm model at most eccentricities newer methods have also gradually been developed for example yun et al 2007 performed an experiment and numerical analyzed a cycloidal blade system during which the time averaged hydrodynamic performance yielded from the experiment was highly consistent with that of the numerical prediction jürgens et al 2010 further optimized a cycloidal propeller using a vortex lattice method developed for three dimensional foils and improved its efficiency by 4 8 a lower order unsteady hydrodynamic model was more recently developed by halder et al 2018 which incorporates nonlinear lifting theodorsen s approach polhamus leading edge suction analogy and a modified double multiple streamtube d ms model with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd the transient hydrodynamics of cycloidal propellers have become the subject of increasing research interest for instance siegel et al 2007 studied the unsteady dynamic lift produced by a one blade cycloidal propeller at medium reynolds numbers and the distribution of unsteady flow fields and vortices behind the propeller palm et al 2011 experimentally compared the ventilation behaviors of rudder and cycloidal propellers through a scaled model test and revealed many details regarding the mechanism of flow behind the thruster by employing a cfd approach using numerical models validated against wind tunnel test results yu et al 2017 discussed the effects of blade number and advance ratio on the forward flight characteristics of a cycloidal rotor they found that as the number of blades increased the thrust pulsation and the induced vibration decreased they also found that the maximum forward flight efficiency typically occurred at a medium high advance speed more recently reed et al 2019 investigated the thrust and power consumption of the blade of a cycloidal propeller with and without rotation and revealed the importance of dynamic stall in the generation of thrust and drag singh and páscoa 2019 studied the impact of numerical turbulence models on the computation of the hydrodynamic performance of a single cycloidal propeller blade and compared the evolution of vortices at the leading and trailing edges for different models in recent years the effects of the geometric and motion parameters of propeller blades on their efficiency have been investigated regarding geometric parameters hu et al 2019 explored the effects of blade aspect and taper ratios on the efficiency of a cycloidal propeller their experimental and numerical results both demonstrated that aspect ratio had an insignificant effect on efficiency and that larger taper ratios led to higher efficiencies because they resulted in longer chords their study has provided valuable qualitative guidance for the design of cycloidal propeller blades additionally fasse et al 2019 numerically simulated a cycloidal propeller using a simplified two dimensional model and computed the effect of inter blade distance on the highest efficiency at given geometric and operational parameter settings in order to optimize inter blade distance they also analyzed foil to foil interactions to determine the effect of the number of blades on propulsion efficiency during operation the oncoming flow velocity vector of a cycloidal propeller blade continuously changes with the blade orbit angle it also differs under different parametric settings at a given blade orbit angle considering this phenomenon prabhu et al 2019 computed the hydrodynamic load on the rotating blade disc of a cycloidal propeller as well as the effect of a simplified hull boundary on propeller hydrodynamics in a viscous fluid previously analytical and experimental studies on cycloidal propellers have mainly been focused on the optimization of their time averaged hydrodynamic performance and efficiency however their engineering applications require more in depth explorations of the instantaneous load upon and the flow field around their blades in this study the impacts of various operating parameters i e center of blade rotation eccentricity and advance coefficient on the blade load pulsation and efficiency of a propeller were analyzed using a simplified two dimensional numerical model the model was developed based on an extensive analysis of its convergence and was resolved using a cfd method our study provides insights that can serve as a basis for further optimizing cycloidal propellers and for improving their efficiency 2 theory and data 2 1 governing equations for

domain of the model the side boundaries are two symmetric planes and the distance between the center of the cycloidal propeller and the two planes is 6d the distance between the velocity inlet and the center of the cycloidal propeller is also 6d the fluid passes the cycloidal propeller and flows out through the pressure outlet the distance between the outlet and the center of the cycloidal propeller is 20d the boundaries are located far enough from the rotational domain of the cycloidal propeller thereby minimizing the boundary effects on the computational results the surface of the blade was defined as a non slipping wall surface and the viscosity of the fluid was considered 3 1 2 grid convergence a structured gridding scheme was adopted for the computational domain with the discretization of the cycloidal propeller refined in a step wise manner as shown in fig 3 zone c fig 3 the far fluid domain was gridded with a basic mesh of 0 0625 m in size zone b the fluid domain near the area of rotation was refined with a mesh of 0 03125 m finally zone a the blade operation area was further refined with a mesh of 0 015625 m or 3 125 of the chord length i e the length from the leading edge to trailing edge of the blade this gridding scheme resulted in 230 000 cells occurring in zone a the boundary layer for the blade surface was also gridded using a prism mesh and a data exchange mode for overlapping grids was adopted fig 4 shows the gridding in the vicinity and surface of the blade using a finer prism mesh a more refined gridding scheme is better able to capture the instantaneous load on an operating blade validation of the convergence of the gridding scheme was based on the parametric settings eccentricity e 0 8 advance speed v 6 knot rotary speed 37 rpm advance coefficient j 0 759 and re 1 5 106 k tx1 k ty1 and k q1 were the dimensionless coefficients for the thrust t x1 lateral thrust t y1 and torque q 1 respectively 20 k t x 1 t x 1 π 2 2 ρ n 2 d 3 21 k t y 1 t y 1 π 2 2 ρ n 2 d 3 22 k q 1 2 q 1 π 2 2 ρ n 2 d 4 to validate the gridding scheme the convergence of the basic mesh of the computational domain was validated by first setting the size of the mesh for refining zone a fig 3 equal to 3 125 the chord length which translated into 230 000 cells the basic mesh was then scaled up and down two times to compute the thrust and torque of a single blade respectively the results yielded by the different gridding schemes were reasonably consistent with maximum inconsistencies of 1 85 for the thrust fig 5 and 2 1 for the torque fig 6 coefficients the inconsistency between the lowest thrust coefficients yielded by the original gridding scheme and the up scaled scheme was 1 85 while that between the original gridding scheme and the down scaled scheme was 0 422 indicating that inconsistency decreased with mesh size the thickness of the first layer of the boundary layer mesh was denoted as y in simulating intense boundary layer flows the value of y had an important impact on the results thus the convergence of the thickness of the first layer of the boundary layer mesh on the solid wall surface was validated by separately computing the thrust coefficients k tx1 at y values of 0 35 1 and 3 the results for the three different y values were reasonably consistent as shown in fig 7 a in particular k tx1 first decreased gradually from 0 at θ 0 then decreased rapidly from θ 144 before reaching its minimum value and then increasing at θ 171 to reach 0 at θ 180 the peak value occurred at θ 230 the inconsistency among the three curves was the largest 0 636 at the bottom the curve for y 3 bottomed out at the largest value while that for y 0 35 bottomed out at the smallest value and exhibited the sharpest turning point fig 7 b this confirmed the convergence of the thrust computation thus y was set to 0 35 for the subsequent calculations the computed torque coefficients k q1 at the three different y values were consistent and varied in patterns similar to the thrust coefficients as shown in fig 8 a in particular the torque coefficient was negative at θ 180 and positive at θ 180 it first decreased from 0 at θ 0 bottomed out and began increasing rapidly at θ 169 5 and then peaked at θ 230 the largest inconsistency between the three k q1 curves occurred at the bottom 0 801 wherein the k q1 curve for y 3 bottomed out at the largest value while that for y 0 35 did so at the smallest value fig 8 b additionally the inconsistency between the curves for y 1 and y 0 35 was less than that between the curves for y 1 and y 3 this confirmed their convergence for torque computation notably the boundary layer greatly impacted the shear force of the fluid and the boundary layer of the wall surface had a greater impact on the computation of moment force than of thrust 3 1 3 convergence of time step length a suitable time step length is required to capture the load on a blade during its rapid rotation therefore the instantaneous load on a blade at its maximum swing speed was computed using time step lengths δt of 0 0002 s 0 0005 s and 0 0008 s the thrust and torque coefficients obtained using these three different time steps were reasonably consistent as shown in figs 9 a and 10 a the greatest inconsistencies between the smallest thrust and torque coefficients obtained using these lengths were 2 67 and 2 52 respectively figs 9b and 10b additionally the coefficients yielded by a smaller time step bottomed out at smaller values and decreased to and increased from the bottoms at higher slopes than those yielded by larger time steps therefore the time step length was set to 0 0005 s for subsequent computations 3 2 effects of the center of rotation on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation fig 11 shows the center of rotation r of the propeller blade as shown l is the distance between r and the leading edge of the blade c is the chord length and l c l c fig 12 a shows the thrust coefficients of a single blade at different values of l c 25 60 during a circle of rotation with θ changing from 0 to 360 at all different values of l c the thrust of the blade was negative as θ increased from 0 to 180 and positive as θ further increased from 180 to 360 the mean thrust coefficient is almost unchanged while the peak of instantaneous thrust coefficients reaches largest at l c 25 a position closest to the leading edge as the center of blade rotation moved toward the trailing edge the thrust coefficient bottomed out at a smaller value and the turning point for rapid decreasing occurred at a value of θ closer to 180 at a l c value of 55 or 60 the thrust coefficient exhibited an increasing trend at the turning point as θ increased from 180 to 360 a smaller value of l c also led to a larger thrust coefficient exhibiting a pattern similar to that as θ increased from 0 to 180 at l c 60 a position closest to the trailing edge the thrust coefficient also bottomed out and began increasing rapidly at θ 180 fig 12 b shows the mean maximum minimum and standard deviation of the thrust coefficient of a single blade at different values of l c as the value of l c increased from 25 to 60 the mean coefficient varied insignificantly while the maximum and minimum coefficients decreased the standard deviations represented the magnitude of fluctuations in thrust the period over which thrust fluctuated was only related to the rotary speed and number of blades and the magnitude of fluctuation was markedly affected by the position of the center of rotation in particular the magnitude of fluctuation notably decreased as the value of l c approached 50 the variance of the load was given by the following equation 23 σ 2 1 m x i x 2 m where m is the sample size x i is the i th sample and x is the mean of the sample the sample consisted of the measured instantaneous loads on the blade at every time step obtained from two cycles the standard deviation is the square root of sample variance and provided a measure of the dispersion of the set of measurements indicating how close they were to the mean of the set the overall thrust of the cycloidal propeller during a cycle of its rotation at different values of l c is shown in fig 13 the cycle can be divided into five phases one for each blade fig 13 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the thrust coefficient at different values of l c when the blade revolved to the 12 o clock position of the eccentric point θ 180 the thrust and torque changed drastically these changes occurred once every 72 of propeller rotation fig 14 a shows the overall torque consumption of the propeller during a cycle of rotation at different values of l c the cycle can be divided into five phases according to the number of propellers fig 14 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the torque coefficient at different values of l c as the value of l c increased both the thrust and torque first decreased then bottomed out at l c 55 and finally increased notably the thrust at l c 55 did not exhibit drastic within phase fluctuations as compared with the thrust at other values of l c indicating that a value of l c closer to 50 led to smaller fluctuations considering that the load on the blade was continuously increasing the standard deviation of the thrust coefficient k tx during the decreasing phase was defined as positive and that during the increasing phase was defined as negative as shown in fig 13 a when l c 25 there is a trough between θ 0 36 and the thrust first decreases and then increases and when l c 55 there is a peak between θ 0 36 and the thrust first increases and then decreases in the interval θ 0 36 if there is a trough in the thrust then the variance is set to positive in the interval θ 0 36 if there is a peak in the thrust and the thrust increases first and then decreases then the variance is set to negative fig 15 shows the efficiency thrust and torque of the propeller at different values of l c a smaller value of l c led to both a larger standard deviation in hydrodynamic performance and a lower propeller efficiency fig 16 a shows the lateral thrust of a single blade during a cycle of cycloidal propeller rotation while fig 16 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the lateral thrust coefficient of a single blade at different values of l c the lateral thrust on a single blade varied symmetrically around the point of θ 180 more specifically the lateral thrust first increased slowly and then began to increase or decrease at θ 144 and peaked or bottomed out at θ 180 at l c 50 a smaller value of l c led to a higher peak at l c 50 a larger value of l c led to a lower bottom fig 17 a shows the overall lateral thrust of the propeller during a cycle of rotation at different values of l c the circle can be divided into five phases one for each propeller the lateral thrust fluctuated drastically when the blade revolved to the 12 o clock position of the eccentric point θ 180 and this fluctuation occurred every 72 of propeller rotation the lateral thrust varied smoothly during the intervals between these periodic fluctuations fig 17 b shows the mean maximum minimum and variance of the overall lateral thrust coefficient at different values of l c as the value of l c increased the thrust and torque first decreased then bottomed out at l c 55 and finally increased indicating that a value of l c closer to 50 led to smaller pulsations the effects of center of rotation on thrust and torque of cycloidal propeller are similar as the center of rotation approaches the trailing edge from leading edge the rotational speed of leading edge increases and that of trailing edge decreases this causes the variation of instantaneous hydrodynamic forces from figs 12 14 it can be seen that an optimal lc can dramatically mitigate the force and torque pulsation for present study the pulsations reach their minimum as lc 0 55 however the mean values of thrust and torque are not affected very much from fig 14 it can be seen that there is also an optimal lc for maximum efficiency for present study it is about 0 5 3 3 impact of advance speed on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation the thrust torque and efficiency of the modeled cycloidal propeller at different advance speeds between 4 and 7 knots were computed in order to compare its hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsations at these different speeds fig 18 shows the thrust and torque coefficients at different advance speeds within a circle of propeller rotation the torque and thrust varied in similar patterns in particular the torque and thrust fluctuated drastically in the vicinity of the bottoms of the rotation curves and decreased slowly from the peaks to the bottoms the thrust and torque coefficients at different advance speeds peaked and bottomed out at consistent phase angles the ranges of such fluctuations and the mean values of thrust at different advance speeds are shown in fig 19 as the advance speed increased both the amplitudes means and range of variance for both thrust and torque decreased fort instance when the advance speed reached 7 knots the thrust reversed direction thus providing no forward power as the advance speed increased the thrust efficiency first increased peaked at 5 knots and then decreased overall fluctuation in the thrust of the cycloidal propeller decreased as the advance speed increased the effect of advance speed on hydrodynamics of a cycloidal propeller is not very much different from that of a conventional screw propeller as advance speed increases both the pulsation and the mean thrust increases accordingly comparing to the thrust the torque varies quite nonlinearly with advance speed meanwhile the thrust decreases more rapidly with advance speed than the torque 3 4 impact of rotary speed on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation the hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsations of the cycloidal propeller at a given advance speed and different rotary speeds were computed fig 20 shows the overall thrusts and torques at different rotary speeds as the rotary speed increased the advance coefficient j decreased and the time required for one cycle of rotation decreased fig 20 a within 1 2 s the propeller had completed the five phase cycle of rotation at a rotary speed of 56 rpm but had completed only three phases at a rotary speed of 32 rpm and thus only part of the cycle as the rotary speed increased the thrust and torque increased gradually the efficiency first increased rapidly was sustained at approximately 70 and then slowly decreased additionally the thrust pulsation increased gradually as shown in fig 21 higher rotary speeds led to larger magnitudes mean values and fluctuations in both the thrust and torque larger fluctuations at the curve peaks and bottoms and markedly larger fluctuations in thrust a change in either the rotary or advance speed resulted in a change in the advance coefficient j which was decreased by increasing the advance speed or by decreasing the advance velocity of the oncoming flow as the advance coefficient increased the thrust and torque decreased the corresponding efficiency first increased peaked at a medium high advance coefficient and then decreased overall thrust pulsation decreased 3 5 impact of eccentricity on hydrodynamic performance and thrust pulsation eccentricity affects blade rotary speeds β a larger eccentricity resulted in a higher rotary speed when the blade revolved to the 12 o clock position of the eccentric point θ 180 subsequently the hydrodynamic performance of the cycloidal propeller at an advance speed v of 6 knots a rotary speed of 37 rpm and at different eccentricities e 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 was computed as the eccentricity increased the mean values and magnitudes of both thrust and torque coefficients increased as shown in fig 22 in particular the thrust and torque coefficients at e 0 8 were markedly larger than those at the other three eccentricity values this indicates that with constant advance and rotary speeds a larger eccentricity resulted in a larger thrust and a larger torque consumption at e 0 2 0 4 or 0 6 the thrust and torque coefficients were negative resulting in a thrust direction opposite to the advance direction the thrust coefficients at e 0 2 and e 0 4 varied in similar ways peaking and bottoming out at similar phase angles more specifically the thrust coefficients at e 0 2 and e 0 4 bottomed out at the phase angles at which the thrust coefficient at e 0 8 peaked the standard deviation of thrust decreased as e increased from 0 2 to 0 6 but decreased markedly as e further increased to 0 8 fig 22 b additionally the standard deviation at e 0 8 was much larger than that at e 0 2 0 4 or 0 6 fig 23 shows the variations in the thrust and lateral thrust of a single blade at the four different eccentricities in one cycle of propeller rotation as eccentricity increased the overall thrust on a single blade increased at θ 180 a smaller eccentricity resulted in larger variations in thrust a smaller bottom value and a smaller phase angle at which the thrust bottomed at θ 180 a larger eccentricity resulted in a larger amplitude and mean thrust the positive thrust of the propeller was provided by the blades rotating at phase angles from 180 to 360 fig 23 b shows the lateral thrusts of a single blade at different eccentricities at e 0 8 as the propeller rotated the lateral thrust first increased monotonically peaked significantly at θ 180 and then decreased monotonically at e 0 2 0 4 or 0 6 the lateral thrust bottomed out once before and after the propeller rotated to θ 180 as eccentricity increases the thrust and toque increases accordingly this indicates that the cycloidal propeller can generate more thrust without increasing the rotational speed from fig 22 it can be seen that there is an optimal eccentricity for considerable thrust with minimum pulsation the effect of smaller eccentricity on toque is not as significant as that on thrust too large eccentricity can lead to dramatic variation of lateral thrust the fluid mechanism of the effect of rotary speed and advance speed on the hydrodynamic performance of cycloidal propellers is quite conventional and similar as advance speed increases the relative speed between the blade and the fluid is counteracted which leads the reduction of thrust and torque by increasing the rotary speed the relative speed and angle of attack of blade is enlarged this leads more significant pressure difference between pressure side and suction side and thus to increase the hydrodynamic loading of cycloidal propeller however the thrust is more easily subjected to the advance speed and rotary speed thus there is an optimal advance coefficient for maximum efficiency the effect of varying eccentricity and rotation center on hydrodynamic performance of cycloidal propeller is quite complicated as eccentricity increases the angle of attack of blade increase dramatically as well as the angular velocity of the blade in this case strong flow separation and vortex shedding will occur considering that the vortex shedding is directly related to the lift and drag of the blade the increase of eccentricity will considerably enlarge the hydrodynamic loading of cycloidal propeller as the rotation center approaches to trailing edge the vortex shedding from the leading edge is restricted and that from trailing edge is strengthened thus the average thrust and torque are not affected very much however the pulsation can be mitigated for a proper rotation center 3 6 flow field and vortex distribution the flow fields and vortices behind cycloidal propellers have unique attributes and distributions owing to their structures and working principles the simplified two dimensional model of a cycloidal propeller used in this study was able to accurately simulate its unique flow field and vortex shedding mechanism to characterize its flow field the simplified two dimensional model was used to simulate the cycloidal propeller under the following operating conditions center of blade rotation l c 40 advance speed v 6 knots rotary speed 37 rpm eccentricity e 0 8 advance coefficient j 0 759 and re 1 5 106 fig 24 a shows the resultant velocity distribution in the flow field behind the cycloidal propeller the blades interfered with the lower half of the flow field less and thus this section exhibited a relatively uniform distribution owing to the smaller angles of attack and rotary speeds of the blades conversely the upper half exhibited drastic variations in flow field velocity owing to the rapid rotation of the leading edge of the blades in particular the inter blade flow field gradient was large and exhibited periodic high velocity and low velocity zones with the former located below and in contact with the low velocity zone the high and low velocity zones moved away from the propeller in the direction of the oncoming flow while slightly contracting toward the center additionally the velocity gradient between the high and low velocity zones decreased as the distance from the center of the cycloidal propeller increased fig 24 b shows the distribution of vorticity vor corresponding to the flow field shown in fig 24 a the vorticity exhibited a similar distribution as the flow field velocity more specifically vortices were clear observed in the upper half of the field vortices were shed off from the trailing edge of the blades and moved along the intersection between the high and low velocity zones in the direction of the oncoming flow vorticity was dissipated and decreased as the distance from the propeller increased in contrast the vorticity in the lower half was relatively low additionally vorticity was concentrated at the trailing end of the blades fig 25 shows the streamlines for the flow field distribution of the cycloidal propeller with its blades rotating rapidly at a phase angle of θ 177 83 when a blade revolved above the eccentric point its rear side experienced relatively large velocities whereas the interior side experienced relatively low velocities as shown in fig 25 a and b the streamlines on the rear side originated from the blade surface bypassed the leading edge and then moved forward in the direction of the oncoming flow the streamlines near the trailing edge on the interior side originated from a faraway region ran around the bend at the trailing edge and terminated at the blade surface the streamlines near the leading edge on the interior side originated from the wall surface and moved in the direction of the oncoming flow while those at the middle of the blade on the rear side both originated from and terminated at the wall surface exhibiting a v shaped pattern streamlines changed direction when passing the rapidly rotating blade exhibiting wave trajectories but a smaller angle of attack led to smaller changes in streamline direction and thus smaller waves as shown in fig 26 the vorticities at the bottoms of the streamlines were relatively large as shown in figs 24 a and 25 a the flow field exhibited drastic variations in velocity and direction and the streamlines changed direction on the interior side near the trailing edge fig 25 b fig 27 shows the variation in vortex formation and shedding before and after the blade revolved to a phase angle of θ 180 during this time significant variations in vorticity and vortex shedding occurred the vortex on the exterior side of the leading edge gradually enlarged as the phase angle increased and finally shed off from the leading edge there were two vortices shed off from the trailing edge 1 a trailing edge vortex that occurred behind the trailing edge and which was formed by the force of the rapidly rotating blade and thus was strong near the trailing edge and 2 a boundary layer vortex occurring on the interior side of the airfoil which moved toward the trailing edge and finally shed off at a sufficiently large phase angle fig 26 shows the distribution of flow field velocity around the blade at the moments corresponding to fig 27 d and f the velocity gradient in the flow field around the blade was large the blade rotation speed decreased as the phase angle increased from θ 180 thus the blade rotation speed shown in fig 26 a ω 4 04 rad s was larger than that in fig 26 b ω 1 86 rad s the low velocity zone near the leading edge moved gradually from the interior to the exterior side as the phase angle increased and the vortex shed off from the trailing edge moved along the interface between the high and low velocity zones as the blade rotation speed decreased the velocity gradients on both the exterior and interior of the blade decreased as indicated by the greater distance between the velocity contours shown in fig 26 b than in fig 26 a additionally the high velocity zone on the exterior side of the blade moved gradually toward the trailing edge of the blade its distance from the low velocity zone at the leading edge increased and the vortex disappeared as shown in fig 26 b 4 conclusions in depth research on cycloidal propellers has vital implications for the design and operation of these structures due to their widening range of applications in this study the hydrodynamics of a cycloidal propeller were numerically simulated using a simplified two dimensional model with the feasibility of the computational method validated the impacts of multiple operating parameters on the thrust pulsation and efficiency of the modeled propeller were analyzed and the velocity field and distribution of vortices around the propeller were characterized the results showed that the variation in flow fields and the distribution of vorticity behind the propeller were mainly determined by the rapid rotation of the blade in the 12 o clock direction of the eccentric point in particular rapid blade rotation resulted in vortices forming on and then being shed off from the blade surface thus causing drastic changes in the velocity field thrust and torque pulsations could be reduced by increasing the advance speed reducing the rotary speed or adjusting the center of rotation of the blade these findings can therefore provide guidance for optimizing the operation and design of cycloidal propellers according to various working conditions credit authorship contribution statement jian hu conceptualization validation

using powerful deep neural networks the reward function is designed which ensures that the usv navigates to the target while obeying colregs to avoid dynamic obstacles a method is proposed to track the current network weight to update the target network weight which improves the stability of the algorithm in learning the optimal strategy it is shown that the cica algorithm converges with fewer training times through ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold than other three strategies by comparing the cica algorithm with the artificial potential field method and the velocity obstacle method it is concluded that the cica algorithm is superior to the other two algorithms keywords unmanned surface vehicles dynamic collision avoidance deep learning reinforcement learning colregs 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicles usvs may encounter complex and various obstacles in many cases including islands reefs buoys and moving boats agile and accurate handling of unknown hazards is an important part of research in the field of collision avoidance control for usvs there are many classical collision avoidance algorithms koren and borenstein 1991 propose the artificial potential field method apf the target point produces attraction obstacles produces repulsion the resultant force determines the optimal direction of motion for the robot however the robot may fall into the trap area of local minimum to solve the problem of local minimum liu and bucknall 2015 improve a constrained fast marching fm method to construct two areas to ensure the planned trajectory does not violate any forbidden area for dynamic collision avoidance in addition the velocity obstacle method vo proposed by fiorini and shiller 1998 is widely used in the dynamic collision avoidance of usvs the algorithm constructes a conical region for each obstacle in the velocity space as long as the velocity vector falls into the region there will be collision risk and an optimal velocity vector should be selected from the non conical region to avoid obstacles there are many other collision avoidance methods for usvs naeem et al 2012 present a reactive collision avoidance algorithm the proposed strategy consists of waypoint guidance by line of sight coupled with a manual biasing scheme and a simple pid autopilot is incorporated to ensure that the vessel adheres to the generated seaway chiang and tapia 2018 propose colreg rrt which is achieved by conducting joint forward simulations of both the asv and the other vessels during rrt growth and the colregs compliance is enforced by constructing virtual obstacles that inhibit tree growth li et al 2019 present a two stage trajectory planning scheme a wavefront search is applied on the graph to explore the reachability in the first stage the cost of state constraints and the risk of collision then a smooth path will be found in the second stage the moving trajectories of obstacles are usually unpredictable the collision avoidance process is complex and changeable and many related factors are difficult to quantify the conventional analytic algorithms become ineffective zhang et al 2018 the control of the usv is however challenging with the integration of colregs the control law also becomes more complex even worse usvs are occasionally too ill equipped to meet the complex control law produced by analytic algorithms liu et al 2017 in order to reduce the complexity of the control law in the problem of colregs compliant collision avoidance and improve the availability of the algorithm a colregs intelligent collision avoidance cica algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning for usvs is proposed in this paper compared with the analytic algorithms this method is easier to adapt to the complex and changeable marine environment and has stronger generalization ability which is the innovation of this paper reinforcement learning rl has been a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning in recent years after the deep reinforcement learning method is successfully applied to google alphago silver et al 2016 and defeats the human chess king li shimeng in go competition how to translate deep reinforcement learning from theoretical research to practical application has attracted people s attention in recent years deep reinforcement learning has been used to solve complex control problems deep reinforcement learning combines the advantages of deep learning and reinforcement learning deep learning provides learning mechanism and reinforcement

et al 2015 the algorithm achieved more scores than the top human players in the atari game deep reinforcement learning is also gradually applied to the autonomous collision avoidance control of robots duguleana and mogan 2016 use q learning and a neural network planner to provide mobile robots a collision free trajectory fathinezhad and derhami fathinezhad et al 2016 propose a collision avoidance method for e puck robot by combining of supervised learning and reinforcement learning liu et al 2018 propose an estimation model based on a single hidden layer neural network to approximate the unknown dynamics induced by uncertain model parameters thus the target tracking of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles with unknown dynamics is realized the advantages of reinforcement learning in the field of collision avoidance have been highlighted but only a few scholars have applied reinforcement learning to collision avoidance control of usvs cheng and zhang 2018 cheng and zhang 2018 use reinforcement learning for static collision avoidance control of usvs and dynamic collision avoidance deserves to be further studied the sea level is complex and changeable the relevant rules must be satisfied in the process of dynamic collision avoidance the international maritime organization has formulated international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs johansen et al 2016 beser and yildirim 2018 which is known as a standard for international shipping how to combine this rule with collision avoidance algorithm is the key and difficult point in this study a new intelligent algorithm cica colregs intelligent collision avoidance is proposed by combining the feature extraction ability of deep convolution neural network with the decision making ability of reinforcement learning the usv adopts this method to avoid obstacles automatically under the constraint of colregs the main contents of this paper are as follows 1 the dynamic model of the usv based

point to the target point avoiding obstacles encountered the usv is different from traditional robots the navigation environment is more complex in addition to avoiding islands and floating reefs encountered the usv also needs to avoid moving boats according to the rules of navigation when the usv navigates near a moving boat dynamic obstacle if the distance between them is less than the safe distance the usv needs to avoid obstacle it is recommended that the avoidance direction should be determined according to colregs see fig 1 this paper addresses the following four primary colregs situation 1 overtaking when the usv navigates behind the moving boat the angle is within 112 5 247 5 the angle difference of the two is within 0 67 5 or 292 5 360 and the speed of the usv is faster than that of the moving boat the usv should take action to avoid the moving boat turn left or right 2 head on head on is the situation where two boats are navigating on opposite or near opposite routes the moving boat is in the usv s azimuth range of 0 5 or 355 360 the angle difference of the two is within 175 185 the usv needs to turn right and navigate as far as possible from the port side of the moving boat 3 port crossing port crossing means that the moving boat is in the usv s azimuth range of 247 5 355 and the angle difference of the two is within 67 5 175 the usv is not the give way boat so it should keep the original course 4 starboard crossing starboard crossing means that the moving boat is in the usv s azimuth range of 5 112 5 the angle difference of the two is within 185 292 5 the usv should take a right turn action and navigate behind the moving boat as far as possible in order to train the algorithm of obeying colregs and reduce the inputs of state space the parameter of conflict situation σ between the usv and the moving boat is defined when the usv and moving boat are not in conflict situation σ 0 when they are in the overtaking situation defined by colregs σ 1 when they are in the head on situation defined by colregs σ 2 when they are in the port crossing situation defined by colregs σ 3 when they are in the starboard crossing situation defined by colregs σ 4 4 colregs intelligent collision avoidance cica algorithm in the mission of automatic collision avoidance the usv is agent and the obstacles and the oceans are the environment the driving device that the usv can control and influence the environment is its propellers and rudder the usv interacts with the environment in a series of ways and constantly gains experience to correct strategy the algorithm controls the usv to take corresponding actions and the actions taken by the usv will affect the environment the environment gives some feedback rewards to the usv and the usv gains navigation experience from it 4 1 state and actions 1 system state in cica algorithm the actions taken by the usv directly depend on the system state the mission of dynamic collision avoidance is to design a decision system f according to the continuous environmental information p t detected by the usv over the past period of time the corresponding control action τ t is given among them 2 p t s t s t 1 s t n p 1 3 s t σ t v t η t ψ e t τ t 1 r n s s t is the current state of the system which includes the position vector η and the velocity vector ν the parameter of conflict situation σ the heading angle error ψ e and the last action τ t 1 among them ψ e ψ d ψ ψ d is the desired heading angle n p is the delay step taken into account by the decision system f where n s is the number of the information vector in this algorithm n s 10 the usv changes its speed and heading angle under the control actions thus avoids the dynamic obstacles and navigates toward the target and finally arrives at the target safely the decision system can be expressed as 4 τ t f p t r 2 2 control actions the environmental state perceived by the usv at t 1 is s t 1 the usv takes action τ t 1 to reach another state s t the environmental information obtained is used to judge whether the action is good or not i e the immediate reward r t the final rewards for completing the mission can only be observed after multiple steps it is a kind of delayed supervised learning the whole interaction process is a partially observable markov decision sequence process the usv has three degrees of freedom in the process of dynamic collision avoidance including forward and backward movement left and right movement and yaw rotation for the underactuated usv in order to reduce the complexity of hardware and algorithm the control vector is as follows 5 τ t τ u 0 τ r t τ u represents thrust of the propeller that drives the usv forward and backward τ r represents the moment that drives the usv turn the usv involved in this paper is equipped with two electric propellers to control the thrust and a high moment digital steering engine to control the rudder surface the variation of τ u in each simulation step is δ τ u with δ τ u 0 when the usv increases the thrust reduces the thrust or keeps the thrust constant at time t 1 the new thrust at time t is expressed as τ u t 1 δ τ u τ u t 1 δ τ u and τ u t 1 respectively we control the yaw torque by controlling the rudder angle because the steering speed of the steering engine we used is 0 22 s 60 so the rudder angle is discretized accordingly into three discrete values δ m a x 0 δ m a x 4 2 immediate rewards according to the mission of dynamic collision avoidance immediate rewards are divided into five parts goal approach reward angle reward end reward dynamic collision avoidance reward and colregs reward 1 goal approach reward one of the most important purposes of the usv is to sail towards the target and finally reach the target the position of the target η g x g y g t is known the reward function for approaching the target can be defined as 6 r g d e f λ g x t x g 2 y t y g 2 λ g is the weight of the goal approach reward 2 angle reward the heading angle error is taken as the factor of the index definition of heading angle error is shown in fig 2 the reward function is shown in equation 7 keeping it on the right heading angle and sailing approach the target are two missions that the usv needs to consider in balance the reward value of goal approach reward is large when the usv is far away from the target in order for the angle reward could be compared with the pof sition reward in different positions we include the distance factor in the angle reward 7 r a d e f λ a exp ε ψ e 2 x t x g 2 y t y g 2 where ψ e ψ d ψ is the heading angle error ψ d is the desired heading angle λ a is the weight of potential function and ε is the regulating parameter of convergence speed 3 end reward in order for the ship to stop smoothly near the target point it is necessary to design the end reward when the ship s distance from the target is less than r t h r e s h o l d we give the ship end reward the end reward is related to the speed of the usv that is the smaller the speed the bigger the reward based on the above considerations the end reward is designed as follows 8 r e d e f λ e u v x t x g 2 y t y g 2 r t h r e s h o l d 0 o t h e r w i s e where r t h r e s h o l d is the threshold of distance λ e is the weight of potential function 4 dynamic collision avoidance reward the position of the moving boat is η d i x d i y d i t the detection range of the usv is a circle the center of the circle is the center of gravity for the usv the radius is r r a d a r and r r a d a r is the detection radius of the radar in order to reduce the computational complexity the minimum distance between our usv and other boat is defined as r m i n when the distance between the usv and the moving boat is less than r m i n it is regarded as collision see fig 3 when the distance between the usv and the moving boat is less than r r e w a r d the collision avoidance mode will be triggered just like the angle reward the distance between the usv and the target is considered in the design of the collision avoidance reward function if the usv is in the state of port crossing with a moving boat it is in accordance with colregs for the usv to stay on its course if a collision occurs the usv should not be given a collision avoidance reward the collision avoidance reward function is designed as follows 9 r d i 0 σ 3 a n d τ r 0 λ d x t x g 2 y t y g 2 x t x d i 2 y t y d i 2 e l s e in which λ d is the reward weight of dynamic collision avoidance r d i r d i 5 colregs reward in order to train the collision avoidance algorithm that satisfies colregs we should reward the usv for taking actions that obey colregs it is similar to the angle reward the distance between the usv and the target is considered in the design of the colregs reward function when the usv needs to turn right based on the rule the rudder angle should be greater than 0 also when the usv needs to turn left based on the rule the rudder angle should be less than 0 when the usv needs to maintain course the rudder angle should be 0 if the usv does not perform the action described above we define it as contrary to colregs the colregs reward is designed as follows 10 r c λ c x t x g 2 y t y g 2 c o n t r a r y t o c o l r e g s 0 e l s e where λ c is the weight of the colregs reward according to the above reward function the sum of the five kinds of reward r t is as follows 11 r t r g r a r e r d r c 4 3 deep reinforcement network in traditional q learning a huge but limited table is used to represent q value watkins and dayan 1992 in this paper a depth neural network is used to fit q function the design of network model adopts two layers of convolutional layer conv two layers of full connected layer fc the input of the network is state and the structure of middle layer is cnn convolutional neural networks the output is the corresponding q value of each action and the action of the maximum q value is selected to interact with the environment when training the neural network the data must be independent and identically distributed so this is considered in cica algorithm in the process of the dynamic collision avoidance the information pt of the latest np step is stored in process memory p module where pt st st 1 st 2 s t n p 1 s t σ t v t η t ψ e t τ t 1 in order to break the relativity of data and ensure the convergence of value function replay memory r is set to store the historical running state e t p t τ t r t p t 1 at each time step t the updated state p t after the usv interacts with the environment is stored in replay memory r r e 1 e t in the process of training neural network uniform random sampling method is adopted to extract small batches of transfer sample e j p j τ j r j p j 1 from replay memory r in order to improve the stability an independent target value network q p j τ θ is used to generate the target q value 12 y j r γ max τ q p j 1 τ θ θ represents the parameter of the network for objective value function the approximator of the value function uses the deep convolution neural network in cica and the optimal objective function of the model is as follows 13 l θ j e y j q p j τ j θ 2 the weight parameter θ of main net is updated by a stochastic gradient descent sgd for small batch data baird and moore 1999 which updates the parameters of the network along the descending direction of the gradient the formula is as follows 14 l θ e r γ max τ q p j 1 τ θ q p j τ θ q p j τ j θ in cica algorithm besides using the output q p j τ j θ of deep convolution network main net to approximate the current value function replay memory r also uses the output of another network target net to represent the target q value namely max τ q p j 1 τ θ in dqn algorithm the parameter θ of main net is copied to target net every n steps during the period target net is frozen and the target q value remained unchanged that is delayed update the difference between cica algorithm and traditional dqn algorithm is that cica uses a network weight which traces the current value slowly to update the parameter of target network that is θ ξ θ 1 ξ θ where ξ 1 the update range of the target q value can be effectively controlled by cica algorithm it reduces the correlation between the current value function and the target value function to a certain extent at the same time it improves the stability of the usv in learning the optimal strategy the following figure describes the main components of cica fig 4 and their interactions 4 4 training framework of the algorithm in this paper we build an environment platform and train the algorithm in the simulation environment based on this framework the framework is used to generate random environmental information including position and speed of moving boats we define the available environment information s t σ t v t η t ψ e t τ t 1 according to the action vector τ τ u 0 τ r t selected by the usv in each simulation step the dynamics and kinematics of the usv are simulated and then the calculated attitude vector η velocity vector ν and angle vector ψ e are updated to the environmental information this framework mainly includes environment platform module process memory p module replay memory r module main net and target net environment platform is used for environment generation usv simulation and reward calculation environment generation module generates the position information of the target the position velocity and heading angle information of the moving boats the information of dynamic obstacles can be acquired and calculated by sensors and ais on the usv in real time the usv simulation module is used to calculate position information η t velocity information v t and angle information ψ e t of the usv based on dynamics theory of ships the ultimate goal of the usv is to avoid collision while sailing toward the target and to meet the requirements of colregs therefore according to the different problems that the usv has to deal with five different rewards are calculated which are respectively goal approach reward r g angle reward r a end reward r e collision avoidance reward r d and colregs reward r c reward calculation adds up the above five parts the total collision avoidance reward is r t r g r a r e r d r c then r t is stored in replay memory r module as a reward for the usv to take action τ t 1 environment platform would pass on the calculated environmental information s t to process memory p environment platform updates the environmental information according to the control moment arg ma x τ q p j τ θ and gets s t 1 the system architecture of the training framework is shown in fig 5 the learning process consists of four stages initializing executing actions getting rewards training the network the following is the calculation flow of the cica algorithm where s t is the set of state τ t is the executable action and θ is weight parameter image 1 5 simulation based on the training framework of intelligent collision avoidance system designed above cica algorithm is trained the computer configuration is as follows intel core i7 9750h six core processor nvidia gtx1660ti 6 gb graphics card 16 gb ddr3l memory in order to distinguish features easily we use matlab and unity3d to simulate jointly establish 3d navigation environment in unity3d and complete the training of cica algorithm in matlab the dynamic performance data of the usv is measured by the usv platform of ipac information processing and advanced control group in shanghai jiaotong university in the simulation the usv does not know the follow up motion of the dynamic obstacle boat which can only take corresponding actions according to the existing motion of the dynamic obstacle boat the dynamic performance of the usv is within its limit power range and its motion ability is controllable this paper studies the problem of collision avoidance in open sea with good visibility all the boats studied had ais automatic identification system installed with ais the usv can obtain accurate information of other boats such as position heading angle speed angular velocity in all simulation cases the same parameter settings are used all the symbols are marked out in fig 6 environment platform module undertakes the work of generating the navigation environment and simulating the usv simulation the information of moving boat is generated and calculated by environment platform module when the usv arrives at the target the training mission of the current episode ends and the training enters the next episode the size of process memory p np is 10 the size of replay memory r nr is 500 000 the discount factor γ is 0 999 the random probability ε of ε greedy strategy is 0 1 the mini batch data randomly extracted from replay memory r which contains 50 groups data and the weight of the network is updated by the stochastic gradient descent method sgd the training of network model is divided into 5000 episodes 200 steps of training are performed at each episode the coefficients of rewards for goal approach reward angle reward end reward collision avoidance reward and colregs reward λ d λ c λ g λ a λ e are 25 1 1 5 0 5 and 300 respectively the initial position of the usv is 0 0 and the target position is 400 300 as shown on the left side of fig 6 a the usv sails back and forth around the starting point and don t sail towards the target in the process of wandering around it collides with boat 3 in the early stage of interacting with the environment the usv lacks the experience of driving towards the target and avoiding collisions as can be seen from the figure it doesn t have the ability of driving towards the target and avoiding collisions the curves of the velocity thrust and yaw moment are shown on the right side of fig 6 a it can be seen from the figure that the thrust is not stable so the control strategy of usv needs to be further learned after 1000 episodes of training as shown on the left side of fig 6 b the usv sails along the x axis then along the y axis and slowly approaches the target but it didn t reach the target through this stage of learning it learned that the penalty will be reduced when it sails along the x axis it can be seen from the figure on the right that the thrust curve is more stable than before but the yaw moment curve shows large fluctuation the control of yaw moment still needs to be further learned after 3000 episodes of training as shown on the left side of fig 6 c the usv avoids boats 5 6 3 and finally reaches the target point in the process of avoiding boat 5 overtaking situation and 6 port crossing situation the action of avoiding collision conforms to colregs while the action of avoiding obstacle 3 head on situation does not the whole process takes 94 steps through this stage of learning it learned how to navigate to the target but has not yet fully learned colregs rules the usv has the experience of quickly obtaining the maximum thrust which can be seen from the figure on the right the usv increases the thrust to the maximum and maintains the maximum thrust until it is near the target after 5000 episodes of training as shown on the left side of fig 6 d the usv avoids boats 5 6 3 4 and 1 the collision avoidance actions are in accordance with colregs and the whole process takes 101 steps from the figure on the right it can be seen that the usv increases the thrust at the beginning and keeps the maximum thrust sailing towards the target the usv gradually reduces the thrust as it is near the target point and reaches the target point smoothly the yaw moment is also smooth throughout the process the detailed collision avoidance process is as follows in step 20 in the unity3d simulation on the right side of figure e boat 5 and the usv are in the overtaking situation the red circle represents the range of starting collision avoidance r r e w a r d boat 5 which enclosed by the red circle locates at 78 52 the usv changes course and passes starboard of boat 5 in step 37 on the right side of figure f boat 3 is enclosed by the red circle at 178 100 they are in the head on situation the usv adjusts the course turns right and successfully avoids boat 3 in the process of avoiding boats 4 and 1 starboard crossing situation the usv turns right which is in accordance with colregs as shown in figure g boat 1 which enclosed by the red circle locates at 349 197 the usv then turns right and successfully avoids boat 1 from the above different learning stages we can see that with the increase of training episodes the usv gradually acquires the ability of dynamic collision avoidance which complies with colregs and eventually reaches the target point smoothly 6 algorithm optimization 6 1 algorithm optimization of cica the training process of cica algorithm based on reinforcement learning is a process of learning through trial and error the exploitation strategy is to take corresponding actions directly when it gets the maximum expected return usv s exploratory strategy is to select random actions with a certain probability in order to search for better result even if it gets the highest reward currently expected in the training process of the above algorithm the strategy of ε greedy is adopted that is selecting a random control behavior τt with probability ε and selecting the best known behavior with probability 1 ε in the early stage of training the usv chooses random actions with larger probability ε by increasing the probability of random actions in the algorithm it quickly explores more rich experience at the end of training the usv has obtained rich experience in dealing with collision avoidance so it only needs to select random actions under a smaller probability ε or even doesn t need to select random actions in this way the usv can make full use of existing experience to select the best action based on the above considerations we define the random exploration probability ε which decaying with episode 15 ε ε 0 λ ε e p i s o d e among them ε 0 is the initial exploration probability and λ ε is the decay coefficient of exploration probability the parameters are shown in table 2 although the probability of random actions has been improved at the beginning of the training the rewards for random action are still small in this case the usv will fall into inefficient action space to solve this problem the strategy for jumping out of inefficient action space is developed which is to continue random exploration when the rewards are too small when the rewards are less than the threshold value the strategy of random exploration is adopted although the reward r g for goal approach reward is proportional to the distance from the usv to the target but no matter how far the usv is from the target the low reward action has negative impact on the choice of the subsequent action for the usv to counteract the effect of reward r g a threshold of rewards proportional to the distance between the usv and the target is defined 16 ϖ λ ϖ x t x g 2 y t y g 2 in order to train the usv to learn a good strategy as quickly as possible from its interaction with the environment and accelerate the convergence of the neural network model without losing too many rewards in the process of exploration we can use a balanced strategy of exploration and exploitation the optimized exploration strategy combines the ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold when the reward of the action is greater than ϖ strategy of ε greedy is adopted when the reward is less than ϖ random action is adopted in order to compare the impact of different exploratory strategies on the training of collision avoidance algorithm we train the algorithm under four strategies respectively which are ε greedy ε greedy with decaying ε ε greedy with reward threshold and ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold in order to reduce the random deviation of the result 100 groups of training are conducted for each strategy and then the average cumulative reward is compared the cumulative rewards received by the usv are shown in fig 7 because of the high probability of randomization at the beginning of training the usv takes many random actions and gains many penalties the usv constantly explores the environment but collisions often occurs after sufficient trial and error learning the usv has gradually changed from exploring the environment to utilizing knowledge the number of times the usv reaches the target point also increases cica algorithm with different reward strategies finally converges but the convergence rate of different reward strategies is different the early rewards for different strategies are not significantly different but they became more and more apparent as the episode increased with the increase of training episodes the difference between the cumulative rewards obtained by using decaying ε and fixed ε is more and more obvious under the same training episode that is to say the method of decaying exploration probability can improve the speed of training when using the strategy of ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold more attempts are made in the early stage which lead to low reward but its attempts in the early stage lay the foundation for the later exploitation in the later stage the strategy shows a faster convergence rate 6 2 comparison and analysis in order to verify the effectiveness of the above algorithm cica algorithm apf method and vo method are simulated and compared as can be seen from fig 8 the usv avoids the moving boats and navigates safely to the target while obeying colregs through this algorithm the other two algorithms do not obey colregs when the usv avoids moving boats apf method obtains the current control action by balancing missions between avoiding obstacles and navigating to target in each simulation step this way of balancing risks and benefits will inevitably fail to obtain the optimal path apf algorithm is easy to produce the phenomenon of local wandering at the same time the usv has the problem of excessive turning which leads to path redundancy and increase energy consumption the vo method excludes all the speeds that may lead to collision even if it takes a long time for a collision to occur which reduces the usv s optional velocity space from the simulation results of fig 8 it can be seen that the reinforcement learning algorithm can get close to the target faster and the path is shorter than other algorithms through the above comparison from table 3 it can be seen that the usv does not collide with obstacles in the three algorithms the path length is the shortest with cica algorithm apf method and vo method both depend on path planning that is which can not realize automatic navigation without path planning in apf method the usv wanders back and forth in a small range the turning radius of the usv controlled by vo method is large it is prone to make a detour because the heading angle changes in real time the probability of keeping the heading angle unchanged is low so the threshold of the change for the heading angle is o if the heading angle is θ i in i time segment the heading angle is θ i 1 in i 1 time segment t i is the time spent in the i time segment the difference of heading angle is 17 δ θ i θ i 1 θ i t i i 1 2 n 1 if δ θ i o the path maintains a straight line in i time segment if δ θ i o the path is not straight in i time segment the larger proportion of time for straight line navigation in the total time is the longer the time of straight line navigation is and the lower the requirement of maneuverability for the usv is as can be seen from the table above the proportion of straight line navigation time is the largest in cica and the quality of the path is the highest the cica algorithm can handle different navigation missions in real time without prior path planning which is an end to end algorithm it can make decisions concisely and efficiently different collision avoidance algorithms are simulated and 2 10 random obstacles are set respectively in the simulation environment we define the usv as successful when it reaches the target within the specified time each algorithm is simulated 100 times and the success rate is shown in fig 9 the horizontal axis is the number of moving boats and the vertical axis is the success rate with the increase of obstacles the success rate of apf and vo method fluctuates greatly the success rate of cica algorithm is relatively stable the usv obeys colregs which shows good environmental adaptability 7 conclusions this paper proposed a colregs intelligent collision avoidance cica algorithm for underactuated usvs under unknown dynamic environment under the control of this algorithm the usv has the ability to avoid dynamic obstacles and the strategy of collision avoidance obeys colregs in cica algorithm it can deal with complex scenarios without defining a complete collision avoidance control law so the algorithm is concise and efficient the cica algorithm achieves convergence about 4000th episode through ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold in the dynamic environment composed of different numbers of obstacles the cica algorithm shows good adaptability even in the complex navigation environment composed of 10 obstacles the success rate can still reach more than 90 the simulation results also show that the path of cica algorithm is shorter than that of the apf method and vo method under the control of cica algorithm the usv has stable heading angle which shows excellent control performance 8 future scope although this paper has made some achievements in the research on the dynamic collision avoidance for the usv but some problems are worth further studied further efforts should be made in the following aspects in the future work 1 the combination of collision avoidance algorithm and practical engineering application needs to be further studied although the usv is designed with collision avoidance function navigation tests are carried out by using real full scale usv as shown in figs 10 and 11 which partially verified the existing theoretical results however the measurement accuracy of the sensor will have an impact on collision avoidance at the same time sensor signals may be occasionally lost when navigating at sea considering the above situation the problem of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the algorithm needs to be further studied 2 multi usv collaboration control for collision avoidance multi usv collaboration can greatly improve the intelligence level of combat equipment in the military field in the field of industrial control the degree of automation for factories can be improved it is very important to extend the research results for collision avoidance control of single usv to multi usv system when the number of the usv increases it can not be accomplished by relying solely on reinforcement learning an intermediate learning layer such as planning method must be added according to the characteristics of the system we need to consider collision avoidance and navigation in the case of multi usv communication and coordination of overall behavior as shown in fig 12 3 research on algorithm integration the basic reinforcement learning method has its own insurmountable shortcomings algorithmic integration is an effective way to solve the existing

the current network weight to update the target network weight which improves the stability of the algorithm in learning the optimal strategy it is shown that the cica algorithm converges with fewer training times through ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold than other three strategies by comparing the cica algorithm with the artificial potential field method and the velocity obstacle method it is concluded that the cica algorithm is superior to the other two algorithms keywords unmanned surface vehicles dynamic collision avoidance deep learning reinforcement learning colregs 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicles usvs may encounter complex and various obstacles in many cases including islands reefs buoys and moving boats agile and accurate handling of unknown hazards is an important part of research in the field of collision avoidance control for usvs there are many classical collision avoidance algorithms koren and borenstein 1991 propose the artificial potential field method apf the target point produces attraction obstacles produces repulsion the resultant force determines the optimal direction of motion for the robot however the robot may fall into the trap area of local minimum to solve the problem of local minimum liu and bucknall 2015 improve a constrained fast marching fm method to construct two areas to ensure the planned trajectory does not violate any forbidden area for dynamic collision avoidance in addition the velocity obstacle method vo proposed by fiorini and shiller 1998 is widely used in the dynamic collision avoidance of usvs the algorithm constructes a conical region for each obstacle in the velocity space as long as the velocity vector falls into the region there will be collision risk and an optimal velocity vector should be selected from the non conical region to avoid obstacles there are many other collision avoidance methods for usvs naeem et al 2012 present a reactive collision avoidance algorithm the proposed strategy consists of waypoint guidance by line of sight coupled with a manual biasing scheme and a simple pid autopilot is incorporated to ensure that the vessel adheres to the generated seaway chiang and tapia 2018 propose colreg rrt which is achieved by conducting joint forward simulations of both the asv and the other vessels during rrt growth and the colregs compliance is enforced by constructing virtual obstacles that inhibit tree growth li et al 2019 present a two stage trajectory planning scheme a wavefront search is applied on the graph to explore the reachability in the first stage the cost of state constraints and the risk of collision then a smooth path will be found in the second stage the moving trajectories of obstacles are usually unpredictable the collision avoidance process is complex and changeable and many related factors are difficult to quantify the conventional analytic algorithms become ineffective zhang et al 2018 the control of the usv is however challenging with the integration of colregs the control law also becomes more complex even worse usvs are occasionally too ill equipped to meet the complex control law produced by analytic algorithms liu et al 2017 in order to reduce the complexity of the control law in the problem of colregs compliant collision avoidance and improve the availability of the algorithm a colregs intelligent collision avoidance cica algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning for usvs is proposed in this paper compared with the analytic algorithms this method is easier to adapt to the complex and changeable marine environment and has stronger generalization ability which is the innovation of this paper reinforcement learning rl has been a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning in recent years after the deep reinforcement learning method is successfully applied to google alphago silver et al 2016 and defeats the human chess king li shimeng in go competition how to translate deep reinforcement learning from theoretical research to practical application has attracted people s attention in recent years deep reinforcement learning has been used to solve complex control problems deep reinforcement learning combines the advantages of deep learning and reinforcement learning deep learning provides learning mechanism and reinforcement learning provides learning objectives for deep learning thus deep reinforcement learning has the ability to fit complex control strategies in 2015 the deepmind team published an article on nature mnih et al 2015 the algorithm achieved more scores than the top human players in the atari game deep reinforcement learning is also gradually applied to the autonomous collision avoidance control of robots duguleana and mogan 2016 use q learning and a neural network planner to provide mobile robots a collision free trajectory fathinezhad and derhami fathinezhad et al 2016 propose a collision avoidance method for e puck robot by combining of supervised learning and reinforcement learning liu et al 2018 propose an estimation model based on a single hidden layer neural network to approximate the unknown dynamics induced by uncertain model parameters thus the target tracking of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles with unknown dynamics is realized the advantages of reinforcement learning in the field of collision avoidance have been highlighted but only a few scholars have applied reinforcement learning to collision avoidance control of usvs cheng and zhang 2018 cheng and zhang 2018 use reinforcement learning for static collision avoidance control of usvs and dynamic collision avoidance deserves to be further studied the sea level is complex and changeable the relevant rules must be satisfied in the process of dynamic collision avoidance the international maritime organization has formulated international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs johansen et al 2016 beser and yildirim 2018 which is known as a standard for international shipping how to combine this rule with collision avoidance algorithm is the key and difficult point in this study a new intelligent algorithm cica colregs intelligent collision avoidance is proposed by combining the feature extraction ability of deep convolution neural network with the decision making ability of reinforcement learning the usv adopts this method to avoid obstacles automatically under the constraint of colregs the main contents of this paper are as follows 1 the dynamic model of the usv based on colregs is built a training framework of is designed and the collision avoidance algorithm which obeys colregs is obtained 2 process memory p is designed to store continuous state information during the voyage a continuous state is used to represent the navigation mission of the usv which solves the problem that dynamic navigation mission cannot be described by simple state 3 through

fitted frame b in the inertial coordinate system n the position of x axis position of y axis and heading angle are respectively represented by x y and ψ it is assumed that the usv can be regarded as a

point to the target point avoiding obstacles encountered the usv is different from traditional robots the navigation environment is more complex in addition to avoiding islands and floating reefs encountered the usv also needs to avoid moving boats according to the rules of navigation when the usv navigates near a moving boat dynamic obstacle if the distance between them is less than the safe distance the usv needs to avoid obstacle it is recommended that the avoidance direction should be determined according to colregs see fig 1 this paper addresses the following four primary colregs situation 1 overtaking when the usv navigates behind the moving boat the angle is within 112 5 247 5 the angle difference of the two is within 0 67 5 or 292 5 360 and the speed of the usv is faster than that of the moving boat the usv should take action to avoid the moving boat turn left or right 2 head on head on is the situation where two boats are navigating on opposite or near opposite routes the moving boat is in the usv s azimuth range of 0 5 or 355 360 the angle difference of the two is within 175 185 the usv needs to turn right and navigate as far as possible from the port side of the moving boat 3 port crossing port crossing means that the moving boat is in the usv s azimuth range of 247 5 355 and the angle difference of the two is within 67 5 175 the usv is not the give way boat so it should keep the original course 4 starboard crossing starboard crossing means that the moving boat is in the usv s azimuth range of 5 112 5 the angle difference of the two is within 185 292 5 the usv should take a right turn action and navigate behind the moving boat as far as possible in order to train the algorithm of obeying colregs and reduce the inputs of state space the parameter of conflict situation σ between the usv and the moving boat is defined when the usv and moving boat are not in conflict situation σ 0 when they are in the overtaking situation defined by colregs σ 1 when they are in the head on situation defined by colregs σ 2 when they are in the port crossing situation defined by colregs σ 3 when they are in the starboard crossing situation defined by colregs σ 4 4 colregs intelligent collision avoidance cica algorithm in the mission of automatic collision avoidance the usv is agent and the obstacles and the oceans are the environment the driving device that the usv can control and influence the environment is its propellers and rudder the usv interacts with the environment in a series of ways and constantly gains experience to correct strategy the algorithm controls the usv to take corresponding actions and the actions taken by the usv will affect the environment the environment gives some feedback rewards to the usv and the usv gains navigation experience from it 4 1 state and actions 1 system state in cica algorithm the actions taken by the usv directly depend on the system state the mission of dynamic collision avoidance is to design a decision system f according to the continuous environmental information p t detected by the usv over the past period of time the corresponding control action τ t is given among them 2 p t s t s t 1 s t n p 1 3 s t σ t v t η t ψ e t τ t 1 r n s s t is the current state of the system which includes the position vector η and the velocity vector ν the parameter of conflict situation σ the heading angle error ψ e and the last action τ t 1 among them ψ e ψ d ψ ψ d is the desired heading angle n p is the delay step taken into account by the decision system f where n s is the number of the information vector in this algorithm n s 10 the usv changes its speed and heading angle under the control actions thus avoids the dynamic obstacles and navigates toward the target and finally arrives at the target safely the decision system can be expressed as 4 τ t f p t r 2 2 control actions the environmental state perceived by the usv at t 1 is s t 1 the usv takes action τ t 1 to reach another state s t the environmental information obtained is used to judge whether the action is good or not i e the immediate reward r t the final rewards for completing the mission can only be observed after multiple steps it is a kind of delayed supervised learning the whole interaction process is a partially observable markov decision sequence process the usv has three degrees of freedom in the process of dynamic collision avoidance including forward and backward movement left and right movement and yaw rotation for the underactuated usv in order to reduce the complexity of hardware and algorithm the control vector is as follows 5 τ t τ u 0 τ r t τ u represents thrust of the propeller that drives the usv forward and backward τ r represents the moment that drives the usv turn the usv involved in this paper is equipped with two electric propellers to control the thrust and a high moment digital steering engine to control the rudder surface the variation of τ u in each simulation step is δ τ u with δ τ u 0 when the usv increases the thrust reduces the thrust or keeps the thrust constant at time t 1 the new thrust at time t is expressed as τ u t 1 δ τ u τ u t 1 δ τ u and τ u t 1 respectively we control the yaw torque by controlling the rudder angle because the steering speed of the steering engine we used is 0 22 s 60 so the rudder angle is discretized accordingly into three discrete values δ m a x 0 δ m a x 4 2 immediate rewards according to the mission of dynamic collision avoidance immediate rewards are divided into five parts goal approach reward angle reward end reward dynamic collision avoidance reward and colregs reward 1 goal approach reward one of the most important purposes of the usv is to sail towards the target and finally reach the target the position of the target η g x g y g t is known the reward function for approaching the target can be defined as 6 r g d e f λ g x t x g 2 y t y g 2 λ g is the weight of the goal approach reward 2 angle reward the heading angle error is taken as the factor of the index definition of heading angle error is shown in fig 2 the reward function is shown in equation 7 keeping it on the right heading angle and sailing approach the target are two missions that the usv needs to consider in balance the reward value of goal approach reward is large when the usv is far away from the target in order for the angle reward could be compared with the pof sition reward in different positions we include the distance factor in the angle reward 7 r a d e f λ a exp ε ψ e 2 x t x g 2 y t y g 2 where ψ e ψ d ψ is the heading angle error ψ d is the desired heading angle λ a is the weight of potential function and ε is the regulating parameter of convergence speed 3 end reward in order for the ship to stop smoothly near the target point it is necessary to design the end reward when the ship s distance from the target is less than r t h r e s h o l d we give the ship end reward the end reward is related to the speed of the usv that is the smaller the speed the bigger the reward based on the above considerations the end reward is designed as follows 8 r e d e f λ e u v x t x g 2 y t y g 2 r t h r e s h o l d 0 o t h e r w i s e where r t h r e s h o l d is the threshold of distance λ e is the weight of potential function 4 dynamic collision avoidance reward the position of the moving boat is η d i x d i y d i t the detection range of the usv is a circle the center of the circle is the center of gravity for the usv the radius is r r a d a r and r r a d a r is the detection radius of the radar in order to reduce the computational complexity the minimum distance between our usv and other boat is defined as r m i n when the distance between the usv and the moving boat is less than r m i n it is regarded as collision see fig 3 when the distance between the usv and the moving boat is less than r r e w a r d the collision avoidance mode will be triggered just like the angle reward the distance between the usv and the target is considered in the design of the collision avoidance reward function if the usv is in the state of port crossing with a moving boat it is in accordance with colregs for the usv to stay on its course if a collision occurs the usv should not be given a collision avoidance reward the collision avoidance reward function is designed as follows 9 r d i 0 σ 3 a n d τ r 0 λ d x t x g 2 y t y g 2 x t x d i 2 y t y d i 2 e l s e in which λ d is the reward weight of dynamic collision avoidance r d i r d i 5 colregs reward in order to train the collision avoidance algorithm that satisfies colregs we should reward the usv for taking actions that obey colregs it is similar to the angle reward the distance between the usv and the target is considered in the design of the colregs reward function when the usv needs to turn right based on the rule the rudder angle should be greater than 0 also when the usv needs to turn left based on the rule the rudder angle should be less than 0 when the usv needs to maintain course the rudder angle should be 0 if the usv does not perform the action described above we define it as contrary to colregs the colregs reward is designed as follows 10 r c λ c x t x g 2 y t y g 2 c o n t r a r y t o c o l r e g s 0 e l s e where λ c is the weight of the colregs reward according to the above reward function the sum of the five kinds of reward r t is as follows 11 r t r g r a r e r d r c 4 3 deep reinforcement network in traditional q learning a huge but limited table is used to represent q value watkins and dayan 1992 in this paper a depth neural network is used to fit q function the design of network model adopts two layers of convolutional layer conv two layers of full connected layer fc the input of the network is state and the structure of middle layer is cnn convolutional neural networks the output is the corresponding q value of each action and the action of the maximum q value is selected to interact with the environment when training the neural network the data must be independent and identically distributed so this is considered in cica algorithm in the process of the dynamic collision avoidance the information pt of the latest np step is stored in process memory p module where pt st st 1 st 2 s t n p 1 s t σ t v t η t ψ e t τ t 1 in order to break the relativity of data and ensure the convergence of value function replay memory r is set to store the historical running state e t p t τ t r t p t 1 at each time step t the updated state p t after the usv interacts with the environment is stored in replay memory r r e 1 e t in the process of training neural network uniform random sampling method is adopted to extract small batches of transfer sample e j p j τ j r j p j 1 from replay memory r in order to improve the stability an independent target value network q p j τ θ is used to generate the target q value 12 y j r γ max τ q p j 1 τ θ θ represents the parameter of the network for objective value function the approximator of the value function uses the deep convolution neural network in cica and the optimal objective function of the model is as follows 13 l θ j e y j q p j τ j θ 2 the weight parameter θ of main net is updated by a stochastic gradient descent sgd for small batch data baird and moore 1999 which updates the parameters of the network along the descending direction of the gradient the formula is as follows 14 l θ e r γ max τ q p j 1 τ θ q p j τ θ q p j τ j θ in cica algorithm besides using the output q p j τ j θ of deep convolution network main net to approximate the current value function replay memory r also uses the output of another network target net to represent the target q value namely max τ q p j 1 τ θ in dqn algorithm the parameter θ of main net is copied to target net every n steps during the period target net is frozen and the target q value remained unchanged that is delayed update the difference between cica algorithm and traditional dqn algorithm is that cica uses a network weight which traces the current value slowly to update the parameter of target network that is θ ξ θ 1 ξ θ where ξ 1 the update range of the target q value can be effectively controlled by cica algorithm it reduces the correlation between the current value function and the target value function to a certain extent at the same time it improves the stability of the usv in learning the optimal strategy the following figure describes the main components of cica fig 4 and their interactions 4 4 training framework of the algorithm in this paper we build an environment platform and train the algorithm in the simulation environment based on this framework the framework is used to generate random environmental information including position and speed of moving boats we define the available environment information s t σ t v t η t ψ e t τ t 1 according to the action vector τ τ u 0 τ r t selected by the usv in each simulation step the dynamics and kinematics of the usv are simulated and then the calculated attitude vector η velocity vector ν and angle vector ψ e are updated to the environmental information this framework mainly includes environment platform module process memory p module replay memory r module main net and target net environment platform is used for environment generation usv simulation and reward calculation environment generation module generates the position information of the target the position velocity and heading angle information of the moving boats the information of dynamic obstacles can be acquired and calculated by sensors and ais on the usv in real time the usv simulation module is used to calculate position information η t velocity information v t and angle information ψ e t of the usv based on dynamics theory of ships the ultimate goal of the usv is to avoid collision while sailing toward the target and to meet the requirements of colregs therefore according to the different problems that the usv has to deal with five different rewards are calculated which are respectively goal approach reward r g angle reward r a end reward r e collision avoidance reward r d and colregs reward r c reward calculation adds up the above five parts the total collision avoidance reward is r t r g r a r e r d r c then r t is stored in replay memory r module as a reward for the usv to take action τ t 1 environment platform would pass on the calculated environmental information s t to process memory p environment platform updates the environmental information according to the control moment arg ma x τ q p j τ θ and gets s t 1 the system architecture of the training framework is shown in fig 5 the learning process consists of four stages initializing executing actions getting rewards training the network the following is the calculation flow of the cica algorithm where s t is the set of state τ t is the executable action and θ is weight parameter image 1 5 simulation based on the training framework of intelligent collision avoidance system designed above cica algorithm is trained the computer configuration is as follows intel core i7 9750h six core processor nvidia gtx1660ti 6 gb graphics card 16 gb ddr3l memory in order to distinguish features easily we use matlab and unity3d to simulate jointly establish 3d navigation environment in unity3d and complete the training of cica algorithm in matlab the dynamic performance data of the usv is measured by the usv platform of ipac information processing and advanced control group in shanghai jiaotong university in the simulation the usv does not know the follow up motion of the dynamic obstacle boat which can only take corresponding actions according to the existing motion of the dynamic obstacle boat the dynamic performance of the usv is within its limit power range and its motion ability is controllable this paper studies the problem of collision avoidance in open sea with good visibility all the boats studied had ais automatic identification system installed with ais the usv can obtain accurate information of other boats such as position heading angle speed angular velocity in all simulation cases the same parameter settings are used all the symbols are marked out in fig 6 environment platform module undertakes the work of generating the navigation environment and simulating the usv simulation the information of moving boat is generated and calculated by environment platform module when the usv arrives at the target the training mission of the current episode ends and the training enters the next episode the size of process memory p np is 10 the size of replay memory r nr is 500 000 the discount factor γ is 0 999 the random probability ε of ε greedy strategy is 0 1 the mini batch data randomly extracted from replay memory r which contains 50 groups data and the weight of the network is updated by the stochastic gradient descent method sgd the training of network model is divided into 5000 episodes 200 steps of training are performed at each episode the coefficients of rewards for goal approach reward angle reward end reward collision avoidance reward and colregs reward λ d λ c λ g λ a λ e are 25 1 1 5 0 5 and 300 respectively the initial position of the usv is 0 0 and the target position is 400 300 as shown on the left side of fig 6 a the usv sails back and forth around the starting point and don t sail towards the target in the process of wandering around it collides with boat 3 in the early stage of interacting with the environment the usv lacks the experience of driving towards the target and avoiding collisions as can be seen from the figure it doesn t have the ability of driving towards the target and avoiding collisions the curves of the velocity thrust and yaw moment are shown on the right side of fig 6 a it can be seen from the figure that the thrust is not stable so the control strategy of usv needs to be further learned after 1000 episodes of training as shown on the left side of fig 6 b the usv sails along the x axis then along the y axis and slowly approaches the target but it didn t reach the target through this stage of learning it learned that the penalty will be reduced when it sails along the x axis it can be seen from the figure on the right that the thrust curve is more stable than before but the yaw moment curve shows large fluctuation the control of yaw moment still needs to be further learned after 3000 episodes of training as shown on the left side of fig 6 c the usv avoids boats 5 6 3 and finally reaches the target point in the process of avoiding boat 5 overtaking situation and 6 port crossing situation the action of avoiding collision conforms to colregs while the action of avoiding obstacle 3 head on situation does not the whole process takes 94 steps through this stage of learning it learned how to navigate to the target but has not yet fully learned colregs rules the usv has the experience of quickly obtaining the maximum thrust which can be seen from the figure on the right the usv increases the thrust to the maximum and maintains the maximum thrust until it is near the target after 5000 episodes of training as shown on the left side of fig 6 d the usv avoids boats 5 6 3 4 and 1 the collision avoidance actions are in accordance with colregs and the whole process takes 101 steps from the figure on the right it can be seen that the usv increases the thrust at the beginning and keeps the maximum thrust sailing towards the target the usv gradually reduces the thrust as it is near the target point and reaches the target point smoothly the yaw moment is also smooth throughout the process the detailed collision avoidance process is as follows in step 20 in the unity3d simulation on the right side of figure e boat 5 and the usv are in the overtaking situation the red circle represents the range of starting collision avoidance r r e w a r d boat 5 which enclosed by the red circle locates at 78 52 the usv changes course and passes starboard of boat 5 in step 37 on the right side of figure f boat 3 is enclosed by the red circle at 178 100 they are in the head on situation the usv adjusts the course turns right and successfully avoids boat 3 in the process of avoiding boats 4 and 1 starboard crossing situation the usv turns right which is in accordance with colregs as shown in figure g boat 1 which enclosed by the red circle locates at 349 197 the usv then turns right and successfully avoids boat 1 from the above different learning stages we can see that with the increase of training episodes the usv gradually acquires the ability of dynamic collision avoidance which complies with colregs and eventually reaches the target point smoothly 6 algorithm optimization 6 1 algorithm optimization of cica the training process of cica algorithm based on reinforcement learning is a process of learning through trial and error the exploitation strategy is to take corresponding actions directly when it gets the maximum expected return usv s exploratory strategy is to select random actions with a certain probability in order to search for better result even if it gets the highest reward currently expected in the training process of the above algorithm the strategy of ε greedy is adopted that is selecting a random control behavior τt with probability ε and selecting the best known behavior with probability 1 ε in the early stage of training the usv chooses random actions with larger probability ε by increasing the probability of random actions in the algorithm it quickly explores more rich experience at the end of training the usv has obtained rich experience in dealing with collision avoidance so it only needs to select random actions under a smaller probability ε or even doesn t need to select random actions in this way the usv can make full use of existing experience to select the best action based on the above considerations we define the random exploration probability ε which decaying with episode 15 ε ε 0 λ ε e p i s o d e among them ε 0 is the initial exploration probability and λ ε is the decay coefficient of exploration probability the parameters are shown in table 2 although the probability of random actions has been improved at the beginning of the training the rewards for random action are still small in this case the usv will fall into inefficient action space to solve this problem the strategy for jumping out of inefficient action space is developed which is to continue random exploration when the rewards are too small when the rewards are less than the threshold value the strategy of random exploration is adopted although the reward r g for goal approach reward is proportional to the distance from the usv to the target but no matter how far the usv is from the target the low reward action has negative impact on the choice of the subsequent action for the usv to counteract the effect of reward r g a threshold of rewards proportional to the distance between the usv and the target is defined 16 ϖ λ ϖ x t x g 2 y t y g 2 in order to train the usv to learn a good strategy as quickly as possible from its interaction with the environment and accelerate the convergence of the neural network model without losing too many rewards in the process of exploration we can use a balanced strategy of exploration and exploitation the optimized exploration strategy combines the ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold when the reward of the action is greater than ϖ strategy of ε greedy is adopted when the reward is less than ϖ random action is adopted in order to compare the impact of different exploratory strategies on the training of collision avoidance algorithm we train the algorithm under four strategies respectively which are ε greedy ε greedy with decaying ε ε greedy with reward threshold and ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold in order to reduce the random deviation of the result 100 groups of training are conducted for each strategy and then the average cumulative reward is compared the cumulative rewards received by the usv are shown in fig 7 because of the high probability of randomization at the beginning of training the usv takes many random actions and gains many penalties the usv constantly explores the environment but collisions often occurs after sufficient trial and error learning the usv has gradually changed from exploring the environment to utilizing knowledge the number of times the usv reaches the target point also increases cica algorithm with different reward strategies finally converges but the convergence rate of different reward strategies is different the early rewards for different strategies are not significantly different but they became more and more apparent as the episode increased with the increase of training episodes the difference between the cumulative rewards obtained by using decaying ε and fixed ε is more and more obvious under the same training episode that is to say the method of decaying exploration probability can improve the speed of training when using the strategy of ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold more attempts are made in the early stage which lead to low reward but its attempts in the early stage lay the foundation for the later exploitation in the later stage the strategy shows a faster convergence rate 6 2 comparison and analysis in order to verify the effectiveness of the above algorithm cica algorithm apf method and vo method are simulated and compared as can be seen from fig 8 the usv avoids the moving boats and navigates safely to the target while obeying colregs through this algorithm the other two algorithms do not obey colregs when the usv avoids moving boats apf method obtains the current control action by balancing missions between avoiding obstacles and navigating to target in each simulation step this way of balancing risks and benefits will inevitably fail to obtain the optimal path apf algorithm is easy to produce the phenomenon of local wandering at the same time the usv has the problem of excessive turning which leads to path redundancy and increase energy consumption the vo method excludes all the speeds that may lead to collision even if it takes a long time for a collision to occur which reduces the usv s optional velocity space from the simulation results of fig 8 it can be seen that the reinforcement learning algorithm can get close to the target faster and the path is shorter than other algorithms through the above comparison from table 3 it can be seen that the usv does not collide with obstacles in the three algorithms the path length is the shortest with cica algorithm apf method and vo method both depend on path planning that is which can not realize automatic navigation without path planning in apf method the usv wanders back and forth in a small range the turning radius of the usv controlled by vo method is large it is prone to make a detour because the heading angle changes in real time the probability of keeping the heading angle unchanged is low so the threshold of the change for the heading angle is o if the heading angle is θ i in i time segment the heading angle is θ i 1 in i 1 time segment t i is the time spent in the i time segment the difference of heading angle is 17 δ θ i θ i 1 θ i t i i 1 2 n 1 if δ θ i o the path maintains a straight line in i time segment if δ θ i o the path is not straight in i time segment the larger proportion of time for straight line navigation in the total time is the longer the time of straight line navigation is and the lower the requirement of maneuverability for the usv is as can be seen from the table above the proportion of straight line navigation time is the largest in cica and the quality of the path is the highest the cica algorithm can handle different navigation missions in real time without prior path planning which is an end to end algorithm it can make decisions concisely and efficiently different collision avoidance algorithms are simulated and 2 10 random obstacles are set respectively in the simulation environment we define the usv as successful when it reaches the target within the specified time each algorithm is simulated 100 times and the success rate is shown in fig 9 the horizontal axis is the number of moving boats and the vertical axis is the success rate with the increase of obstacles the success rate of apf and vo method fluctuates greatly the success rate of cica algorithm is relatively stable the usv obeys colregs which shows good environmental adaptability 7 conclusions this paper proposed a colregs intelligent collision avoidance cica algorithm for underactuated usvs under unknown dynamic environment under the control of this algorithm the usv has the ability to avoid dynamic obstacles and the strategy of collision avoidance obeys colregs in cica algorithm it can deal with complex scenarios without defining a complete collision avoidance control law so the algorithm is concise and efficient the cica algorithm achieves convergence about 4000th episode through ε greedy with both decaying ε and reward threshold in the dynamic environment composed of different numbers of obstacles the cica algorithm shows good adaptability even in the complex navigation environment composed of 10 obstacles the success rate can still reach more than 90 the simulation results also show that the path of cica algorithm is shorter than that of the apf method and vo method under the control of cica algorithm the usv has stable heading angle which shows excellent control performance 8 future scope although this paper has made some achievements in the research on the dynamic collision avoidance for the usv but some problems are worth further studied further efforts should be made in the following aspects in the future work 1 the combination of collision avoidance algorithm and practical engineering application needs to be further studied although the usv is designed with collision avoidance function navigation tests are carried out by using real full scale usv as shown in figs 10 and 11 which partially verified the existing theoretical results however the measurement accuracy of the sensor will have an impact on collision avoidance at the same time sensor signals may be occasionally lost when navigating at sea considering the above situation the problem of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the algorithm needs to be further studied 2 multi usv collaboration control for collision avoidance multi usv collaboration can greatly improve the intelligence level of combat equipment in the military field in the field of industrial control the degree of automation for factories can be improved it is very important to extend the research results for collision avoidance control of single usv to multi usv system when the number of the usv increases it can not be accomplished by relying solely on reinforcement learning an intermediate learning layer such as planning method must be added according to the characteristics of the system we need to consider collision avoidance and navigation in the case of multi usv communication and coordination of overall behavior as shown in fig 12 3 research on algorithm integration the basic reinforcement learning method has its own insurmountable shortcomings algorithmic integration is an effective way to solve the existing problems integrating artificial intelligence technology operations research and optimal control theory is an important research direction in the future credit authorship contribution statement xinli

21402,long term extreme load effects are one of the primary concerns in the design of civil and offshore structures such load effects can be evaluated using the accurate but computationally demanding full long term method or the more efficient but approximate first order and second order reliability methods monte carlo based methods enhanced with machine learning algorithms offer efficient alternatives to the traditional methods therefore artificial neural networks and support vector machines are used as surrogate models for the limit state function to speed up the prediction of long term extreme load effects a three span suspension bridge with two floating pylons under combined wind and wave actions is used as a case study the cumulative density functions of the long term extreme values corresponding to a bending moment value due to vertical deflections at the critical position of the girder are calculated it is then shown that the artificial neural network and support vector machine based approaches require less computational effort and yield more accurate results than the first and second order reliability methods keywords artificial neural networks support vector

c penalty parameter operation symbol ф cdf of a standard normal distribution the norm of a vector 1 introduction the probability distribution of long term extreme load effects is desired in the design of civil and offshore structures in principle the full long term method flm is an integration of short term response statistics e g distributions of all peaks distributions of extreme values or the mean upcrossing rate over all possible environmental conditions and represents the most accurate approach however the flm does not represent the most economical approach from a computational perspective because it must account for contributions from all possible short term environmental conditions the long term extreme load effects of structures can also be calculated using approximate reliability methods such as form and sorm rackwitz and flessler 1978 zhao and ono 1999 in such methods the point on the limit state surface with the highest probability of occurrence the so called design point or the mpp is sought then the limit state surface is approximated at the mpp by a linear surface in form whereas it is replaced by its quadratic taylor expansion in the case of sorm breitung 1984 der kiureghian and de stefano 1991 making it more accurate if the failure surface is nonlinear ultimately the performance of both methods hinges on the estimation of the mpp to that end several strategies has been developed over the years to search for it liu and der kiureghian 1991 compared several optimization algorithms to search for the mpp and found that the hasofer lind and rackwitz fiessler hl rf method hasofer and lind 1974 rackwitz and flessler 1978 and the modified hl rf method outperformed others for the examples presented in their study later zhang and kiureghian 1995 introduced an improved hl rf method that showed better performance in terms of convergence in several examples santos et al 2012 zhang and kiureghian 1995 more recently machine learning approaches such as artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm algorithms have been employed in structural reliability analysis machine learning algorithms are generally used to replace the implicit limit state function by a surrogate model therefore they can be combined with both form sorm and monte carlo methods several studies successfully used ann based mcs cardoso et al 2008 papadrakakis et al 1996 in their reliability analyses where others compared the results from ann based mcs and ann based form on the other hand several studies used svm either in connection with mcs hurtado 2004 rocco and moreno 2002 or form li et al 2006 zhao 2008 the results showed remarkable accuracy and efficiency for the basic examples presented although machine learning methods are shown to be applicable in form and sorm their full potential is realized in monte carlo methods where the computational effort is reduced significantly and the accuracy is not compromised due to approximations of the limit state function anns can replace the implicit limit state function in the reliability problem therefore avoiding time consuming simulations an ann consists of an input layer hidden layer and output layer that are connected by weights and bias parameters the training of the network is then to find the optimum combination of these parameters to minimize the difference between the outputs and the corresponding target values the feed forward back propagation bp network rumelhart et al 1986 vogl et al 1988 is one of the most commonly used types the direct way to solve this problem is through the widely used gradient descent conjugate gradient charalambous 1992 or quasi newton algorithms the levenberg marquardt hagan and menhaj 1994 algorithm that is based on the newton raphson or gauss newton methods shows a more robust and stable performance when employed in training neural networks the bayesian regulation method was introduced to neural network training by mackay 1992a 1992b and adds the sum of the squared network parameters to the objective function in addition to the errors between the outputs and the targets this approach has been shown to have good performance in controlling the so called overfitting problem hirschen and schäfer 2006 liang 2005 titterington 2004 svm which is essentially another powerful machine learning tool for data classification type of problems can also be conveniently implemented into reliability analyses if failure and safety domains are defined as two classes the algorithm is based on the principle of structural risk minimization hurtado 2004 li et al 2006 pan and dias 2017 and usually requires a small amount of training data which makes it computationally efficient pan and dias 2017 although ann and svm have been applied in some engineering relevant reliability problems most prior research has focused on the evaluation of performance and efficiency of the machine learning methods by applying them to simple benchmark examples however the applicability of such machine learning approaches to the prediction of the probability of long term extreme load effects of complex structures is yet to be investigated in this paper a new machine learning based monte carlo mc framework is developed to predict the cumulative distribution function cdf of the long term extreme response of a floating suspension bridge under wind and wave actions by replacing the implicit limit state function with surrogate models based on ann and svm the efficiency of the mc method is increased significantly in training of the algorithms a strategy is devised to increase the accuracy of the models in the vicinity of the design point the probability values and limit state surfaces obtained by ann based and svm based mc methods are then compared with the exact solutions obtained by the full long term method and more efficient but approximate form and sorm in the particular case study of the suspension bridge with floating pylons which is characterized by a strongly nonlinear limit state function form and sorm showed poor performance in estimation of the limit state surface and consequently the cdf of the long term extreme response whereas the ann and svm enhanced mc schemes showed great potential with respect to both computational efficiency and accuracy 2 the floating suspension bridge concept fig 1 shows the model view of a three span suspension bridge with two floating pylons proposed as a solution for crossing wide and deep fjords in norway the main cables are supported by two fixed pylons at each end of the bridge and two floating pylons in the middle of the bridge the bottom part of the floating pylon is similar to tension leg platforms moored by four groups of tethers providing a high stiffness in heave pitch and roll each of the main girder spans has a length of 1385 m and the pylons are 198 m high and have a draft of 65 m the water depth is 550 m and 450 m at the left and right floating pylons respectively a comprehensive finite element model of the bridge as displayed in fig 1 is used in the dynamic analysis the girder main cable tethers hangers and pylons are modeled using beam elements more details about the finite element model of the bridge are presented in gong and halden 2016 3 prediction of the long term extreme load effects 3 1 long term description of the wind and wave fields in prediction of the long term extreme load effects of complex structures a long term description of the environmental conditions is needed the long term condition can be considered as a sequence of stationary short term 1 h conditions characterized by the h s t p and v here due to lack of useable site measurements a scaled dataset from the north sea is used where the wave height and the period are divided by 2 5 and 2 5 respectively to match the preliminary surveys at the site where the mean wind velocity is kept as it is li et al 2015 the marginal distribution of the mean wind velocity v and the conditional distribution of significant wave height h s given the mean wind velocity are presented using a two parameter weibull distribution model moreover the conditional distribution of peak wave period t p given both the mean wind velocity and the significant wave height is fitted to a lognormal distribution the wind and waves are assumed to be colinear and perpendicular to the bridge axis table 1 lists the assumed parameters johannessen et al 2002 li et al 2015 and the expressions of for the probability distributions of environmental parameters are given below 1 f v v α v β v v β v α v 1 exp v β v α v 2 f h s v h s v α h s β h s h s β h s α v 1 exp h s β h s α h s α h s a 1 a 2 v a 3 β h s b 1 b 2 v b 3 3 f t p v h s

p k 1 k 2 e x p k 3 h s 3 2 wind and wave induced responses in calculation of the response of the suspension bridge with floating pylons namely the section bending moments along the girder combined wind and wave actions are considered the wind actions consist of a time invariant component due to the mean wind velocity a stationary dynamic component due to turbulence and self excited forces induced by the motion of the girder the wave actions include the radiation force generated by the motion of the submerged part of the pylons and the first order wave excitation force the second order excitation force viscous drag damping forces on the pylons and the tethers and possible excitations due to vortex shedding are out of the scope of this study furthermore the nonlinear buffeting forces are disregarded due to its negligible contribution to the overall response xu et al 2018a and nonlinear aerodynamics are not modeled owing to the linear nature of the bridge section that is used the equation of motion is solved by multi mode frequency domain method xu et al 2018a the standard deviation of the bending moment due to vertical deflection at the critical position of the girder with the maximum bending moment under various combinations of wind velocity wave height and peak period are shown in fig 2 as expected the sea states with greater significant wave height induce larger wave excitation forces and correspondingly larger section moments however the structural response is not necessarily larger with the increasing wind speed under large wave heights this is due to larger aerodynamic damping under stronger winds in addition the variation in the section moments depends strongly on the wave period the peaks in the bending moment due to vertical deformation are located within the wave period range from 3 s to 8 s which contains several vertical natural modes the occurrence probability of a specified environmental condition f s s can be achieved through field measurement given a specified environmental condition s the conditional cdf of the extreme value of the section moment due to vertical deflection in the girder in a short term period can be written as follows naess and moan 2012 4 f x d s x s exp ν x 0 s t s h o r t exp x 2 2 σ x s 2 ν x 0 s 1 2 π σ x s σ x s where σ x and σ x are the standard deviations of the response process and its derivative and ν x 0 s denotes the mean zero upcrossing rate 3 3 the full long term method as stated earlier the long term condition i e 100 years is a sequence of many short term intervals 1 h which are characterized by a set of environmental parameters s v h s t p denoting the extreme load effect in a short term period as x d the cdf of the extreme load effect in the long term period can be written as 5 f x d x s f x d s x s f s s d s it should be noted that the formulation based on the short term extremes is used here however formulations based on other response statistics such as peak values or upcrossing rate can also be used naess and moan 2012 direct integration of the above expression is called the full long term method flm in other words the flm is an integration of all possible short term response statistics weighted by their probability of occurrence the cdf of the long term extreme response can then be obtained using 6 f x ˆ x f x d x t l o n g t s h o r t the relation in eqn 5 can also be formulated as a structural reliability problem to that end introducing x crit as an arbitrary critical load effect a limit state function is written in the form madsen et al 2006 7 g s x d s x crit x crit x d s the integration then can be rewritten as 8 p f x crit s g s x d x crit 0 f x d s x s d x f s s d s using the limit state function here p f x crit is the probability that the limit state criteria is violated x crit x d s 0 commonly referred to as the probability of failure in structural reliability analysis notice that this is equivalent to 1 f x d x crit the expression can be further simplified defining a new vector ω s x d as 9 p f x crit g ω x c r i t 0 f ω ω d ω which is the familiar form of the generalized reliability problem 3 4 first order reliability method form directly solving eqn 9 is not efficient therefore it is often approximated using form first the variables are transformed into the standard normal space the so called u space applying the rosenblatt transform rosenblatt 1952 the transformation uses conditional cdfs of the variables in a stepwise manner as follows 10 f v v φ u 1 f h s v h s v φ u 2 f t p h s v t p h s v φ u 3 f x d t p h s v x d t p h s v φ u 4 u 1 φ 1 f v v u 2 φ 1 f h s v h s v u 3 φ 1 f t p h s v t p h s v u 4 φ 1 f x d t p h s v x d t p h s v and it preserves probability so that 11 g ω 0 f ω ω d ω g u x crit 0 ϕ u u d u where ϕ u is the joint probability density function of the standard normal random variables after the transformation the failure probability reads 12 p f x crit g u x crit 0 ϕ u u d u form assumes that the limit state function g u x crit 0 in the u space can be approximated linearly by a first order taylor expansion prior to this assumption there is no loss of accuracy furthermore to guarantee that the first order expansion will be as accurate as possible the taylor expansion of the limit state function is obtained at the mpp which provides the greatest contribution to the failure probability in the u space searching for the mpp is equivalent to minimizing the distance from the origin to the known failure surface defined by g u x crit 0 du 2005 therefore the basic idea of form is as follows given x crit find β min u subject to g u x crit 0 where stands for the norm of a vector and β is the distance from the origin to the mpp when the limit state function is linearly expanded at the mpp in the u space the probability of exceeding x crit over a short term period is defined as follows haver and winterstein 2009 13 p f g u x crit 0 ϕ u u d u 1 φ β the design point can be obtained using the hl rf method liu and der kiureghian 1991 14 u k 1 1 g u k 2 g u k u k g u k g u k t here g u k denotes the gradient of the limit state function evaluated at point u k the design point is obtained when eqn 14 converges i e u k 1 u k u k 1 ε where ε is the convergence tolerance the probability of the extreme section bending moment due to vertical deflection of the girder not exceeding a bending moment value of 50 4 mnm is calculated using form the moment value is taken from xu et al 2018b which represents the 100 year load effect an improved hl rf method is used to obtain the design point since the iterations oscillate among several conditions without convergence when the hl rf is used the details of the improved hl rf method are given in liu and der kiureghian 1991 zhang and kiureghian 1995 12 iterations have been performed before converging to the point u 1 4 23 u 2 0 497 u 3 0 281 and u 4 1 84 which is very close to the true design point mpp obtained using the full long term method xu et al 2018b here u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 are variables in the gaussian space transformed from the distribution or conditional distribution of the mean wind velocity significant wave height peak wave period and short term extreme responses the results correspond to a mean wind velocity of 28 3 m s a significant wave height of 4 61 m and a peak wave period of 8 13 s in the physical space the failure surface approximated by form is plotted along with the exact failure surface in fig 3 a for the sake of comparison in the figure a fixed value for u1 coincident with the true design point was assumed for the sake of visualizing the 4 d failure surface in a 3 d plot clearly the first order approximation fails to represent the true failure surface the non exceedance probability cdf value of the long term extreme bending moment corresponding to the bending moment value of 50 42 mnm based on form is 0 228 with an error of 39 5 compared with the value 0 396 that is obtained from the full long term method 3 5 second order reliability method sorm sorm approximates the limit state function g u 0 in the u space via a second order taylor expansion at the mpp the approximation of the limit state function can be written as follows ditlevsen and madsen 1996 naess and moan 2012 15 g u u g u u u t g u 1 2 u u t h u u u here h u is the hessian matrix of the limit state function at the mpp with respect to the gaussian variables the failure probability based on breitung s asymptotic approximation can be written as follows breitung 1984 16 p f φ β i 1 n 1 1 β κ i 1 2 where κ i is the ith main curvature of the limit state function at the mpp φ β is the failure probability obtained by form therefore i 1 n 1 1 β κ i 1 2 is also called the sorm factor the non exceedence probability of the extreme section bending moment due to vertical deflection of the floating suspension bridge girder is also evaluated using sorm the value of the cdf corresponding to the bending moment of 50 4 mnm is found to be 0 441 compared to the exact value of 0 396 from the full long term method this yields an error of 10 3 which is a significant improvement compared to form the failure surface approximated using sorm is shown in fig 3 b although the approximated failure surface is superior to form it still lacks accuracy further from the design point 3 6 monte carlo method enhanced with machine learning algorithms the probability distribution of the long term extreme load effects can also be obtained using monte carlo simulations in that case the expression of the cdf can be written as follows naess and moan 2012 17 f x c r i t m x d m c x c r i t m t l o n g t s h o r t where x d m c are the monte carlo simulated short term extremes m x d m c x c r i t is the number of cases where the output is smaller than x crit and t long and t short are the durations of the long term and short term periods which in this case are 100 years and 1 h respectively this framework requires many simulations giving the output x d mc for the set of m randomly generated samples of the environmental variables h s t p and v for each combination of the environmental variables random samples of x d mc can be drawn using the conditional distribution given in eqn 4 after the standard deviation of the load effect and its derivative is calculated in frequency domain this means an exhausting number of calls to the multimode frequency domain routine is necessary which is time consuming however if machine learning algorithms such as anns or svms are trained using a limited number of simulations and used instead of the response calculation routine a significantly more efficient framework can be achieved taking advantage of the equality given in eqn 11 and the rosenblatt transform the random samples can also be generated in the u space directly which is desirable due to the its convenience for a random set consisting of independent gaussian variables u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 described in 10 the monte carlo simulated short term extreme response is written as 18 x d m c f x d s 1 φ u 4 here it is noticed that a unique x d m c is obtained for each random set of u values however the evaluation of the function f x d s 1 x s needs calculation of the standard deviations of the load effect and its derivative for each combination of u 1 u 2 and u 3 this can be avoided by training machine learning algorithms that take the random variables u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 as input and give the corresponding x d m c as output 3 6 1 training cases the efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning algorithms are highly dependent on the training cases therefore they should be selected carefully since the location of the design point is unknown prior to training of the algorithms the generated training cases are suggested to cover most of the u space therefore u 1 u 2 and u 3 are selected in the ranges 1 5 2 5 and 5 5 respectively whereas the gaussian variable u4 is selected in the range 5 5 it should be noted that once u 1 u 2 and u 3 are known eqn 18 explicitly defines the relationship between u 4 and x d m c this means that the response prediction routine will be called only for unique combinations of u 1 u 2 and u 3 where many values of u 4 can be used in training without much computational effort for the initial training of the network it is desired that the training data is uniformly distributed in the u space to avoid large errors in the regions with less data therefore the u 1 u 2 u 3 parameter space is divided into 5 5 5 equal regions and one training case is generated for each region by assuming that they follow a uniform distribution in the region as presented by the blue circles in fig 4 the total number of calls to the response prediction routine therefore adds up to 5 5 5 125 using 101 values of u 4 the size of the training data becomes 5 5 5 101 12625 points of which 10 is reserved as validation set and the rest is used as the training set 3 6 2 artificial neural networks fig 5 shows a feed forward back propagation ann with three layers i e input layer hidden layer and output layer the network can have one or more hidden layers depending on the complexity of the research problem one hidden layer is sufficient for the case study in this paper each layer contains several neurons that are connected by the weight parameters w a bias parameter b is used to modulate the element output typically the number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen via trial and error the training of the neural network is basically to update the weight and bias parameters to minimize the network errors which are defined as the difference between the output and target values the bayesian regularization algorithm is employed in the training due to its superiority in avoiding overfitting the algorithm minimizes the combination of squared errors and weights as follows 19 min β 0 e d α 0 e w here e d is the sum of squared errors and e w is the sum of squares of the network weights α 0 and β 0 denote the objective function parameters representing the emphasis of reducing the weight size or minimizing the network errors during the training the workflow of the prediction of the long term extreme load effects using anns is illustrated in fig 6 training of the network was performed using the matlab toolbox neural net fitting in the case study the inputs are the gaussian variables transformed from the distribution or conditional distribution of the environmental parameters such as mean wind velocity significant wave height and peak wave period in this paper and short term extreme responses based on the rosenblatt transform algorithm rosenblatt 1952 as represent as u in eqn 12 the targets are the values of short term extreme responses which are referred as x d in eqn 7 each combination of u corresponds to a unique value of x d by mapping the inputs to the targets in the matlab toolbox the weight and bias parameters connecting different layers of the network are obtained in order to optimize the network step 3 is introduced which finds the design point form mpp using the roughly trained neural network and generates several test cases around the design point for re training the network finally in step 4 the re trained neural network is combined with the monte carlo method to predict the probability distribution of long term extreme load effects although it is not very likely for the problem considered here it is possible that the reliability problem accommodates more than one design point due to a highly nonlinear limit state function in the u space in such a case mc simulations will still yield accurate results however it is advised that the amount of training data is increased where the step 3 should either be removed or modified to search for multiple design points using the established methods of structural reliability der kiureghian and dakessian 1998 3 6 2 1 determination of the number of neurons to an extent the performance of an ann is dependent on the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the initial values of the weight and bias selected for the case study considered the training process does not require extensive computational effort therefore a simple trial and error scheme is applied to determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer the number of neurons is then determined based on the effective number of parameters r as well as based on the sum of square errors between the outputs and the targets dan foresee and hagan 1997 the actual number of weight and bias parameters in the neural network is represented by n whereas the effective number r indicates how many of the weight and bias parameters are effectively used if r is very close to n then there may be an insufficient number of neurons or hidden layers more neurons should be added until r no longer increases several networks with different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer are trained and table 2 lists the corresponding squared errors and the actual and effective number of the parameters it is observed that the sum of the squared errors always converges as the number of neurons exceeds 40 moreover the effective number of parameters also remains at approximately 240 and does not increase significantly with increasing number of neurons therefore the network with 40 neurons in the hidden layer is considered as the optimum choice for this nonlinear problem given that the simplest possible network with no loss of accuracy is sought after 3 6 2 2 selection and updating of the neural networks twenty anns with 40 neurons in the hidden layer each with different initial weight and bias parameters are trained using the bayesian regularization algorithm the condition at the mean position of the mpp predicted by the twenty networks and another eight conditions at the corners of a cube with a center at the mpp and a length of one is displayed by the red circles in fig 4 these 9 conditions are selected as the first three gaussian coordinates of the test cases the average value of u 4 is 1 89 thus the fourth coordinate of the inputs is selected in the range 1 39 2 39 with an interval of 0 1 giving 11 values of u 4 the root mean square error rmse of the predicted short term extreme values of the section moment for the test cases compared to the exact solutions is used as the criterion to judge which network has the best performance the rmse is defined as follows 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x d true x d pred 2 here x d pred is the predicted value of the section moment using the trained neural network and x d t r u e is the target value n is the number of the test cases the predicted short term extreme values of the section moment of the 9 11 test cases based on three of the networks are compared with the true results as shown in fig 7 the trial and error scheme is used to identify the network with optimal initial parameters i e giving the least error rmse the third network shown in fig 7 introduces the minimal rmse and is selected to predict the distribution of the long term extreme values of the section moment due to vertical deflections at the end of the training the total number of structural analyses that were performed is only 5 5 5 9 134 3 6 2 3 ann based monte carlo simulation the predicted failure surface defined as the section moment being equal to 50 42 mnm match quite well with the exact surface as shown in fig 8 according to the ann based monte carlo simulation where 5 108 samples were used the cdf value corresponds very well with the full long term method over the entire range of the long term extreme values as shown in fig 9 and the probability of the bending moment not exceeding the value of 50 42 mnm in 100 years is calculated as 0 3985 with an error of 0 63 3 6 3 support vector machine given a set of training data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 and x n y n x i r p y i 1 1 and 1 and 1 represent two different categories the main purpose of svm is to find a hyperplane in a high or infinite dimensional space to separate the training data as different classes in reliability analysis the two classes refer to safety and failure domains in the case study of the probability distribution of extreme load effects the two classes are the short term extreme response value exceeding or not exceeding a specified critical value the hyperplane named as failure surface in the long term analysis is usually expressed as follows 21a w t x b 0 here w is the orthogonal vector to the hyperplane and b is the bias term the optimization problem searching for appropriate w and b values can be formulated as maximizing the margin which is also equal to minimizing w with a constraint to guarantee that all training data are on the correct side of the hyperplane to control overfitting classification errors should be allowed which can be expressed as 21b min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i subject to y i w t x i b 1 ξ i i 1 2 n here ξ represent the distance of the training data from the functional margin it is positive when the ith training point is in a wrong position otherwise it is zero c is the parameter defined by the user to assign the penalty to the classification errors when the training data are required to be separated by a nonlinear hyperplane the optimization problem can be solved by mapping the variables to a higher dimensional space x ϕ x as shown in fig 10 b this mapping function is called the kernel function k x i x j ϕ x i ϕ x j radial basis function is one of the most widely used kernel functions for nonlinear problems which is expressed as follows burges 1998 22 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 here γ is a kernel parameter defined by the user the procedure of applying an svm to the case study is shown in fig 11 the first and last steps are similar to those for the application of an ann steps 2 4 are introduced to search for the optimum combination of the kernel s parameter γ and soft margin parameter c which are two important parameters determining the performance of the svm model many computer codes for svm training are readily available online e g the libsvm compiled by chang and lin 2011 ls svmlab by suykens and vandewalle 1999 and the matlab toolbox fitcsvm which is used in this study 3 6 3 1 determination of parameters cross validation technique is used to search for the optimum combination of the hyperparameters γ and c the method requires dividing the training data into subsets and calculating an average error quantity repeating this with different hyperparameters the combination of parameters that give the least average error is chosen as the optimal to that end the 125 environmental conditions are divided here into eight subsets each environmental condition is then grouped with 1001 values of u 4 the mean error rate of classifying the unknown set under different combinations of γ and c is shown in fig 12 the svm model with parameters γ 24 and c 29 introduces the least error and is used to find the mpp u 1 4 23 u 2 0 508 u 3 0 304 and u 4 1 84 the test conditions are shown by the yellow circles in fig 4 and u 4 is selected in the range 5 5 with an interval of 0 01 the error rates of the classification of the test cases under different combinations of kernel parameter γ and soft margin parameter c are shown in fig 13 finally γ 22 and c 213 are selected as the parameters for the model as the combination gives the least error in classification of the test data 3 6 3 2 svm based monte carlo simulation after determining the parameters the svm model is re trained by adding the test cases to the training cases the predicted and true failure surfaces are shown in fig 14 similar to the case of the ann based mc method there is a good agreement between the two surfaces the value of the cdf of the extreme bending moment according to the monte carlo simulation is 0 402 with an error of 1 41 compared to the results obtained using the full long term method 3 6 4 the effect of the randomness and size of the training data the random nature of the training data can affect the training process and consequently the performance of the ann and svm models for instance if the randomly generated environmental conditions for training are near the design point by chance the predicted results will likely match well with the true values to guarantee that the better performance of the machine learning approaches over traditional reliability analysis methods is not owed to coincidence three different training cases with different sizes are generated table 3 and table 4 show the cumulative probabilities of the long term extreme values corresponding to the bending moment value of 50 42 mnm and the corresponding errors along with a comparison of the failure surface for the ann based method 3 3 3 environmental conditions are not sufficient to predict the probability distribution of the long term extreme values the variation in the cdf value based on the three different random training sets is large and the agreement between the failure surfaces is poor when the number of training environmental conditions is increased to 4 4 4 the ann gives satisfactory predictions the maximum error is found to be 7 12 therefore the accuracy is not a result of a cancellation effect because the failure surfaces also match well thus only 73 environmental conditions are required including the test conditions which is fewer than that in form the performance becomes significantly better when 5 5 5 and 6 6 6 training conditions are used the performance of the trained svm model is presented in table 4 the prediction becomes satisfactory as the number of training environmental conditions increases to 5 5 5 where 3 3 3 conditions are clearly not enough although the cdf of long term extreme response is accurate based on the first two random sets of 4 4 4 conditions it should be attributed to the cancellation effect according to the poor match of the failure surface 3 7 comparison of the failure probability based on different approaches the probability of the extreme values of the bending moment below 50 42 mnm in 100 years and the number of simulations required for the full long term method form sorm ann monte carlo and svm monte carlo approaches are compared in table 5 form requires the simulation of 78 environmental conditions 65 of these conditions come from 13 iterations whereas the other 13 are performed due to backtracking to guarantee the convergence sorm requires ten more to calculate the elements in the hessian matrix in this case study the performance of the ann in predicting the probability of the long term extreme load effects of suspension bridges with floating pylons is better than those of the form and sorm from the perspective of both computational efficiency and accuracy another advantage of applying the machine learning approach is that the numerically simulated cases can also be used to predict the cdf at any specified extreme value for different response parameters the svm is not as good as the ann method because regression is performed in the ann whereas a classification algorithm is employed in the svm therefore the targets of the training cases in the ann are the long term extreme values whereas in the svm the target values are simply 1 and 1 representing failure and safety respectively therefore much more information is efficiently used in the neural networks 4 conclusions the machine learning methods of the ann based and svm based monte carlo simulations are applied to a case study of long term extreme load effects on a suspension bridge with floating pylons under combined wind and wave actions a comparison between machine learning methods and first and second order reliability methods is conducted to determine the computational accuracy and efficiency of the methods in calculation of the cumulative probabilities of the long term extreme values of the bending moment due to vertical deflections at the critical position of the girder in the case study of the suspension bridge with floating pylons which is characterized by a strongly nonlinear limit state function first and second order taylor expansions are not found sufficiently accurate the ann regression algorithm yields more accurate results than the sorm when similar number of environmental conditions are used the svm classification algorithm requires more computational effort than the ann to perform with similar accuracy therefore the ann approach is recommended based on the case study results another reason for recommending the ann method is that the long term cumulative probability of any specified short term extreme peak value can be achieved through only one training process it can be further used to calculate the characteristic long term extreme response values for uls and als design checks to achieve the same goal form sorm and svm training have to be repeated several times at different specified critical response values consequently the computational effort required will be significantly larger

21402,long term extreme load effects are one of the primary concerns in the design of civil and offshore structures such load effects can be evaluated using the accurate but computationally demanding full long term method or the more efficient but approximate first order and second order reliability methods monte carlo based methods enhanced with machine learning algorithms offer efficient alternatives to the traditional methods therefore artificial neural networks and support vector machines are used as surrogate models for the limit state function to speed up the prediction of long term extreme load effects a three span suspension bridge with two floating pylons under combined wind and wave actions is used as a case study the cumulative density functions of the long term extreme values corresponding to a bending moment value due to vertical deflections at the critical position of the girder are calculated it is then shown that the artificial neural network and support vector

c penalty parameter operation symbol ф cdf of a standard normal distribution the norm of a vector 1 introduction the probability distribution of long term extreme load effects is desired in the design of civil and offshore structures in principle the full long term method flm is an integration of short term response statistics e g distributions of all peaks distributions of extreme values or the mean upcrossing rate over all possible environmental conditions and represents the most accurate approach however the flm does not represent the most economical approach from a computational perspective because it must account for contributions from all possible short term environmental conditions the long term extreme load effects of structures can also be calculated using approximate reliability methods such as form and sorm rackwitz and flessler 1978 zhao and ono 1999 in such methods the point on the limit state surface with the highest probability of occurrence the so called design point or the mpp is sought then the limit state surface is approximated at the mpp by a linear surface in form whereas it is replaced by its quadratic taylor expansion in the case of sorm breitung 1984 der kiureghian and de stefano 1991 making it more accurate if the failure surface is nonlinear ultimately the performance of both methods hinges on the estimation of the mpp to that end several strategies has been developed over the years to search for it liu and der kiureghian 1991 compared several optimization algorithms to search for the mpp and found that the hasofer lind and rackwitz fiessler hl rf method hasofer and lind 1974 rackwitz and flessler 1978 and the modified hl rf method outperformed others for the examples presented in their study later zhang and kiureghian 1995 introduced an improved hl rf method that showed better performance in terms of convergence in several examples santos et al 2012 zhang and kiureghian 1995 more recently machine learning approaches such as artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm algorithms have been employed in structural reliability analysis machine learning algorithms are generally used to replace the implicit limit state function by a surrogate model therefore they can be combined with both form sorm and monte carlo methods several studies successfully used ann based mcs cardoso et al 2008 papadrakakis et al 1996 in their reliability analyses where others compared the results from ann based mcs and ann based form on the other hand several studies used svm either in connection with mcs hurtado 2004 rocco and moreno 2002 or form li et al 2006 zhao 2008 the results showed remarkable accuracy and efficiency for the basic examples presented although machine learning methods are shown to be applicable in form and sorm their full potential is realized in monte carlo methods where the computational effort is reduced significantly and the accuracy is not compromised due to approximations of the limit state function anns can replace the implicit limit state function in the reliability problem therefore avoiding time consuming simulations an ann consists of an input layer hidden layer and output layer that are connected by weights and bias parameters the training of the network is then to find the optimum combination of these parameters to minimize the difference between the outputs and the corresponding target values the feed forward back propagation bp network rumelhart et al 1986 vogl et al 1988 is one of the most commonly used types the direct way to solve this problem is through the widely used gradient descent conjugate gradient charalambous 1992 or quasi newton algorithms the levenberg marquardt hagan and menhaj 1994 algorithm that is based on the newton raphson or gauss newton methods shows a more robust and stable performance when employed in training neural networks the bayesian regulation method was introduced to neural network training by mackay 1992a 1992b and adds the sum of the squared network parameters to the objective function in addition to the errors between the outputs and the targets this approach has been shown to have good performance in controlling the so called overfitting problem hirschen and schäfer 2006 liang 2005 titterington 2004 svm which is essentially another powerful machine learning tool for data classification type of problems can also be conveniently implemented into reliability analyses if failure and safety domains are defined as two classes the algorithm is based on the principle of structural risk minimization hurtado 2004 li et al 2006 pan and dias 2017 and usually requires a small amount of training data which makes it computationally efficient pan and dias 2017 although ann and svm have been applied in some engineering relevant reliability problems most prior research has focused on the evaluation of performance and efficiency of the machine learning methods by applying them to simple benchmark examples however the applicability of such machine learning approaches to the prediction of the probability of long term extreme load effects of complex structures is yet to be investigated in this paper a new machine learning based monte carlo mc framework is developed to predict the cumulative distribution function cdf of the long term extreme response of a floating suspension bridge under wind and wave actions by replacing the implicit limit state function with surrogate models based on ann and svm the efficiency of the mc method is increased significantly in training of the algorithms a strategy is devised to increase the accuracy of the models in the vicinity of the design point the probability values and limit state surfaces obtained by ann based and svm based mc methods are then compared with the exact solutions obtained by the full long term method and more efficient but approximate form and sorm in the particular case study of the suspension bridge with floating pylons which is characterized by a strongly nonlinear limit state function form and sorm showed poor performance in estimation of the limit state surface and consequently the cdf of the long term extreme response whereas the ann and svm enhanced mc schemes showed great potential with respect to both computational efficiency and accuracy 2 the floating suspension bridge concept fig 1 shows the model view of a three span suspension bridge with two floating pylons proposed as a solution for crossing wide and deep fjords in norway the main cables are supported by two fixed pylons at each end of the bridge and two floating pylons in the middle of the bridge the bottom part of the floating pylon is similar to tension leg platforms moored by four groups of tethers providing a high stiffness in heave pitch and roll each of the main girder spans has a length of 1385 m and the pylons are 198 m high and have a draft of 65 m the water depth is 550 m and 450 m at the left and right floating pylons respectively a comprehensive finite element model of the bridge as displayed in fig 1 is used in the dynamic analysis the girder main cable tethers hangers and pylons are modeled using beam elements more details about the finite element model of the bridge are presented in gong and halden 2016 3 prediction of the long term extreme load effects 3 1 long term description of the wind and wave fields in prediction of the long term extreme load effects of complex structures a long term description of the environmental conditions is needed the long term condition can be considered as a sequence of stationary short term 1 h conditions characterized by the h s t p and v here due to lack of useable site measurements a scaled dataset from the north sea is used where the wave height and the period are divided by 2 5 and 2 5 respectively to match the preliminary surveys at the site where the mean wind velocity is kept as it is li et al 2015 the marginal distribution of the mean wind velocity v and the conditional distribution of significant wave height h s given the mean wind velocity are presented using a two parameter weibull distribution model moreover the conditional distribution of peak wave period t p given both the mean wind velocity and the significant wave height is fitted to a lognormal distribution the wind and waves are assumed to be colinear and perpendicular to the bridge axis table 1 lists the assumed parameters johannessen et al 2002 li et al 2015 and the expressions of for the probability distributions of environmental parameters are given below 1 f v v α v β v v β v α v 1 exp v β v α v 2 f h s v h s v α h s β h s h s β h s α v 1 exp h s β h s α h s α h s a 1 a 2 v a 3 β h s b 1 b 2 v b 3 3 f t p v h s

p k 1 k 2 e x p k 3 h s 3 2 wind and wave induced responses in calculation of the response of the suspension bridge with floating pylons namely the section bending moments along the girder combined wind and wave actions are considered the wind actions consist of a time invariant component due to the mean wind velocity a stationary dynamic component due to turbulence and self excited forces induced by the motion of the girder the wave actions include the radiation force generated by the motion of the submerged part of the pylons and the first order wave excitation force the second order excitation force viscous drag damping forces on the pylons and the tethers and possible excitations due to vortex shedding are out of the scope of this study furthermore the nonlinear buffeting forces are disregarded due to its negligible contribution to the overall response xu et al 2018a and nonlinear aerodynamics are not modeled owing to the linear nature of the bridge section that is used the equation of motion is solved by multi mode frequency domain method xu et al 2018a the standard deviation of the bending moment due to vertical deflection at the critical position of the girder with the maximum bending moment under various combinations of wind velocity wave height and peak period are shown in fig 2 as expected the sea states with greater significant wave height induce larger wave excitation forces and correspondingly larger section moments however the structural response is not necessarily larger with the increasing wind speed under large wave heights this is due to larger aerodynamic damping under stronger winds in addition the variation in the section moments depends strongly on the wave period the peaks in the bending moment due to vertical deformation are located within the wave period range from 3 s to 8 s which contains several vertical natural modes the occurrence probability of a specified environmental condition f s s can be achieved through field measurement given a specified environmental condition s the conditional cdf of the extreme value of the section moment due to vertical deflection in the girder in a short term period can be written as follows naess and moan 2012 4 f x d s x s exp ν x 0 s t s h o r t exp x 2 2 σ x s 2 ν x 0 s 1 2 π σ x s σ x s where σ x and σ x are the standard deviations of the response process and its derivative and ν x 0 s denotes the mean zero upcrossing rate 3 3 the full long term method as stated earlier the long term condition i e 100 years is a sequence of many short term intervals 1 h which are characterized by a set of environmental parameters s v h s t p denoting the extreme load effect in a short term period as x d the cdf of the extreme load effect in the long term period can be written as 5 f x d x s f x d s x s f s s d s it should be noted that the formulation based on the short term extremes is used here however formulations based on other response statistics such as peak values or upcrossing rate can also be used naess and moan 2012 direct integration of the above expression is called the full long term method flm in other words the flm is an integration of all possible short term response statistics weighted by their probability of occurrence the cdf of the long term extreme response can then be obtained using 6 f x ˆ x f x d x t l o n g t s h o r t the relation in eqn 5 can also be formulated as a structural reliability problem to that end introducing x crit as an arbitrary critical load effect a limit state function is written in the form madsen et al 2006 7 g s x d s x crit x crit x d s the integration then can be rewritten as 8 p f x crit s g s x d x crit 0 f x d s x s d x f s s d s using the limit state function here p f x crit is the probability that the limit state criteria is violated x crit x d s 0 commonly referred to as the probability of failure in structural reliability analysis notice that this is equivalent to 1 f x d x crit the expression can be further simplified defining a new vector ω s x d as 9 p f x crit g ω x c r i t 0 f ω ω d ω which is the familiar form of the generalized reliability problem 3 4 first order reliability method form directly solving eqn 9 is not efficient therefore it is often approximated using form first the variables are transformed into the standard normal space the so called u space applying the rosenblatt transform rosenblatt 1952 the transformation uses conditional cdfs of the variables in a stepwise manner as follows 10 f v v φ u 1 f h s v h s v φ u 2 f t p h s v t p h s v φ u 3 f x d t p h s v x d t p h s v φ u 4 u 1 φ 1 f v v u 2 φ 1 f h s v h s v u 3 φ 1 f t p h s v t p h s v u 4 φ 1 f x d t p h s v x d t p h s v and it preserves probability so that 11 g ω 0 f ω ω d ω g u x crit 0 ϕ u u d u where ϕ u is the joint probability density function of the standard normal random variables after the transformation the failure probability reads 12 p f x crit g u x crit 0 ϕ u u d u form assumes that the limit state function g u x crit 0 in the u space can be approximated linearly by a first order taylor expansion prior to this assumption there is no loss of accuracy furthermore to guarantee that the first order expansion will be as accurate as possible the taylor expansion of the limit state function is obtained at the mpp which provides the greatest contribution to the failure probability in the u space searching for the mpp is equivalent to minimizing the distance from the origin to the known failure surface defined by g u x crit 0 du 2005 therefore the basic idea of form is as follows given x crit find β min u subject to g u x crit 0 where stands for the norm of a vector and β is the distance from the origin to the mpp when the limit state function is linearly expanded at the mpp in the u space the probability of exceeding x crit over a short term period is defined as follows haver and winterstein 2009 13 p f g u x crit 0 ϕ u u d u 1 φ β the design point can be obtained using the hl rf method liu and der kiureghian 1991 14 u k 1 1 g u k 2 g u k u k g u k g u k t here g u k denotes the gradient of the limit state function evaluated at point u k the design point is obtained when eqn 14 converges i e u k 1 u k u k 1 ε where ε is the convergence tolerance the probability of the extreme section bending moment due to vertical deflection of the girder not exceeding a bending moment value of 50 4 mnm is calculated using form the moment value is taken from xu et al 2018b which represents the 100 year load effect an improved hl rf method is used to obtain the design point since the iterations oscillate among several conditions without convergence when the hl rf is used the details of the improved hl rf method are given in liu and der kiureghian 1991 zhang and kiureghian 1995 12 iterations have been performed before converging to the point u 1 4 23 u 2 0 497 u 3 0 281 and u 4 1 84 which is very close to the true design point mpp obtained using the full long term method xu et al 2018b here u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 are variables in the gaussian space transformed from the distribution or conditional distribution of the mean wind velocity significant wave height peak wave period and short term extreme responses the results correspond to a mean wind velocity of 28 3 m s a significant wave height of 4 61 m and a peak wave period of 8 13 s in the physical space the failure surface approximated by form is plotted along with the exact failure surface in fig 3 a for the sake of comparison in the figure a fixed value for u1 coincident with the true design point was assumed for the sake of visualizing the 4 d failure surface in a 3 d plot clearly the first order approximation fails to represent the true failure surface the non exceedance probability cdf value of the long term extreme bending moment corresponding to the bending moment value of 50 42 mnm based on form is 0 228 with an error of 39 5 compared with the value 0 396 that is obtained from the full long term method 3 5 second order reliability method sorm sorm approximates the limit state function g u 0 in the u space via a second order taylor expansion at the mpp the approximation of the limit state function can be written as follows ditlevsen and madsen 1996 naess and moan 2012 15 g u u g u u u t g u 1 2 u u t h u u u here h u is the hessian matrix of the limit state function at the mpp with respect to the gaussian variables the failure probability based on breitung s asymptotic approximation can be written as follows breitung 1984 16 p f φ β i 1 n 1 1 β κ i 1 2 where κ i is the ith main curvature of the limit state function at the mpp φ β is the failure probability obtained by form therefore i 1 n 1 1 β κ i 1 2 is also called the sorm factor the non exceedence probability of the extreme section bending moment due to vertical deflection of the floating suspension bridge girder is also evaluated using sorm the value of the cdf corresponding to the bending moment of 50 4 mnm is found to be 0 441 compared to the exact value of 0 396 from the full long term method this yields an error of 10 3 which is a significant improvement compared to form the failure surface approximated using sorm is shown in fig 3 b although the approximated failure surface is superior to form it still lacks accuracy further from the design point 3 6 monte carlo method enhanced with machine learning algorithms the probability distribution of the long term extreme load effects can also be obtained using monte carlo simulations in that case the expression of the cdf can be written as follows naess and moan 2012 17 f x c r i t m x d m c x c r i t m t l o n g t s h o r t where x d m c are the monte carlo simulated short term extremes m x d m c x c r i t is the number of cases where the output is smaller than x crit and t long and t short are the durations of the long term and short term periods which in this case are 100 years and 1 h respectively this framework requires many simulations giving the output x d mc for the set of m randomly generated samples of the environmental variables h s t p and v for each combination of the environmental variables random samples of x d mc can be drawn using the conditional distribution given in eqn 4 after the standard deviation of the load effect and its derivative is calculated in frequency domain this means an exhausting number of calls to the multimode frequency domain routine is necessary which is time consuming however if machine learning algorithms such as anns or svms are trained using a limited number of simulations and used instead of the response calculation routine a significantly more efficient framework can be achieved taking advantage of the equality given in eqn 11 and the rosenblatt transform the random samples can also be generated in the u space directly which is desirable due to the its convenience for a random set consisting of independent gaussian variables u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 described in 10 the monte carlo simulated short term extreme response is written as 18 x d m c f x d s 1 φ u 4 here it is noticed that a unique x d m c is obtained for each random set of u values however the evaluation of the function f x d s 1 x s needs calculation of the standard deviations of the load effect and its derivative for each combination of u 1 u 2 and u 3 this can be avoided by training machine learning algorithms that take the random variables u 1 u 2 u 3 and u 4 as input and give the corresponding x d m c as output 3 6 1 training cases the efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning algorithms are highly dependent on the training cases therefore they should be selected carefully since the location of the design point is unknown prior to training of the algorithms the generated training cases are suggested to cover most of the u space therefore u 1 u 2 and u 3 are selected in the ranges 1 5 2 5 and 5 5 respectively whereas the gaussian variable u4 is selected in the range 5 5 it should be noted that once u 1 u 2 and u 3 are known eqn 18 explicitly defines the relationship between u 4 and x d m c this means that the response prediction routine will be called only for unique combinations of u 1 u 2 and u 3 where many values of u 4 can be used in training without much computational effort for the initial training of the network it is desired that the training data is uniformly distributed in the u space to avoid large errors in the regions with less data therefore the u 1 u 2 u 3 parameter space is divided into 5 5 5 equal regions and one training case is generated for each region by assuming that they follow a uniform distribution in the region as presented by the blue circles in fig 4 the total number of calls to the response prediction routine therefore adds up to 5 5 5 125 using 101 values of u 4 the size of the training data becomes 5 5 5 101 12625 points of which 10 is reserved as validation set and the rest is used as the training set 3 6 2 artificial neural networks fig 5 shows a feed forward back propagation ann with three layers i e input layer hidden layer and output layer the network can have one or more hidden layers depending on the complexity of the research problem one hidden layer is sufficient for the case study in this paper each layer contains several neurons that are connected by the weight parameters w a bias parameter b is used to modulate the element output typically the number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen via trial and error the training of the neural network is basically to update the weight and bias parameters to minimize the network errors which are defined as the difference between the output and target values the bayesian regularization algorithm is employed in the training due to its superiority in avoiding overfitting the algorithm minimizes the combination of squared errors and weights as follows 19 min β 0 e d α 0 e w here e d is the sum of squared errors and e w is the sum of squares of the network weights α 0 and β 0 denote the objective function parameters representing the emphasis of reducing the weight size or minimizing the network errors during the training the workflow of the prediction of the long term extreme load effects using anns is illustrated in fig 6 training of the network was performed using the matlab toolbox neural net fitting in the case study the inputs are the gaussian variables transformed from the distribution or conditional distribution of the environmental parameters such as mean wind velocity significant wave height and peak wave period in this paper and short term extreme responses based on the rosenblatt transform algorithm rosenblatt 1952 as represent as u in eqn 12 the targets are the values of short term extreme responses which are referred as x d in eqn 7 each combination of u corresponds to a unique value of x d by mapping the inputs to the targets in the matlab toolbox the weight and bias parameters connecting different layers of the network are obtained in order to optimize the network step 3 is introduced which finds the design point form mpp using the roughly trained neural network and generates several test cases around the design point for re training the network finally in step 4 the re trained neural network is combined with the monte carlo method to predict the probability distribution of long term extreme load effects although it is not very likely for the problem considered here it is possible that the reliability problem accommodates more than one design point due to a highly nonlinear limit state function in the u space in such a case mc simulations will still yield accurate results however it is advised that the amount of training data is increased where the step 3 should either be removed or modified to search for multiple design points using the established methods of structural reliability der kiureghian and dakessian 1998 3 6 2 1 determination of the number of neurons to an extent the performance of an ann is dependent on the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the initial values of the weight and bias selected for the case study considered the training process does not require extensive computational effort therefore a simple trial and error scheme is applied to determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer the number of neurons is then determined based on the effective number of parameters r as well as based on the sum of square errors between the outputs and the targets dan foresee and hagan 1997 the actual number of weight and bias parameters in the neural network is represented by n whereas the effective number r indicates how many of the weight and bias parameters are effectively used if r is very close to n then there may be an insufficient number of neurons or hidden layers more neurons should be added until r no longer increases several networks with different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer are trained and table 2 lists the corresponding squared errors and the actual and effective number of the parameters it is observed that the sum of the squared errors always converges as the number of neurons exceeds 40 moreover the effective number of parameters also remains at approximately 240 and does not increase significantly with increasing number of neurons therefore the network with 40 neurons in the hidden layer is considered as the optimum choice for this nonlinear problem given that the simplest possible network with no loss of accuracy is sought after 3 6 2 2 selection and updating of the neural networks twenty anns with 40 neurons in the hidden layer each with different initial weight and bias parameters are trained using the bayesian regularization algorithm the condition at the mean position of the mpp predicted by the twenty networks and another eight conditions at the corners of a cube with a center at the mpp and a length of one is displayed by the red circles in fig 4 these 9 conditions are selected as the first three gaussian coordinates of the test cases the average value of u 4 is 1 89 thus the fourth coordinate of the inputs is selected in the range 1 39 2 39 with an interval of 0 1 giving 11 values of u 4 the root mean square error rmse of the predicted short term extreme values of the section moment for the test cases compared to the exact solutions is used as the criterion to judge which network has the best performance the rmse is defined as follows 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x d true x d pred 2 here x d pred is the predicted value of the section moment using the trained neural network and x d t r u e is the target value n is the number of the test cases the predicted short term extreme values of the section moment of the 9 11 test cases based on three of the networks are compared with the true results as shown in fig 7 the trial and error scheme is used to identify the network with optimal initial parameters i e giving the least error rmse the third network shown in fig 7 introduces the minimal rmse and is selected to predict the distribution of the long term extreme values of the section moment due to vertical deflections at the end of the training the total number of structural analyses that were performed is only 5 5 5 9 134 3 6 2 3 ann based monte carlo simulation the predicted failure surface defined as the section moment being equal to 50 42 mnm match quite well with the exact surface as shown in fig 8 according to the ann based monte carlo simulation where 5 108 samples were used the cdf value corresponds very well with the full long term method over the entire range of the long term extreme values as shown in fig 9 and the probability of the bending moment not exceeding the value of 50 42 mnm in 100 years is calculated as 0 3985 with an error of 0 63 3 6 3 support vector machine given a set of training data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 and x n y n x i r p y i 1 1 and 1 and 1 represent two different categories the main purpose of svm is to find a hyperplane in a high or infinite dimensional space to separate the training data as different classes in reliability analysis the two classes refer to safety and failure domains in the case study of the probability distribution of extreme load effects the two classes are the short term extreme response value exceeding or not exceeding a specified critical value the hyperplane named as failure surface in the long term analysis is usually expressed as follows 21a w t x b 0 here w is the orthogonal vector to the hyperplane and b is the bias term the optimization problem searching for appropriate w and b values can be formulated as maximizing the margin which is also equal to minimizing w with a constraint to guarantee that all training data are on the correct side of the hyperplane to control overfitting classification errors should be allowed which can be expressed as 21b min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i subject to y i w t x i b 1 ξ i i 1 2 n here ξ represent the distance of the training data from the functional margin it is positive when the ith training point is in a wrong position otherwise it is zero c is the parameter defined by the user to assign the penalty to the classification errors when the training data are required to be separated by a nonlinear hyperplane the optimization problem can be solved by mapping the variables to a higher dimensional space x ϕ x as shown in fig 10 b this mapping function is called the kernel function k x i x j ϕ x i ϕ x j radial basis function is one of the most widely used kernel functions for nonlinear problems which is expressed as follows burges 1998 22 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 here γ is a kernel parameter defined by the user the procedure of applying an svm to the case study is shown in fig 11 the first and last steps are similar to those for the application of an ann steps 2 4 are introduced to search for the optimum combination of the kernel s parameter γ and soft margin parameter c which are two important parameters determining the performance of the svm model many computer codes for svm training are readily available online e g the libsvm compiled by chang and lin 2011 ls svmlab by suykens and vandewalle 1999 and the matlab toolbox fitcsvm which is used in this study 3 6 3 1 determination of parameters cross validation technique is used to search for the optimum combination of the hyperparameters γ and c the method requires dividing the training data into subsets and calculating an average error quantity repeating this with different hyperparameters the combination of parameters that give the least average error is chosen as the optimal to that end the 125 environmental conditions are divided here into eight subsets each environmental condition is then grouped with 1001 values of u 4 the mean error rate of classifying the unknown set under different combinations of γ and c is shown in fig 12 the svm model with parameters γ 24 and c 29 introduces the least error and is used to find the mpp u 1 4 23 u 2 0 508 u 3 0 304 and u 4 1 84 the test conditions are shown by the yellow circles in fig 4 and u 4 is selected in the range 5 5 with an interval of 0 01 the error rates of the classification of the test cases under different combinations of kernel parameter γ and soft margin parameter c are shown in fig 13 finally γ 22 and c 213 are selected as the parameters for the model as the combination gives the least error in classification of the test data 3 6 3 2 svm based monte carlo simulation after determining the parameters the svm model is re trained by adding the test cases to the training cases the predicted and true failure surfaces are shown in fig 14 similar to the case of the ann based mc method there is a good agreement between the two surfaces the value of the cdf of the extreme bending moment according to the monte carlo simulation is 0 402 with an error of 1 41 compared to the results obtained using the full long term method 3 6 4 the effect of the randomness and size of the training data the random nature of the training data can affect the training process and consequently the performance of the ann and svm models for instance if the randomly generated environmental conditions for training are near the design point by chance the predicted results will likely match well with the true values to guarantee that the better performance of the machine learning approaches over traditional reliability analysis methods is not owed to coincidence three different training cases with different sizes are generated table 3 and table 4 show the cumulative probabilities of the long term extreme values corresponding to the bending moment value of 50 42 mnm and the corresponding errors along with a comparison of the failure surface for the ann based method 3 3 3 environmental conditions are not sufficient to predict the probability distribution of the long term extreme values the variation in the cdf value based on the three different random training sets is large and the agreement between the failure surfaces is poor when the number of training environmental conditions is increased to 4 4 4 the ann gives satisfactory predictions the maximum error is found to be 7 12 therefore the accuracy is not a result of a cancellation effect because the failure surfaces also match well thus only 73 environmental conditions are required including the test conditions which is fewer than that in form the performance becomes significantly better when 5 5 5 and 6 6 6 training conditions are used the performance of the trained svm model is presented in table 4 the prediction becomes satisfactory as the number of training environmental conditions increases to 5 5 5 where 3 3 3 conditions are clearly not enough although the cdf of long term extreme response is accurate based on the first two random sets of 4 4 4 conditions it should be attributed to the cancellation effect according to the poor match of the failure surface 3 7 comparison of the failure probability based on different approaches the probability of the extreme values of the bending moment below 50 42 mnm in 100 years and the number of simulations required for the full long term method form sorm ann monte carlo and svm monte carlo approaches are compared in table 5 form requires the simulation of 78 environmental conditions 65 of these conditions come from 13 iterations whereas the other 13 are performed due to backtracking to guarantee the convergence sorm requires ten more to calculate the elements in the hessian matrix in this case study the performance of the ann in predicting the probability of the long term extreme load effects of suspension bridges with floating pylons is better than those of the form and sorm from the perspective of both computational efficiency and accuracy another advantage of applying the machine learning approach is that the numerically simulated cases can also be used to predict the cdf at any specified extreme value for different response parameters the svm is not as good as the ann method because regression is performed in the ann whereas a classification algorithm is employed in the svm therefore the targets of the training cases in the ann are the long term extreme values whereas in the svm the target values are simply 1 and 1 representing failure and safety respectively therefore much more information is efficiently used in the neural networks 4 conclusions the machine learning methods of the ann based and svm based monte carlo simulations are applied to a case study of long term extreme load effects on a suspension bridge with floating pylons under combined wind and wave actions a comparison between machine learning methods and first and second order reliability methods is conducted to determine the computational accuracy and efficiency of the methods in calculation of the cumulative probabilities of the long term extreme values of the bending moment due to vertical deflections at the critical position of the girder in the case study of the suspension bridge with floating pylons which is characterized by a strongly nonlinear limit state function first and second order taylor expansions are not found sufficiently accurate the ann regression algorithm yields more accurate results than the sorm when similar number of environmental conditions are used the svm classification algorithm requires more computational effort than the ann to perform with similar accuracy therefore the ann approach is recommended based on the case study results another reason for recommending the ann method is that the long term cumulative probability of any specified short term extreme peak value can be achieved through only one training process it can be further used to calculate the characteristic long term extreme response values for uls and als design checks to achieve the same goal form sorm and svm training have to be repeated several times at different specified critical response values consequently the computational effort required will be significantly larger

21403,two degree of freedom vortex induced vibrations 2dof vivs of a circular cylinder controlled by synthetic jets in laminar flow are numerically investigated the influence of synthetic jet orientation angle and phase difference on the oscillation characteristics hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding are discussed the acting mechanisms of synthetic jets are also revealed the numerical results show that the synthetic jet orientation angle is a key factor which can determine whether the oscillation of the circular cylinder is suppressed or enhanced 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder can be suppressed when synthetic jets are issued horizontally but when controlled by synthetic jets issued vertically they are enhanced under the control of synthetic jets issued in the normal direction the suppression or enhancement of 2dof vivs are determined by the position angle furthermore synthetic jets with different orientation angles can effectively control 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder in a wide range of reduced velocities compared with the cross flow oscillation the in flow oscillation is more sensitive to the phase difference the root mean square values of lift coefficients usually increase with the increase of phase difference the vortex shedding in the wake is completely dominated by synthetic jets and the vortices are elongated and symmetric when two degree of freedom vivs of the circular cylinder are effectively suppressed by synthetic jets β 0 α 45 keywords vortex induced vibration synthetic jets two degree of freedom phase difference 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a common phenomenon in nature and engineering applications which is usually harmful to various structures hong and shah 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2020a vortex induced vibration can cause fatigue damage of many structures such as offshore structures tube arrays in heat exchangers tall buildings and so on especially when the phenomenon of lock in or resonance occurs yang et al 2020 ding et al 2018 zou et al 2019 wang et al 2020b thus extensive efforts have been made to attenuate viv and many measures have been put forward including passive control measures law and jaiman 2018 huang 2011 cicolin and assi 2017 ding et al 2020 yang et al 2019 and active control measures zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2016a though passive control measures are low cost and easier to apply in practical engineering these measures are vulnerable to flow conditions zhou et al 2011 in order to better adapt to the actual changing flow conditions active control measures whose basic mechanism is on disturbing the boundary layer separation are widely studied by the scientific community choi et al 2008 baz and ro 1991 investigated the viv suppression of a flexible circular cylinder using the velocity feedback controller in a wind tunnel and found that resonance attenuation in excess of 80 was possible korkischko and meneghini 2012 performed experiments in a recirculating water channel to study the effectiveness of moving surface boundary layer control msbc on viv suppression of a circular cylinder the results showed that after applying two small rotating wake control cylinders the wake became highly organized and narrower with a significant reduction of the maximum oscillation amplitudes silva ortega and assi 2017 further compared the viv suppression effects of a polar array of 2 4 and 8 wake control cylinders by experiment and found that the best suppression effects can be obtained using 8 control cylinders which can mitigate 99 of the peak oscillation amplitudes ma and srinil 2017 numerically studied active linear and nonlinear controls of two degree of freedom vivs of a circular cylinder using the cylinder transverse velocity feedback in uniform flows they found that the linear controller was more efficient in suppressing two degree of freedom vivs in the main lock in resonance region but the nonlinear controller performed better for very small targeted controlled amplitudes of a cylinder with a very low mass shah and hong 2018 analyzed the lateral and transverse vibrations of fuel rods during their transportation in water and developed a boundary layer control scheme that can suppress the lateral and transverse vibrations at the same time during the transportation of such fuel rods as a novel and efficient flow control technique synthetic jets have drawn attention of many scholars ziadé et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 synthetic jets are generated by an oscillating diaphragm or a piston which displaces a small volume of fluid in a cavity to generate periodic jets through an orifice sharma 2007 itsariyapinyo and sharma 2018 jeyalingam and jabbal 2018 feng and wang 2010 studied the control of flow separation around a circular cylinder by a synthetic jet positioned at the rear stagnation point and a conversion of vortex shedding from the antisymmetric mode to the symmetric mode was observed besides they also found that the strength of the synthetic jet played an important role on the vortex synchronization feng and ran 2018 further used the wavelet method to investigate the multi scale vortical structures of flow over a circular cylinder when a synthetic jet was placed at the rear stagnation point and analyzed the flow physics by decomposing the velocity field into an approximation wavelet component and 8 detail wavelet components demauro et al 2013 analyzed the influence of a single synthetic jet placed at a circular cylinder s mid span on the flow around the cylinder by experiment the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv measurements showed that the wake became narrower with synthetic jet actuation and a redirection of the downwash behind the cylinder was triggered furthermore the measurements also showed that the elongated vortex ring generated by the synthetic jet can redirect the upwash flow and entrain it back to the surface outboard of the orifice however the viv control using synthetic jets are still not sufficiently studied at present especially for two degree of freedom vortex induced vibrations wang et al 2016b numerically studied the influence of synthetic jets on wakes and one degree of freedom vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder at re 100 they found that synthetic jets issued horizontally β 0 can effectively suppress the lift oscillation on a fixed circular cylinder and one degree of freedom viv of an elastically circular cylinder however due to the larger relative flow velocity around the cylinder caused by vortex induced vibration the synthetic jets operational range in which the viv of circular cylinder can be suppressed is much narrower in addition an extended linear theory has been proposed by wang et al 2017a to predict the occurrence of different lock in phenomena the occurrence of lock in is not always helpful for viv suppression it can even strengthen vortex induced vibration wang et al 2017b in our previous work wang et al 2019b it was found that two degree of freedom vivs of a circular cylinder can be suppressed by synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction and positioned at the leeward side of the cylinder and the suppression effect can be obtained in a wide range of reduced velocities the synthetic jet orientation angle is a very important parameter and a natural choice would be keeping them perpendicular to the cylinder surface other than in the horizontal direction to further our understanding on the effect of synthetic jets on viv the influence of synthetic jet orientation angle and phase difference are studied numerically when the synthetic jets are arranged on the cylinder s leeward portion the influence of synthetic jets on the oscillation characteristics oscillating trajectories and wake structures are analyzed and the interaction mechanisms of synthetic jets are also revealed the reynolds number in this work is fixed at 150 which is in a fully laminar regime so two dimensional 2d simulations are employed carmo and meneghini 2006 2 physical model and numerical methodology 2 1 physical model the physical model of this work is depicted in fig 2 the diameter of the circular cylinder immersed in a uniform incoming flow is d and equals 0 01 m the cylinder diameter based reynolds number is 150 and the corresponding reduced velocity u equals 4 899 except for section 3 6 since the viv of a smooth circular cylinder is in the viv upper branch bao et al 2012 the oscillation amplitudes in two directions are high a y 0 6058 a x 0 033 in this work the vigorous oscillation of the cylinder will induce great relative flow speed around the cylinder resulting in shear layers with larger vorticity the mass ratio of the circular cylinder m m osc m d equals 2 0 in this work the circular cylinder is elastically supported and allowed to oscillate in both in flow and cross flow directions the stiffness of the springs in the in flow and cross flow directions are represented by k 2 and k 1 respectively in order to induce high amplitude oscillations the system damping of both in flow and cross flow directions c 2 and c 1 are set as zero furthermore the in flow to cross flow natural frequency ratio equals 1 0 in this work f nx water f ny water 1 0 a pair of synthetic jets are arranged symmetrically in the wake of the circular cylinder since the vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder can be effectively suppressed when the synthetic jets are placed in the quarter arc edge of the circular cylinder s leeward side wang et al 2016b the position angle of the synthetic jets α is varied from 15 to 75 in 15 increments in this work β is the orientation angle of synthetic jets which is the angle between the synthetic jet actuator nozzle axis and the horizontal line three synthetic jet orientation angles β are studied in this work which equal 0 horizontal direction 90 vertical direction and α normal direction respectively in the simulations the synthetic jet orientation angles are changed by adjusting the velocity direction of the velocity boundary the detailed parameters of physical model in this work can be seen in table 1 2 2 numerical methodology the governing equations for the incompressible flow over a circular cylinder are the unsteady navier stokes equations and the equations can be expressed as 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i υ 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where u i and u j are the velocity components in the x i and x j coordinate directions respectively p is the static pressure and ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively the oscillation of the cylinder is caused by the fluctuation of hydrodynamic forces due to vortex shedding the classical mass spring damper oscillator model is adopted to simulate the viv of the cylinder the equations can be expressed as 3 m o s c x c 2 x k 2 x f f l u i d x t 4 m o s c x c 1 x k 1 x f f l u i d x t where m osc denotes the oscillation mass of the circular cylinder per unit length c 1 and c 2 are the damping in two directions which equal zero in this work k 1 and k 2 denote spring stiffness f fluid x t and f fluid y t are the fluid forces per unit length acting on the cylinder in the in flow and cross flow directions respectively a suction blowing type boundary condition is used to model the perturbation of synthetic jets on the flow field and the velocities at the nozzle of the synthetic jet actuators are expressed as wang et al 2016b 5 u s j u u p e a k sin 2 π f s j t ϕ u cos β sin

three phase differences δϕ ϕ u ϕ l between upper and lower synthetic jets are studied in this work which are 0 π 2 and π the f sj represents the synthetic jet excitation frequency and the non dimensional excitation frequency f s j is expressed as 7 f s j f s j f n w a t e r where f n water denotes the natural frequency in water and is expressed as 8 f n w a t e r 1 2 π k m o s c m a the velocity amplitude of synthetic jets u peak is determined by the momentum coefficient cu and it is defined as 9 c u 2 u p e a k 2 d u 2 d where u denotes the incoming flow velocity d is the width of the nozzle on the cylinder surface and equals 1 72 of the circular cylinder perimeter d πd 72 in this work the momentum coefficient cu is constant at 2 0 which is large enough for flow control wang et al 2019b wang et al 2020c the non dimensional excitation frequency f s j is set to 5 0 because the jet flow can take away most of the energy produced by the synthetic jet and there are strong interactions between the synthetic jet flow and the shedding vortices wang et al 2016b besides our previous work wang et al 2019b wang et al 2020c has shown that the oscillations in both in flow and cross flow directions can be significantly suppressed by synthetic jets issued in the horizontal direction when f s j 3 0 the viv suppression effect of synthetic jets issued horizontally is most effective in this range of f s j and this effect becomes almost independent of f s j consequently the current study focuses on fixing the non dimensional excitation frequency to f s j 5 0 the commercial software package fluent based on the finite volume method is used for the numerical simulation in this work and the user defined function udf is adopted to account for the oscillation of the cylinder to solve the continuity and momentum equations the pressure based coupled algorithm is adopted for the discretization of space the least squares cell based scheme is applied for the gradient and the second order upwind scheme is used for the momentum the first order implicit transient scheme is adopted to model the motion of the cylinder shaaban and mohany 2018 in this work the dimensionless time step δtu d is 0 01507 which satisfies the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition in this work the fluid field and the motion of cylinder are two way coupled in one time step the momentum and continuity equations equation 1 and 2 are solved first by the fluent solver and the pressure and velocity distributions around the cylinder can be obtained then the total fluid force acting on the cylinder can be calculated by adding up the contributions of the pressure and viscous forces from local elements of the cylinder surface the lift force f fluid y t and drag force f fluid x t are the components of the total fluid force acting on the cylinder in y direction and x direction respectively after that the lift force and drag force are transferred to the user defined function udf and the ordinary differential equations 3 and 4 are solved to obtain the new position of the cylinder the information of the new position is transferred to update the pressure and velocity distributions of the fluid field by re solving the momentum and continuity equations then the next time step is initiated in order to numerically solve the ordinary differential equations 3 and 4 the fourth order runge kutta algorithm chen et al 2018a is used taking equation 4 as an example this equation is discretized and rearranged as 10 y t n 1 y t n δ t 6 m 1 2 m 2 2 m 3 m 4 11 y t n 1 y t n y

where δt denotes the time step and m 1 m 2 m 3 and m 4 are the intermediate functions 2 3 computational domain and gird generation fig 3 depicts the two dimensional computational domain in this work the streamwise length of the computational domain is 50d and the transverse length is 20d the circular cylinder is placed in the center of the computational domain the distances from the center of the circular cylinder to the top and bottom boundaries are all 10d and the distances from the center of the circular cylinder to inlet and outlet boundaries are all 25d the cylinder wall is set as no slip condition u ν 0 and the free slip boundaries u y 0 v 0 are applied on the top and bottom boundaries the inlet boundary is set as the dirichlet type boundary condition u u v 0 a neumann type boundary condition u x 0 v x 0 is applied on the outlet boundary the overset mesh is used to model the motion of the cylinder which can simplify and speed the simulation with moving parts chen et al 2019 for every case there are two grids the background and component girds the background grid is generated at first to discretize the entire computational domain while the component grid is used to deal with the cylinder and generated on the top of the background grid in order to ensure calculation accuracy and minimize the computational time a mesh independence study is done and the details can be seen in table 2 three different grid densities are studied in the test including a coarse mesh background grid component grid 148 695 7200 a medium mesh 234 080 14 400 and a fine mesh 370 920 25 600 the results of the pertinent parameters of viv a x d a y d c d mean c l rms and the corresponding percentage changes are listed and compared in table 2 it is observed that percentage changes of the pertinent parameters decrease with the increase of grid density the maximum difference between medium grid and fine grid can be observed on the root mean square values of the lift coefficient c l rms which equals 1 35 the medium grid is adopted in the simulations because the further increasement of grid resolution has negligible influence on the results the computational mesh used in ths work is shown in fig 4 2 4 validation cases the numerical methodology used in this work is verified against published results of chung 2016 and singh and mittal 2005 on two degree of freedom vivs of a circular cylinder at re 100 m 10 and ζ 0 the root mean square values of in flow displacement ratio x rms d and the time averaged values of cross flow amplitude ratio y max d in the present work are compared with the results of chung 2016 and singh and mittal 2005 in fig 5 it can be observed that the trends of the two curves in the present work match well with the corresponding curves in the literature similar to the results of chung 2016 and singh and mittal 2005 the second peak in the x rms d curve can also be captured in present work the y max d curve in the present work is very close to the results obtained by chung 2016 except for the individual points due to the adoption of different numerical solvers and methods to deal with the moving parts and their interfaces the maximal in flow and cross flow displacements of present work are all slightly lower than the published results though deviations exist the numerical method adopted in present work still can provide accurate results for prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 amplitude response the amplitude ratio in this work is defined as a d a m a x a m i n 2 d where a min and a max are the minimum displacement and maximum displacement relative to the time averaged position respectively fig 6 illustrates the in flow oscillation amplitudes of the circular cylinder under the control of synthetic jets with different position angles α the in flow amplitude ratio of the uncontrolled case the smooth circular cylinder is also plotted in fig 6 for comparison fig 6 clearly shows that when the synthetic jets with three different phase differences are issued horizontally β 0 the in flow oscillation of the cylinder is suppressed in the studied range of α as the in flow amplitude ratios are much lower compared with the uncontrolled case under the control of synthetic jets issued in vertical direction β 90 and α 15 the in flow oscillation of the cylinder is however enhanced at three phase differences that were investigated as the in flow amplitude ratios are larger than that of the uncontrolled case moreover the in flow amplitude ratios decrease with the increase of the phase difference under the control of synthetic jets issued vertically β 90 or horizontally β 0 for example for α 60 when β 90 and α 30 when β 0 under the control of synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices β α the in flow amplitude ratios increase overall with increasing α especially for the cases of δϕ π the in flow oscillation amplitudes increase monotonically with increasing α it can be observed in fig 7 when the position angle α is small the normal direction is closer to the horizontal direction but when the position angle α is large it is closer to the vertical direction thus when the cylinder is controlled by the synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices β α the in flow oscillation is mitigated when the position angle α is small and the in flow oscillation is enhanced when the position angle α is large besides for cases controlled by synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices the effect of phase differences on the in flow oscillation is also quite obvious when α 45 for 2dof vivs of a circular cylinder the cross flow oscillation is predominant which is usually one order of magnitude larger than that of in flow oscillation bao et al 2012 the cross flow amplitude ratios of the controlled cases versus the synthetic jet position angle α are shown in fig 8 compared with the in flow oscillation amplitudes the cross flow oscillation amplitudes are insensitive to the phase differences of synthetic jets when α is larger than 15 and the curves corresponding to different phase differences almost coincide under the control of synthetic jets with three different phase differences and issued in horizontal direction β 0 the cross flow oscillation is suppressed and the best suppression effects can be observed in the synthetic jet position angle range of 30 and 45 this agrees with the idea that when the synthetic jets are placed close to the mean separation points of the shear layers their influence on shear layers will be more obvious demauro et al 2013 wang et al 2016b under the control of synthetic jets issued in vertical direction β 90 the cross flow oscillation of the cylinder is enhanced in the studied position angle range especially in the position angle range of 30 and 60 influenced by synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices except for the case of δϕ π α 15 the cross flow amplitude ratios increase with the increase of position angle α this is because the normal direction gradually approaches to the vertical direction with the increase of position angle α when α equals 75 the cross flow amplitude ratios are slightly larger than that of the uncontrolled case and the cross flow oscillation is enhanced 3 2 frequency response the cross flow oscillation frequencies of the circular cylinder under synthetic jets control are depicted in fig 9 the cross flow oscillation frequencies are calculated using the fast fourier transform over the displacement histories of the cylinder in cross flow direction ding et al 2013 chen et al 2018b for the uncontrolled case the cross flow oscillation frequency is very close to the cylinder s natural frequency since the reduced velocity u 4 899 in the present study is in the synchronized region of viv ding et al 2015 wu et al 2018 for the circular cylinder under the control of synthetic jets issued horizontally β 0 the cross flow oscillation frequencies are almost equal the synthetic jet excitation frequency when the position angle α equals 30 and 45 and the phase difference δϕ equals π 2 and π this is because viv is caused by the synchronization between the oscillatory pressure from the shed vortices and the cylinder motion and vortices push the cylinder away from the side they shed ding et al 2016 when the position angle α equals 30 and 45 β 0 and δϕ π 2 and π the vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder is completely dominated by synthetic jets and the vortices are elongated and symmetric which will be discussed in detail later in section 3 5 however due to the existence of phase difference between synthetic jets small asymmetric vortex pairs are generated which can be clearly seen in fig 21 the generation and shedding of small asymmetric vortex pairs are therefore a direct result of synthetic jet forcing causing small amplitude oscillations of the cylinder at the excitation frequency of the synthetic jet when synthetic jets are issued in the horizontal direction β 0 α equals 30 and 45 and the phase difference δϕ equals zero the cross flow oscillation frequencies cannot be obtained because no periodic oscillations are observed for other cases the cross flow oscillation frequencies are all close to that of the uncontrolled case since vortex shedding for these cases is not dominated by synthetic jets and oscillations are still mainly caused by the kármán vortices 3 3 hydrodynamic forces the time averaged drag coefficients c d mean and the corresponding standard deviations δ cd are presented in fig 10 the drag coefficient is defined as c d 2 f f l u i d x t ρ u 2 d l it can be observed that the mean drag coefficients c d mean of the cylinder under the control of synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 are lower than that of the uncontrolled case this is because the application of synthetic jets issued horizontally will inject nonzero momentum to the downstream which can offset some of the drag induced by the main flow wang et al 2017a however when the orientation angle of the synthetic jet β equals 90 the vertical direction and α the normal direction of orifice the changing trends of the drag coefficients are similar and the mean drag coefficients c d mean increase monotonically with increasing the synthetic jet position angle α in addition the mean drag coefficients c d mean of the circular cylinder under synthetic jets control are larger than that of the uncontrolled case when α 45 when the synthetic jets are issued in vertical direction β 90 the influence of phase differences on the mean drag coefficient is not obvious however when the synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α and α 30 the influence of phase difference becomes significant and the mean drag coefficients increase with increasing phase difference when the synthetic jets are applied the fluctuation of the drag coefficients δ cd decreases significantly with increasing phase difference for cases controlled by synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 the standard deviations δ cd generally decrease with increasing position angle α and the standard deviations δ cd correspond to three phase differences are all lower than that of the uncontrolled case when α 60 for the cases under the control of synthetic jets issued in the vertical direction β 90 the standard deviations δ cd increase with increasing position angle α and they are all larger than that of the uncontrolled case when α 45 when the synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α most of the standard deviations δ cd are larger than that of the uncontrolled case especially when δϕ 0 and π 2 for the discussion of lift coefficients the root mean square values are adopted because the mean lift coefficients are very close to zero the root mean square values can represent the fluctuation of the lift coefficients the root mean square values of the lift coefficients of the controlled cases are shown in fig 11 when the orientation angle of the synthetic jet β equals 0 the horizontal direction and α the normal direction of orifices it can be clearly seen that the root mean square values of the lift coefficients increase with increasing the phase difference δϕ and the maximum values corresponding to each position angle α can be observed when δϕ π similar phenomenon has also been observed by wang et al 2017b on viv control using the in phase and anti phase synthetic jet pairs under the control of synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 the root mean square values of the lift coefficients are lower than that of the uncontrolled case and close to zero when α 30 and 45 for the cases of δϕ 0 when the synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α except for the case of α 15 and δϕ π the root mean square values of the lift coefficients increase with increasing position angle α also the maximal lift coefficients corresponding to three phase differences are all larger than that of a smooth circular cylinder when the synthetic jets are issued in vertical direction β 90 the root mean square values of the lift coefficients are all larger than that of the uncontrolled case in the studied position angle range only when α 45 the influence of phase difference becomes obvious when α 45 the maximum value of the lift coefficient corresponding to each position angle α is observed on the case of δϕ π the second is the case of δϕ π 2 and the third is the case of δϕ 0 3 4 cylinder orbital trajectories the oscillating trajectory and the time histories of the displacement for the smooth circular cylinder are shown in fig 12 the trajectory is horizontally symmetric and similar to a distorted figure eight shape it can be observed from the time histories of the displacement that the oscillation frequency in in flow direction is twice that in cross flow direction as expected prasanth and mittal 2009 for the circular cylinder under synthetic jets control the typical trajectories are depicted in fig 13 as can be seen in fig 13 a when the oscillation in cross flow direction is completely suppressed by synthetic jets only the in flow oscillation can be identified and the oscillation trajectory is a horizontal line similar to a smooth circular cylinder the figure eight shape trajectory fig 13 b can also be observed when the oscillation of the cylinder is enhanced by synthetic jets especially when the synthetic jets are issued in vertical direction β 90 another typical trajectory is the symmetric c shape in fig 13 c which can be observed when the oscillation in cross flow direction is enhanced or not completely suppressed by synthetic jets besides the irregular oscillation trajectories such as fig 13 d and 13 e can also be observed because the in line oscillation does not settle into a regular trajectory due to the influence of synthetic jets 3 5 wake patterns the vortex patterns of the smooth circular cylinder are depicted in fig 14 and the dash lines in subgraphs represent the neutral position of the cylinder two single vortices are shed in one oscillation circle and the 2s vortex shedding mode can be identified besides a two row vortex structure can be observed which causes the large amplitude of cross flow oscillation under the control of synthetic jets issued in the horizontal direction β 0 the vortex patterns of the circular cylinder are displayed in fig 15 two representative position angles of the synthetic jets are selected on the consideration of brevity it can be observed that the influence of phase difference on the wake pattern is not obvious which can only be identified from the small piece vortices generated by the synthetic jets when the synthetic jet position angle α equals 45 the vortices in the wake of the cylinder are elongated and symmetric accordingly the oscillations in both in flow and cross flow directions are suppressed by the synthetic jets figs 6 and 8 it should be noted that the root mean square values of the lift coefficients shown in fig 11 still increase with increasing phase difference when α 45 because of the small asymmetric vortex pairs generated by the synthetic jets when δϕ equals π 2 and π wang et al 2017b however when the synthetic jet position angle α equals 75 the wake pattern is still dominated by kármán vortices and an asymmetric 2s mode two single vortices of opposite directions are shed in one oscillation cycle can be observed but the transverse distance between vortices becomes smaller than that of a smooth circular cylinder in fig 14 also as depicted in fig 8 the cross flow oscillation is partially suppressed by synthetic jets fig 16 depicts the wake patterns of the circular cylinder under the control of synthetic jets issued in the vertical direction when the position angle α equals 60 similar to the wake pattern of the uncontrolled case shown in fig 14 a two row vortex structure can be observed in the wake of the cylinder and the wake pattern is also the 2s mode however the wake width increases due to the influence of synthetic jets and the two row vortices merge together in the far wake the widening of wake width leads to the increase of the drag force and enhancement of oscillation which is also found in the study of zhu and gao 2018 the effect of phase difference between the two synthetic jets on the wake pattern is not obvious as the wake structures are almost identical the selected synthetic jet excitation frequency may be the main reason for this which is far larger than the vortex shedding frequency the vorticity contours of the cases controlled by synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices β α are shown in fig 17 the normal direction is closer to the horizontal direction when the position angle α is small but when the position angle α is large the normal direction is closer to the vertical direction thus two representative position angles α 30 and α 75 are chosen and discussed in this section as shown in fig 17 the wake patterns for two selected cases are all in the 2s mode and is furthermore insensitive to the phase difference of synthetic jets when the position angle α equals 30 the oscillations in both in flow and cross flow directions are all suppressed by the synthetic jets and the wake patterns are similar to those for α 75 and β 0 shown in fig 15 the transverse distance between vortices becomes smaller compared to that for the uncontrolled case and therefore the wake width decreases however when the position angle α equals 75 the 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder are enhanced by the synthetic jets similar to those for α 60 and β 90 shown in fig 16 the transverse distance between the vortices increases and the two row vortex structure can be observed besides it is worth noting that the shedding vortices are also elongated and distorted due to the particularity of the synthetic jet orientation angle 3 6 the influence of reduced velocity the reduced velocity is an important parameter that may influence the control effect in addition an effective control method should work well in a wide range of reduced velocities therefore the influence of the reduced velocity is studied in this work and some representative combinations of synthetic jet position angle and orientation angle are selected similarly the reynolds number is fixed at 150 the momentum coefficient cu is a constant at 2 0 and the non dimensional excitation frequency f s j equals 5 0 in this section the oscillation amplitudes of the circular cylinder controlled by synthetic jets at different reduced velocities are shown in fig 18 under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally β 0 α 45 δϕ 0 the cross flow oscillation of the cylinder is suppressed in the range of reduced velocities studied 2 5 u 10 and the in flow oscillation can be suppressed at 4 0 u 7 0 where the in flow oscillation of the uncontrolled case is significant it should be noted that the in flow oscillation is enhanced by the in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally at u 8 0 however since both in flow and cross flow oscillation amplitudes of the uncontrolled case are quite low at u 8 0 the necessary of viv suppression is doubtful under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued vertically β 90 α 45 δϕ 0 the enhancement of both in flow and cross flow oscillations can be observed in the entire reduced velocity range especially at u 8 0 when the in phase synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction β α δϕ 0 the control effects are largely dependent on the position angle α over the range of reduced velocities studied the control effect is close to that of in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally when α 30 and the suppression of 2dof vivs can be observed however when the position angle α becomes larger α 60 the control effect is similar to that of in phase synthetic jets issued vertically in the range of reduced velocities studied besides the vorticity contours of some representative cases at different reduced velocities are displayed in fig 19 under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally the wake width decreases and the vortices in the wake tend to be symmetric especially when 3 0 u 7 0 under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued vertically the wake is widened and the vortex shedding becomes intense in the studied reduced velocity range which leads to the enhancement of viv when the in phase synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction the position angle α has a significant influence on the wake patterns when α 30 the decrease of wake width can be observed and the shedding vortices are interrupted by synthetic jets when α 60 the wake width increases and the wake patterns are similar to those of β 90 α 45 and δϕ 0 at different reduced velocities 3 7 mechanism of viv suppression by synthetic jets issued horizontally as shown in figs 6 and 8 both the in flow and cross flow oscillations are suppressed by synthetic jets issued horizontally to investigate the mechanism of viv suppression by synthetic jets some contours of the instantaneous streamlines and pressure coefficients around the circular cylinder when α 45 are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the pressure coefficient c p in this work is defined as 16 c p p p ρ u 2 2 where p is the reference pressure of the inlet it is worth remembering that the synthetic jet is formed by periodic blowing and suction of fluids and without net mass injection smith and glezer 1998 as can be seen in fig 20 in the blowing phase momentum is injected into the wake region by the synthetic jets and the boundary layer attached to the cylinder is able to overcome the adverse pressure gradient caused by viscosity thus the boundary layer separation is delayed and the wake region is compressed to the near wake region of the cylinder in the suction cycle the fluid with low speed in the boundary layer is sucked away and the adverse pressure gradient also decreases so the boundary layer separation is also delayed besides the instantaneous streamlines and pressure coefficients around the cylinder are symmetric to the horizontal centerline when the phase difference of the synthetic jets is zero δϕ 0 so the lift coefficient shown in fig 11 is almost zero when α 45 and δϕ 0 however when the phase difference of synthetic jets is non zero for example δϕ π though the boundary layer separation can be delayed in both blowing and suction phases of each cycle the pressure coefficients around the cylinder shown in fig 21 become asymmetric therefore the lift force shown in fig 11 increases with increasing phase difference when the synthetic jets are issued in the horizontal direction though they are still all lower than that of the uncontrolled case 3 8 mechanism of viv enhancement by synthetic jets issued vertically under the control of synthetic jets issued vertically β 90 it can be known from the discussion above that 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder are enhanced in order to reveal the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon a sequence of instantaneous pressure and vorticity contours around the cylinder controlled by synthetic jets with α 60 and δϕ π cylinder 2 are shown and compared with those of the smooth circular cylinder cylinder 1 in fig 22 and some details of the vortex near the synthetic jet place are drawn as well for the two cylinders with and without control it can be seen that the vortices on the lower side vortex v1 0 and vortex v2 0 are shedding from the cylinders and the vortices on the upper side vortex v1 1 and vortex v2 1 are growing mature from instant a to instant d at instant a the two cylinders are all in their equilibrium positions and moving upwards for cylinder 2 the vortex v2 1 is promoted to grow in both size and strength due to the synthetic jet on the upper side synthetic jet 1 and also gaining vorticity from the synthetic jet 1 directly two significant low pressure zones can be seen on the upper side of cylinder 2 the former one is due to the vortex generation by synthetic jet 1 and the latter one is caused by the growth of vortex v2 1 besides a significant low pressure zone with small size can also be identified on the lower side of cylinder 2 due to vortex generation by the synthetic jet on the lower side synthetic jet 2 for cylinder 1 the growth of vortex v1 1 is less intense and the pressure coefficients in the upper and back sides are larger so the lift coefficient and drag coefficient of cylinder 2 are larger than those of cylinder 1 at instant a at instant b cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are half way towards their highest position and moving upwards for cylinder 2 vortex v2 1 moves down relative to cylinder 2 and still gains vorticity from synthetic jet 1 directly a significant low pressure zone in the upper side can be identified so the lift coefficient and drag coefficient of cylinder 2 at instant b are significantly larger than those of cylinder 1 at instant c cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are on their highest position respectively for cylinder 1 vortex v1 2 in the lower side is formed and a large low pressure zone can be seen in the lower side for cylinder 2 the appearance of vortex v2 2 is delayed by the vortex with opposite rotational direction generated by synthetic jet 2 and a significant low pressure zone with small size can be observed at instant c the lift coefficient of cylinder 2 is larger than that of cylinder 1 but the drag coefficients are almost identical at instant d cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are on the half way towards their equilibrium positions and moving towards for cylinder 2 the vortex v2 2 on the lower side is formed and grows in both size and strength and v2 2 is also gaining vorticity from the synthetic jet 2 directly accordingly two significant low pressure zones can be seen on the lower side and wake of cylinder 2 both the lift and drag coefficients of cylinder 2 are larger than those of cylinder 1 from instant e to h the vortices vortex v1 1 and vortex v2 1 on the upper side are shed from the cylinders and the vortices vortex v1 2 and vortex v2 2 on the lower side are growing mature similarly the lift coefficients of cylinder 2 are all larger than those of cylinder 1 and most of the drag coefficients of cylinder 2 except at instant h are larger than those of cylinder 1 it can be found that the synthetic jet on the upper side can promote the growth of vortex on the upper side when the cylinder moves upwards and vice versa thus when the synthetic jets with three different phase differences are issued vertically two degree of freedom vivs of the circular cylinder are all enhanced 3 9 the engineering approach adding synthetic jets on the circular cylinder is novel and interesting and a conceptual design of such a device is shown in fig 23 the synthetic jets are generated by the sinusoidal and time harmonic movement of two pistons at two ends of the circular cylinder the pistons are connected to the voice coil motors via the connecting rods and the motion of the pistons is driven by the voice coil motors at two ends which is a type of non commutated dc linear actuator the momentum coefficient and excitation frequency of synthetic jets can be adjusted by changing the waveform and frequency of the input voltage to voice coil motors as for the synthetic jet orientation angle it can be adjusted by changing the layout of slots on the circular cylinder in practice 4 conclusions in this work the effect of the synthetic jet orientation angle and phase difference on two degree of freedom vivs control of a circular cylinder at re 150 are numerically investigated the oscillation characters hydrodynamic forces and wake patterns are evaluated and discussed based on the discussion above the following conclusions can be summarized 1 synthetic jets with different orientation angles and phase differences can effectively control 2dof vivs of a circular cylinder in a wide range of reduced velocities and the synthetic jet orientation angle can determine whether the oscillation is suppressed or enhanced under the control of synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 both in flow and cross flow oscillations can be suppressed however 2dof vivs are enhanced when the orientation angle of synthetic jets β equals 90 when synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α the control effects depend on the position angle α which is still ascribed to the influence of synthetic jet orientation angle 2 the phase difference between synthetic jets has significant influence on the standard deviations of drag coefficients and the root mean square values of lift coefficients the standard deviations of drag coefficients decrease significantly with the increase of phase difference and the root mean square values of lift coefficients usually increase with increasing the phase difference in addition the in flow oscillation is more sensitive to the phase difference than the cross flow oscillation 3 the cross flow oscillation frequencies of the controlled cases are close to that of the smooth circular cylinder when the vortex shedding is not completely dominated by synthetic jets however when vortex shedding is completely dominated by synthetic jets β 0 α 30 and 45 the cross flow oscillation frequencies may be unobtainable δϕ 0 or locked to the synthetic jet excitation frequency δϕ π 2 and π 4 the synthetic jets issued horizontally can delay the boundary layer separation in both blowing and suction phases the vortices in the wake of the cylinder are elongated and tend to be symmetric which leads to the suppression of viv when issued vertically the synthetic jets can enhance the viv of the cylinder by promoting the growth of vortex on the upper lower side when the cylinder is moving upwards downwards credit authorship contribution statement haibo wang conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

21403,two degree of freedom vortex induced vibrations 2dof vivs of a circular cylinder controlled by synthetic jets in laminar flow are numerically investigated the influence of synthetic jet orientation angle and phase difference on the oscillation characteristics hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding are discussed the acting mechanisms of synthetic jets are also revealed the numerical results show that the synthetic jet orientation angle is a key factor which can determine whether the oscillation of the circular cylinder is suppressed or enhanced 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder can be suppressed when synthetic jets are issued horizontally but when controlled by synthetic jets issued vertically they are enhanced under the control of synthetic jets issued in the normal direction the suppression or enhancement of 2dof vivs are determined by the position angle furthermore synthetic jets with different orientation angles can effectively control 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder in a wide range of reduced velocities compared with the cross flow oscillation the in flow oscillation is more sensitive to the phase difference the root mean square values of lift coefficients usually increase with the increase of phase difference the vortex shedding in the wake is completely dominated by synthetic jets and the vortices are elongated and symmetric when two degree of freedom vivs of the circular cylinder are effectively suppressed by synthetic jets β 0 α 45 keywords vortex induced vibration synthetic jets two degree of freedom phase difference 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a common phenomenon in nature and engineering applications which is usually harmful to various structures hong and shah 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2020a vortex induced vibration can cause fatigue damage of many structures such as offshore structures tube arrays in heat exchangers tall buildings and so on especially when the phenomenon of lock in or resonance occurs yang et al 2020 ding et al 2018 zou et al 2019 wang et al 2020b thus extensive efforts have been made to attenuate viv and many measures have been put forward including passive control measures law and jaiman 2018 huang 2011 cicolin and assi 2017 ding et al 2020 yang et al 2019 and active control measures zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2016a though passive control measures are low cost and easier to apply in practical engineering these measures are vulnerable to flow conditions zhou et al 2011 in order to better adapt to the actual changing flow conditions active control measures whose basic mechanism is on disturbing the boundary layer separation are widely studied by the scientific community choi et al 2008 baz and ro 1991 investigated the viv suppression of a flexible circular cylinder using the velocity feedback controller in a wind tunnel and found that resonance attenuation in excess of 80 was possible korkischko and meneghini 2012 performed experiments in a recirculating water channel to study the effectiveness of moving surface boundary layer control msbc on viv suppression of a circular cylinder the results showed that after applying two small rotating wake control cylinders the wake became highly organized and narrower with a significant reduction of the maximum oscillation amplitudes silva ortega and assi 2017 further compared the viv suppression effects of a polar array of 2 4 and 8 wake control cylinders by experiment and found that the best suppression effects can be obtained using 8 control cylinders which can mitigate 99 of the peak oscillation amplitudes ma and srinil 2017 numerically studied active linear and nonlinear controls of two degree of freedom vivs of a circular cylinder using the cylinder transverse velocity feedback in uniform flows they found that the linear controller was more efficient in suppressing two degree of freedom vivs in the main lock in resonance region but the nonlinear controller performed better for very small targeted controlled amplitudes of a cylinder with a very low mass shah and hong 2018 analyzed the lateral and transverse vibrations of fuel rods during their transportation in water and developed a boundary layer control scheme that can suppress the lateral and transverse vibrations at the same time during the transportation of such fuel rods as a novel and efficient flow control technique synthetic jets have drawn attention of many scholars ziadé et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 synthetic jets are generated by an oscillating diaphragm or a piston which displaces a small volume of fluid in a cavity to generate periodic jets through an orifice sharma 2007 itsariyapinyo and sharma 2018 jeyalingam and jabbal 2018 feng and wang 2010 studied the control of flow separation around a circular cylinder by a synthetic jet positioned at the rear stagnation point and a conversion of vortex shedding from the antisymmetric mode to the symmetric mode was observed besides they also found that the strength of the synthetic jet played an important role on the vortex synchronization feng and ran 2018 further used the wavelet method to investigate the multi scale vortical structures of flow over a circular cylinder when a synthetic jet was placed at the rear stagnation point and analyzed the flow physics by decomposing the velocity field into an approximation wavelet component and 8 detail wavelet components demauro et al 2013 analyzed the influence of a single synthetic jet placed at a circular cylinder s mid span on the flow around the cylinder by experiment the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv measurements showed that the wake became narrower with synthetic jet actuation and a redirection of the downwash behind the cylinder was triggered furthermore the measurements also showed that the elongated vortex ring generated by the synthetic jet can redirect the upwash flow and entrain it back to the surface outboard of the orifice however the viv control using synthetic jets are still not sufficiently studied at present especially for two degree of freedom vortex induced vibrations wang et al 2016b numerically studied the influence of synthetic jets on wakes and one degree of freedom vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder at re 100 they found that synthetic jets issued horizontally β 0 can effectively suppress the lift oscillation on a fixed circular cylinder and one degree of freedom viv of an elastically circular cylinder however due to the larger relative flow velocity around the cylinder caused by vortex induced vibration the synthetic jets operational range in which the viv of circular cylinder can be suppressed is much narrower in addition an extended linear theory has been proposed by wang et al 2017a to predict the occurrence of different lock in phenomena the occurrence of lock in is not always helpful for viv suppression it can even strengthen vortex induced vibration wang et al 2017b in our previous work wang et al 2019b it was found that two degree of freedom vivs of a circular cylinder can be suppressed by synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction and positioned at the leeward side of the cylinder and the suppression effect can be obtained in a wide range of reduced velocities the synthetic jet orientation angle is a very important parameter and a natural choice would be keeping them perpendicular to the cylinder surface other than in the horizontal direction to further our understanding on the effect of synthetic jets on viv the influence of synthetic jet orientation angle and phase difference are studied numerically when the synthetic jets are arranged on the cylinder s leeward portion the influence of synthetic jets on the oscillation characteristics oscillating trajectories and wake structures are analyzed and the interaction mechanisms of synthetic jets are also revealed the reynolds number in this work is fixed at 150 which is in a fully laminar regime so two dimensional 2d simulations are employed carmo and meneghini 2006 2 physical model and numerical methodology 2 1 physical model the physical model of this work is depicted in fig 2 the diameter of the circular cylinder immersed in a uniform incoming flow is d and equals 0 01 m the cylinder diameter based reynolds number is 150 and the corresponding reduced velocity u equals 4 899 except for section 3 6 since the viv of a smooth circular cylinder is in the viv upper branch bao et al 2012 the oscillation amplitudes in two directions are high a y 0 6058 a x 0 033 in this work the vigorous oscillation of the cylinder will induce great relative flow speed around the cylinder resulting in shear layers with larger vorticity the mass ratio of the circular cylinder m m osc m d equals 2 0 in this work the circular cylinder is elastically supported and allowed to oscillate in both in flow and cross flow directions the stiffness of the springs in the in flow and cross flow directions are represented by k 2 and k 1 respectively in order to induce high amplitude oscillations the system damping of both in flow and cross flow directions c 2 and c 1 are set as zero furthermore the in flow to cross flow natural frequency ratio equals 1 0 in this work f nx water f ny water 1 0 a pair of synthetic jets are arranged symmetrically in the wake of the circular cylinder since the vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder can be effectively suppressed when the synthetic jets are placed in the quarter arc edge of the circular cylinder s leeward side wang et al 2016b the position angle of the synthetic jets α is varied from 15 to 75 in 15 increments in this work β is the orientation angle of synthetic jets which is the angle between the synthetic jet actuator nozzle axis and the horizontal line three synthetic jet orientation angles β are studied in this work which equal 0 horizontal direction 90 vertical direction and α normal direction respectively in the simulations the synthetic jet orientation angles are changed by adjusting the velocity direction of the velocity boundary the detailed parameters of physical model in this work can be seen in table 1 2 2 numerical methodology the governing equations for the incompressible flow over a circular cylinder are the unsteady navier stokes equations and the equations can be expressed as 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i υ 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where u i and u j are the velocity components in the x i and x j coordinate directions respectively p is the static pressure and ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively the oscillation of the cylinder is caused by the fluctuation of hydrodynamic forces due to vortex shedding the classical mass spring damper oscillator model is adopted to simulate the viv of the cylinder the equations can be expressed as 3 m o s c x c 2 x k 2 x f f l u i d x t 4 m o s c x c 1 x k 1 x f f l u i d x t where m osc denotes the oscillation mass of the circular cylinder per unit length c 1 and c 2 are the damping in two directions which equal zero in this work k 1 and k 2 denote spring stiffness f fluid x t and f fluid y t are the fluid forces per unit length acting on the cylinder in the in flow and cross flow directions respectively a suction blowing type boundary condition is used to model the perturbation of synthetic jets on the flow field and the velocities at the nozzle of the synthetic jet actuators are expressed as wang et al 2016b 5 u s j u u p e a k sin 2 π f s j t ϕ u cos β sin β 6 u s j l u p e a k sin 2 π f s j t ϕ l cos β sin β where u and l denote the synthetic jets in the upper side and lower side respectively u peak denotes the velocity amplitude of synthetic jets three phase differences δϕ ϕ u ϕ l between upper and lower synthetic jets are studied in this work which are 0 π 2 and π the f sj represents the synthetic jet excitation frequency and the non dimensional excitation frequency f s j is expressed as 7 f s j f s j f n w a t e r where f n water denotes the natural frequency in water and is expressed as 8 f n w a t e r 1 2 π k m o s c m a the velocity amplitude of synthetic jets u peak is determined by the momentum coefficient cu and it is defined as 9 c u 2 u p e a k 2 d u 2 d where u denotes the incoming flow velocity d is the width of the nozzle on the cylinder surface and equals 1 72 of the circular cylinder perimeter d πd 72 in this work the momentum coefficient cu is constant at 2 0 which is large enough for flow control wang et al 2019b wang et al 2020c the non dimensional excitation frequency f s j is set to 5 0 because the jet flow can take away most of the energy produced by the synthetic jet and there are strong interactions between the synthetic jet flow and the shedding vortices wang et al 2016b besides our previous work wang et al 2019b wang et al 2020c has shown that the oscillations in both in flow and cross flow directions can be significantly suppressed by synthetic jets issued in the horizontal direction when f s j 3 0 the viv suppression effect of synthetic jets issued horizontally is most effective in this range of f s j and this effect becomes almost independent of f s j consequently the current study focuses on fixing the non dimensional excitation frequency to f s j 5 0 the commercial software package fluent based on the finite volume method is used for the numerical simulation in this work and the user defined function udf is adopted to account for the oscillation of the cylinder to solve the continuity and momentum equations the pressure based coupled algorithm is adopted for the discretization of space the least squares cell based scheme is applied for the gradient and the second order upwind scheme is used for the momentum the first order implicit transient scheme is adopted to model the motion of the cylinder shaaban and mohany 2018 in this work the dimensionless time step δtu d is 0 01507 which satisfies the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition in this work the fluid field and the motion of cylinder are two way coupled in one time step the momentum and continuity equations equation 1 and 2 are solved first by the fluent solver and the pressure and velocity distributions around the cylinder can be obtained then the total fluid force acting on the cylinder can be calculated by adding up the contributions of the pressure and viscous forces from local elements of the cylinder surface the lift force f fluid y t and drag force f fluid x t are the components of the total fluid force acting on the cylinder in y direction and x direction respectively after that the lift force and drag force are transferred to the user defined function udf and the ordinary differential equations 3 and 4 are solved to obtain the new position of the cylinder the information of the new position is transferred to update the pressure and velocity distributions of the fluid field by re solving the momentum and continuity equations then the next time step is initiated in order to numerically solve the ordinary differential equations 3 and 4 the fourth order runge kutta algorithm chen et al 2018a is used taking equation 4 as an example this equation is discretized and rearranged as 10 y t n 1 y t n δ t 6 m 1 2 m 2 2 m 3 m 4 11 y t n 1 y t n y

the streamwise length of the computational domain is 50d and the transverse length is 20d the circular cylinder is placed in the center of the computational domain the distances from the center of the circular cylinder to the top and bottom boundaries are all 10d and the distances from the center of the circular cylinder to inlet and outlet boundaries are all 25d the cylinder wall is set as no slip condition u ν 0 and the free slip boundaries u y 0 v 0 are applied on the top and bottom boundaries the inlet boundary is set as the dirichlet type boundary condition u u v 0 a neumann type boundary condition u x 0 v x 0 is applied on the outlet boundary the overset mesh is used to model the motion of the cylinder which can simplify and speed the simulation with moving parts chen et al 2019 for every case there are two grids the background and component girds the background grid is generated at first to discretize the entire computational domain while the component grid is used to deal with the cylinder and generated on the top of the background grid in order to ensure calculation accuracy and minimize the computational time a mesh independence study is done and the details can be seen in table 2 three different grid densities are studied in the test including a coarse mesh background grid component grid 148 695 7200 a medium mesh 234 080 14 400 and a fine mesh 370 920 25 600 the results of the pertinent parameters of viv a x d a y d c d mean c l rms and the corresponding percentage changes are listed and compared in table 2 it is observed that percentage changes of the pertinent parameters decrease with the increase of grid density the maximum difference between medium grid and fine grid can be observed on the root mean square values of the lift coefficient c l rms which equals 1 35 the medium grid is adopted in the simulations because the further increasement of grid resolution has negligible influence on the results the computational mesh used in ths work is shown in fig 4 2 4 validation cases the numerical methodology used in this work is verified against published results of chung 2016 and singh and mittal 2005 on two degree of freedom vivs of a circular cylinder at re 100 m 10 and ζ 0 the root mean square values of in flow displacement ratio x rms d and the time averaged values of cross flow amplitude ratio y max d in the present work are compared with the results of chung 2016 and singh and mittal 2005 in fig 5 it can be observed that the trends of the two curves in the present work match well with the corresponding curves in the literature similar to the results of chung 2016 and singh and mittal 2005 the second peak in the x rms d curve can also be captured in present work the y max d curve in the present work is very close to the results obtained by chung 2016 except for the individual points due to the adoption of different numerical solvers and methods to deal with the moving parts and their interfaces the maximal in flow and cross flow displacements of present work are all slightly lower than the published results though deviations exist the numerical method adopted in present work still can provide accurate results for prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 amplitude response the amplitude ratio in this work is defined as a d a m a x a m i n 2 d where a min and a max are the minimum displacement and maximum displacement relative to the time averaged position respectively fig 6 illustrates the in flow oscillation amplitudes of the circular cylinder under the control of synthetic jets with different position angles α the in flow amplitude ratio of the uncontrolled case the smooth circular cylinder is also plotted in fig 6 for comparison fig 6 clearly shows that when the synthetic jets with three different phase differences are issued horizontally β 0 the in flow oscillation of the cylinder is suppressed in the studied range of α as the in flow amplitude ratios are much lower compared with the uncontrolled case under the control of synthetic jets issued in vertical direction β 90 and α 15 the in flow oscillation of the cylinder is however enhanced at three phase differences that were investigated as the in flow amplitude ratios are larger than that of the uncontrolled case moreover the in flow amplitude ratios decrease with the increase of the phase difference under the control of synthetic jets issued vertically β 90 or horizontally β 0 for example for α 60 when β 90 and α 30 when β 0 under the control of synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices β α the in flow amplitude ratios increase overall with increasing α especially for the cases of δϕ π the in flow oscillation amplitudes increase monotonically with increasing α it can be observed in fig 7 when the position angle α is small the normal direction is closer to the horizontal direction but when the position angle α is large it is closer to the vertical direction thus when the cylinder is controlled by the synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices β α the in flow oscillation is mitigated when the position angle α is small and the in flow oscillation is enhanced when the position angle α is large besides for cases controlled by synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices the effect of phase differences on the in flow oscillation is also quite obvious when α 45 for 2dof vivs of a circular cylinder the cross flow oscillation is predominant which is usually one order of magnitude larger than that of in flow oscillation bao et al 2012 the cross flow amplitude ratios of the controlled cases versus the synthetic jet position angle α are shown in fig 8 compared with the in flow oscillation amplitudes the cross flow oscillation amplitudes are insensitive to the phase differences of synthetic jets when α is larger than 15 and the curves corresponding to different phase differences almost coincide under the control of synthetic jets with three different phase differences and issued in horizontal direction β 0 the cross flow oscillation is suppressed and the best suppression effects can be observed in the synthetic jet position angle range of 30 and 45 this agrees with the idea that when the synthetic jets are placed close to the mean separation points of the shear layers their influence on shear layers will be more obvious demauro et al 2013 wang et al 2016b under the control of synthetic jets issued in vertical direction β 90 the cross flow oscillation of the cylinder is enhanced in the studied position angle range especially in the position angle range of 30 and 60 influenced by synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices except for the case of δϕ π α 15 the cross flow amplitude ratios increase with the increase of position angle α this is because the normal direction gradually approaches to the vertical direction with the increase of position angle α when α equals 75 the cross flow amplitude ratios are slightly larger than that of the uncontrolled case and the cross flow oscillation is enhanced 3 2 frequency response the cross flow oscillation frequencies of the circular cylinder under synthetic jets control are depicted in fig 9 the cross flow oscillation frequencies are calculated using the fast fourier transform over the displacement histories of the cylinder in cross flow direction ding et al 2013 chen et al 2018b for the uncontrolled case the cross flow oscillation frequency is very close to the cylinder s natural frequency since the reduced velocity u 4 899 in the present study is in the synchronized region of viv ding et al 2015 wu et al 2018 for the circular cylinder under the control of synthetic jets issued horizontally β 0 the cross flow oscillation frequencies are almost equal the synthetic jet excitation frequency when the position angle α equals 30 and 45 and the phase difference δϕ equals π 2 and π this is because viv is caused by the synchronization between the oscillatory pressure from the shed vortices and the cylinder motion and vortices push the cylinder away from the side they shed ding et al 2016 when the position angle α equals 30 and 45 β 0 and δϕ π 2 and π the vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder is completely dominated by synthetic jets and the vortices are elongated and symmetric which will be discussed in detail later in section 3 5 however due to the existence of phase difference between synthetic jets small asymmetric vortex pairs are generated which can be clearly seen in fig 21 the generation and shedding of small asymmetric vortex pairs are therefore a direct result of synthetic jet forcing causing small amplitude oscillations of the cylinder at the excitation frequency of the synthetic jet when synthetic jets are issued in the horizontal direction β 0 α equals 30 and 45 and the phase difference δϕ equals zero the cross flow oscillation frequencies cannot be obtained because no periodic oscillations are observed for other cases the cross flow oscillation frequencies are all close to that of the uncontrolled case since vortex shedding for these cases is not dominated by synthetic jets and oscillations are still mainly caused by the kármán vortices 3 3 hydrodynamic forces the time averaged drag coefficients c d mean and the corresponding standard deviations δ cd are presented in fig 10 the drag coefficient is defined as c d 2 f f l u i d x t ρ u 2 d l it can be observed that the mean drag coefficients c d mean of the cylinder under the control of synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 are lower than that of the uncontrolled case this is because the application of synthetic jets issued horizontally will inject nonzero momentum to the downstream which can offset some of the drag induced by the main flow wang et al 2017a however when the orientation angle of the synthetic jet β equals 90 the vertical direction and α the normal direction of orifice the changing trends of the drag coefficients are similar and the mean drag coefficients c d mean increase monotonically with increasing the synthetic jet position angle α in addition the mean drag coefficients c d mean of the circular cylinder under synthetic jets control are larger than that of the uncontrolled case when α 45 when the synthetic jets are issued in vertical direction β 90 the influence of phase differences on the mean drag coefficient is not obvious however when the synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α and α 30 the influence of phase difference becomes significant and the mean drag coefficients increase with increasing phase difference when the synthetic jets are applied the fluctuation of the drag coefficients δ cd decreases significantly with increasing phase difference for cases controlled by synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 the standard deviations δ cd generally decrease with increasing position angle α and the standard deviations δ cd correspond to three phase differences are all lower than that of the uncontrolled case when α 60 for the cases under the control of synthetic jets issued in the vertical direction β 90 the standard deviations δ cd increase with increasing position angle α and they are all larger than that of the uncontrolled case when α 45 when the synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α most of the standard deviations δ cd are larger than that of the uncontrolled case especially when δϕ 0 and π 2 for the discussion of lift coefficients the root mean square values are adopted because the mean lift coefficients are very close to zero the root mean square values can represent the fluctuation of the lift coefficients the root mean square values of the lift coefficients of the controlled cases are shown in fig 11 when the orientation angle of the synthetic jet β equals 0 the horizontal direction and α the normal direction of orifices it can be clearly seen that the root mean square values of the lift coefficients increase with increasing the phase difference δϕ and the maximum values corresponding to each position angle α can be observed when δϕ π similar phenomenon has also been observed by wang et al 2017b on viv control using the in phase and anti phase synthetic jet pairs under the control of synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 the root mean square values of the lift coefficients are lower than that of the uncontrolled case and close to zero when α 30 and 45 for the cases of δϕ 0 when the synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α except for the case of α 15 and δϕ π the root mean square values of the lift coefficients increase with increasing position angle α also the maximal lift coefficients corresponding to three phase differences are all larger than that of a smooth circular cylinder when the synthetic jets are issued in vertical direction β 90 the root mean square values of the lift coefficients are all larger than that of the uncontrolled case in the studied position angle range only when α 45 the influence of phase difference becomes obvious when α 45 the maximum value of the lift coefficient corresponding to each position angle α is observed on the case of δϕ π the second is the case of δϕ π 2 and the third is the case of δϕ 0 3 4 cylinder orbital trajectories the oscillating trajectory and the time histories of the displacement for the smooth circular cylinder are shown in fig 12 the trajectory is horizontally symmetric and similar to a distorted figure eight shape it can be observed from the time histories of the displacement that the oscillation frequency in in flow direction is twice that in cross flow direction as expected prasanth and mittal 2009 for the circular cylinder under synthetic jets control the typical trajectories are depicted in fig 13 as can be seen in fig 13 a when the oscillation in cross flow direction is completely suppressed by synthetic jets only the in flow oscillation can be identified and the oscillation trajectory is a horizontal line similar to a smooth circular cylinder the figure eight shape trajectory fig 13 b can also be observed when the oscillation of the cylinder is enhanced by synthetic jets especially when the synthetic jets are issued in vertical direction β 90 another typical trajectory is the symmetric c shape in fig 13 c which can be observed when the oscillation in cross flow direction is enhanced or not completely suppressed by synthetic jets besides the irregular oscillation trajectories such as fig 13 d and 13 e can also be observed because the in line oscillation does not settle into a regular trajectory due to the influence of synthetic jets 3 5 wake patterns the vortex patterns of the smooth circular cylinder are depicted in fig 14 and the dash lines in subgraphs represent the neutral position of the cylinder two single vortices are shed in one oscillation circle and the 2s vortex shedding mode can be identified besides a two row vortex structure can be observed which causes the large amplitude of cross flow oscillation under the control of synthetic jets issued in the horizontal direction β 0 the vortex patterns of the circular cylinder are displayed in fig 15 two representative position angles of the synthetic jets are selected on the consideration of brevity it can be observed that the influence of phase difference on the wake pattern is not obvious which can only be identified from the small piece vortices generated by the synthetic jets when the synthetic jet position angle α equals 45 the vortices in the wake of the cylinder are elongated and symmetric accordingly the oscillations in both in flow and cross flow directions are suppressed by the synthetic jets figs 6 and 8 it should be noted that the root mean square values of the lift coefficients shown in fig 11 still increase with increasing phase difference when α 45 because of the small asymmetric vortex pairs generated by the synthetic jets when δϕ equals π 2 and π wang et al 2017b however when the synthetic jet position angle α equals 75 the wake pattern is still dominated by kármán vortices and an asymmetric 2s mode two single vortices of opposite directions are shed in one oscillation cycle can be observed but the transverse distance between vortices becomes smaller than that of a smooth circular cylinder in fig 14 also as depicted in fig 8 the cross flow oscillation is partially suppressed by synthetic jets fig 16 depicts the wake patterns of the circular cylinder under the control of synthetic jets issued in the vertical direction when the position angle α equals 60 similar to the wake pattern of the uncontrolled case shown in fig 14 a two row vortex structure can be observed in the wake of the cylinder and the wake pattern is also the 2s mode however the wake width increases due to the influence of synthetic jets and the two row vortices merge together in the far wake the widening of wake width leads to the increase of the drag force and enhancement of oscillation which is also found in the study of zhu and gao 2018 the effect of phase difference between the two synthetic jets on the wake pattern is not obvious as the wake structures are almost identical the selected synthetic jet excitation frequency may be the main reason for this which is far larger than the vortex shedding frequency the vorticity contours of the cases controlled by synthetic jets issued in the normal direction of orifices β α are shown in fig 17 the normal direction is closer to the horizontal direction when the position angle α is small but when the position angle α is large the normal direction is closer to the vertical direction thus two representative position angles α 30 and α 75 are chosen and discussed in this section as shown in fig 17 the wake patterns for two selected cases are all in the 2s mode and is furthermore insensitive to the phase difference of synthetic jets when the position angle α equals 30 the oscillations in both in flow and cross flow directions are all suppressed by the synthetic jets and the wake patterns are similar to those for α 75 and β 0 shown in fig 15 the transverse distance between vortices becomes smaller compared to that for the uncontrolled case and therefore the wake width decreases however when the position angle α equals 75 the 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder are enhanced by the synthetic jets similar to those for α 60 and β 90 shown in fig 16 the transverse distance between the vortices increases and the two row vortex structure can be observed besides it is worth noting that the shedding vortices are also elongated and distorted due to the particularity of the synthetic jet orientation angle 3 6 the influence of reduced velocity the reduced velocity is an important parameter that may influence the control effect in addition an effective control method should work well in a wide range of reduced velocities therefore the influence of the reduced velocity is studied in this work and some representative combinations of synthetic jet position angle and orientation angle are selected similarly the reynolds number is fixed at 150 the momentum coefficient cu is a constant at 2 0 and the non dimensional excitation frequency f s j equals 5 0 in this section the oscillation amplitudes of the circular cylinder controlled by synthetic jets at different reduced velocities are shown in fig 18 under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally β 0 α 45 δϕ 0 the cross flow oscillation of the cylinder is suppressed in the range of reduced velocities studied 2 5 u 10 and the in flow oscillation can be suppressed at 4 0 u 7 0 where the in flow oscillation of the uncontrolled case is significant it should be noted that the in flow oscillation is enhanced by the in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally at u 8 0 however since both in flow and cross flow oscillation amplitudes of the uncontrolled case are quite low at u 8 0 the necessary of viv suppression is doubtful under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued vertically β 90 α 45 δϕ 0 the enhancement of both in flow and cross flow oscillations can be observed in the entire reduced velocity range especially at u 8 0 when the in phase synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction β α δϕ 0 the control effects are largely dependent on the position angle α over the range of reduced velocities studied the control effect is close to that of in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally when α 30 and the suppression of 2dof vivs can be observed however when the position angle α becomes larger α 60 the control effect is similar to that of in phase synthetic jets issued vertically in the range of reduced velocities studied besides the vorticity contours of some representative cases at different reduced velocities are displayed in fig 19 under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued horizontally the wake width decreases and the vortices in the wake tend to be symmetric especially when 3 0 u 7 0 under the control of in phase synthetic jets issued vertically the wake is widened and the vortex shedding becomes intense in the studied reduced velocity range which leads to the enhancement of viv when the in phase synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction the position angle α has a significant influence on the wake patterns when α 30 the decrease of wake width can be observed and the shedding vortices are interrupted by synthetic jets when α 60 the wake width increases and the wake patterns are similar to those of β 90 α 45 and δϕ 0 at different reduced velocities 3 7 mechanism of viv suppression by synthetic jets issued horizontally as shown in figs 6 and 8 both the in flow and cross flow oscillations are suppressed by synthetic jets issued horizontally to investigate the mechanism of viv suppression by synthetic jets some contours of the instantaneous streamlines and pressure coefficients around the circular cylinder when α 45 are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the pressure coefficient c p in this work is defined as 16 c p p p ρ u 2 2 where p is the reference pressure of the inlet it is worth remembering that the synthetic jet is formed by periodic blowing and suction of fluids and without net mass injection smith and glezer 1998 as can be seen in fig 20 in the blowing phase momentum is injected into the wake region by the synthetic jets and the boundary layer attached to the cylinder is able to overcome the adverse pressure gradient caused by viscosity thus the boundary layer separation is delayed and the wake region is compressed to the near wake region of the cylinder in the suction cycle the fluid with low speed in the boundary layer is sucked away and the adverse pressure gradient also decreases so the boundary layer separation is also delayed besides the instantaneous streamlines and pressure coefficients around the cylinder are symmetric to the horizontal centerline when the phase difference of the synthetic jets is zero δϕ 0 so the lift coefficient shown in fig 11 is almost zero when α 45 and δϕ 0 however when the phase difference of synthetic jets is non zero for example δϕ π though the boundary layer separation can be delayed in both blowing and suction phases of each cycle the pressure coefficients around the cylinder shown in fig 21 become asymmetric therefore the lift force shown in fig 11 increases with increasing phase difference when the synthetic jets are issued in the horizontal direction though they are still all lower than that of the uncontrolled case 3 8 mechanism of viv enhancement by synthetic jets issued vertically under the control of synthetic jets issued vertically β 90 it can be known from the discussion above that 2dof vivs of the circular cylinder are enhanced in order to reveal the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon a sequence of instantaneous pressure and vorticity contours around the cylinder controlled by synthetic jets with α 60 and δϕ π cylinder 2 are shown and compared with those of the smooth circular cylinder cylinder 1 in fig 22 and some details of the vortex near the synthetic jet place are drawn as well for the two cylinders with and without control it can be seen that the vortices on the lower side vortex v1 0 and vortex v2 0 are shedding from the cylinders and the vortices on the upper side vortex v1 1 and vortex v2 1 are growing mature from instant a to instant d at instant a the two cylinders are all in their equilibrium positions and moving upwards for cylinder 2 the vortex v2 1 is promoted to grow in both size and strength due to the synthetic jet on the upper side synthetic jet 1 and also gaining vorticity from the synthetic jet 1 directly two significant low pressure zones can be seen on the upper side of cylinder 2 the former one is due to the vortex generation by synthetic jet 1 and the latter one is caused by the growth of vortex v2 1 besides a significant low pressure zone with small size can also be identified on the lower side of cylinder 2 due to vortex generation by the synthetic jet on the lower side synthetic jet 2 for cylinder 1 the growth of vortex v1 1 is less intense and the pressure coefficients in the upper and back sides are larger so the lift coefficient and drag coefficient of cylinder 2 are larger than those of cylinder 1 at instant a at instant b cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are half way towards their highest position and moving upwards for cylinder 2 vortex v2 1 moves down relative to cylinder 2 and still gains vorticity from synthetic jet 1 directly a significant low pressure zone in the upper side can be identified so the lift coefficient and drag coefficient of cylinder 2 at instant b are significantly larger than those of cylinder 1 at instant c cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are on their highest position respectively for cylinder 1 vortex v1 2 in the lower side is formed and a large low pressure zone can be seen in the lower side for cylinder 2 the appearance of vortex v2 2 is delayed by the vortex with opposite rotational direction generated by synthetic jet 2 and a significant low pressure zone with small size can be observed at instant c the lift coefficient of cylinder 2 is larger than that of cylinder 1 but the drag coefficients are almost identical at instant d cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 are on the half way towards their equilibrium positions and moving towards for cylinder 2 the vortex v2 2 on the lower side is formed and grows in both size and strength and v2 2 is also gaining vorticity from the synthetic jet 2 directly accordingly two significant low pressure zones can be seen on the lower side and wake of cylinder 2 both the lift and drag coefficients of cylinder 2 are larger than those of cylinder 1 from instant e to h the vortices vortex v1 1 and vortex v2 1 on the upper side are shed from the cylinders and the vortices vortex v1 2 and vortex v2 2 on the lower side are growing mature similarly the lift coefficients of cylinder 2 are all larger than those of cylinder 1 and most of the drag coefficients of cylinder 2 except at instant h are larger than those of cylinder 1 it can be found that the synthetic jet on the upper side can promote the growth of vortex on the upper side when the cylinder moves upwards and vice versa thus when the synthetic jets with three different phase differences are issued vertically two degree of freedom vivs of the circular cylinder are all enhanced 3 9 the engineering approach adding synthetic jets on the circular cylinder is novel and interesting and a conceptual design of such a device is shown in fig 23 the synthetic jets are generated by the sinusoidal and time harmonic movement of two pistons at two ends of the circular cylinder the pistons are connected to the voice coil motors via the connecting rods and the motion of the pistons is driven by the voice coil motors at two ends which is a type of non commutated dc linear actuator the momentum coefficient and excitation frequency of synthetic jets can be adjusted by changing the waveform and frequency of the input voltage to voice coil motors as for the synthetic jet orientation angle it can be adjusted by changing the layout of slots on the circular cylinder in practice 4 conclusions in this work the effect of the synthetic jet orientation angle and phase difference on two degree of freedom vivs control of a circular cylinder at re 150 are numerically investigated the oscillation characters hydrodynamic forces and wake patterns are evaluated and discussed based on the discussion above the following conclusions can be summarized 1 synthetic jets with different orientation angles and phase differences can effectively control 2dof vivs of a circular cylinder in a wide range of reduced velocities and the synthetic jet orientation angle can determine whether the oscillation is suppressed or enhanced under the control of synthetic jets issued in horizontal direction β 0 both in flow and cross flow oscillations can be suppressed however 2dof vivs are enhanced when the orientation angle of synthetic jets β equals 90 when synthetic jets are issued in the normal direction of orifices β α the control effects depend on the position angle α which is still ascribed to the influence of synthetic jet orientation angle 2 the phase difference between synthetic jets has significant influence on the standard deviations of drag coefficients and the root mean square values of lift coefficients the standard deviations of drag coefficients decrease significantly with the increase of phase difference and the root mean square values of lift coefficients usually increase with increasing the phase difference in addition the in flow oscillation is more sensitive to the phase difference than the cross flow oscillation 3 the cross flow oscillation frequencies of the controlled cases are close to that of the smooth circular cylinder when the vortex shedding is not completely dominated by synthetic jets however when vortex shedding is completely dominated by synthetic jets β 0 α 30 and 45 the cross flow oscillation frequencies may be unobtainable δϕ 0 or locked to the synthetic jet excitation frequency δϕ π 2 and π 4 the synthetic jets issued horizontally can delay the boundary layer separation in both blowing and suction phases the vortices in the wake of the cylinder are elongated and tend to be symmetric which leads to the suppression of viv when issued vertically the synthetic jets can enhance the viv of the cylinder by promoting the growth of vortex on the upper lower side when the cylinder is moving upwards downwards credit authorship contribution statement haibo wang conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

21404,flow induced vibration fiv occurs in deep water engineering when multiple cylinders interact with each other at a closer range and leads to significant fatigue damages nevertheless many studies have focused on the fatigue damage caused by vortex induced vibration viv using a group of flexible cylinders is more common in offshore engineering and has attracted extensive concern however the features of fiv fatigue damage remain unclear in this paper the experimental data of two side by side flexible cylinders with high aspect ratios length to diameter l d 350 where l is the cylinder length and d is the cylinder diameter and low mass ratios total structural mass to displaced fluid mass m 1 90 are utilized to calculate fatigue damages based on s n curves and miner s rule four spacing ratios centre to centre distance to cylinder diameter s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 where s is the centre to centre distance are adopted to investigate their effects on fatigue damage the results are presented in terms of strain responses fatigue damage distributions and the maximum fatigue damages the cross flow cf fatigue damages of the two side by side cylinders remain almost consistent with that of the isolated cylinder at most of the reduced velocities while the in line il fatigue damages are more than 2 times greater than that of the isolated cylinder when s d 3 0 and 4 0 in addition fatigue damage of the two side by side cylinders is more serious than that of the isolated cylinder in the il direction when s d 8 0 owing to considerably vigorous interactions keywords flow induced vibration side by side arrangement flexible cylinder spacing ratio fatigue damage 1 introduction interactions among slender cylinders are ubiquitous in the offshore industry and constitute a critical factor in the design of marine structures such as marine risers tendons of tension leg platform mooring lines and subsea pipelines in ocean engineering riser systems are widely employed for the transportation of seabed resources to floating production units however most riser systems consist of many risers with relatively low separation distances which may interact with each other and cause serious fatigue damage flow induced vibration fiv represents an intricate fluid structure interaction problem and occurs when vortices generate fluctuating forces on multiple cylinders many studies have been performed to address this canonical issue since a few decades ago williamson 1985 zdravkovich 1988 sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 xu et al 2018a 2018b 2019 2020 ma et al 2020 as a simple case of fiv vortex induced vibration viv causes intricate fatigue damage and has attracted the attention of many researchers lu et al 2020 trim et al 2005 investigated the fatigue damages of marine risers with and without viv suppression and with various strake arrangements the results indicated that in line il fatigue damage is as severe as cross flow cf fatigue damage and that the response of a smooth riser can be markedly distinct from that of a riser covered with helical strakes baarholm et al 2006 studied the relative importance of il and cf viv to fatigue damage accumulation in large scale model tests of a tensioned steel riser they found that fatigue damage was proportional to u 2τ 1 where u is the flow velocity and τ is the parameter of the s n curve when the modes were dominated by tension whereas fatigue damage was proportional to u τ 1 when the modes were controlled by bending mukundan et al 2009 employed systematic techniques to reconstruct riser viv responses using data from available sensors and estimated the fatigue damage along the entire riser xue et al 2014 proposed a prediction model of viv fatigue damage for risers in both the cf and il directions the effects of cf and il viv coupling were considered and the response amplitude was corrected by a weighted factor according to the input power within the overlap excitation region for each vibration mode moreover the maximum velocity of the sheared current the top tension the internal fluid density and the material type were investigated to discuss their effects on the occurrence of fatigue damage wang et al 2013a 2013b 2014 proposed a time domain method accounting for the interaction between a steel catenary riser scr and soil to predict the cf and il viv fatigue damages in the touchdown zone tdz the results indicated that trench depth vertical and lateral stiffness and clay suction prominently affect the maximum fatigue damage in the tdz wang et al 2015 experimentally investigated the viv fatigue damage of a flexible cylinder in oscillatory flow using rain flow counting method and s n curve their work suggested that fatigue damage resulting from viv in oscillatory flow produced three main characteristics recently wang et al 2018 performed large scale model testing of an scr to investigate the responses under steady uniform and vessel motions the fatigue damages of the scr were estimated revealing that the fatigue damage caused by vessel motion was similar in magnitude to that caused by the uniform flow their findings emphasized the importance of vessel motion in analyses of scr systems furthermore wong and kim 2018 creatively used an artificial neural network ann to predict viv fatigue damage considering six main input parameters i e riser outer diameter wall thickness top tension water depth surface current velocity and bottom current velocity in their work the effects of these parameters on the fatigue damage of a top tensioned riser ttr were studied and discussed nevertheless a two parallel cylinder system is considered as one of the simplest arrangements of multiple cylinders thus fiv of two cylinders has attracted increasing attention assi et al 2006 huera huarte and gharib 2011b huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and bearman 2011 experimentally investigated the fiv of two identical flexible cylinders in tandem with a centre to centre spacing ratio ranging from 2 0 to 4 0 and different response regimes were identified based on the type of oscillations exhibited by the cylinders xu et al 2018b conducted laboratory tests of the fiv of two tandem long flexible cylinders in a towing tank to study their multi mode response behaviours the influences of five centre to centre spacing ratios t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 where t is the centre to centre distance in the il direction and d is the cylinder diameter were investigated from several aspects e g strain and displacement responses dominant frequency and mode the results showed that fiv responses of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of an isolated cylinder while the response of the downstream cylinder differs from that of the upstream cylinder owing to wake shielding effects the problem of side by side cylinders subjected to fiv has been approached by many researchers huera huarte and gharib 2011a sanaati and kato 2014 xu et al 2018a han et al 2018 chen et al 2019 huera huarte and gharib 2011a conducted laboratory experiments on the dynamic responses of two side by side slender cylinder models with a centre to centre spacing ratio of up to 5 0 the researchers concluded that at spacing ratios smaller than 3 5 the cf motions of the cylinders were considerably synchronized in contrast at spacing ratios larger than 3 5 the cylinders showed no synchronized motions and displayed independent behaviours furthermore sanaati and kato 2014 tested two flexible cylinders in a side by side arrangement the results indicated that the upper cylinder showed no upper branch in the first cf modal resonance region at a small spacing ratio of 2 75 but when the spacing ratio became large both cylinders exhibited amplitude responses similar to those of an isolated cylinder xu et al 2018a conducted a series of experimental tests to investigate the fiv of two side by side flexible cylinders with high aspect ratios l d 350 where l is the cylinder length and d is the cylinder diameter in a towing tank four different spacing ratios s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 where s is the centre to centre distance in the cf direction were adopted to examine the effect of spacing on the multi mode fiv of the two flexible cylinders the apparent proximity interference existed in the cf direction when the spacing was smaller than 6 0d moreover the side by side arrangement may enhance their il displacements despite a spacing ratio of s d 8 0 owing to the design and application of slender cylindrical structures e g top tension risers subsea pipelines and tension leg platform tlp tethers their fatigue lives cannot be underestimated long flexible cylinders are known to be vulnerable to the serious fatigue damage caused by viv and their multi mode vibrations may exacerbate fatigue damage problems hence fatigue damage is an eternal topic in ocean engineering due to its destructiveness and unavoidability fatigue damage analysis of isolated flexible cylinders subjected to viv has appealed to considerable attention trim et al 2005 baarholm et al 2006 iranpour et al 2008 lu et al 2020 and few researchers adequately consider the fatigue damages of two side by side cylinders with low mass ratios and high aspect ratios obviously two side by side flexible cylinders exhibit significant differences from an isolated cylinder in terms of dynamic responses huera huarte and gharib 2011a sanaati and kato 2014 xu et al 2018a moreover swithenbank 2007 discussed the dynamics of an isolated long flexible cylinder at a higher vibration mode recently the ubiquitous multi mode vibrations of two flexible cylinders have attracted attention xu et al 2018a 2018b han et al 2018 xu et al 2020 nevertheless to the authors knowledge studies on the fiv fatigue damages of two side by side flexible cylinders remain scarce actually the mutual interaction among flexible cylinders is known to result in more serious fatigue damage hence prioritizing the fatigue damage features of two side by side cylinders is extremely urgent thus the main aim of this paper is to calculate the fiv fatigue damages of the two side by side flexible cylinders experimentally investigated by xu et al 2018a and to discuss the effects of the spacing ratio on the damage results the remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections the calculation of fatigue damage is proposed in section 2 section 3 introduces the laboratory tests conducted on the fivs of two flexible cylinders section 4 discusses the results including strain response fatigue damage distribution and the maximum fatigue damage moreover some mechanism and summary are presented further finally the conclusions are reported in section 5 2 calculation of fatigue damage 2 1 rain flow counting method the rain flow procedure is a stress cycle counting method that was first proposed by matsuishi and endo in 1968 and has been widely used in fatigue analysis in ocean engineering fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the rain flow counting method the time coordinate is represented by a vertical axis while the stress loading coordinate is expressed by a horizontal axis raindrops flow down from a peak or a valley the load cycle can be defined based on the trace of raindrops flowing the counting procedure is briefly introduced as follows 1 the starting points of raindrops are located successively at peaks or valleys 2 raindrops continue falling from every peak or valley until a larger peak or valley is encountered 3 a complete cycle forms when raindrops cease 4 the cycles can be extracted according to the starting point and the ending point of each drop 2 2 s n curve the s n curve is broadly utilized in estimating the fatigue lives of beam structures in various engineering applications in ocean engineering s n curves are employed with the rain flow counting method owing to their simplicity numerous researchers have employed s n curves in estimating the fatigue lives of offshore structures zheng et al 2014 wang et al 2015 2018 thorsen et al 2015 preliminarily miner s rule for fatigue damage accumulation from stress time histories states that a fracture will form if 1 d t o t a l i 1 n i n i 1 where d t o t a l is the total fatigue damage n i is the number of stress cycles and n i is the number of cycles to failure for the specific stress range σ i n i and the corresponding stress range σ i can be obtained by the rain flow method the stress range σ i is defined by the difference between consecutive inflection points the number of cycles to failure n i refers to the endurance of the material exposed to cyclic loads which can be obtained from the given s n curve s n curves define the relationship between the number of cycles to failure and the stress range 2 log n i log a m log σ i where m is the negative inverse slope of the given s n curve log a represents the intercept of the log n axis by the s n curve and a and m are material parameters obtained from laboratory tests hence the number of cycles n i can be written by 3 n i a σ i m therefore the corresponding damage from one cycle with stress range σ i can be written as 4 d i n i n i n i σ i m a thus according to eq 1 d t o t a l can be expressed based on accumulated linear damages from all cycles as follows 5 d t o t a l 1 a i 1 n i σ i m throughout the fatigue analysis the d curve from dnv is applied veritas 2010 which is a linear function on a log log scale with m 3 0 the parameters are listed in table 1 3 experimental description 3 1 experimental set up the laboratory experimental data in xu et al 2018a are used to calculate the fiv fatigue damages the layout of the experiment is displayed in fig 2 two cylinders were mounted horizontally and labelled cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 both cylinders were 5 60 m in length with an external diameter of 16 mm the main parameters are listed in table 2 four spacing ratios s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 were adopted for tests the towing velocity varied from 0 05 to 1 00 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s to simulate a uniform flow fig 3 shows a sketch of strain gauges from a cross section view and their arrangements along the cylinder axis seven measurement positions g1 g7 were distributed uniformly a total of fourteen pairs of strain gauges were installed to measure the cf and il strain values furthermore the reduced velocity v r can be defined as 6 v r u f 1 d where u is the towing velocity and f 1 is the fundamental frequency of the cylinder in still water which is calculated from 7 f n n 2 l t a m s m a n π l 2 e i m s m a where f n is the nth order natural frequency in water m s and m a are the structural mass and the added mass per unit length respectively t a denotes the axial tension l is the cylinder length and e is young s modulus of the material more details can be found in xu et al 2018a 3 2 data process to calculate the fatigue damage along the cylinder axis the strain signals at seven measurement positions required reconstruction a modal analysis approach has been utilized to reconstruct displacements by many researchers trim et al 2005 chaplin et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 song et al 2011 xu et al 2018a successfully employed a similar modal analysis approach in our previous experiments the dynamical behaviour of a flexible cylinder can be assumed to be approximately linear the time and space dependent displacement can be composed of a series of mode shapes which can be written as 8 y z t n 1 ϕ n z ω n t where y z t is the displacement function z is the coordinate along the axis t denotes time ϕ n z is the mode shape ω n t is the modal weight and n is the order of vibration mode based on bernoulli euler beam theory the mode shape of displacement can be expressed as 9 ϕ n z sin n π z l hence the strain function ε z t can be expressed see in eq 11 based on the relationship between displacement and strain 10 ε z t d 2 2 y z t z 2 n 1 n π l 2 ϕ n z ω n t 11 ε z t n 1 w n t ϕ n z where d is the external diameter of the cylinder w n t is a function of modal weight ω n t and it reads 12 w n t d 2 n π l 2 ω n t according to eq 11 the only unknown parameter w n t can be calculated from the strain signals at seven measurement points then the stress function σ z t can be directly expressed 13 σ z t e ε z t 4 results and discussion in this section the fatigue damage results are presented according to three aspects i e strain response fatigue damage distribution and the maximum fatigue damage moreover effects of the four spacing ratios are discussed further 4 1 strain response figs 4 and 5 display the strain responses at v r 15 03 under s d 3 0 this case involves many typical features of fiv of flexible cylinders including multi mode response standing and traveling wave response and higher dominant frequency response in the il than in the cf etc the first columns demonstrate the strain time series at measurement positions g1 g7 along the two cylinders axes in both the cf and il directions the cf strain is found to have slightly higher amplitudes than the il strain at corresponding positions the next columns show the root mean square rms of the strain along the cylinder axis and the strain signals are reconstructed according to the aforementioned method firstly the rms of the strain is calculated as follows 14 ε rms z 1 s t 1 s ε 2 z t where s is the total number of milliseconds which equals 3000 xu et al 2018a the cf rms strain has more than four peaks along the axis while the il rms strain has approximately four peaks note that the cf rms strain has higher amplitudes along the axis than the il rms strain due to the features of the strain time series the third columns depict the space time varying strain response contours one second sampling time is adopted as a specimen it can be found that the two cylinders have lower vibrating frequencies in the cf direction than in the il direction overall the fiv responses of the flexible cylinders characterize a combined behaviour of the stationary wave and traveling wave xu et al 2018a to validate the cf and il strain frequencies the last columns show the frequency spectra at seven measurement positions obviously two strain frequency components exist in the cf spectra for both cylinders see fig 4 and the higher one is the dominant frequency with a value of approximately 6 40 hz in contrast the lower frequency is approximately 18 70 hz as shown in fig 5 interestingly more than two frequency spikes can be observed in the il spectra of all frequency components the dominant component corresponds to approximately 12 46 hz evidently the il strain has a higher dominant frequency than its cf counterpart and the il vibration characterizes the multi mode feature similar displacement results for multi mode vibration have been discussed thoroughly by xu et al 2018a furthermore we find that higher order frequency components appear in both the cf and il spectra over the past few years higher order harmonic components have been counted as a significant feature for viv and dramatically affect fatigue damage results jhingran and vandiver 2007 modarres sadeghi et al 2010 zheng et al 2014 typically third harmonic components in cf fatigue damage are quite remarkable vandiver et al 2006 price et al 2011 and their contribution to the total fatigue damage is greater than 50 modarres sadeghi et al 2010 to incorporate the higher order frequency components the following discussion will employ time domain methods 4 2 fatigue damage distribution figs 6 and 7 depict the fatigue damage distributions of cylinders 1 and 2 at v r 20 04 under four spacing ratios in the cf and il directions respectively the fatigue damages of the isolated cylinder in the cf and il directions are denoted by a black dotted line for comparison when s d 3 0 and 4 0 the two cylinders exhibit an inverse cf fatigue damage distribution along the axes at v r 20 04 since the gap flow is alternatingly biased to one of the cylinders in a closer range and they show a large discrepancy for fatigue damage compared to the isolated cylinder for the isolated cylinder three peaks can be observed in the cf fatigue damage distribution at this reduced velocity while more than three peaks can be observed in the corresponding results of the two cylinders this feature that higher order mode vibrations easily occur for the two cylinders compared with the isolated cylinder has been reported in xu et al 2018a furthermore strong proximity interference persists in the cf vibration when spacing ratios are small zdravkovich 1988 sanaati and kato 2014 on the other hand when s d 6 0 or 8 0 the fatigue damage distributions of the two cylinders tend to remain in accordance with the results of the isolated cylinder typically the two cylinders almost encounter identical fatigue damage along the axes to the isolated cylinder in the cf direction when s d 8 0 which may be attributed to attenuation of the strong interaction in the cf direction when the spacing is larger than 6 0 diameter and both cylinders therefore behave similar to the isolated cylinder in terms of fatigue damage huera huarte and gharib 2011a likewise this feature agrees with the displacement results found by xu et al 2018a for the il direction the two cylinders exhibit five peaks in the fatigue damage curves under four spacing ratios and the same number of peaks can also be observed in the isolated cylinder s fatigue damage curve the fatigue damage distribution curve is highly consistent with the rms strain along the axis which both reach their maximum values at the same position along the cylinder axis gao et al 2015 the two cylinders sustain more serious fatigue damage at some specific positions than the isolated cylinder when s d 6 0 moreover the two cylinders present large fatigue damage disparities to each other along the axes when s d 8 0 interestingly remarkable il fatigue differences between the isolate cylinder and the two cylinders emerge compared to the case of cf fatigue damage these findings are similar to the results proposed by xu et al 2018a that two side by side cylinders still have a notably strong coupling effect with each other in the il direction when s d 8 0 furthermore to investigate the difference in the fatigue damage distributions along the axes between the side by side cylinders and the isolated cylinder and discuss the effects of spacing ratios on the results cylinder 1 is adopted as an example to compare its fatigue damage distribution to that of the isolated cylinder to quantify the relative difference we define this difference as follows 15 d r d cy 1 d isolated d isolated where d r is the relative fatigue damage difference d c y 1 is the fatigue damage of cylinder 1 and d i s o l a t e d refers to the isolated cylinder s fatigue damage figs 8 and 9 illustrate the corresponding results along the axis and versus the reduced velocity graphically the green areas represent the cases where cylinder 1 sustains approximately the same fatigue damage as the isolated cylinder with an error margin lower than 20 the red areas refer to cases where cylinder 1 has more severe fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder in contrast the blue areas denote that cylinder 1 has less than half of the fatigue damage of the isolated cylinder upon closer inspection of fig 8 the contours at s d 3 0 4 0 and 6 0 are similar to each other both in colour distribution and depth the cf fatigue damage distributions of cylinder 1 remain consistent with each other among smaller spacing ratios and cylinder 1 sustains less severe fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most reduced velocities typically compared with s d 3 0 and 6 0 cylinder 1 has a similar cf fatigue damage distribution to that of the isolated cylinder when s d 4 0 except when v r 6 26 and 12 52 when v r 12 52 cylinder 1 exhibits more serious fatigue damage along the axis than the isolated cylinder in the cf direction especially when s d 3 0 and 8 0 however approximately the same fatigue damages occur to cylinder 1 and the isolated cylinder when v r 12 52 furthermore the fatigue damage values of cylinder 1 sharply increase when s d 8 0 compared to the cases of s d 6 0 more serious fatigue damages appear along the axis when 6 26 v r 12 52 hence side by side cylinders may have less severe fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most positions along the axes when s d 6 0 nevertheless they both sustain substantially more serious fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder when s d 8 0 at most positions along the axes huera huarte and gharib 2011a reported that two side by side flexible cylinders exhibit no synchronized vibrations when the spacing ratios are larger than 3 5 and that they both show independent cf viv since the stronger interaction between the two cylinders barely exists xu et al 2018a increased the spacing ratio threshold to 8 0 in the cf direction in contrast to their findings we find that the cf fatigue damages of the two side by side cylinders remain higher than that of the isolated cylinder despite s d 8 0 in addition fig 9 demonstrates the corresponding results in the il direction compared to the cases in the cf direction cylinder 1 has more serious fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most axis positions when s d 6 0 especially s d 3 0 however when s d 8 0 cylinder 1 is more vulnerable to fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder compared to s d 6 0 the case of s d 8 0 leads to considerably higher fatigue damage values for the side by side cylinders hence the side by side cylinders could not attenuate the il fatigue damage when s d 8 0 compared to the isolated cylinder in contrast the fatigue damages along the axes of the two side by side cylinders are increased by the strong interaction even with s d 8 0 this fatigue damage feature in the il direction is similar to the displacement results found by xu et al 2018a indicating an enlargement effect on the il fiv behaviours thus the two side by side cylinders still show an enlargement effect on fatigue damages 4 3 maximum fatigue damage this section presents the maximum fatigue damage along the cylinder axis and discusses the effects of the spacing ratio on the results preliminarily the maximum fatigue damage can be written as follows 16 d max max 0 z l d t o t a l where d t o t a l is the fatigue damage at each position along the cylinder axis figs 10 and 11 show the maximum fatigue damages of cylinders 1 and 2 versus the reduced velocity in logarithmic coordinates under four spacing ratios the subplots depict the maximum fatigue damages with the reduced velocity ranging from 12 52 to 23 80 obviously the maximum fatigue damages in both directions increase exponentially with the increasingly reduced velocity tognarelli et al 2004 baarholm et al 2005 trim et al 2005 upon closer inspection the cf maximum fatigue damages of the two cylinders remain in accordance with that of the isolated cylinder at several reduced velocities however a strong interaction occurs between the two bodies when s d 6 0 due to the biased gap flow possibly because the maximum fatigue damages of the two cylinders are slightly lower than that of the isolated cylinder this phenomenon is very apparent when v r 15 03 higher reduced velocities tend to induce less serious cf fatigue damages on two side by side cylinders under smaller spacing ratios compared to isolated cylinders similar results upon displacement have been reported by sanaati and kato 2014 which show no synchronization with a large spacing ratio of 5 5 interesting features of the il maximum fatigue damage are shown in fig 11 we find that the two cylinders have more severe il maximum fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most of the reduced velocities when s d 6 0 the data in the il direction are more scattered than those in the cf direction in contrast to the case of the cf direction moreover higher reduced velocities v r 15 03 lead to a significant discrepancy in the maximum fatigue damage between the two cylinders this feature can be elucidated by the influence of strong proximity interference between two cylinders in a closer range notably however the il maximum fatigue damages of the two cylinders are still higher than that of the isolated cylinder even when s d 8 0 to compare the side by side cylinders and the isolated cylinder and illustrate the results more clearly figs 12 and 13 demonstrate the maximum fatigue damage ratios of cylinder 1 to the isolated cylinder in the cf and il directions respectively the dotted lines in each subplot refer to a ratio of 1 d m a x c y 1 and d m a x i s o l a t e d denote the maximum fatigue damages of cylinder 1 and the isolated cylinder respectively we find that the cf maximum fatigue damages of cylinder 1 at four spacing ratios are less serious than those of the isolated cylinder when v r 5 01 beyond v r 12 52 cylinder 1 remains consistent with the isolated cylinder for the maximum fatigue damage within the modal resonance region 13 78 v r 18 79 at all spacing ratios when v r 20 04 the maximum fatigue damage value of cylinder 1 is smaller than that of the isolated cylinder in xu s experiments the cf vibrations of the two cylinders strongly interact with each other even for s d 6 0 xu et al 2018a hence the data at s d 6 0 appear much more scattered than those at s d 4 0 similar results reported by sanaati and kato 2014 showed that the violent interaction exhibited even spacing up to 5 5 diameters interestingly a significant upper branch exists in the maximum damage ratio at s d 8 0 when 5 01 v r 12 52 cylinder 1 has more serious maximum fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder compared to the cases of s d 3 0 4 0 and 6 0 indicating that the maximum fatigue damage of cylinder 1 does not remain consistent with that of the isolated cylinder within a specific reduced velocity range even though s d 8 0 this feature of the maximum fatigue damage differs from the features of displacement reported by xu et al 2018a the cf maximum fatigue damage of cylinder 1 is still much more severe than that of the isolated cylinder even for a spacing ratio up to 8 0d as shown in fig 13 the il maximum fatigue damage of cylinder 1 is much more serious than that of the isolated cylinder when 5 01 v r 12 52 notably even when s d 3 0 and 4 0 an obvious upper branch still exists in the maximum fatigue damage ratio plot the two cylinders mutual interference could enhance the il maximum fatigue damage within 5 01 v r 12 52 however when v r 12 52 cylinder 1 exhibits approximately similar maximum fatigue damage to that of the isolated cylinder except in several mode transition regions at four spacing ratios according to xu et al 2018a note that unlike s d 3 0 4 0 and 8 0 the maximum fatigue damage ratio data at s d 6 0 are more concentrated around the dotted line furthermore similar to the cf maximum fatigue damage ratio at s d 8 0 the il maximum fatigue damage ratio still shows a remarkable upper branch within the reduced velocity ranging from 5 01 to 12 52 at s d 8 0 moreover the highest ratio reaches approximately 8 at several reduced velocities this feature remains consistent with the results reported by xu et al 2018a indicating that two side by side cylinders still have a very strong interaction in the il direction when s d 8 0 4 4 mechanism and summary from a flow field perspective fatigue damage is caused by cyclic vortices impingement between them cases of s d 6 0 lead to a biased flow pattern for two side by side cylinders as shown in fig 14 sumner et al 1999 sumner 2010 the inner shear layers periodically oscillate from one cylinder to another the cylinder to which the gap flow is biased has a narrow wake and higher vortex shedding frequency whilst the other one has a wide wake and lower vortex shedding frequency hence the deflection of the inner shear layers might also be the main mechanism that two side by side cylinders show inverse cf fatigue damage distribution see fig 6 a b and c however this biased flow between the two cylinders can hardly affect the il fatigue damage distributions because it vibrates vertical to the free flow direction when comparing the isolated cylinder with the side by side one the latter is bound to withstand more significant fatigue damage than the former due to the impact of the biased flow in contrast s d 8 0 leads to nearly same fatigue damage distributions of the two cylinders because their vortex streets incline to be parallel without strong vortex deflection the two cylinders almost behave independent as an isolated cylinder and the flow field regains its symmetry with two parallel vortex streets see fig 15 taken from sumner et al 1999 and sumner 2010 it is worth noting that there exists a vigorous fatigue difference between the side by side cylinder and an isolated one although the mutual interference cannot result in a fatigue disparity in a two side by side cylinder system it can still enlarge the fatigue damage of an isolated cylinder when another body is placed with a spacing ratio up to 8 0 in summary the biased flow mainly affects the fatigue discrepancy between the two side by side cylinders and it can reinforce the fatigue damage of the side by side cylinder when compared to an isolated cylinder parallel vortex streets instead make the side by side cylinders encounter approximately the same fatigue damage nevertheless this large spacing ratio due to the fierce coupled effect can still augment their fatigue damages when compared to an isolated cylinder 5 conclusions the experimental data from two flexible cylinders in a side by side arrangement are employed to calculate fatigue damages based on the rain flow counting method and s n curves the effects of four spacing ratios s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 on fiv fatigue damages are discussed three aspects including strain response fatigue damage distribution and the maximum fatigue damage are investigated furthermore fatigue damage differences between the side by side cylinders and the isolated cylinder are also discussed further the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the cf fatigue damage distributions of the two side by side flexible cylinders are consistent with that of the isolated cylinder at most positions along the axes when s d 6 0 except when 6 26 v r 10 02 in contrast the case of s d 8 0 could significantly enhance the cf fatigue damage when v r 15 03 especially when the reduced velocity is approximately 6 26 on the other hand side by side arrangement of the two cylinders could increase the il fatigue damage values when s d 3 0 and 4 0 due to the vigorous interaction between the two cylinders nevertheless this enlargement effect still exists in the il direction despite s d 8 0 in contrast s d 6 0 results in relatively lower il fatigue damage values for two side by side cylinders 2 the variation of the maximum fatigue damage of the two side by side cylinders shows an approximately exponential uptrend with increasingly reduced velocity in both the cf and il directions compared to the isolated cylinder the cf maximum fatigue damages of two side by side cylinders could be attenuated at lower reduced velocities v r 5 01 apart from the reduced velocities within the first modal transition region two side by side cylinders have less serious maximum fatigue damages than the isolated cylinder under four spacing ratios especially when v r 13 78 however the enlargement effect on the cf maximum fatigue damage appears when 6 26 v r 12 52 with s d 8 0 on the other hand the il maximum fatigue damages of two side by side cylinders are enhanced within 6 26 v r 12 52 and also when s d 3 0 and 4 0 the highest ratio reaches approximately 8 in the modal transition regions two side by side cylinders are prone to encounter more serious il maximum fatigue damages under four spacing ratios for s d 8 0 the enlargement effect still exists and causes more severe fatigue damage in the il direction due to the remarkably strong interaction with each other notably some simplified applications of s n curves have been employed in this paper and a typical d curve for free corrosion is adopted according to an empirical analysis the fatigue damage distributions are ideal models thus the method requires further investigation of its effectiveness in future

21404,flow induced vibration fiv occurs in deep water engineering when multiple cylinders interact with each other at a closer range and leads to significant fatigue damages nevertheless many studies have focused on the fatigue damage caused by vortex induced vibration viv using a group of flexible cylinders is more common in offshore engineering and has attracted extensive concern however the features of fiv fatigue damage remain unclear in this paper the experimental data of two side by side flexible cylinders with high aspect ratios length to diameter l d 350 where l is the cylinder length and d is the cylinder diameter and low mass ratios total structural mass to displaced fluid mass m 1 90 are utilized to calculate fatigue damages based on s n curves and miner s rule four spacing ratios centre to centre distance to cylinder diameter s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 where s is the centre to centre distance are adopted to investigate their effects on fatigue damage the results are presented in terms of strain responses fatigue damage distributions and the maximum fatigue damages the cross flow cf fatigue damages of the two side by side cylinders remain almost consistent with that of the isolated cylinder at most of the reduced velocities while the in line il fatigue damages are more than 2 times greater than that of the isolated cylinder when s d 3 0 and 4 0 in addition fatigue damage of the two side by side cylinders is more serious than that of the isolated cylinder in the il direction when s d 8 0 owing to considerably vigorous interactions keywords flow induced vibration side by side arrangement flexible cylinder spacing ratio fatigue damage 1 introduction interactions among slender cylinders are ubiquitous in the offshore industry and constitute a critical factor in the design of marine structures such as marine risers tendons of tension leg platform mooring lines and subsea pipelines in ocean engineering riser systems are widely employed for the transportation of seabed resources to floating production units however most riser systems consist of many risers with relatively low separation distances which may interact with each other and cause serious fatigue damage flow induced vibration fiv represents an intricate fluid structure interaction problem and occurs when vortices generate fluctuating forces on multiple cylinders many studies have been performed to address this canonical issue since a few decades ago williamson 1985 zdravkovich 1988 sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 xu et al 2018a 2018b 2019 2020 ma et al 2020 as a simple case of fiv vortex induced vibration viv causes intricate fatigue damage and has attracted the attention of many researchers lu et al 2020 trim et al 2005 investigated the fatigue damages of marine risers with and without viv suppression and with various strake arrangements the results indicated that in line il fatigue damage is as severe as cross flow cf fatigue damage and that the response of a smooth riser can be markedly distinct from that of a riser covered with helical strakes baarholm et al 2006 studied the relative importance of il and cf viv to fatigue damage accumulation in large scale model tests of a tensioned steel riser they found that fatigue damage was proportional to u 2τ 1 where u is the flow velocity and τ is the parameter of the s n curve when the modes were dominated by tension whereas fatigue damage was proportional to u τ 1 when the modes were controlled by bending mukundan et al 2009 employed systematic techniques to reconstruct riser viv responses using data from available sensors and estimated the fatigue damage along the entire riser xue et al 2014 proposed a prediction model of viv fatigue damage for risers in both the cf and il directions the effects of cf and il viv coupling were considered and the response amplitude was corrected by a weighted factor according to the input power within the overlap excitation region for each vibration mode moreover the maximum velocity of the sheared current the top tension the internal fluid density and the material type were investigated to discuss their effects on the occurrence of fatigue damage wang et al 2013a 2013b 2014 proposed a time domain method accounting for the interaction between a steel catenary riser scr and soil to predict the cf and il viv fatigue damages in the touchdown zone tdz the results indicated that trench depth vertical and lateral stiffness and clay suction prominently affect the maximum fatigue damage in the tdz wang et al 2015 experimentally investigated the viv fatigue damage of a flexible cylinder in oscillatory flow using rain flow counting method and s n curve their work suggested that fatigue damage resulting from viv in oscillatory flow produced three main characteristics recently wang et al 2018 performed large scale model testing of an scr to investigate the responses under steady uniform and vessel motions the fatigue damages of the scr were estimated revealing that the fatigue damage caused by vessel motion was similar in magnitude to that caused by the uniform flow their findings emphasized the importance of vessel motion in analyses of scr systems furthermore wong and kim 2018 creatively used an artificial neural network ann to predict viv fatigue damage considering six main input parameters i e riser outer diameter wall thickness top tension water depth surface current velocity and bottom current velocity in their work the effects of these parameters on the fatigue damage of a top tensioned riser ttr were studied and discussed nevertheless a two parallel cylinder system is considered as one of the simplest arrangements of multiple cylinders thus fiv of two cylinders has attracted increasing attention assi et al 2006 huera huarte and gharib 2011b huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and bearman 2011 experimentally investigated the fiv of two identical flexible cylinders in tandem with a centre to centre spacing ratio ranging from 2 0 to 4 0 and different response regimes were identified based on the type of oscillations exhibited by the cylinders xu et al 2018b conducted laboratory tests of the fiv of two tandem long flexible cylinders in a towing tank to study their multi mode response behaviours the influences of five centre to centre spacing ratios t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 where t is the centre to centre distance in the il direction and d is the cylinder diameter were investigated from several aspects e g strain and displacement responses dominant frequency and mode the results showed that fiv responses of the upstream cylinder are similar to those of an isolated cylinder while the response of the downstream cylinder differs from that of the upstream cylinder owing to wake shielding effects the problem of side by side cylinders subjected to fiv has been approached by many researchers huera huarte and gharib 2011a sanaati and kato 2014 xu et al 2018a han et al 2018 chen et al 2019 huera huarte and gharib 2011a conducted laboratory experiments on the dynamic responses of two side by side slender cylinder models with a centre to centre spacing ratio of up to 5 0 the researchers concluded that at spacing ratios smaller than 3 5 the cf motions of the cylinders were considerably synchronized in contrast at spacing ratios larger than 3 5 the cylinders showed no synchronized motions and displayed independent behaviours furthermore sanaati and kato 2014 tested two flexible cylinders in a side by side arrangement the results indicated that the upper cylinder showed no upper branch in the first cf modal resonance region at a small spacing ratio of 2 75 but when the spacing ratio became large both cylinders exhibited amplitude responses similar to those of an isolated cylinder xu et al 2018a conducted a series of experimental tests to investigate the fiv of two side by side flexible cylinders with high aspect ratios l d 350 where l is the cylinder length and d is the cylinder diameter in a towing tank four different spacing ratios s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 where s is the centre to centre distance in the cf direction were adopted to examine the effect of spacing on the multi mode fiv of the two flexible cylinders the apparent proximity interference existed in the cf direction when the spacing was smaller than 6 0d moreover the side by side arrangement may enhance their il displacements despite a spacing ratio of s d 8 0 owing to the design and application of slender cylindrical structures e g top tension risers subsea pipelines and tension leg platform tlp tethers their fatigue lives cannot be underestimated long flexible cylinders are known to be vulnerable to the serious fatigue damage caused by viv and their multi mode vibrations may exacerbate fatigue damage problems hence fatigue damage is an eternal topic in ocean engineering due to its destructiveness and unavoidability fatigue damage analysis of isolated flexible cylinders subjected to viv has appealed to considerable attention trim et al 2005 baarholm et al 2006 iranpour et al 2008 lu et al 2020 and few researchers adequately consider the fatigue damages of two side by side cylinders with low mass ratios and high aspect ratios obviously two side by side flexible cylinders exhibit significant differences from an isolated cylinder in terms of dynamic responses huera huarte and gharib 2011a sanaati and kato 2014 xu et al 2018a moreover swithenbank 2007 discussed the dynamics of an isolated long flexible cylinder at a higher vibration mode recently the ubiquitous multi mode vibrations of two flexible cylinders have attracted attention xu et al 2018a 2018b han et al 2018 xu et al 2020 nevertheless to the authors knowledge studies on the fiv fatigue damages of two side by side flexible cylinders remain scarce actually the mutual interaction among flexible cylinders is known to result in more serious fatigue damage hence prioritizing the fatigue damage features of two side by side cylinders is extremely urgent thus the main aim of this paper is to calculate the fiv fatigue damages of the two side by side flexible cylinders experimentally investigated by xu et al 2018a and to discuss the effects of the spacing ratio on the damage results the remainder of this paper is organized into the following sections the calculation of fatigue damage is proposed in section 2 section 3 introduces the laboratory tests conducted on the fivs of two flexible cylinders section 4 discusses the results including strain response fatigue damage distribution and the maximum fatigue damage moreover some mechanism and summary are presented further finally the conclusions are reported in section 5 2 calculation of fatigue damage 2 1 rain flow counting method the rain flow procedure is a stress cycle counting method that was first proposed by matsuishi and endo in 1968 and has been widely used in fatigue analysis in ocean engineering fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the rain flow counting method the time coordinate is represented by a vertical axis while the stress loading coordinate is expressed by a horizontal axis raindrops flow down from a peak or a valley the load cycle can be defined based on the trace of raindrops flowing the counting procedure is briefly introduced as follows 1 the starting points of raindrops are located successively at peaks or valleys 2 raindrops continue falling from every peak or valley until a larger peak or valley is encountered 3 a complete cycle forms when raindrops cease 4 the cycles can be extracted according to the starting point and the ending point of each drop 2 2 s n curve the s n curve is broadly utilized in estimating the fatigue lives of beam structures in various engineering applications in ocean engineering s n curves are employed with the rain flow counting method owing to their simplicity numerous researchers have employed s n curves in estimating the fatigue lives of offshore structures zheng et al 2014 wang et al 2015 2018 thorsen et al 2015 preliminarily miner s rule for fatigue damage accumulation from stress time histories states that a fracture will form if 1 d t o t a l i 1 n i n i 1 where d t o t a l is the total fatigue damage n i is the number of stress cycles and n i is the number of cycles to failure for the specific stress range σ i n i and the corresponding stress range σ i can be obtained by the rain flow method the stress range σ i is defined by the difference between consecutive inflection points the number of cycles to failure n i refers to the endurance of the material exposed to cyclic loads which can be obtained from the given s n curve s n curves define the relationship between the number of cycles to failure and the stress range 2 log n i log a m log σ i where m is the negative inverse slope of the given s n curve log a represents the intercept of the log n axis by the s n curve and a and m are material parameters obtained from laboratory tests hence the number of cycles n i can be written by 3 n i a σ i m therefore the corresponding damage from one cycle with stress range σ i can be written as 4 d i n i n i n i σ i m a thus according to eq 1 d t o t a l can be expressed based on accumulated linear damages from all cycles as follows 5 d t o t a l 1 a i 1 n i σ i m throughout the fatigue analysis the d curve from dnv is applied veritas 2010 which is a linear function on a log log scale with m 3 0 the parameters are listed in table 1 3 experimental description 3 1 experimental set up the laboratory experimental data in xu et al 2018a are used to calculate the fiv fatigue damages the layout of the experiment is displayed in fig 2 two cylinders were mounted horizontally and labelled cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 both cylinders were 5 60 m in length with an external diameter of 16 mm the main parameters are listed in table 2 four spacing ratios s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 were adopted for tests the towing velocity varied from 0 05 to 1 00 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s to simulate a uniform flow fig 3 shows a sketch of strain gauges from a cross section view and their arrangements along the cylinder axis seven measurement positions g1 g7 were distributed uniformly a total of fourteen pairs of strain gauges were installed to measure the cf and il strain values furthermore the reduced velocity v r can be defined as 6 v r u f 1 d where u is the towing velocity and f 1 is the fundamental frequency of the cylinder in still water which is calculated from 7 f n n 2 l t a m s m a n π l 2 e i m s m a where f n is the nth order natural frequency in water m s and m a are the structural mass and the added mass per unit length respectively t a denotes the axial tension l is the cylinder length and e is young s modulus of the material more details can be found in xu et al 2018a 3 2 data process to calculate the fatigue damage along the cylinder axis the strain signals at seven measurement positions required reconstruction a modal analysis approach has been utilized to reconstruct displacements by many researchers trim et al 2005 chaplin et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 song et al 2011 xu et al 2018a successfully employed a similar modal analysis approach in our previous experiments the dynamical behaviour of a flexible cylinder can be assumed to be approximately linear the time and space dependent displacement can be composed of a series of mode shapes which can be written as 8 y z t n 1 ϕ n z ω n t where y z t is the displacement function z is the coordinate along the axis t denotes time ϕ n z is the mode shape ω n t is the modal weight and n is the order of vibration mode based on bernoulli euler beam theory the mode shape of displacement can be expressed as 9 ϕ n z sin n π z l hence the strain function ε z t can be expressed see in eq 11 based on the relationship between displacement and strain 10 ε z t d 2 2 y z t z 2 n 1 n π l 2 ϕ n z ω n t 11 ε z t n 1 w n t ϕ n z where d is the external diameter of the cylinder w n t is a function of modal weight ω n t and it reads 12 w n t d 2 n π l 2 ω n t according to eq 11 the only unknown parameter w n t can be calculated from the strain signals at seven measurement points then the stress function σ z t can be directly expressed 13 σ z t e ε z t 4 results and discussion in this section the fatigue damage results are presented according to three aspects i e strain response fatigue damage distribution and the maximum fatigue damage moreover effects of the four spacing ratios are discussed further 4 1 strain response figs 4 and 5 display the strain responses at v r 15 03 under s d 3 0 this case involves many typical features of fiv of flexible cylinders including multi mode response standing and traveling wave response and higher dominant frequency response in the il than in the cf etc the first columns demonstrate the strain time series at measurement positions g1 g7 along the two cylinders axes in both the cf and il directions the cf strain is found to have slightly higher amplitudes than the il strain at corresponding positions the next columns show the root mean square rms of the strain along the cylinder axis and the strain signals are reconstructed according to the aforementioned method firstly the rms of the strain is calculated as follows 14 ε rms z 1 s t 1 s ε 2 z t where s is the total number of milliseconds which equals 3000 xu et al 2018a the cf rms strain has more than four peaks along the axis while the il rms strain has approximately four peaks note that the cf rms strain has higher amplitudes along the axis than the il rms strain due to the features of the strain time series the third columns depict the space time varying strain response contours one second sampling time is adopted as a specimen it can be found that the two cylinders have lower vibrating frequencies in the cf direction than in the il direction overall the fiv responses of the flexible cylinders characterize a combined behaviour of the stationary wave and traveling wave xu et al 2018a to validate the cf and il strain frequencies the last columns show the frequency spectra at seven measurement positions obviously two strain frequency components exist in the cf spectra for both cylinders see fig 4 and the higher one is the dominant frequency with a value of approximately 6 40 hz in contrast the lower frequency is approximately 18 70 hz as shown in fig 5 interestingly more than two frequency spikes can be observed in the il spectra of all frequency components the dominant component corresponds to approximately 12 46 hz evidently the il strain has a higher dominant frequency than its cf counterpart and the il vibration characterizes the multi mode feature similar displacement results for multi mode vibration have been discussed thoroughly by xu et al 2018a furthermore we find that higher order frequency components appear in both the cf and il spectra over the past few years higher order harmonic components have been counted as a significant feature for viv and dramatically affect fatigue damage results jhingran and vandiver 2007 modarres sadeghi et al 2010 zheng et al 2014 typically third harmonic components in cf fatigue damage are quite remarkable vandiver et al 2006 price et al 2011 and their contribution to the total fatigue damage is greater than 50 modarres sadeghi et al 2010 to incorporate the higher order frequency components the following discussion will employ time domain methods 4 2 fatigue damage distribution figs 6 and 7 depict the fatigue damage distributions of cylinders 1 and 2 at v r 20 04 under four spacing ratios in the cf and il directions respectively the fatigue damages of the isolated cylinder in the cf and il directions are denoted by a black dotted line for comparison when s d 3 0 and 4 0 the two cylinders exhibit an inverse cf fatigue damage distribution along the axes at v r 20 04 since the gap flow is alternatingly biased to one of the cylinders in a closer range and they show a large discrepancy for fatigue damage compared to the isolated cylinder for the isolated cylinder three peaks can be observed in the cf fatigue damage distribution at this reduced velocity while more than three peaks can be observed in the corresponding results of the two cylinders this feature that higher order mode vibrations easily occur for the two cylinders compared with the isolated cylinder has been reported in xu et al 2018a furthermore strong proximity interference persists in the cf vibration when spacing ratios are small zdravkovich 1988 sanaati and kato 2014 on the other hand when s d 6 0 or 8 0 the fatigue damage distributions of the two cylinders tend to remain in accordance with the results of the isolated cylinder typically the two cylinders almost encounter identical fatigue damage along the axes to the isolated cylinder in the cf direction when s d 8 0 which may be attributed to attenuation of the strong interaction in the cf direction when the spacing is larger than 6 0 diameter and both cylinders therefore behave similar to the isolated cylinder in terms of fatigue damage huera huarte and gharib 2011a likewise this feature agrees with the displacement results found by xu et al 2018a for the il direction the two cylinders exhibit five peaks in the fatigue damage curves under four spacing ratios and the same number of peaks can also be observed in the isolated cylinder s fatigue damage curve the fatigue damage distribution curve is highly consistent with the rms strain along the axis which both reach their maximum values at the same position along the cylinder axis gao et al 2015 the two cylinders sustain more serious fatigue damage at some specific positions than the isolated cylinder when s d 6 0 moreover the two cylinders present large fatigue damage disparities to each other along the axes when s d 8 0 interestingly remarkable il fatigue differences between the isolate cylinder and the two cylinders emerge compared to the case of cf fatigue damage these findings are similar to the results proposed by xu et al 2018a that two side by side cylinders still have a notably strong coupling effect with each other in the il direction when s d 8 0 furthermore to investigate the difference in the fatigue damage distributions along the axes between the side by side cylinders and the isolated cylinder and discuss the effects of spacing ratios on the results cylinder 1 is adopted as an example to compare its fatigue damage distribution to that of the isolated cylinder to quantify the relative difference we define this difference as follows 15 d r d cy 1 d isolated d isolated where d r is the relative fatigue damage difference d c y 1 is the fatigue damage of cylinder 1 and d i s o l a t e d refers to the isolated cylinder s fatigue damage figs 8 and 9 illustrate the corresponding results along the axis and versus the reduced velocity graphically the green areas represent the cases where cylinder 1 sustains approximately the same fatigue damage as the isolated cylinder with an error margin lower than 20 the red areas refer to cases where cylinder 1 has more severe fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder in contrast the blue areas denote that cylinder 1 has less than half of the fatigue damage of the isolated cylinder upon closer inspection of fig 8 the contours at s d 3 0 4 0 and 6 0 are similar to each other both in colour distribution and depth the cf fatigue damage distributions of cylinder 1 remain consistent with each other among smaller spacing ratios and cylinder 1 sustains less severe fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most reduced velocities typically compared with s d 3 0 and 6 0 cylinder 1 has a similar cf fatigue damage distribution to that of the isolated cylinder when s d 4 0 except when v r 6 26 and 12 52 when v r 12 52 cylinder 1 exhibits more serious fatigue damage along the axis than the isolated cylinder in the cf direction especially when s d 3 0 and 8 0 however approximately the same fatigue damages occur to cylinder 1 and the isolated cylinder when v r 12 52 furthermore the fatigue damage values of cylinder 1 sharply increase when s d 8 0 compared to the cases of s d 6 0 more serious fatigue damages appear along the axis when 6 26 v r 12 52 hence side by side cylinders may have less severe fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most positions along the axes when s d 6 0 nevertheless they both sustain substantially more serious fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder when s d 8 0 at most positions along the axes huera huarte and gharib 2011a reported that two side by side flexible cylinders exhibit no synchronized vibrations when the spacing ratios are larger than 3 5 and that they both show independent cf viv since the stronger interaction between the two cylinders barely exists xu et al 2018a increased the spacing ratio threshold to 8 0 in the cf direction in contrast to their findings we find that the cf fatigue damages of the two side by side cylinders remain higher than that of the isolated cylinder despite s d 8 0 in addition fig 9 demonstrates the corresponding results in the il direction compared to the cases in the cf direction cylinder 1 has more serious fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most axis positions when s d 6 0 especially s d 3 0 however when s d 8 0 cylinder 1 is more vulnerable to fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder compared to s d 6 0 the case of s d 8 0 leads to considerably higher fatigue damage values for the side by side cylinders hence the side by side cylinders could not attenuate the il fatigue damage when s d 8 0 compared to the isolated cylinder in contrast the fatigue damages along the axes of the two side by side cylinders are increased by the strong interaction even with s d 8 0 this fatigue damage feature in the il direction is similar to the displacement results found by xu et al 2018a indicating an enlargement effect on the il fiv behaviours thus the two side by side cylinders still show an enlargement effect on fatigue damages 4 3 maximum fatigue damage this section presents the maximum fatigue damage along the cylinder axis and discusses the effects of the spacing ratio on the results preliminarily the maximum fatigue damage can be written as follows 16 d max max 0 z l d t o t a l where d t o t a l is the fatigue damage at each position along the cylinder axis figs 10 and 11 show the maximum fatigue damages of cylinders 1 and 2 versus the reduced velocity in logarithmic coordinates under four spacing ratios the subplots depict the maximum fatigue damages with the reduced velocity ranging from 12 52 to 23 80 obviously the maximum fatigue damages in both directions increase exponentially with the increasingly reduced velocity tognarelli et al 2004 baarholm et al 2005 trim et al 2005 upon closer inspection the cf maximum fatigue damages of the two cylinders remain in accordance with that of the isolated cylinder at several reduced velocities however a strong interaction occurs between the two bodies when s d 6 0 due to the biased gap flow possibly because the maximum fatigue damages of the two cylinders are slightly lower than that of the isolated cylinder this phenomenon is very apparent when v r 15 03 higher reduced velocities tend to induce less serious cf fatigue damages on two side by side cylinders under smaller spacing ratios compared to isolated cylinders similar results upon displacement have been reported by sanaati and kato 2014 which show no synchronization with a large spacing ratio of 5 5 interesting features of the il maximum fatigue damage are shown in fig 11 we find that the two cylinders have more severe il maximum fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder at most of the reduced velocities when s d 6 0 the data in the il direction are more scattered than those in the cf direction in contrast to the case of the cf direction moreover higher reduced velocities v r 15 03 lead to a significant discrepancy in the maximum fatigue damage between the two cylinders this feature can be elucidated by the influence of strong proximity interference between two cylinders in a closer range notably however the il maximum fatigue damages of the two cylinders are still higher than that of the isolated cylinder even when s d 8 0 to compare the side by side cylinders and the isolated cylinder and illustrate the results more clearly figs 12 and 13 demonstrate the maximum fatigue damage ratios of cylinder 1 to the isolated cylinder in the cf and il directions respectively the dotted lines in each subplot refer to a ratio of 1 d m a x c y 1 and d m a x i s o l a t e d denote the maximum fatigue damages of cylinder 1 and the isolated cylinder respectively we find that the cf maximum fatigue damages of cylinder 1 at four spacing ratios are less serious than those of the isolated cylinder when v r 5 01 beyond v r 12 52 cylinder 1 remains consistent with the isolated cylinder for the maximum fatigue damage within the modal resonance region 13 78 v r 18 79 at all spacing ratios when v r 20 04 the maximum fatigue damage value of cylinder 1 is smaller than that of the isolated cylinder in xu s experiments the cf vibrations of the two cylinders strongly interact with each other even for s d 6 0 xu et al 2018a hence the data at s d 6 0 appear much more scattered than those at s d 4 0 similar results reported by sanaati and kato 2014 showed that the violent interaction exhibited even spacing up to 5 5 diameters interestingly a significant upper branch exists in the maximum damage ratio at s d 8 0 when 5 01 v r 12 52 cylinder 1 has more serious maximum fatigue damage than the isolated cylinder compared to the cases of s d 3 0 4 0 and 6 0 indicating that the maximum fatigue damage of cylinder 1 does not remain consistent with that of the isolated cylinder within a specific reduced velocity range even though s d 8 0 this feature of the maximum fatigue damage differs from the features of displacement reported by xu et al 2018a the cf maximum fatigue damage of cylinder 1 is still much more severe than that of the isolated cylinder even for a spacing ratio up to 8 0d as shown in fig 13 the il maximum fatigue damage of cylinder 1 is much more serious than that of the isolated cylinder when 5 01 v r 12 52 notably even when s d 3 0 and 4 0 an obvious upper branch still exists in the maximum fatigue damage ratio plot the two cylinders mutual interference could enhance the il maximum fatigue damage within 5 01 v r 12 52 however when v r 12 52 cylinder 1 exhibits approximately similar maximum fatigue damage to that of the isolated cylinder except in several mode transition regions at four spacing ratios according to xu et al 2018a note that unlike s d 3 0 4 0 and 8 0 the maximum fatigue damage ratio data at s d 6 0 are more concentrated around the dotted line furthermore similar to the cf maximum fatigue damage ratio at s d 8 0 the il maximum fatigue damage ratio still shows a remarkable upper branch within the reduced velocity ranging from 5 01 to 12 52 at s d 8 0 moreover the highest ratio reaches approximately 8 at several reduced velocities this feature remains consistent with the results reported by xu et al 2018a indicating that two side by side cylinders still have a very strong interaction in the il direction when s d 8 0 4 4 mechanism and summary from a flow field perspective fatigue damage is caused by cyclic vortices impingement between them cases of s d 6 0 lead to a biased flow pattern for two side by side cylinders as shown in fig 14 sumner et al 1999 sumner 2010 the inner shear layers periodically oscillate from one cylinder to another the cylinder to which the gap flow is biased has a narrow wake and higher vortex shedding frequency whilst the other one has a wide wake and lower vortex shedding frequency hence the deflection of the inner shear layers might also be the main mechanism that two side by side cylinders show inverse cf fatigue damage distribution see fig 6 a b and c however this biased flow between the two cylinders can hardly affect the il fatigue damage distributions because it vibrates vertical to the free flow direction when comparing the isolated cylinder with the side by side one the latter is bound to withstand more significant fatigue damage than the former due to the impact of the biased flow in contrast s d 8 0 leads to nearly same fatigue damage distributions of the two cylinders because their vortex streets incline to be parallel without strong vortex deflection the two cylinders almost behave independent as an isolated cylinder and the flow field regains its symmetry with two parallel vortex streets see fig 15 taken from sumner et al 1999 and sumner 2010 it is worth noting that there exists a vigorous fatigue difference between the side by side cylinder and an isolated one although the mutual interference cannot result in a fatigue disparity in a two side by side cylinder system it can still enlarge the fatigue damage of an isolated cylinder when another body is placed with a spacing ratio up to 8 0 in summary the biased flow mainly affects the fatigue discrepancy between the two side by side cylinders and it can reinforce the fatigue damage of the side by side cylinder when compared to an isolated cylinder parallel vortex streets instead make the side by side cylinders encounter approximately the same fatigue damage nevertheless this large spacing ratio due to the fierce coupled effect can still augment their fatigue damages when compared to an isolated cylinder 5 conclusions the experimental data from two flexible cylinders in a side by side arrangement are employed to calculate fatigue damages based on the rain flow counting method and s n curves the effects of four spacing ratios s d 3 0 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 on fiv fatigue damages are discussed three aspects including strain response fatigue damage distribution and the maximum fatigue damage are investigated furthermore fatigue damage differences between the side by side cylinders and the isolated cylinder are also discussed further the conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the cf fatigue damage distributions of the two side by side flexible cylinders are consistent with that of the isolated cylinder at most positions along the axes when s d 6 0 except when 6 26 v r 10 02 in contrast the case of s d 8 0 could significantly enhance the cf fatigue damage when v r 15 03 especially when the reduced velocity is approximately 6 26 on the other hand side by side arrangement of the two cylinders could increase the il fatigue damage values when s d 3 0 and 4 0 due to the vigorous interaction between the two cylinders nevertheless this enlargement effect still exists in the il direction despite s d 8 0 in contrast s d 6 0 results in relatively lower il fatigue damage values for two side by side cylinders 2 the variation of the maximum fatigue damage of the two side by side cylinders shows an approximately exponential uptrend with increasingly reduced velocity in both the cf and il directions compared to the isolated cylinder the cf maximum fatigue damages of two side by side cylinders could be attenuated at lower reduced velocities v r 5 01 apart from the reduced velocities within the first modal transition region two side by side cylinders have less serious maximum fatigue damages than the isolated cylinder under four spacing ratios especially when v r 13 78 however the enlargement effect on the cf maximum fatigue damage appears when 6 26 v r 12 52 with s d 8 0 on the other hand the il maximum fatigue damages of two side by side cylinders are enhanced within 6 26 v r 12 52 and also when s d 3 0 and 4 0 the highest ratio reaches approximately 8 in the modal transition regions two side by side cylinders are prone to encounter more serious il maximum fatigue damages under four spacing ratios for s d 8 0 the enlargement effect still exists and causes more severe fatigue damage in the il direction due to the remarkably strong interaction with each other notably some simplified applications of s n curves have been employed in this paper and a typical d curve for free corrosion is adopted according to an empirical analysis the fatigue damage distributions are ideal models thus the method requires further investigation of its effectiveness in future studies the fiv fatigue damage results of the two side by side cylinders may broaden the current understanding of fiv fatigue damage in ocean engineering and motivate profound studies on the characteristics of fiv fatigue damage of deep water marine risers credit authorship contribution statement wanhai xu conducted the calculation of fatigue damage and revised the paper yuhan li
