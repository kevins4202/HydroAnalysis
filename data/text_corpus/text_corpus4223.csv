21115,a two dimensional finite element numerical model was developed to predict local scour around a vibration submarine pipeline in steady current the numerical model was based on incompressible two dimensional navier stokes equations with a shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model closure the transportations of suspended load and the bed load were taken into consideration in the present numerical simulation the moving boundaries induced by the vibration pipeline and the evolution of the seabed due to local scour were tracked by using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method comparisons between the numerical results and available experimental data showed satisfactory agreements the local scour around a vibrating pipeline has been investigated including the maximum scour depth below the pipeline the vortex shedding mode and the vibration amplitude of the pipeline the numerical results showed that the maximum vibration amplitude of the pipeline could be about 1 2d and the maximum scour depth occurred in the wake side of the vibration pipeline keywords submarine pipeline vortex induced vibration local scour numerical simulation 1 introduction submarine pipelines are widely used in the development of marine oil and gas resources as the offshore transportation wang et al 2018 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2020 li et al 2019 guo et al 2019 and zhao et al 2007 the sediment particles around the submarine pipeline will be transported in current forming scour pits below the pipeline local scour around the pipeline will seriously affect the stability of submarine pipelines because of vortex induced vibration and sagging over the past decades researchers have studied the local scour around submarine pipelines both physically and numerically limited by computer simulation techniques early research mainly focused on physical experimental studies taking mao 1986 ibrahim and nalluri 1986 sumer 1988 fredsøe et al 1988 and chiew et al 1990 for example the above mentioned laboratory results showed that local scour characteristics around submarine pipelines were closely related to the incoming flow condition pipeline diameter water depth and sediment size etc empirical formulae for predicting scour characteristics of submarine pipelines have been established based on the laboratory results these pioneering research works have greatly deepened the understanding of localized scouring of submarine pipelines since the 1980s scholars began to study on the local scour of submarine pipelines using numerical simulation method hansen et al 1986 established a numerical analysis model of local scour around pipelines on the basis of potential flow theory which was based on the assumptions of non adhesion theory due to the fact that the viscous effect of the fluid couldn t be taken into account large discrepancies were found between the numerical simulation results and the experimental results to overcome the shortcomings of the potential flow theory numerical analysis model beek and wind 1990 established a numerical model based on navier stokes equations combined with the standard k ε turbulent model which was implemented to simulate local scour around the submarine pipeline the simulation results showed that the data obtained from numerical simulations agreed well with the laboratory results in trends but results were not in good agreement in scour profiles thereafter li and cheng 2000 developed a new numerical model solving navier stokes equations with the large eddy simulation turbulent model closure to investigate local scour problems around the submarine pipeline satisfactory numerical results were obtained in the following work li and cheng 2001 extended the above numerical model to the numerical simulation of self sagging pipelines which yielded satisfactory results liu et al 2016 have successfully developed a numerical model to study the problem of local scour around submarine pipelines under free wave action by solving the n s equations and the sst k ω turbulent model the related results show that the sst k ω turbulence model can achieve accurate simulation of the vortex field and high velocity gradients in the near wall region which guarantees the accuracy of the simulation however the actual situation is that after local scour around the submarine pipeline the scour hole will expand along the axial direction of the pipeline thus forming a suspended pipeline under periodic alternating fluid forces vortex induced vibration can occur for the suspended pipeline especially when the frequency of vortex shedding behind the pipeline approaches the natural frequency of suspended pipelines currently there is little research on local scour around vibrating pipelines based on the best knowledge of the authors the pioneering research work of local scour around vibrating pipelines is the experimental research work of sumer et al 1988 in the laboratory tests of sumer et al 1988 local scour around a pipeline undergo cross flow vibration was studied the experimental study showed that the vibration of the pipeline would result in a large increase of the extent and depth of local scour of the submarine pipeline and the depth of scour below the pipe decreased as the initial distance of the pipe from the bottom bed increased in addition the presence of the scour hole will make the vibration of the pipeline mainly governed by the vortex shedding shen et al 2000 studied local scour around pipelines which allowed simultaneous movement in cross flow direction and in flow direction the maximum depth of scour around a vibrating pipe was 1 5 times greater than the maximum depth of scour around a fixed pipe yang et al 2008 also carried out an experimental study on the coupling of pipeline vibration and local scour and the results showed that the amplitude of pipeline vibration increased with the increase of the distance to the bottom and the depth of scour beneath the pipe was strongly dependent on the approaching velocity gao et al 2006 similarly studied on the scouring around vibrating pipelines under uniform currents zhao and cheng 2010 conducted a numerical study on local scour around the vibrating pipeline by solving the navier stokes equation the structural motion equation and the local sediment transport equations it was found that the maximum scour depth around the vibrating pipeline within its calculation range would be greater than that of the fixed pipeline the maximum depth of scour around the vibrating pipeline was 25 greater than that of the fixed pipe from the above discussion it can be seen that the vibration of the pipeline will increase local scour depth below the pipeline local scour will also have an important impact on the pipeline vibration therefore vibration of the pipeline is an important influence factor when studying the local scour of the submarine pipeline however only the experimental model size pipeline local sediment scour has been studied no research work on local scour of prototype size vibrating pipelines has been reported liang et al 2005 studied the problem of the reynolds number dependence of two dimensional scour beneath offshore pipelines in steady currents numerically it was found that scour depths for prototype pipelines are about 10 15 smaller than those for model pipelines therefore it has value to study local scour around a prototype size pipeline in this paper the problem of local scour around a vibrating pipeline in prototype size will be studied numerically 2 numerical modeling 2 1 flow

streamline upwind finite element method brooks and hughes 1982 is used to discretise the governing equations of fluid flow and sediment transport which has proved to be successful in solving the advection diffusion problems selvam 1997 zhao et al 2007 the time advance for solving the navier stokes equations involves a fractional step formulation meling and dalherim 1997 meneghini et al 2001

pipeline the unstructured meshes are employed in the numerical simulations which allows the fine meshes to be used near the pipeline the minimum distance for first layer of mesh node away from the seabed is set to be y min mesh dependence studies are conducted to check the spatial convergence of the numerical results three values of y min are investigated fig 3 shows local scour profile around a pipeline with three different of meshes where the y min of mesh 1 is 0 0005d y min of mesh 2 is 0 001d y min of mesh 3 is 0 0015d it can be seen from fig 3 that the numerical results of present numerical model agree well with the experimental data of hansen 1986 and that the numerical results of all the three types of meshes show very good agreement which illustrates that present numerical model can be used to study the problem of local scour around pipeline and the present meshes can predict local scour around pipeline well therefore of mesh 2 where y min 0 001d is adopted considering of the calculation efficiency 3 2 vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder in order to verify that present numerical model can be used to study the problem of vortex induced vibration a validation was carried out and compared with the previous results of khalak and williamson 1997 all computational parameters in the simulation are the same as those used in khalak and williamson 1997 i e reynolds number re 12 000 the mass ratio m 2 4 and the mass damping ratio m ξ 0 013 i e ξ 0 0054 fig 4 reveals the relationship between the maximum dimensionless vibration amplitude and the reduced velocity from the comparison results in fig 4 three branches are found namely the initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch the maximum amplitude a the maximum amplitude of the vibration history curve can be about 1 0d and the locked in region is about u r 4 0 to 11 0 where u r is the reduced velocity which can be defined as u r u f n d with u the inlet velocity and f n the nature frequency of the structure the present numerical results agree well with the experimental results of khalak and williamson 1997 therefore numerical model can be used to study vortex induced vibrations in the following discussion 3 3 local scour around a vibrating pipeline sumer et al 1988 investigated the problem of local scour around a vibrating submarine pipeline under uniform current experimentally to verify the present numerical model local scour around a vibrating pipeline with laboratory size was first studied and compared with the experimental results the relevant calculated parameters are shown in table 1 fig 5 gives the profiles of the scour hole around the pipeline at different moments at t 30 min and 243 min respectively it can be seen from the comparison of fig 5 a that the results obtained from the present numerical model have a good agreement with the experiments of sumer et al 1988 this agreement is not only reflected in the scour depth but also in the profile of the scour hole this shows that the model can predict local scour around the vibrating pipeline well it is found that from t 30 min to t 243 min the maximum scour depth below the pipeline has not increased much however the scour profile around the pipeline has changed considerably this can be seen from a a flatter profile downstream of the pipeline b an increase in the transition between the upstream and downstream sections of the pipeline therefore present numerical model can be used to investigate the problem of local scour around vibrating pipelines 4 numerical results from the above discussion it can be seen that present numerical model can predict local scour around a vibrating submarine pipeline well in this study local scour around a 1 0 m diameter vibrating submarine pipeline is studied under velocity u 1 m s the calculated parameters are shown in table 2 since the vibration will lead the pipeline to touch seabed the velocity of the pipeline is set to be 0 m s as the minimum distance of the pipeline from the seabed surface is less than 5 cm 4 1 vibration displacement fig 6 gives the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 9 hz where y is the displacement of the pipeline it can be seen from the figure that the maximum vibration displacement of the pipeline is about 0 01 times the diameter of the pipeline the pipeline displacement in time can be divided into five stages as follows 1 when it is about 0 s 60 s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is small and gradually decreases 2 about 60 s 200 s the vibration is very week the vibration amplitude is almost zero 3 for 200 s t 400 s the vibration amplitude increases and the maximum amplitude increases to about 0 005d 4 about 400 s 500 s the vibration amplitude increases slowly and reach the largest value about 0 01d 5 for t greater than 500 s the pipeline vibration amplitude decreases very slowly with time fig 7 gives the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 2 hz it can be seen from the figure that the maximum vibration displacement of the pipeline is about 0 8d the pipeline displacement can be divided into four stages as follows 1 at about 0 s 100 s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is small and gradually increases 2 about 100 s 450 s the vibration amplitude gradually increases the maximum amplitude increases to about 0 8d and the positive amplitude of the pipeline is significantly greater than the negative amplitude at the time that the pipeline movement will research the bottom seabed 3 about 450 s 1500 s the positive pipeline amplitude is nearly constant while the negative gradually increased to about 0 7d at this stage the pipeline movement will contact the bottom seabed 4 for t greater than 1500 s the pipeline vibration amplitude is almost stable fig 8 shows the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 1 hz it can be seen from the figure that the maximum vibration displacement of the pipeline is about 1 2d the pipeline displacement in time can be divided into two stages as follows 1 when t is about 0 s 500s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is small and the mean location of the vibration is going downing with time which means that the pipeline is sagging with small vibrating amplitude 2 after t 500 s the vibration is very strong the vibration amplitude can even reach 1 2d fig 9 shows the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 05 hz which is different from other cases at the very beginning the amplitude is about 0 3d and the amplitude reduces to almost zero with time for 200 s t 600 s the pipeline sag with time and the mean position of vibration reaches about 0 7d for 600 s t 1200 s the pipeline almost keep fixed for 1200 s t 2200 s the piline goes to upward with the vibration amplitude almost zero for 2200 s t 4000 s vibration amplitude of the pipeline increase very slow and the mean position of vibration reaches about 0 4d for t 4000 s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is very large which is about 0 8d fig 10 shows the dependence of maximum vibration amplitude of the pipeline on the nature frequency it can be seen from fig 10 that lock in occurs around f n 0 07 0 3 hz where the vibration amplitude is very large the maximum vibration amplitude even can be 1 2d and the vibration amplitude is also very larger for very small frequency f n 0 05 hz which is different from 2dof laboratory size pipeline 4 2 scour profile and scour depth fig 11 shows the comparison of the local scour profile of the fixed pipeline and the vibrating pipeline with f n 0 2 hz and 0 05 hz in the equilibrium condition as can be seen from fig 11 the vibrating pipeline has a larger difference in erosion patterns than the fixed pipe which is reflected in the following four aspects 1 the maximum scour depth of the vibrating pipeline can be up to 50 higher than that of the fixed pipeline 2 the maximum scour depth of the vibrating pipeline is located behind the pipeline rather than directly below it 3 the scour range and scour depth behind the vibrating pipeline is significantly higher than that of the fixed pipeline 4 the scour depth and scour extent in front of the vibrating pipeline is less than in the case of fixed pipeline fig 12 shows the dependence of the maximum scour depth around the pipeline on nature frequency the maximum scour depth is about 1 2d under f n 0 1 hz which is shown in fig 12 and the scour depth is very large for f n 0 1 hz for f n 0 3 hz the maximum scour depths are almost the same fig 13 shows the dependence of the maximum scour width around pipeline on natural frequency the maximum x for location where maximum scour depth is about 1 7d which is very small compared with two degrees of freedom 4 0d 4 3 vortex shedding mode from the discussion above it is evident that the local scour in the case of vibrating pipelines is different than in the case of fixed pipelines fig 14 shows the local scour equilibrium for a fixed submarine pipeline with a diameter of 1 0 m at a flow rate of 1 m s the fixed pipeline local vortex shedding fig 14 a d corresponds to the minimum zero maximum and zero moments of the lift force of the fixed pipe local vortex off the pipe situation fig 15 shows the local vortex shedding of the vibrating pipeline for f n 0 2 hz fig 15 a d corresponds to the local vortex shedding of the vibrating pipeline at the minimum zero maximum and zero moments of displacement respectively fig 14 shows a pair of vortices shedding behind the pipe during a lift cycle and overall the vortices is shedding in the direction of water flow the maximum length of the trailing vortex is about 2 0 times the diameter of the pipe from fig 15 a it can be seen that there is positive vorticity a1 shedding around the pipe and they are both positive vorticity a and negative vorticity b from fig 15 b when the pipe continues to move upward the negative vorticity b moves downward and becomes longer and the positive vorticity a falls off from the pipe when the pipe moves to the point of maximum displacement the negative vorticity b splits into vorticity b and vorticity b1 as shown in fig 15 c and d when the pipe moves downward to the original position the negative vorticity b falls off as a result a row of vortices is consisting of vorticity a1 and vorticity b and another row of vortices consisting of vorticity a and vorticity b1 are formed at the rear of the pipeline under the calculated conditions in this paper the local vorticity length of the vibrating pipe is shorter overall than in the stationary case which makes the bottom bed shear stress greater than in the fixed pipe case which in turn leads to a deeper scouring depth behind the vibrating pipe than in the fixed pipe case 5 conclusions a numerical model was developed by solving the navier stokes equation for incompressible viscous fluids with the sst k ω turbulent closure both the sediment transport equations and the pipeline vibration equation are considered the results are compared with published data to demonstrate the validity of the model the local scour problem of the prototype pipeline is investigated numerically using the numerical model developed the numerical result of present study shows that 1 the maximum vibration amplitude of the pipeline can reach about 1 2d for the process of coupling of local scour and vibration 2 the place where the maximum scour depth occurred is in the wake side of the pipeline which is different from the case of fixed pipeline 3 the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 05 hz is different from other cases it takes very long times for the pipeline to start vibration under f n 0 05 hz credit authorship contribution

local scour around the submarine pipeline the simulation results showed that the data obtained from numerical simulations agreed well with the laboratory results in trends but results were not in good agreement in scour profiles thereafter li and cheng 2000 developed a new numerical model solving navier stokes equations with the large eddy simulation turbulent model closure to investigate local scour problems around the submarine pipeline satisfactory numerical results were obtained in the following work li and cheng 2001 extended the above numerical model to the numerical simulation of self sagging pipelines which yielded satisfactory results liu et al 2016 have successfully developed a numerical model to study the problem of local scour around submarine pipelines under free wave action by solving the n s equations and the sst k ω turbulent model the related results show that the sst k ω turbulence model can achieve accurate simulation of the vortex field and high velocity gradients in the near wall region which guarantees the accuracy of the simulation however the actual situation is that after local scour around the submarine pipeline the scour hole will expand along the axial direction of the pipeline thus forming a suspended pipeline under periodic alternating fluid forces vortex induced vibration can occur for the suspended pipeline especially when the frequency of vortex shedding behind the pipeline approaches the natural frequency of suspended pipelines currently there is little research on local scour around vibrating pipelines based on the best knowledge of the authors the pioneering research work of local scour around vibrating pipelines is the experimental research work of sumer et al 1988 in the laboratory tests of sumer et al 1988 local scour around a pipeline undergo cross flow vibration was studied the experimental study showed that the vibration of the pipeline would result in a large increase of the extent and depth of local scour of the submarine pipeline and the depth of scour below the pipe decreased as the initial distance of the pipe from the bottom bed increased in addition the presence of the scour hole will make the vibration of the pipeline mainly governed by the vortex shedding shen et al 2000 studied local scour around pipelines which allowed simultaneous movement in cross flow direction and in flow direction the maximum depth of scour around a vibrating pipe was 1 5 times greater than the maximum depth of scour around a fixed pipe yang et al 2008 also carried out an experimental study on the coupling of pipeline vibration and local scour and the results showed that the amplitude of pipeline vibration increased with the increase of the distance to the bottom and the depth of scour beneath the pipe was strongly dependent on the approaching velocity gao et al 2006 similarly studied on the scouring around vibrating pipelines under uniform currents zhao and cheng 2010 conducted a numerical study on local scour around the vibrating pipeline by solving the navier stokes equation the structural motion equation and the local sediment transport equations it was found that the maximum scour depth around the vibrating pipeline within its calculation range would be greater than that of the fixed pipeline the maximum depth of scour around the vibrating pipeline was 25 greater than that of the fixed pipe from the above discussion it can be seen that the vibration of the pipeline will increase local scour depth below the pipeline local scour will also have an important impact on the pipeline vibration therefore vibration of the pipeline is an important influence factor when studying the local scour of the submarine pipeline however only the experimental model size pipeline local sediment scour has been studied no research work on local scour of prototype size vibrating pipelines has been reported liang et al 2005 studied the problem of the reynolds number dependence of two dimensional scour beneath offshore pipelines in steady currents numerically it was found that scour depths for prototype pipelines are about 10 15 smaller than those for model pipelines therefore it has value to study local scour around a prototype size pipeline in this paper the problem of local scour around a vibrating pipeline in prototype size will be studied numerically 2 numerical modeling 2 1 flow

streamline upwind finite element method brooks and hughes 1982 is used to discretise the governing equations of fluid flow and sediment transport which has proved to be successful in solving the advection diffusion problems selvam 1997 zhao et al 2007 the time advance for solving the navier stokes equations involves a fractional step formulation meling and dalherim 1997 meneghini et al 2001

pipeline the unstructured meshes are employed in the numerical simulations which allows the fine meshes to be used near the pipeline the minimum distance for first layer of mesh node away from the seabed is set to be y min mesh dependence studies are conducted to check the spatial convergence of the numerical results three values of y min are investigated fig 3 shows local scour profile around a pipeline with three different of meshes where the y min of mesh 1 is 0 0005d y min of mesh 2 is 0 001d y min of mesh 3 is 0 0015d it can be seen from fig 3 that the numerical results of present numerical model agree well with the experimental data of hansen 1986 and that the numerical results of all the three types of meshes show very good agreement which illustrates that present numerical model can be used to study the problem of local scour around pipeline and the present meshes can predict local scour around pipeline well therefore of mesh 2 where y min 0 001d is adopted considering of the calculation efficiency 3 2 vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder in order to verify that present numerical model can be used to study the problem of vortex induced vibration a validation was carried out and compared with the previous results of khalak and williamson 1997 all computational parameters in the simulation are the same as those used in khalak and williamson 1997 i e reynolds number re 12 000 the mass ratio m 2 4 and the mass damping ratio m ξ 0 013 i e ξ 0 0054 fig 4 reveals the relationship between the maximum dimensionless vibration amplitude and the reduced velocity from the comparison results in fig 4 three branches are found namely the initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch the maximum amplitude a the maximum amplitude of the vibration history curve can be about 1 0d and the locked in region is about u r 4 0 to 11 0 where u r is the reduced velocity which can be defined as u r u f n d with u the inlet velocity and f n the nature frequency of the structure the present numerical results agree well with the experimental results of khalak and williamson 1997 therefore numerical model can be used to study vortex induced vibrations in the following discussion 3 3 local scour around a vibrating pipeline sumer et al 1988 investigated the problem of local scour around a vibrating submarine pipeline under uniform current experimentally to verify the present numerical model local scour around a vibrating pipeline with laboratory size was first studied and compared with the experimental results the relevant calculated parameters are shown in table 1 fig 5 gives the profiles of the scour hole around the pipeline at different moments at t 30 min and 243 min respectively it can be seen from the comparison of fig 5 a that the results obtained from the present numerical model have a good agreement with the experiments of sumer et al 1988 this agreement is not only reflected in the scour depth but also in the profile of the scour hole this shows that the model can predict local scour around the vibrating pipeline well it is found that from t 30 min to t 243 min the maximum scour depth below the pipeline has not increased much however the scour profile around the pipeline has changed considerably this can be seen from a a flatter profile downstream of the pipeline b an increase in the transition between the upstream and downstream sections of the pipeline therefore present numerical model can be used to investigate the problem of local scour around vibrating pipelines 4 numerical results from the above discussion it can be seen that present numerical model can predict local scour around a vibrating submarine pipeline well in this study local scour around a 1 0 m diameter vibrating submarine pipeline is studied under velocity u 1 m s the calculated parameters are shown in table 2 since the vibration will lead the pipeline to touch seabed the velocity of the pipeline is set to be 0 m s as the minimum distance of the pipeline from the seabed surface is less than 5 cm 4 1 vibration displacement fig 6 gives the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 9 hz where y is the displacement of the pipeline it can be seen from the figure that the maximum vibration displacement of the pipeline is about 0 01 times the diameter of the pipeline the pipeline displacement in time can be divided into five stages as follows 1 when it is about 0 s 60 s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is small and gradually decreases 2 about 60 s 200 s the vibration is very week the vibration amplitude is almost zero 3 for 200 s t 400 s the vibration amplitude increases and the maximum amplitude increases to about 0 005d 4 about 400 s 500 s the vibration amplitude increases slowly and reach the largest value about 0 01d 5 for t greater than 500 s the pipeline vibration amplitude decreases very slowly with time fig 7 gives the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 2 hz it can be seen from the figure that the maximum vibration displacement of the pipeline is about 0 8d the pipeline displacement can be divided into four stages as follows 1 at about 0 s 100 s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is small and gradually increases 2 about 100 s 450 s the vibration amplitude gradually increases the maximum amplitude increases to about 0 8d and the positive amplitude of the pipeline is significantly greater than the negative amplitude at the time that the pipeline movement will research the bottom seabed 3 about 450 s 1500 s the positive pipeline amplitude is nearly constant while the negative gradually increased to about 0 7d at this stage the pipeline movement will contact the bottom seabed 4 for t greater than 1500 s the pipeline vibration amplitude is almost stable fig 8 shows the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 1 hz it can be seen from the figure that the maximum vibration displacement of the pipeline is about 1 2d the pipeline displacement in time can be divided into two stages as follows 1 when t is about 0 s 500s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is small and the mean location of the vibration is going downing with time which means that the pipeline is sagging with small vibrating amplitude 2 after t 500 s the vibration is very strong the vibration amplitude can even reach 1 2d fig 9 shows the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 05 hz which is different from other cases at the very beginning the amplitude is about 0 3d and the amplitude reduces to almost zero with time for 200 s t 600 s the pipeline sag with time and the mean position of vibration reaches about 0 7d for 600 s t 1200 s the pipeline almost keep fixed for 1200 s t 2200 s the piline goes to upward with the vibration amplitude almost zero for 2200 s t 4000 s vibration amplitude of the pipeline increase very slow and the mean position of vibration reaches about 0 4d for t 4000 s the vibration amplitude of the pipeline is very large which is about 0 8d fig 10 shows the dependence of maximum vibration amplitude of the pipeline on the nature frequency it can be seen from fig 10 that lock in occurs around f n 0 07 0 3 hz where the vibration amplitude is very large the maximum vibration amplitude even can be 1 2d and the vibration amplitude is also very larger for very small frequency f n 0 05 hz which is different from 2dof laboratory size pipeline 4 2 scour profile and scour depth fig 11 shows the comparison of the local scour profile of the fixed pipeline and the vibrating pipeline with f n 0 2 hz and 0 05 hz in the equilibrium condition as can be seen from fig 11 the vibrating pipeline has a larger difference in erosion patterns than the fixed pipe which is reflected in the following four aspects 1 the maximum scour depth of the vibrating pipeline can be up to 50 higher than that of the fixed pipeline 2 the maximum scour depth of the vibrating pipeline is located behind the pipeline rather than directly below it 3 the scour range and scour depth behind the vibrating pipeline is significantly higher than that of the fixed pipeline 4 the scour depth and scour extent in front of the vibrating pipeline is less than in the case of fixed pipeline fig 12 shows the dependence of the maximum scour depth around the pipeline on nature frequency the maximum scour depth is about 1 2d under f n 0 1 hz which is shown in fig 12 and the scour depth is very large for f n 0 1 hz for f n 0 3 hz the maximum scour depths are almost the same fig 13 shows the dependence of the maximum scour width around pipeline on natural frequency the maximum x for location where maximum scour depth is about 1 7d which is very small compared with two degrees of freedom 4 0d 4 3 vortex shedding mode from the discussion above it is evident that the local scour in the case of vibrating pipelines is different than in the case of fixed pipelines fig 14 shows the local scour equilibrium for a fixed submarine pipeline with a diameter of 1 0 m at a flow rate of 1 m s the fixed pipeline local vortex shedding fig 14 a d corresponds to the minimum zero maximum and zero moments of the lift force of the fixed pipe local vortex off the pipe situation fig 15 shows the local vortex shedding of the vibrating pipeline for f n 0 2 hz fig 15 a d corresponds to the local vortex shedding of the vibrating pipeline at the minimum zero maximum and zero moments of displacement respectively fig 14 shows a pair of vortices shedding behind the pipe during a lift cycle and overall the vortices is shedding in the direction of water flow the maximum length of the trailing vortex is about 2 0 times the diameter of the pipe from fig 15 a it can be seen that there is positive vorticity a1 shedding around the pipe and they are both positive vorticity a and negative vorticity b from fig 15 b when the pipe continues to move upward the negative vorticity b moves downward and becomes longer and the positive vorticity a falls off from the pipe when the pipe moves to the point of maximum displacement the negative vorticity b splits into vorticity b and vorticity b1 as shown in fig 15 c and d when the pipe moves downward to the original position the negative vorticity b falls off as a result a row of vortices is consisting of vorticity a1 and vorticity b and another row of vortices consisting of vorticity a and vorticity b1 are formed at the rear of the pipeline under the calculated conditions in this paper the local vorticity length of the vibrating pipe is shorter overall than in the stationary case which makes the bottom bed shear stress greater than in the fixed pipe case which in turn leads to a deeper scouring depth behind the vibrating pipe than in the fixed pipe case 5 conclusions a numerical model was developed by solving the navier stokes equation for incompressible viscous fluids with the sst k ω turbulent closure both the sediment transport equations and the pipeline vibration equation are considered the results are compared with published data to demonstrate the validity of the model the local scour problem of the prototype pipeline is investigated numerically using the numerical model developed the numerical result of present study shows that 1 the maximum vibration amplitude of the pipeline can reach about 1 2d for the process of coupling of local scour and vibration 2 the place where the maximum scour depth occurred is in the wake side of the pipeline which is different from the case of fixed pipeline 3 the time history of the vibration displacement for f n 0 05 hz is different from other cases it takes very long times for the pipeline to start vibration under f n 0 05 hz credit authorship contribution

21116,at present although there are a large number of studies on the hydroelastic analysis of ship propellers almost all of them neglect the shaft thus ignoring the influence of the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft therefore considering this coupling effect a new hydrodynamic analysis model of propellers is established by using the boundary element method bem coupled finite element method fem and then the model is verified by some experiments on the water tunnel test bench finally based on this model the influence of the structural coupling effect on propellers hydroelastic performance is mainly studied the results show that when the structural coupling effect is ignored the relative errors of the first order jellyfish mode of the blade the dynamic stress at the blade root and the longitudinal bearing force of the propeller are as high as 22 78 28 04 and 20 37 respectively therefore the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft should be considered when analyzing the propellers hydroelastic response further when designing the propeller shaft system this coupling effect can also be fully utilized to reasonably match the parameters of the propeller and the shaft to optimize the hydroelastic performance of propellers keywords fluid structure interaction hydroelasticity propeller shaft bearing systems boundary element method finite element method 1 introduction due to the inhomogeneity of the incoming flow field the fluid excitation force will inevitably be generated when the ship propellers work propeller excitation force has adverse effects on the ship first of all the propeller excitation force will cause the propeller blades to vibrate and cause fatigue damage if the frequency component in the excitation force is consistent with the natural frequency of the blade it will cause the blade to resonate and in severe cases the blade will break secondly the propeller excitation force will cause bending longitudinal and torsional vibration of the shaft which will easily lead to fatigue instability of the shaft finally the propeller excitation force is easy to cause the hull vibration which leads to fatigue damage of hull structure and produces vibration noise vibration and noise will reduce the comfort of the ship to solve this problem it is necessary to deeply analyze the hydroelastic performance of the propeller in the non uniform flow field including the prediction of blade deformation blade dynamic stress and propeller bearing force usually the hydrodynamic force causes the blade to deform and the blade deformation will affect the flow field in turn so there is a fluid solid coupling effect between the fluid and the propeller at present many researchers have studied the hydroelastic performance of propellers for example ghassemi et al 2015 studied the hydroelastic performances of a composite marine propeller under the uniform flow field the finite volume method fvm and finite element method fem were used das and kapuria kapuria and das 2018 das and kapuria 2016 investigated the bend twist coupling characteristics of a full scale composite marine propeller the fvm and fem were also used ghassemi et al 2012 analyzed the effects of skew angles on the hydroelastic performance of a composite propeller in their studies the boundary element method bem and fem were used ghassabzadeh et al morteza et al 2013 did similar work using the bem and fem young 2007 2008 used bem and fem to study the hydroelastic performance of propellers under a non uniform flow field he et al 2012 investigated the hydroelastic optimization of a composite marine propeller in the non uniform wake lee et al 2014 2017 studied the hydroelastic analysis of marine propellers based on a bem fem coupled fsi algorithm similarly li et al 2017 analyzed the hydroelastic analysis of an elastic marine propeller by using a coupled bem fem algorithm however in the literature mentioned above it is assumed that the root of the hub is fixed thus ignoring the influence of the shaft on the hydroelastic performance of the propeller this may cause errors zou et al 2019 2020 because of this the purpose of this study is to establish a new propeller hydroelastic analysis model that can consider the influence of the shaft and to study the influence of the shaft on the hydroelastic performance of the propeller the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model is described in section 2 in section 3 the mathematical model is verified through several experiments on a gravity type water tunnel test rig in section 4 numerical analysis of a propeller shaft bearing system in practical engineering is studied some discussions and important conclusions are presented in section 5 and section 6 2 mathematical model in this study the boundary element method kinnas et al 2012 2015 greco et al 2014 bem also known as panel method is applied to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure of the propeller the finite element method fem is used to calculate the deformation and stress of the propeller as shown in fig 1 a propeller subjected to an effective inflow wake v 0 is considered so the inflow velocity v i n on the propeller can be written as 1 v i n v 0 ω r where r is the position vector of a point q on the propeller surface s b the perturbation velocity potential φ can be expressed as 2 2 φ 0 on the propeller surface s b the kinematic boundary condition should be satisfied 3 φ n q v i n v b n q where n q is the unit normal vector of the propeller surface and v b is the vibration velocity of the blade surface it contains both the vibration velocity of the blade itself and the rigid body velocity with the vibration of the shaft the pressure on the propeller surface consists of two parts one part is the pressure caused by the rigid blade in the non uniform flow field the other part is the pressure caused by the elastic blade in the uniform flow field when the deformation of the blade is small the two parts of the pressure can be calculated separately young 2007 hylarides 1979 then the perturbation velocity potential φ could be linearly decomposed into two parts young 2007 kuo 1984 4 φ φ ϕ where φ denotes the perturbation velocity potential due to the rigid blade in the non uniform flow field and ϕ denotes the perturbation velocity potential due to the elastic blade in the uniform flow field therefore the flow field analysis could be split into two problems as follows 5 2 φ 0 φ n q v i n n q p φ p 0 ρ 1 2 v i n 2 φ t 1 2 v i n φ 2 6 2 ϕ 0 ϕ n q v b n q p ϕ ρ ϕ t v i n ϕ where p φ is the pressure due to φ p ϕ is the pressure due to ϕ p 0 is the static pressure at infinity ρ is the density of water eq 5 makes up the classical hydrodynamics of the rigid propeller in the non uniform flow field eq 6 is the problem of an elastic propeller operating in the uniform flow field and the fluid structure interaction is only related to it eq 5 and eq 6 can be solved numerically by dividing the blades and the wake surface s w into many small hyperbolic quadrilateral panels where constant strength dipoles and sources are distributed fig 2 shows panel arrangements on the surface of the propeller and the surface of the wake s w as can be seen that the wake surface s w is assumed to be linear and its shape is a prescribed helical surface zou et al 2017 su and huang 2013 the structure model is modeled by the fem belegundu and chandrupatla 2002 a schematic diagram for a propeller shafting bearings system is illustrated in fig 3 it consists of a shaft propeller back stern bearing front stern bearing middle bearing and thrust bearing in the fem the blade is simulated with 20 node solid elements since the thickness of the blade edge is zero a wedge element is selected at the edge as shown in fig 4 c it is based on a condensation of the 20 node solid element zienkiewicz et al 2005 fig 5 is an enlarged view of the fem mesh of a single blade each blade is divided into 5 elements in the thickness direction 25 elements in chord direction and 60 elements in the radial direction totaling 7500 elements as shown in fig 4 b the bem has only four nodes per panel while the fem has eight nodes per face to ensure that the results between the fem and the bem can be transferred to each other accurately and quickly in fluid structure interaction the four corners of the fem element surface exactly coincide with the four vertices of the bem panel the shaft is simulated with timoshenko beam elements which have six degrees of freedom three translation and three rotation degrees of freedom because the hub is interference fit with the shaft the hub is considered to be a part of the shaft the bearings are modeled by springs and damping elements which stiffness and damping could see in table a 3 of appendix a fig 6 is a schematic diagram of a fe model of a propeller shaft bearing system its dynamic equation can be written as follows the other loads such as centrifugal forces are assumed to be zero and only the hydrodynamic load is considered 7 m u c u k u f φ f ϕ where u u and u are the nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively f φ is the hydrodynamic force due to the rigid blade operating in the non uniform flow field f ϕ is the hydrodynamic force due to the elastic blade in the uniform flow field the hydrodynamic force vectors f φ and f ϕ are computed as 8 f φ n t p φ d s f ϕ n t p ϕ d s where p φ and p ϕ are computed by eqs 5 and 6 it can be seen that the hydrodynamic force vector f ϕ is dependent on the structure motion accelerations u and velocities u which are obtained from the fem analysis in turn to solve the accelerations u and velocities u the fem analysis requires the hydrodynamic force vectors f ϕ which are obtained from the bem analysis in this process fluid structure interaction happens furthermore the structure motion dependent hydroelastic force f ϕ could be further expressed as added mass matrix m a and added damping matrix c a the detailed derivation can be referred to the literature zou et al 2017 then eq 7 can be written as 9 m m a u c c a u k u f φ it should be pointed out that the fem model bem model and their coupling calculation are all realized in matlab software with the help of matlab a software package for calculating the fluid solid coupling of the propeller shaft system has been developed by us 3 model validation this section verifies the correctness of the model and codes presented in this study through several experiments these experiments have been done in the water tunnel fig 7 is a schematic of the design scheme and fig 8 is the product of the experimental platform processed according to fig 7 it consists of a pump water tank groundwater reservoir propeller shaft bearing system and experiment section and so on the experiment section is made of high strength plexiglas and its size is 7 m 0 7 m 0 7 m when the water tunnel is in operation the water pump pumps the water from the reservoir into the water tank the water then accelerates into the experimental section under gravity and finally flows back into the reservoir if the pump operates at full load the maximum flow velocity in the experimental section can reach 4 5 m s the maximum rotation velocity of the propeller shaft bearing system can reach 1200 rpm propeller 4381 is used in the experiment whose geometric parameters can refer to reference carlton 2012 the parameters of the propeller shaft bearing system are shown in table 1 three experiments have been completed including a blade stress test resonant frequency test of the propeller shaft system in air and water and longitudinal bearing force test when the propeller is in a non uniform incoming flow field the details are described below 3 1 stress test of blade the first experiment is to test the stress of 4381 propeller under static loads as shown in fig 9 a two 45 degree strain flowers are arranged on the face and back of the blade respectively and their positions are shown in table 2 loads parallel to the x axis are applied at different positions of the blade the weight is 2 kg the diagram of load application is shown in fig 9 b and c a total of four different loads are applied and the positions are shown in table 3 the von mises stresses measured by 45 degree strain flowers are compared with the calculated results of the present model the comparison results are shown in table 4 from the table it can be seen that the maximum relative error is 7 62 indicating the validity of the fem model and the codes the main error sources are as follows 1 firstly in the theoretical calculation the number of fem meshes and the selection of material parameters will cause errors 2 secondly in the experimental test the propeller processing will produce errors at the same time signal acquisition during the test will also produce measurement errors 3 besides for the specified measuring points and load application points there may be no nodes so the nodes closest to these specified points are used instead this processing will also produce errors at the same time the dynamic stress in the non uniform flow field is also measured and compared with theoretical calculations to measure the dynamic stress a waterproof dynamic strain acquisition instrument is developed as shown in fig 10 the instrument is fixed at the end of the shaft and rotates together it contains a battery and can work for a long time without an external energy supply dynamic strain data can be stored in the instrument in real time the strain gauge is covered with a thin layer of waterproof glue during the experiment the non uniform flow field is shown in fig 17 and the experimental speed is 320 rpm fig 11 a and fig 12 a are time domain comparisons of the maximum principal stress between the measure and the theoretical calculation average values are removed the waveforms of the experiment and calculation are very similar through the frequency spectrum analysis it is known that the frequency components in the theoretical calculation are mainly the blade frequency i e 5 times the rotation frequency and some other low frequencies but the experimental measurement contains a lot of high frequency components which may come from turbulence excitation in the flow field and friction excitation of water lubricated rubber bearings etc these factors cannot be considered in the calculation model therefore the experimental and calculated results are filtered simultaneously and only the first order blade frequency is extracted as shown in figs 11 b and fig 12 b it can be seen that the two agree well further table 5 gives a comparison of the amplitudes of the dynamic stresses at the first order blade frequency in general the dynamic stress testing can prove that the fluid solid coupling dynamic model established in this paper is effective 3 2 resonant frequencies test of the propeller shaft system the second experiment is to test the resonant frequencies of the 4381 propeller shaft system in air and water as shown in fig 13 acceleration sensors are installed on the blades and the shaft the resonant frequencies and acceleration frequency response functions frf of the system are measured by using a force hammer to excite the blades and the shaft then the experimental results are compared with the calculated results of the model established in this study considering that the mass of the acceleration sensors influences the resonant frequencies of blades the acceleration sensors mass is also considered in the theoretical calculation table 6 shows the comparison between experimental results and theoretical results for the first longitudinal resonant frequency of the shaft and the first bending resonant frequency of the blade it can be seen that the maximum relative error is 5 36 further fig 14 and fig 15 are the measured and calculated results of a blade acceleration frequency response function frf it also can be seen that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results therefore it shows the correctness of the model established in this study the main reasons for the errors are the same as the blade stress test in the previous section which will not be explained here it can also be seen from table 6 that the added mass caused by fluid has a great influence on the first resonant frequency of the blade which is reduced by about 40 this conclusion is close to the previously published literature young and liu 2008 3 3 longitudinal bearing force test of the propeller shaft system the third experiment is to test the longitudinal bearing force of the propeller shaft system under a non uniform flow field in order to make the propeller produce as large a longitudinal bearing force as possible for a 5 bladed propeller a 5 cycle wake screen is designed and manufactured as shown in fig 16 the detailed manufacturing process of the 5 cycle wake screen can be referred to reference zou 2017 the wake screen is installed 0 6m in front of the propeller the velocity distribution of the inhomogeneous flow field at the propeller plane is measured by the laser doppler velocimeter ldv system the test results are shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the non uniform flow field contains an obvious fifth order harmonic component which indicates that the 5 cycle wake screen constructed meets the requirements the longitudinal displacement of the shaft near the thrust bearing is measured then as shown in eq 10 the longitudinal bearing force transmitted to the thrust bearing base through the propeller shaft system is obtained and dimensionless 10 f x f x ρ n 2 d 4 k t a ρ n 2 d 4 where f x is the longitudinal bearing force n a is the vibration displacement near the thrust bearing m k t is the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing nm 1 and is shown in table 1 ρ is the density of water kgm 3 n is the longitudinal bearing force frequency rps and d is the diameter of the propeller m at the same time the non uniform flow field measured in fig 17 is substituted into the fluid solid coupling calculation model presented in this study then the theoretical results are obtained and compared with the experimental test results in the experiment the propellers are tested at 320 rpm 450 rpm and 600 rpm respectively at each rotation speed the inflow velocity v 0 is always 1 5 m s fig 18 a fig 19 a and fig 20 a are time domain comparisons of longitudinal bearing force between experiment and calculation at 320 rpm 450 rpm and 600 rpm respectively as can be seen from these figures the waveforms of the two are very similar according to spectrum analysis in the theoretical calculation the frequency components of the bearing force are mainly the blade frequency i e 5 times the rotation frequency with a small amount of the 2 times blade frequency in the experiment besides the blade frequency and its multiplier the bearing force contains obvious rotation frequency components which are caused by some factors such as bearing friction excitation and propeller eccentricity rather than non uniform inflow field these factors will cause the shaft to do longitudinal vibration and the vibration frequency is mainly rotating frequency chen 1987 this is also the reason why the rotation frequency components in the experiment increase with the increase of the rotation speed of the shaft at the same time many small high frequency components may come from turbulence excitation in the flow field and friction excitation of water lubricated rubber bearings etc to compare with the theoretical results the experimental and calculation results are filtered and the first order blade frequency and 2 times blade frequency components are extracted the comparison results are shown in figs 18 b fig 19 b and fig 20 b as can be seen from these figures the calculated results are highly consistent with the measured results further for the amplitude of the blade frequency component table 7 shows the comparisons between experimental results and calculation results at different rotational speeds it can be seen from the table that the maximum relative error is 15 19 indicating the correctness of the model established in this paper to sum up from these experiments it can be found that there is a very good accuracy between the theoretical results and the experiment results suggesting the validity of the model established in this study besides in our previous published papers the hydrodynamic model has been verified through a large number of numerical examples including prediction of open water performance of rigid propellers under uniform inflow unsteady pressure of rigid propellers under nonuniform inflow and bearing forces of rigid propellers under simple motion for more details please refer to references zou et al 2017 zou 2017 4 simulation results in this section the presented fluid structure coupling dynamics model of the propeller shaft bearing system is applied to investigate the hydroelastic performance of a propeller under a non uniform flow field in section 3 the experimental model is a small sized propeller and its function is only to prove the validity of the fluid solid coupling model established in this paper however on the one hand this small sized propeller is rare in real ships especially large ships on the other hand the experimental results in table 6 show that the resonant frequency of this small sized propeller is very high so it is difficult to reflect the dynamic characteristics of propellers on large ships especially the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft which is the focus of this paper therefore different from the experimental model in section 3 a propeller shaft system whose geometric and physical parameters refer to a cargo ship chen 1987 is studied the diameter of the propeller is 4 m and the length of the shaft is 20 m the detailed geometry and material parameters are shown in table a of appendix a the main parameters come from the reference chen 1987 for convenience the shaft is assumed to be a uniform cross section beam 4 1 resonant frequency analysis first the resonant frequencies of the propeller shaft system are analyzed from eq 9 it is known that the undamped resonant frequencies satisfy the following expression 11 λ m m a k φ 0 where λ 4 π 2 f 2 f is the resonant frequency hz and φ is the corresponding mode shape m a is the added mass due to the fluid in our analysis in order to study the influence of the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft on the propellers resonant frequencies two cases are studied one is consideration of the shaft namely the whole propeller shaft bearings system and the other is not consideration of the shaft only the propeller with the root fixed table 8 shows the calculated resonant frequencies fig 21 shows the mode shapes of the propeller without the shaft and fig 22 shows these mode shapes with the shaft it can be seen that the propeller mode shapes can be divided into two types one is the jellyfish mode which shows that all blades vibrate in one direction at the same time with obvious circumferential symmetry such as figs 21 e and fig 22 e the second type is the non jellyfish mode which shows that some blades vibrate and some blades hardly vibrate such as fig 21 a d and fig 22 a to d this classification is consistent with the conclusion of previous research literature xiong et al 2016 lou et al 2016 lei et al 2016 sarkani and szilagyi 1991 in these references the jellyfish modes are also called umbrella modes xiong et al 2016 lou et al 2016 sarkani and szilagyi 1991 or in phase modes lei et al 2016 it also can be seen that the values of the first five resonant frequencies of the propeller are the same due to symmetry when the shaft is not considered however after considering the shaft there is a significant structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft so that the resonant frequencies of the propeller are changed for example there is a coupling between the propeller and the bending vibration of the shaft which changes the non jellyfish modes of the blades from 27 25 hz to 26 19 hz reducing 1 06 hz similarly the blades are coupled to the longitudinal vibration of the shaft which changes the jellyfish mode from 27 25 hz to 35 29 hz increasing by 8 04 hz fig 23 further shows the non jellyfish mode shapes of the propeller when the blades are coupled to the bending vibration of the shaft as can be seen from the figure the mode shape is dominated by the propeller and contains a small amount of bending vibration of the shaft it can be seen from the above analysis that the structural coupling effect has an important influence on the jellyfish mode and when the shaft is ignored its relative error reaches 22 78 besides the resonant frequencies of the propeller shaft system are also calculated using ansys software in ansys the blade and the shaft are simulated by solid95 and beam188 elements respectively the added mass caused by the fluid is simulated by fluid221 element the comparisons are shown in table 9 it is seen that the calculation results by the present model are close to those of ansys and the maximum relative error is 0 51 which further shows the correctness of the model established in this study 4 2 dynamic stress analysis second the dynamic stress of the blade under the non uniform flow field is studied the effective inflow wake v 0 is assumed to be 12 v x θ u 0 1 b cos 10 θ sin 10 θ where θ is zero vertically upward and positive clockwise when looking downstream u 0 is the ship speed b is a constant which indicates the non uniform level of the flow field in this study b is set equal to 0 005 this study analyzes the blade dynamic stress when the propeller rotation speed is 60 rpm and 150 rpm when the propeller angular velocity ω changes the ship speed u 0 also changes so that the advance coefficient j is always 0 889 similarly two cases are studied and one considers the shaft and the other is not consideration of the shaft in these two cases the maximum principal stresses of six specified points on blades r r 0 3 s c 0 5 r r 0 7 s c 0 5 r r 0 9 s c 0 5 r r 0 7 s c 0 3 r r 0 7 s c 0 7 r r 0 7 s c 0 9 are investigated and compared eq 9 is solved with the step by step procedure in time domain and the newmark beta method is used clough and penzien 2003 some revolutions are calculated to make sure that the transient solutions decay to zero and the results of the last revolution are shown only one blade dynamic stresses are shown because the difference between them is only the phase delay fig 24 is the dynamic stresses of the six specified points on one blade when the propeller makes one revolution under angular velocity 60 rpm it should be noted that only the dynamic components are displayed and all the static components are removed from this figure it is known that the max amplitude is 3 82 mpa at the top point r r 0 9 s c 0 5 2 67 mpa at the middle point r r 0 7 s c 0 5 0 74 mpa at the root point r r 0 3 s c 0 5 when the shaft is considered on the contrary the max amplitude is only 1 84 mpa 0 99 mpa and 0 04 mpa at these points when the shaft is ignored so the differences of the dynamic stresses between the case with shaft and the case without shaft are large further table 10 shows the maximum dynamic stress amplitude and the relative errors when the shaft is considered or not it is known that the dynamic stress of blades considering the shaft is larger than that without the shaft at the same time ignoring the shaft will lead to large stress errors for example the maximum relative error is 94 59 fig 25 is the dynamic stresses of the six specified points when the angular velocity of the propeller is 150 rpm from this figure it is known that the max amplitude is 45 87 mpa at the top point r r 0 9 s c 0 5 22 98 mpa at the middle point r r 0 7 s c 0 5 1 07 mpa at the root point r r 0 3 s c 0 5 when the shaft is considered on the contrary the max amplitude is only 73 76 mpa 38 27 mpa and 1 37 mpa at these points when the shaft is neglected further table 11 shows the maximum dynamic stress amplitude and the relative errors it is known that the dynamic stress of blades considering the shaft is smaller than that without the shaft at the same time ignoring the shaft will lead to large stress errors for example the maximum relative error is 92 89 as can be seen from the above analysis the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has an important influence on the dynamic stress of the blade it may increase or reduce the dynamic stress depending on the vibration phase of the blade and the shaft for example if they are out phase then the dynamic stress of blades will increase therefore we can use this coupling effect to optimize the dynamic stress of the blade 4 3 longitudinal bearing force analysis as mentioned in the introduction the bearing force is one of the important causes of hull vibration so the research of the bearing forces is very important for the hull design and vibration control especially for the submarine therefore the bearing forces are also studied in this section since the non uniform flow field assumed in this study as shown in eq 12 only produces longitudinal bearing force and pulsating torque the longitudinal bearing force that is more likely to cause hull vibration and noise will be focused on in this study the longitudinal bearing force in three cases is calculated in the first case the shaft is not considered and the blade is rigid at present most scholars use this method to study the propeller bearing force dubbioso et al 2017 ortolani et al 2015 abbas et al 2015 in the second case the shaft is not considered but the blade is elastic in the third case the shaft and the elastic effect of the blade are considered simultaneously that is the bearing force is calculated by using the model presented in this study the calculated bearing force is dimensionless by eq 10 fig 26 is a comparison of time domain results of longitudinal bearing force in three cases and table 12 shows the comparison of their amplitudes the following two conclusions can be seen from the figure and table 1 when the shaft is not considered the differences between the bearing force of the rigid propeller and that of the elastic propeller are very small at 60 rpm however at 150 rpm the bearing force of the elastic propeller is larger than that of the rigid propeller this is because at 60 rpm the bearing force frequency is 10hz which is much smaller than the first resonant frequency of the blade as shown in table 8 they are 27 25hz and then the blade elastic effect has little influence on the longitudinal bearing force when the rotation speed of the propeller is 150 rpm the exciting force frequency is 25hz which is close to the first resonant frequency of the blade so the longitudinal bearing force is significantly amplified 2 at 60 rpm the bearing force of the elastic propeller with the shaft is larger than that of the elastic propeller without the shaft while at 150 rpm the opposite is true this is because the dynamic characteristics of the shaft have an amplification effect on the bearing force so the bearing force considered the shaft is larger at 60 rpm at the same time the structural coupling effect between the shaft and the propeller makes the jellyfish mode that can amplify the longitudinal bearing force zou 2017 change from 27 25hz to 35 29hz therefore at 150 rpm the longitudinal bearing force without considering the shaft is larger instead further table 12 gives the relative error of longitudinal bearing force when the blade elasticity or the shaft is not considered it can be seen that the maximum relative error is 20 37 therefore when analyzing the propeller bearing force it is necessary to consider both the influence of the blade elasticity and the structural coupling effect in summary from the above analysis results it is known that the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has an important influence on the propellers hydroelastic performance such as the resonant frequency dynamic stress and longitudinal bearing force 5 discussion at present although many researchers have studied the hydroelastic performance of propellers under the non uniform flow field their models all ignore the influence of the shafting thus ignoring the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft young 2007 2008 he et al 2012 lee et al 2014 2017 li et al 2017 in this study the influence of this coupling effect on propeller hydroelastic response is studied the research shows that the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft will affect the hydro elastic characteristics such as the propellers resonant frequency dynamic stress and bearing force therefore this coupling effect needs to be highly valued by researchers comparing figs 21 and 22 it can be found that the structural coupling effect has little influence on the non jellyfish mode of the blade but has a great influence on the jellyfish modes this indicates that the jellyfish mode is more likely to produce a coupling effect with the shaft this is because when the propeller vibrates according to the jellyfish mode shapes since the vibration phases of each blade are the same it is easier to generate a coupling effect with the shaft however when the propeller vibrates according to the non jellyfish mode shapes the vibration phases of each blade are inconsistent or even opposite so the structural coupling effect with the shaft is weaker therefore the influence of the structural coupling effect on the dynamic characteristics of the propeller is achieved to a great extent by changing the blade jellyfish mode this is a very important conclusion that needs to be highly valued by engineers because this shows that we can make full use of this coupling effect to change the blade jellyfish mode when designing the propulsion shafting thus making the propeller hydroelastic performance be in an optimal state for example propeller bearing force is an important cause of hull vibration and how to reduce the bearing force transmitted to the hull is an important research topic merz et al 2010 2013 dylejko et al 2007 some studies show that only the jellyfish mode of the blade can amplify the propeller bearing force when it is transmitted to the hull while the non jellyfish mode cannot zou 2017 this means that when designing the propeller shaft system we can optimize the jellyfish mode by reasonably matching the parameters between the propeller and the shafting such as the blade mass and bearing stiffness so that the propeller bearing force transmitted to the hull is not amplified and is in an optimal state within the working speed range similarly the research in this paper shows that the structural coupling effect will change the dynamic stress of the blade so we can also make full use of this coupling effect to optimize the dynamic stress of the blade etc in a word the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft can be fully utilized to optimize the hydroelastic performance of the blade this is one of the research significance of this paper which provides a new idea for the optimal design of the propeller this is also one of the topics that will require extensive studies by scholars in the future although there is an obvious structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft for the propulsion shafting studied in this paper we cannot infer that there is a non negligible structural coupling effect for all propulsion shafting in engineering this is closely related to the parameters of the shaft and the blade such as mass stiffness etc so it needs further research in the future for example for which type of propulsion shafting this coupling effect cannot be ignored for a propeller shaft system with a strong coupling effect the hydroelastic analysis model without considering this coupling effect probably cause large errors another research significance of this paper is to remind engineers to pay attention to this coupling effect when analyzing propeller hydroelastic response in our previous study zou et al 2017 we have briefly analyzed the effect of the shaft on propeller hydroelastic response and the conclusion that the shaft changes the resonant frequency of blades and bearing force is obtained however there are still many differences between this study and previous research firstly in the present study the hydroelastic analysis model established is verified experimentally which is not studied in reference zou et al 2017 secondly this study makes it clear that the structural coupling effect only affects the jellyfish mode of the propeller but has little effect on the non jellyfish mode this is also not stated in reference zou et al 2017 finally this study reveals that the structural coupling effect causes the change of the propeller bearing force to be achieved by changing the blade jellyfish mode this is also not stated in reference zou et al 2017 therefore this paper is a further extension of our previous research besides the nonlinear effect caused by blade deformation is not considered in the propeller hydroelastic analysis model established in this study so the conclusion proposed in this paper is only suitable for the case of small blade deformation when the blade deformation is very large such as a composite propeller it is necessary to further establish a hydroelastic analysis model of the propeller shaft system considering the large deformation of the blade which is also a topic to be further studied in the future 6 conclusions in this study considering the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft a new hydroelastic analysis model of propellers under a non uniform flow field is established and validated by some experiments then the influence of this coupling effect on propeller hydroelastic performances such as resonant frequencies dynamic stress and longitudinal bearing force are studied based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn when the structural coupling effect is ignored for the case considered here the relative errors of the first order jellyfish mode of the propeller the dynamic stress at the blade root and the longitudinal bearing force of the propeller are as high as 22 78 28 04 and 20 37 respectively therefore the structural coupling effect should be considered when analyzing the propellers hydroelastic response compared with the blade non jellyfish mode the structural coupling effect has a greater influence on the blade jellyfish mode when designing the propeller shaft system the structural coupling effect can be fully utilized by reasonably matching the parameters of the propeller and the shafting so that the propellers hydroelastic performance is optimized credit authorship contribution statement donglin zou methodology formal analysis writing original draft jianghai xu validation

21116,at present although there are a large number of studies on the hydroelastic analysis of ship propellers almost all of them neglect the shaft thus ignoring the influence of the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft therefore considering this coupling effect a new hydrodynamic analysis model of propellers is established by using the boundary element method bem coupled finite element method fem and then the model is verified by some experiments on the water tunnel test bench finally based on this model the influence of the structural coupling effect on propellers hydroelastic performance is mainly studied the results show that when the structural coupling effect is ignored the relative errors of the first order jellyfish mode of the blade the dynamic stress at the blade root and the longitudinal bearing force of the propeller are as high as 22 78 28 04 and 20 37 respectively therefore the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft should be considered when analyzing the propellers hydroelastic response further when designing the propeller shaft system this coupling effect can also be fully utilized to reasonably match the parameters of the propeller and the shaft to optimize the hydroelastic performance of propellers keywords fluid structure interaction hydroelasticity propeller shaft bearing systems boundary element method finite element method 1 introduction due to the inhomogeneity of the incoming flow field the fluid excitation force will inevitably be generated when the ship propellers work propeller excitation force has adverse effects on the ship first of all the propeller excitation force will cause the propeller blades to vibrate and cause fatigue damage if the frequency component in the excitation force is consistent with the natural frequency of the blade it will cause the blade to resonate and in severe cases the blade will break secondly the propeller excitation force will cause bending longitudinal and torsional vibration of the shaft which will easily lead to fatigue instability of the shaft finally the propeller excitation force is easy to cause the hull vibration which leads to fatigue damage of hull structure and produces vibration noise vibration and noise will reduce the comfort of the ship to solve this problem it is necessary to deeply analyze the hydroelastic performance of the propeller in the non uniform flow field including the prediction of blade deformation blade dynamic stress and propeller bearing force usually the hydrodynamic force causes the blade to deform and the blade deformation will affect the flow field in turn so there is a fluid solid coupling effect between the fluid and the propeller at present many researchers have studied the hydroelastic performance of propellers for example ghassemi et al 2015 studied the hydroelastic performances of a composite marine propeller under the uniform flow field the finite volume method fvm and finite element method fem were used das and kapuria kapuria and das 2018 das and kapuria 2016 investigated the bend twist coupling characteristics of a full scale composite marine propeller the fvm and fem were also used ghassemi et al 2012 analyzed the effects of skew angles on the hydroelastic performance of a composite propeller in their studies the boundary element method bem and fem were used ghassabzadeh et al morteza et al 2013 did similar work using the bem and fem young 2007 2008 used bem and fem to study the hydroelastic performance of propellers under a non uniform flow field he et al 2012 investigated the hydroelastic optimization of a composite marine propeller in the non uniform wake lee et al 2014 2017 studied the hydroelastic analysis of marine propellers based on a bem fem coupled fsi algorithm similarly li et al 2017 analyzed the hydroelastic analysis of an elastic marine propeller by using a coupled bem fem algorithm however in the literature mentioned above it is assumed that the root of the hub is fixed thus ignoring the influence of the shaft on the hydroelastic performance of the propeller this may cause errors zou et al 2019 2020 because of this the purpose of this study is to establish a new propeller hydroelastic analysis model that can consider the influence of the shaft and to study the influence of the shaft on the hydroelastic performance of the propeller the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model is described in section 2 in section 3 the mathematical model is verified through several experiments on a gravity type water tunnel test rig in section 4 numerical analysis of a propeller shaft bearing system in practical engineering is studied some discussions and important conclusions are presented in section 5 and section 6 2 mathematical model in this study the boundary element method kinnas et al 2012 2015 greco et al 2014 bem also known as panel method is applied to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure of the propeller the finite element method fem is used to calculate the deformation and stress of the propeller as shown in fig 1 a propeller subjected to an effective inflow wake v 0 is considered so the inflow velocity v i n on the propeller can be written as 1 v i n v 0 ω r where r is the position vector of a point q on the propeller surface s b the perturbation velocity potential φ can be expressed as 2 2 φ 0 on the propeller surface s b the kinematic boundary condition should be satisfied 3 φ n q v i n v b n q where n q is the unit normal vector of the propeller surface and v b is the vibration velocity of the blade surface it contains both the vibration velocity of the blade itself and the rigid body velocity with the vibration of the shaft the pressure on the propeller surface consists of two parts one part is the pressure caused by the rigid blade in the non uniform flow field the other part is the pressure caused by the elastic blade in the uniform flow field when the deformation of the blade is small the two parts of the pressure can be calculated separately young 2007 hylarides 1979 then the perturbation velocity potential φ could be linearly decomposed into two parts young 2007 kuo 1984 4 φ φ ϕ where φ denotes the perturbation velocity potential due to the rigid blade in the non uniform flow field and ϕ denotes the perturbation velocity potential due to the elastic blade in the uniform flow field therefore the flow field analysis could be split into two problems as follows 5 2 φ 0 φ n q v i n n q p φ p 0 ρ 1 2 v i n 2 φ t 1 2 v i n φ 2 6 2 ϕ 0 ϕ n q v b n q p ϕ ρ ϕ t v i n ϕ where p φ is the pressure due to φ p ϕ is the pressure due to ϕ p 0 is the static pressure at infinity ρ is the density of water eq 5 makes up the classical hydrodynamics of the rigid propeller in the non uniform flow field eq 6 is the problem of an elastic propeller operating in the uniform flow field and the fluid structure interaction is only related to it eq 5 and eq 6 can be solved numerically by dividing the blades and the wake surface s w into many small hyperbolic quadrilateral panels where constant strength dipoles and sources are distributed fig 2 shows panel arrangements on the surface of the propeller and the surface of the wake s w as can be seen that the wake surface s w is assumed to be linear and its shape is a prescribed helical surface zou et al 2017 su and huang 2013 the structure model is modeled by the fem belegundu and chandrupatla 2002 a schematic diagram for a propeller shafting bearings system is illustrated in fig 3 it consists of a shaft propeller back stern bearing front stern bearing middle bearing and thrust bearing in the fem the blade is simulated with 20 node solid elements since the thickness of the blade edge is zero a wedge element is selected at the edge as shown in fig 4 c it is based on a condensation of the 20 node solid element zienkiewicz et al 2005 fig 5 is an enlarged view of the fem mesh of a single blade each blade is divided into 5 elements in the thickness direction 25 elements in chord direction and 60 elements in the radial direction totaling 7500 elements as shown in fig 4 b the bem has only four nodes per panel while the fem has eight nodes per face to ensure that the results between the fem and the bem can be transferred to each other accurately and quickly in fluid structure interaction the four corners of the fem element surface exactly coincide with the four vertices of the bem panel the shaft is simulated with timoshenko beam elements which have six degrees of freedom three translation and three rotation degrees of freedom because the hub is interference fit with the shaft the hub is considered to be a part of the shaft the bearings are modeled by springs and damping elements which stiffness and damping could see in table a 3 of appendix a fig 6 is a schematic diagram of a fe model of a propeller shaft bearing system its dynamic equation can be written as follows the other loads such as centrifugal forces are assumed to be zero and only the hydrodynamic load is considered 7 m u c u k u f φ f ϕ where u u and u are the nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively f φ is the hydrodynamic force due to the rigid blade operating in the non uniform flow field f ϕ is the hydrodynamic force due to the elastic blade in the uniform flow field the hydrodynamic force vectors f φ and f ϕ are computed as 8 f φ n t p φ d s f ϕ n t p ϕ d s where p φ and p ϕ are computed by eqs 5 and 6 it can be seen that the hydrodynamic force vector f ϕ is dependent on the structure motion accelerations u and velocities u which are obtained from the fem analysis in turn to solve the accelerations u and velocities u the fem analysis requires the hydrodynamic force vectors f ϕ which are obtained from the bem analysis in this process fluid structure interaction happens furthermore the structure motion dependent hydroelastic force f ϕ could be further expressed as added mass matrix m a and added damping matrix c a the detailed derivation can be referred to the literature zou et al 2017 then eq 7 can be written as 9 m m a u c c a u k u f φ it should be pointed out that the fem model bem model and their coupling calculation are all realized in matlab software with the help of matlab a software package for calculating the fluid solid coupling of the propeller shaft system has been developed by us 3 model validation this section verifies the correctness of the model and codes presented in this study through several experiments these experiments have been done in the water tunnel fig 7 is a schematic of the design scheme and fig 8 is the product of the experimental platform processed according to fig 7 it consists of a pump water tank groundwater reservoir propeller shaft bearing system and experiment section and so on the experiment section is made of high strength plexiglas and its size is 7 m 0 7 m 0 7 m when the water tunnel is in operation the water pump pumps the water from the reservoir into the water tank the water then accelerates into the experimental section under gravity and finally flows back into the reservoir if the pump operates at full load the maximum flow velocity in the experimental section can reach 4 5 m s the maximum rotation velocity of the propeller shaft bearing system can reach 1200 rpm propeller 4381 is used in the experiment whose geometric parameters can refer to reference carlton 2012 the parameters of the propeller shaft bearing system are shown in table 1 three experiments have been completed including a blade stress test resonant frequency test of the propeller shaft system in air and water and longitudinal bearing force test when the propeller is in a non uniform incoming flow field the details are described below 3 1 stress test of blade the first experiment is to test the stress of 4381 propeller under static loads as shown in fig 9 a two 45 degree strain flowers are arranged on the face and back of the blade respectively and their positions are shown in table 2 loads parallel to the x axis are applied at different positions of the blade the weight is 2 kg the diagram of load application is shown in fig 9 b and c a total of four different loads are applied and the positions are shown in table 3 the von mises stresses measured by 45 degree strain flowers are compared with the calculated results of the present model the comparison results are shown in table 4 from the table it can be seen that the maximum relative error is 7 62 indicating the validity of the fem model and the codes the main error sources are as follows 1 firstly in the theoretical calculation the number of fem meshes and the selection of material parameters will cause errors 2 secondly in the experimental test the propeller processing will produce errors at the same time signal acquisition during the test will also produce measurement errors 3 besides for the specified measuring points and load application points there may be no nodes so the nodes closest to these specified points are used instead this processing will also produce errors at the same time the dynamic stress in the non uniform flow field is also measured and compared with theoretical calculations to measure the dynamic stress a waterproof dynamic strain acquisition instrument is developed as shown in fig 10 the instrument is fixed at the end of the shaft and rotates together it contains a battery and can work for a long time without an external energy supply dynamic strain data can be stored in the instrument in real time the strain gauge is covered with a thin layer of waterproof glue during the experiment the non uniform flow field is shown in fig 17 and the experimental speed is 320 rpm fig 11 a and fig 12 a are time domain comparisons of the maximum principal stress between the measure and the theoretical calculation average values are removed the waveforms of the experiment and calculation are very similar through the frequency spectrum analysis it is known that the frequency components in the theoretical calculation are mainly the blade frequency i e 5 times the rotation frequency and some other low frequencies but the experimental measurement contains a lot of high frequency components which may come from turbulence excitation in the flow field and friction excitation of water lubricated rubber bearings etc these factors cannot be considered in the calculation model therefore the experimental and calculated results are filtered simultaneously and only the first order blade frequency is extracted as shown in figs 11 b and fig 12 b it can be seen that the two agree well further table 5 gives a comparison of the amplitudes of the dynamic stresses at the first order blade frequency in general the dynamic stress testing can prove that the fluid solid coupling dynamic model established in this paper is effective 3 2 resonant frequencies test of the propeller shaft system the second experiment is to test the resonant frequencies of the 4381 propeller shaft system in air and water as shown in fig 13 acceleration sensors are installed on the blades and the shaft the resonant frequencies and acceleration frequency response functions frf of the system are measured by using a force hammer to excite the blades and the shaft then the experimental results are compared with the calculated results of the model established in this study considering that the mass of the acceleration sensors influences the resonant frequencies of blades the acceleration sensors mass is also considered in the theoretical calculation table 6 shows the comparison between experimental results and theoretical results for the first longitudinal resonant frequency of the shaft and the first bending resonant frequency of the blade it can be seen that the maximum relative error is 5 36 further fig 14 and fig 15 are the measured and calculated results of a blade acceleration frequency response function frf it also can be seen that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results therefore it shows the correctness of the model established in this study the main reasons for the errors are the same as the blade stress test in the previous section which will not be explained here it can also be seen from table 6 that the added mass caused by fluid has a great influence on the first resonant frequency of the blade which is reduced by about 40 this conclusion is close to the previously published literature young and liu 2008 3 3 longitudinal bearing force test of the propeller shaft system the third experiment is to test the longitudinal bearing force of the propeller shaft system under a non uniform flow field in order to make the propeller produce as large a longitudinal bearing force as possible for a 5 bladed propeller a 5 cycle wake screen is designed and manufactured as shown in fig 16 the detailed manufacturing process of the 5 cycle wake screen can be referred to reference zou 2017 the wake screen is installed 0 6m in front of the propeller the velocity distribution of the inhomogeneous flow field at the propeller plane is measured by the laser doppler velocimeter ldv system the test results are shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the non uniform flow field contains an obvious fifth order harmonic component which indicates that the 5 cycle wake screen constructed meets the requirements the longitudinal displacement of the shaft near the thrust bearing is measured then as shown in eq 10 the longitudinal bearing force transmitted to the thrust bearing base through the propeller shaft system is obtained and dimensionless 10 f x f x ρ n 2 d 4 k t a ρ n 2 d 4 where f x is the longitudinal bearing force n a is the vibration displacement near the thrust bearing m k t is the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing nm 1 and is shown in table 1 ρ is the density of water kgm 3 n is the longitudinal bearing force frequency rps and d is the diameter of the propeller m at the same time the non uniform flow field measured in fig 17 is substituted into the fluid solid coupling calculation model presented in this study then the theoretical results are obtained and compared with the experimental test results in the experiment the propellers are tested at 320 rpm 450 rpm and 600 rpm respectively at each rotation speed the inflow velocity v 0 is always 1 5 m s fig 18 a fig 19 a and fig 20 a are time domain comparisons of longitudinal bearing force between experiment and calculation at 320 rpm 450 rpm and 600 rpm respectively as can be seen from these figures the waveforms of the two are very similar according to spectrum analysis in the theoretical calculation the frequency components of the bearing force are mainly the blade frequency i e 5 times the rotation frequency with a small amount of the 2 times blade frequency in the experiment besides the blade frequency and its multiplier the bearing force contains obvious rotation frequency components which are caused by some factors such as bearing friction excitation and propeller eccentricity rather than non uniform inflow field these factors will cause the shaft to do longitudinal vibration and the vibration frequency is mainly rotating frequency chen 1987 this is also the reason why the rotation frequency components in the experiment increase with the increase of the rotation speed of the shaft at the same time many small high frequency components may come from turbulence excitation in the flow field and friction excitation of water lubricated rubber bearings etc to compare with the theoretical results the experimental and calculation results are filtered and the first order blade frequency and 2 times blade frequency components are extracted the comparison results are shown in figs 18 b fig 19 b and fig 20 b as can be seen from these figures the calculated results are highly consistent with the measured results further for the amplitude of the blade frequency component table 7 shows the comparisons between experimental results and calculation results at different rotational speeds it can be seen from the table that the maximum relative error is 15 19 indicating the correctness of the model established in this paper to sum up from these experiments it can be found that there is a very good accuracy between the theoretical results and the experiment results suggesting the validity of the model established in this study besides in our previous published papers the hydrodynamic model has been verified through a large number of numerical examples including prediction of open water performance of rigid propellers under uniform inflow unsteady pressure of rigid propellers under nonuniform inflow and bearing forces of rigid propellers under simple motion for more details please refer to references zou et al 2017 zou 2017 4 simulation results in this section the presented fluid structure coupling dynamics model of the propeller shaft bearing system is applied to investigate the hydroelastic performance of a propeller under a non uniform flow field in section 3 the experimental model is a small sized propeller and its function is only to prove the validity of the fluid solid coupling model established in this paper however on the one hand this small sized propeller is rare in real ships especially large ships on the other hand the experimental results in table 6 show that the resonant frequency of this small sized propeller is very high so it is difficult to reflect the dynamic characteristics of propellers on large ships especially the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft which is the focus of this paper therefore different from the experimental model in section 3 a propeller shaft system whose geometric and physical parameters refer to a cargo ship chen 1987 is studied the diameter of the propeller is 4 m and the length of the shaft is 20 m the detailed geometry and material parameters are shown in table a of appendix a the main parameters come from the reference chen 1987 for convenience the shaft is assumed to be a uniform cross section beam 4 1 resonant frequency analysis first the resonant frequencies of the propeller shaft system are analyzed from eq 9 it is known that the undamped resonant frequencies satisfy the following expression 11 λ m m a k φ 0 where λ 4 π 2 f 2 f is the resonant frequency hz and φ is the corresponding mode shape m a is the added mass due to the fluid in our analysis in order to study the influence of the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft on the propellers resonant frequencies two cases are studied one is consideration of the shaft namely the whole propeller shaft bearings system and the other is not consideration of the shaft only the propeller with the root fixed table 8 shows the calculated resonant frequencies fig 21 shows the mode shapes of the propeller without the shaft and fig 22 shows these mode shapes with the shaft it can be seen that the propeller mode shapes can be divided into two types one is the jellyfish mode which shows that all blades vibrate in one direction at the same time with obvious circumferential symmetry such as figs 21 e and fig 22 e the second type is the non jellyfish mode which shows that some blades vibrate and some blades hardly vibrate such as fig 21 a d and fig 22 a to d this classification is consistent with the conclusion of previous research literature xiong et al 2016 lou et al 2016 lei et al 2016 sarkani and szilagyi 1991 in these references the jellyfish modes are also called umbrella modes xiong et al 2016 lou et al 2016 sarkani and szilagyi 1991 or in phase modes lei et al 2016 it also can be seen that the values of the first five resonant frequencies of the propeller are the same due to symmetry when the shaft is not considered however after considering the shaft there is a significant structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft so that the resonant frequencies of the propeller are changed for example there is a coupling between the propeller and the bending vibration of the shaft which changes the non jellyfish modes of the blades from 27 25 hz to 26 19 hz reducing 1 06 hz similarly the blades are coupled to the longitudinal vibration of the shaft which changes the jellyfish mode from 27 25 hz to 35 29 hz increasing by 8 04 hz fig 23 further shows the non jellyfish mode shapes of the propeller when the blades are coupled to the bending vibration of the shaft as can be seen from the figure the mode shape is dominated by the propeller and contains a small amount of bending vibration of the shaft it can be seen from the above analysis that the structural coupling effect has an important influence on the jellyfish mode and when the shaft is ignored its relative error reaches 22 78 besides the resonant frequencies of the propeller shaft system are also calculated using ansys software in ansys the blade and the shaft are simulated by solid95 and beam188 elements respectively the added mass caused by the fluid is simulated by fluid221 element the comparisons are shown in table 9 it is seen that the calculation results by the present model are close to those of ansys and the maximum relative error is 0 51 which further shows the correctness of the model established in this study 4 2 dynamic stress analysis second the dynamic stress of the blade under the non uniform flow field is studied the effective inflow wake v 0 is assumed to be 12 v x θ u 0 1 b cos 10 θ sin 10 θ where θ is zero vertically upward and positive clockwise when looking downstream u 0 is the ship speed b is a constant which indicates the non uniform level of the flow field in this study b is set equal to 0 005 this study analyzes the blade dynamic stress when the propeller rotation speed is 60 rpm and 150 rpm when the propeller angular velocity ω changes the ship speed u 0 also changes so that the advance coefficient j is always 0 889 similarly two cases are studied and one considers the shaft and the other is not consideration of the shaft in these two cases the maximum principal stresses of six specified points on blades r r 0 3 s c 0 5 r r 0 7 s c 0 5 r r 0 9 s c 0 5 r r 0 7 s c 0 3 r r 0 7 s c 0 7 r r 0 7 s c 0 9 are investigated and compared eq 9 is solved with the step by step procedure in time domain and the newmark beta method is used clough and penzien 2003 some revolutions are calculated to make sure that the transient solutions decay to zero and the results of the last revolution are shown only one blade dynamic stresses are shown because the difference between them is only the phase delay fig 24 is the dynamic stresses of the six specified points on one blade when the propeller makes one revolution under angular velocity 60 rpm it should be noted that only the dynamic components are displayed and all the static components are removed from this figure it is known that the max amplitude is 3 82 mpa at the top point r r 0 9 s c 0 5 2 67 mpa at the middle point r r 0 7 s c 0 5 0 74 mpa at the root point r r 0 3 s c 0 5 when the shaft is considered on the contrary the max amplitude is only 1 84 mpa 0 99 mpa and 0 04 mpa at these points when the shaft is ignored so the differences of the dynamic stresses between the case with shaft and the case without shaft are large further table 10 shows the maximum dynamic stress amplitude and the relative errors when the shaft is considered or not it is known that the dynamic stress of blades considering the shaft is larger than that without the shaft at the same time ignoring the shaft will lead to large stress errors for example the maximum relative error is 94 59 fig 25 is the dynamic stresses of the six specified points when the angular velocity of the propeller is 150 rpm from this figure it is known that the max amplitude is 45 87 mpa at the top point r r 0 9 s c 0 5 22 98 mpa at the middle point r r 0 7 s c 0 5 1 07 mpa at the root point r r 0 3 s c 0 5 when the shaft is considered on the contrary the max amplitude is only 73 76 mpa 38 27 mpa and 1 37 mpa at these points when the shaft is neglected further table 11 shows the maximum dynamic stress amplitude and the relative errors it is known that the dynamic stress of blades considering the shaft is smaller than that without the shaft at the same time ignoring the shaft will lead to large stress errors for example the maximum relative error is 92 89 as can be seen from the above analysis the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has an important influence on the dynamic stress of the blade it may increase or reduce the dynamic stress depending on the vibration phase of the blade and the shaft for example if they are out phase then the dynamic stress of blades will increase therefore we can use this coupling effect to optimize the dynamic stress of the blade 4 3 longitudinal bearing force analysis as mentioned in the introduction the bearing force is one of the important causes of hull vibration so the research of the bearing forces is very important for the hull design and vibration control especially for the submarine therefore the bearing forces are also studied in this section since the non uniform flow field assumed in this study as shown in eq 12 only produces longitudinal bearing force and pulsating torque the longitudinal bearing force that is more likely to cause hull vibration and noise will be focused on in this study the longitudinal bearing force in three cases is calculated in the first case the shaft is not considered and the blade is rigid at present most scholars use this method to study the propeller bearing force dubbioso et al 2017 ortolani et al 2015 abbas et al 2015 in the second case the shaft is not considered but the blade is elastic in the third case the shaft and the elastic effect of the blade are considered simultaneously that is the bearing force is calculated by using the model presented in this study the calculated bearing force is dimensionless by eq 10 fig 26 is a comparison of time domain results of longitudinal bearing force in three cases and table 12 shows the comparison of their amplitudes the following two conclusions can be seen from the figure and table 1 when the shaft is not considered the differences between the bearing force of the rigid propeller and that of the elastic propeller are very small at 60 rpm however at 150 rpm the bearing force of the elastic propeller is larger than that of the rigid propeller this is because at 60 rpm the bearing force frequency is 10hz which is much smaller than the first resonant frequency of the blade as shown in table 8 they are 27 25hz and then the blade elastic effect has little influence on the longitudinal bearing force when the rotation speed of the propeller is 150 rpm the exciting force frequency is 25hz which is close to the first resonant frequency of the blade so the longitudinal bearing force is significantly amplified 2 at 60 rpm the bearing force of the elastic propeller with the shaft is larger than that of the elastic propeller without the shaft while at 150 rpm the opposite is true this is because the dynamic characteristics of the shaft have an amplification effect on the bearing force so the bearing force considered the shaft is larger at 60 rpm at the same time the structural coupling effect between the shaft and the propeller makes the jellyfish mode that can amplify the longitudinal bearing force zou 2017 change from 27 25hz to 35 29hz therefore at 150 rpm the longitudinal bearing force without considering the shaft is larger instead further table 12 gives the relative error of longitudinal bearing force when the blade elasticity or the shaft is not considered it can be seen that the maximum relative error is 20 37 therefore when analyzing the propeller bearing force it is necessary to consider both the influence of the blade elasticity and the structural coupling effect in summary from the above analysis results it is known that the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has an important influence on the propellers hydroelastic performance such as the resonant frequency dynamic stress and longitudinal bearing force 5 discussion at present although many researchers have studied the hydroelastic performance of propellers under the non uniform flow field their models all ignore the influence of the shafting thus ignoring the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft young 2007 2008 he et al 2012 lee et al 2014 2017 li et al 2017 in this study the influence of this coupling effect on propeller hydroelastic response is studied the research shows that the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft will affect the hydro elastic characteristics such as the propellers resonant frequency dynamic stress and bearing force therefore this coupling effect needs to be highly valued by researchers comparing figs 21 and 22 it can be found that the structural coupling effect has little influence on the non jellyfish mode of the blade but has a great influence on the jellyfish modes this indicates that the jellyfish mode is more likely to produce a coupling effect with the shaft this is because when the propeller vibrates according to the jellyfish mode shapes since the vibration phases of each blade are the same it is easier to generate a coupling effect with the shaft however when the propeller vibrates according to the non jellyfish mode shapes the vibration phases of each blade are inconsistent or even opposite so the structural coupling effect with the shaft is weaker therefore the influence of the structural coupling effect on the dynamic characteristics of the propeller is achieved to a great extent by changing the blade jellyfish mode this is a very important conclusion that needs to be highly valued by engineers because this shows that we can make full use of this coupling effect to change the blade jellyfish mode when designing the propulsion shafting thus making the propeller hydroelastic performance be in an optimal state for example propeller bearing force is an important cause of hull vibration and how to reduce the bearing force transmitted to the hull is an important research topic merz et al 2010 2013 dylejko et al 2007 some studies show that only the jellyfish mode of the blade can amplify the propeller bearing force when it is transmitted to the hull while the non jellyfish mode cannot zou 2017 this means that when designing the propeller shaft system we can optimize the jellyfish mode by reasonably matching the parameters between the propeller and the shafting such as the blade mass and bearing stiffness so that the propeller bearing force transmitted to the hull is not amplified and is in an optimal state within the working speed range similarly the research in this paper shows that the structural coupling effect will change the dynamic stress of the blade so we can also make full use of this coupling effect to optimize the dynamic stress of the blade etc in a word the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft can be fully utilized to optimize the hydroelastic performance of the blade this is one of the research significance of this paper which provides a new idea for the optimal design of the propeller this is also one of the topics that will require extensive studies by scholars in the future although there is an obvious structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft for the propulsion shafting studied in this paper we cannot infer that there is a non negligible structural coupling effect for all propulsion shafting in engineering this is closely related to the parameters of the shaft and the blade such as mass stiffness etc so it needs further research in the future for example for which type of propulsion shafting this coupling effect cannot be ignored for a propeller shaft system with a strong coupling effect the hydroelastic analysis model without considering this coupling effect probably cause large errors another research significance of this paper is to remind engineers to pay attention to this coupling effect when analyzing propeller hydroelastic response in our previous study zou et al 2017 we have briefly analyzed the effect of the shaft on propeller hydroelastic response and the conclusion that the shaft changes the resonant frequency of blades and bearing force is obtained however there are still many differences between this study and previous research firstly in the present study the hydroelastic analysis model established is verified experimentally which is not studied in reference zou et al 2017 secondly this study makes it clear that the structural coupling effect only affects the jellyfish mode of the propeller but has little effect on the non jellyfish mode this is also not stated in reference zou et al 2017 finally this study reveals that the structural coupling effect causes the change of the propeller bearing force to be achieved by changing the blade jellyfish mode this is also not stated in reference zou et al 2017 therefore this paper is a further extension of our previous research besides the nonlinear effect caused by blade deformation is not considered in the propeller hydroelastic analysis model established in this study so the conclusion proposed in this paper is only suitable for the case of small blade deformation when the blade deformation is very large such as a composite propeller it is necessary to further establish a hydroelastic analysis model of the propeller shaft system considering the large deformation of the blade which is also a topic to be further studied in the future 6 conclusions in this study considering the structural coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft a new hydroelastic analysis model of propellers under a non uniform flow field is established and validated by some experiments then the influence of this coupling effect on propeller hydroelastic performances such as resonant frequencies dynamic stress and longitudinal bearing force are studied based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn when the structural coupling effect is ignored for the case considered here the relative errors of the first order jellyfish mode of the propeller the dynamic stress at the blade root and the longitudinal bearing force of the propeller are as high as 22 78 28 04 and 20 37 respectively therefore the structural coupling effect should be considered when analyzing the propellers hydroelastic response compared with the blade non jellyfish mode the structural coupling effect has a greater influence on the blade jellyfish mode when designing the propeller shaft system the structural coupling effect can be fully utilized by reasonably matching the parameters of the propeller and the shafting so that the propellers hydroelastic performance is optimized credit authorship contribution statement donglin zou methodology formal analysis writing original draft jianghai xu validation

21117,a mathematical model is developed based on the application of permeable and impermeable breakwaters utilizing the mild slope equation mse to analyze the wave amplification in an arbitrary shaped harbor with variable bathymetry finite element method fem coupled with analytical approximation is described as hybrid fem which is used to solve the mse and helmholtz equation in bounded and unbounded domains open sea region respectively the validation of the present numerical scheme is conducted by comparing the simulation results with the existing studies and the convergence analysis is also conducted to verify the accuracy of the numerical scheme the effects of energy dissipation bottom friction and variable wave transmission through impermeable and permeable breakwaters are investigated to understand the resonance phenomenon in rectangular port in addition the current numerical scheme is implemented on a real paradip port odisha india at six different key locations and for the first time the effect of breakwaters placed at the entrance and in the bounded region along with bottom friction and partially reflecting port boundary are investigated the breakwaters with small permeability transmission coefficient have high efficiency to reduce the wave resonance inside the port keywords mild slope equation hybrid finite element method permeable and impermeable breakwaters resonance paradip port 1 introduction ocean waves propagating towards the coastal region invoke port resonance as they interact with coastal boundary of port s wall the resonance state agitates wave motion in port due to effect of multiple reflections refractions and diffractions from the coastal boundaries this perturbed oscillations could cause damage to dock and ship setups severe damage to coastal property and mooring system gao et al 2016 2018b therefore appropriate measures are needed in the design of port layout to minimize wave induced oscillations permeable and impermeable breakwaters with appropriate permeability impermeability at the coastal regions including harbors ports shelter ports and can protect the moored vessels inside the port thus an accurate understanding of wave transmission through breakwater gaps including refraction and diffraction is essential for the assessment of wave response in ports protected by breakwaters in the past theoretical and numerical studies were first conducted on rectangular geometry domain including fully reflecting boundaries ippen and goda 1963 le mehaute 1961 miles and munk 1961 further their work was extended for arbitrary shaped domain with constant water depth hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 gerber 1986 extended the work of lee 1971 by including the energy dissipation due to flow separation and bottom friction but restricted to constant depth harbor over the years wave oscillations in harbors or ports have generally been analyzed by assuming the boundaries of the port as fully reflective neither of the approaches by assuming either fully reflecting boundary or zero reflecting harbor boundary are appropriate for the application on real topographies as the partial reflections from the port boundary invariably occurs several studies have been carried out to study wave oscillation behavior in the port including the partially reflecting boundary conditions berkhoff 1976 chen 1986

bellotti et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 kumar and gulshan 2017 2018 kumar and rupali 2018 rupali et al 2020 dong et al 2020b researches on the development of breakwater or wave attenuator to protect the coastal and offshore structure from the strong incident waves have gained enhanced attention breakwater plays a significant role in resonance problem by reducing the resonant frequency peak appearing inside the port due to accumulation of wave energy in the enclosed domains extensive literature for the problem of wave scattering by breakwater have been reviewed by many researchers ijima et al 1975 liu 1975 mattioli 1981 bettess et al 1984 gerber 1986 philip l f liu et al 1986 dalrymple and martin 1990 analyzed the reflection and transmittance of water wave interacting with offshore breakwater yu et al 2000 studied the combined diffraction and refraction phenomenon of random wave passing through breakwater gap with different incident angles wave induced oscillations are examined in semi circular port with porous breakwater yu and chwang 1994 the response of wave interacting with the porous plate breakwater were studied by kumar and sahoo 2006 behera and sahoo 2014 tabssum et al 2020 theoretical models were developed incorporating the effect of energy dissipation through rubble mound jetties placed along the sides of port entrance panchang et al 2008 sulisz 2005 2015 traditionally full protection breakwater such as the rubble mound breakwater have been used widely to restrict water circulation near the coastal region rageh and koraim 2010 alternatively permeable breakwater

yuwono 2019 moreover permeable breakwater minimize the construction cost and are environment friendly huang et al 2011 many research project have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of impermeable and permeable breakwater based on wave induced oscillations chou and han 1993 yucheng et al 2006 ji and suh 2010 koraim et al 2011 chun et al 2012 somervell et al 2018 there are limited studies conducted based on the effects of the energy dissipation by the variable absorbing boundary bottom friction and variable wave energy transmission through permeable and impermeable breakwaters on a realistic port kostense et al 1987 chang and wang 2017 somervell et al 2018 therefore there is a need to develop a validated numerical scheme to investigate the energy dissipation effects including the permeable and impermeable breakwater on a real port such as paradip port in this paper it is presented for the first time that a breakwater at the entrance or in the bounded region along with bottom friction and partially reflecting boundary condition will minimize the resonant peak inside the port for this a hybrid finite element method hfem dong et al 2020a ma et al 2020 is applied with finite elements in the bounded region and the analytical approximation for the unbounded region therefore only the bounded region need to be discretized hence it reduces the total number of equations additionally another advantage is that the variational approach of the finite element method fem is utilized for the numerical solution as it incorporates the matching conditions between the bounded and unbounded region as the natural boundary conditions this variational technique results into the symmetric stiffness matrix which is advantageous for very large and complex geometrical domains to apply the numerical scheme the permeable and impermeable breakwaters are placed at different locations inside the port and the reduction in the wave amplification is examined at the resonant frequencies or peak frequencies domain discretization with irregular mesh is considered for optimum numerical accuracy the influence of variable wave absorbing partial reflection boundaries permeable and impermeable breakwaters and bottom friction factors on the paradip port odisha india is investigated based on the simulation results some tactics such as adding permeable and impermeable breakwaters and wave absorbers at the entrance and the port boundary is suggested to reduce the resonance in the paradip port the current numerical scheme can be implemented on any other realistic port harbor connected to the open sea for the practical applications 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 model geometry the fluid region is divided into two subregions the inner region ω 1 and the outer

incident wave strikes a breakwater at entrance some of the wave energy is partially reflected back to open sea and some part of the wave is absorbed or transmitted into the breakwater region within the breakwater region the waves are continuously reflected and transmitted and the wave motion decays due to energy dissipation when the waves propagate towards the leeward face some of the waves are partially transmitted into the port similarly the waves entrapped in the port are radiated out towards the sea through the seaward face of the breakwater to obtain the wave equation for region 2 breakwater region assuming constant water depth and wave propagation in x direction eq 1 can be re expressed as 16 2 ϕ x 2 k 2 p 2 ϕ 0 where p 2 1 k 2 2 y 2 1 considering the parabolic approximation

the unknown potentials of all the node points are determined by solving the system using gauss elimination method 3 convergence and validation of the numerical scheme against existing studies 3 1 convergence of numerical scheme a numerical scheme is said to converge if the numerical solution approaches the true solution as the discretized mesh is refined the rate of convergence is also providing information about the efficiency and accuracy of any numerical scheme therefore it is important to determine the order of convergence of a numerical scheme before applying on any realistic domain here the order of convergence for the present numerical scheme with uniform and non uniform domain discretization is determined suppose the domain is discretized into n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 number of mesh elements the error norm formula is given as 40 er 1 norm ϕ n 1 ϕ n 5 2 b n 1 α er 2 norm ϕ n 2 ϕ n 5 2 b n 2 α where α refers to the order of convergence and b is the error constant to determine the convergence of the above numerical scheme a rectangular port is considered with dimensions 0 31 m length 0 06 m width and 0 26 m depth the image of the model rectangular port discretized with uniform discrete elements is displayed in fig 2 a the image of a fully open discretized port using the non uniform mesh is shown in fig 2 b and the image of the discretized port with breakwater at the entrance using the non uniform mesh is shown in fig 2 c the cartesian coordinates are lying at the entrance with x axis parallel to the coastal boundary y axis towards the open sea and the z axis is vertically upward in direction the semicircular pseudo boundary is lying at a radius r of 0 09 m from the origin the boundary reflection coefficient for the port is taken as 0 98 breakwater of width 0 006 m with wave admittance value 3 is placed at both the entrance edges the rectangular port is discretized into n 1 1625 n 2 3250 n 3 6500 n 4 13000 and n 5 26000 number of the discrete triangular elements using uniform structured and non uniform discretization here n5 26000 is considered as the maximum number of discretization to estimate the order of convergence the ratio between the minimum grid size of non uniform mesh to the grid size of uniform mesh is 2 5 in fig 3 a the error norm of the present numerical scheme is evaluated and compared for the port with uniform and non uniform discretization in fig 3 b the logarithm error norm is plotted with respect to the logarithmic value of the domain for both the discretization the two equations in eq 40 are solved to determine the value of convergence rate and the error constant the order of convergence with non uniform domain discretization is 1 6 and with the uniform domain discretization is 1 11 therefore the present numerical scheme with non uniform discretization converges faster compare to uniform domain discretization 3 2 validation of numerical scheme to validate the numerical scheme on the rectangular port the port is discretized using the non uniform mesh element in the numerical computation the total number of discretized mesh elements in the rectangular port is given as 1570 and the nodes are 934 the discretized image is given in fig 2 b in which the maximum grid size of the mesh element is 0 05 and the mesh size of the element close to the solid wall is 0 009 the boundary of the port is considered as partially reflecting the response of incident wave to port is determined by the parameter amplification factor which is defined as the ratio of wave amplitude at any point inside the port to the incident wave amplitude the wave amplification factor is computed at the back wall point of the rectangular port marked as w in fig 2 the effectiveness of the partially reflecting port boundary on amplification factor is investigated for rectangular port and the results are validated with the simulation of chen 1986 the reflection coefficient of the boundary is represented by kr with values lying between 0 and 1 here kr 1 represents fully reflecting boundary and kr 0 98 0 95 stand for partially reflecting port boundary in which kr 0 98 represents less partially reflecting port boundary compared to kr 0 95 in fig 4 a the amplification factor obtained by chen 1986 is shown including the effect of variable partially reflecting boundary in the absence of bottom friction corresponding to reflection coefficient values k r 1 0 98 0 95 and 0 90 respectively all the boundary walls were given the same reflection coefficient the wave response is determined at the back wall of the rectangular port for an incident wave angle π 2 in fig 4 b the wave response is obtained using the present numerical scheme on a rectangular port corresponding to different reflection coefficient values as taken by chen 1986 and for the same incident wave angle in the figure the ordinate represents the amplification factor computed for partially reflecting rectangular port while abscissa is considered as non dimensional or normalized wave number kl where l is the characteristic length of the port which is equal to 0 31 m on comparing the simulation results between the present and existing study it is observed that the pattern of the curve in the two figures are similar with two resonance peaks however the slight variation in the amplification is due to the difference in domain discretization the present results are simulated for port discretized into non uniform mesh elements whereas in chen 1986 the uniform regular mesh elements were used to discretize the domain additionally the validation of the present model for the port with fully reflecting boundary and constant depth is carried out by comparing the amplification factor with the analytical approximation by lee 1971 the simulation of the present and analytical approximation is displayed in fig 4 b and it is seen that the comparison shows a good agreement with analytical approximation the numerical scheme is also validated for the rectangular port with varying water depth by comparing the present result with the analytical result of wang et al 2015 the amplification factor is evaluated at the back boundary of the rectangular port with dimensions 1200 m length 200 m width and 10 m depth of the back boundary in the bounded region the bottom is exponentially varying and is given as h h 0 exp 0 001341 y for 0 y l and in the outer region the water depth is 50 m the wave response is evaluated with respect to the normalized wave number and is shown in fig 5 4 numerical simulation results in this section numerical simulations are conducted on a rectangular port to analyze the effect of the variable reflecting boundaries wave transmission through a permeable and impermeable breakwater and frictional bottom conditions the incident waves are assumed as arriving at the entrance with wave angle π 2 the rectangular port has length 0 31 m width 0 06 m and a constant depth equal to 0 26 m the port is discretized with the non uniform mesh elements of which each element has an edge length less than and equal to 0 05 the total number of mesh elements in the port are 1570 and the total nodes are 934 4 1 influence of permeable and impermeable breakwater in the rectangular port permeable and impermeable breakwaters are placed at the entrance the domain boundaries are fully reflecting and the bottom is frictionless the entrance width of the port is 0 03 m the amplification factor is computed at the location marked as w in the port the variations in the wave response of port corresponding to impermeable breakwater ib k t 0 and permeable breakwater pb of width wb 0 006m with respect to different values of m 1 3 and 5 are shown in fig 6 when the wave admittance m decreases the wave energy dissipation increases due to increasing frictional factor of the breakwater region results in slow wave transmission this has been shown in previous researches by various investigators liu et al 1986 dalrymple et al 1991 the results in fig 6 demonstrate that the breakwater with the low admittance significantly reduces the amplification or the resonance peak value compared to the high admittance value increasing breakwater friction or low admittance results in slow transmission of wave and therefore result into reduced wave fluctuations in the port when comparing the effect of wave amplification with permeable and impermeable breakwater it is observed that the amplification is high for the case of an impermeable breakwater at the entrance the reason is that the impermeable breakwater makes the entrance narrow therefore more reflection diffraction occurs and the wave entrapped in the harbor amplifies with finite small transmission coefficient i e low admittance wave transmit slowly in the port and also the waves inside the port are not entrapped and are radiated out towards the sea therefore the resonant peak decreases effectively the increase in permeability energy dissipation of the breakwater reduces the resonance as compared to an impermeable breakwater therefore adding the permeable breakwaters at the entrance in a rectangular harbor is a good strategy for reducing amplification under the resonance conditions 4 2 influence of partial full variable reflection the effect of wave response due to variable partially reflecting boundary inside the domain is demonstrated in fig 7 the wave response curve shown with the dark green line corresponds to the partially reflecting wall prw l1 see fig 7 with a reflection coefficient i e kr 0 95 and other walls are treated as fully reflecting wall the wave response plotted in red line is for the partially reflecting wall l3 blue line corresponds to partially reflecting wall l1 l3 the pink line represents the wave response when wall l1 l2 l3 are partially reflecting purple line refer to wave response when wall l1 to l5 are partially reflecting the reflection coefficient in all these cases is the same i e kr 0 95 on comparing the wave responses of various combinations of partially reflecting walls of the port it is seen that the wave amplification of the resonant peaks reduces effectively with the inclusion of partially reflecting walls of the port 4 3 influence of bottom friction parameter from eq friction factor is variable and depends on relative roughness parameter α c b f therefore in order to determine the effect of bottom friction factor on wave amplification in the rectangular port first the roughness height c b f need to be set in the study by nielsen 2009 it is suggested that the nikuradse roughness height jonsson and carlsen 1976 for a flat sand bottom with uniform granulometry is defines as c b f 2 5 d 50 whereas the motion of sediments create sand ripples thereby increase the roughness height at the bottom which in term makes an increase in the ratio of c b f d 50 to the order from few hundred to thousand pascolo et al 2018 in this way the roughness height value remains arbitrary for heterogeneous bottoms so for the present analysis default value of the roughness height are selected as 0 006 m and 0 009 m for port with bottom depth of 0 26 m as the frictional factor increases with the increase in bottom roughness height the variation in the wave response are observed corresponding to different bottom roughness values and the simulated results are displayed in fig 8 the black line indicates the amplification curve for the water depth of h 0 26 m and nikuradse roughness height cbf 0 m i e without friction whereas the red line indicate the curve for roughness height cbf 0 003 m the blue line is refer to cbf 0 006 m and the curve with orange line refer to cbf 0 009 m it is seen that the bottom roughness parameter influences the wave response in the harbor with an increase in bottom roughness value the amplification peak reduces substantially 4 4 implementation of permeable impermeable breakwater on paradip port paradip port is one of the largest industrial port situated in odisha india on the coast of bay of bengal occasionally the strong seasonal waves induce extreme wave amplification of about 3 5 m in height inside the paradip port the pier structure of the port is capable of handling cargo of 118 5 mmt million metric tons annually including 200 dwt dead weight tonnage size ship the topographic image of the port captured from the google mapping tool is shown in fig 9 for the estimation of wave response inside the port the six locations or the record stations are selected based on ship location berth which are marked as w1 to w6 see fig 9 the non uniform domain discretization of the paradip port with and without breakwater permeable is given in fig 10 the port with and without breakwater is discretized into 2714 mesh elements with 1580 nodes the maximum grid size of the mesh element in the port without breakwater is 0 081 and the boundary element has edge length less than 0 081 whereas the maximum grid size of the mesh element in the port with breakwater is 0 080 the grid size of the mesh element close to the wall is 0 02 the solution at the boundary changes frequently due to local resonance generated by reflection and diffractions of the entrapped wave in the port region the local resonance induce near the moored ship at port provide the important information for the safety of the moored vessel and the coastal structure therefore it is essential to construct refined mesh near the boundary to obtain the optimum numerical solution without losing any crucial information in non uniform mesh discretization the boundary of the port is refined as compared to the interior domain at the corner point also the mesh element is dense so that the optimum accuracy is obtained for the practical application in addition the numerical simulation is conducted for non uniform mesh elements to understand the implication of the permeable breakwater at the port entrance the bathymetry data of the paradip port is given in fig 11 with depth in the bounded region lies between 5 m and 18 m the estimated depth near the ship terminals are between 8 m and 12 m whereas around the entrance it is 15 16 m approximately to verify the number of elements selected for the discretization of port provide results with acceptable accuracy the port is discretized into 2714 and 5428 number of mesh elements and the simulations are performed for these two cases in the port without breakwater the comparison of the wave response for the two grid resolutions at the record station w3 to w6 are shown in fig 12 the response curve for 2714 number of elements is displayed with black color and the response curve for 5428 number of elements is displayed with green color from the figure it can be visualized that there is no significant change in the results with the two discretizations therefore further simulations in the paradip port are conducted for 2714 discrete mesh elements the amplification factor is computed with respect to the normalized wave number kl l is a characteristic length of the port with value 1300 m in fig 13 comparisons of the amplification factor determined at the six record stations w1 to w6 inside paradip port odisha without breakwater black line and with permeable breakwater red line of width 20 m placed at the entrance is shown the incident waves are considered as arriving at the entrance with wave angle θ0 π 2 for the current simulations the results are simulated corresponding to the admittance value equal to 3 it is observed from fig 13 that the wave amplification is stronger for the port without breakwater at all the record stations whereas the amplification decreases with the addition of permeable breakwater at the entrance there are five prominent resonance peaks which are clearly visible in fig 13 at record stations w2 w4 w5 and w6 respectively the resonance peaks are occurring at wave frequencies k1l 1 02 k2l 1 9 k3l 3 48 k4l 3 66 and k5l 5 1 in port with and without breakwater the incident wave with frequency same as the resonant frequency are very critical for the inner and outer boundary of the port as these waves could induce strong oscillations in the port these oscillations results in delaying loading unloading of cargo activity sometime damages the moored ships and the port boundaries for the first and fourth resonant mode wave amplification in the port without breakwater is strong at the record stations w1 w2 w5 and w6 as shown is fig 13 for the first resonant mode high wave amplification is seen at record station w5 and w6 and for the fourth resonant mode wave amplifies strongly at all the record stations except record station w3 from the figure it is found that the record station w6 experiences extreme wave amplification compared to the other stations this is probably expected due to the location of record station w6 wave undergoes frequent reflection and diffraction from the interior walls and corners constructing a permeable breakwater at the entrance decrease the amplification at the record station w1 substantially compared to other record stations however it is seen that permeable breakwater significantly reduces the wave amplification corresponding to all the resonant modes at each record stations this is probably expected as the permeable breakwater allows slower wave transmission into the port which results in minimum wave amplification inside the port also it allows the wave in port to transmit out towards the sea hence this process effectively subsides the wave induced oscillations in the port under the resonant conditions the amplification curve for the monochromatic incident wave falling at the entrance with wave angle θ0 π 4 is evaluated with respect to the non dimensional normalized wave number the wave response curve at six record stations is shown in fig 14 five resonant modes can be seen at record stations w1 w2 w4 and w6 respectively and values the resonant modes are the same as mentioned in the previous paragraph when comparing the wave response of the two figures figs 13 and 14 it is found that the wave amplification corresponding to the resonant modes is high in fig 13 at all record stations compared to the wave amplification shown in fig 14 this reveals that different incident wave directions also impact wave amplification from fig 14 in the port without breakwater first second and fourth resonant modes are prominent compared to the other for these resonant modes wave amplifies strongly at record station w6 the wave response curves in fig 14 reveals that the presence of permeable breakwater m 3 at the entrance is significantly diminishes the amplification at record station w1 for all the resonant modes peaks also it is observed that as the breakwater is located close to the record station w1 the wave amplification corresponding to the first resonant mode at the record station w1 decreases effectively compared to the wave response of the first resonant mode at all other stations it is visualized that the permeable breakwater is highly effective at the record stations with high amplification such as w5 and w6 however it is found that breakwater structure with a finite low transmission coefficient or wave admittance diminishes the wave amplifications peak correspond to all the resonant frequencies at each of six selected record stations in the port variations of the amplification factor curve for the paradip port with the permeable breakwater at the six record stations w1 to w6 are shown in fig 15 with respect to different partially reflecting port boundaries the curve in black color is wave response of port with fully reflected boundary with reflection coefficient 1 bottom roughness factor 0 i e kr 1 cbf 0 the response curve with red color is for port with reflection coefficient 0 95 and bottom roughness factor 0 06 m i e kr 0 95 cbf 0 06 m the curve in blue color represents wave response in port with reflection coefficient 0 90 and bottom roughness factor 0 06 m i e kr 0 90 cbf 0 06 m the admittance parameter value is 3 for all the cases from the figure it is noticed that an increase in amplitude occurs at the low wave number this is due to the local resonance generated by the wave interaction with irregular and sharp corners of the port the resonant peaks that are clearly seen at record station w1 w5 and w6 of the fully reflecting port represented with the black line disappear in the curve shown in red and blue color due to the presence of partially reflecting boundary and frictional bottom port with solid boundary walls leads to worst wave oscillations at all the record stations the increase in the reflection coefficient weakens the wave fluctuations the effect of the variable constant partially reflecting port boundary and the effect of adding a breakwater in the interior of the port on wave amplification is investigated the simulation results are obtained at record station w6 in the port with breakwater as this station experiences high wave amplification compared to other record stations the wave response curve for the variable constant partially reflecting boundaries of the paradip port with respect to the normalized dimensionless wave number is shown in fig 16 a and b and is indicated with the red and the green color curves the partial reflection coefficient given to each boundary segment ranges from 0 90 to 0 99 and the distribution of the partial reflection coefficients to each boundary is shown in fig 16 a for the constant prw the partial reflection coefficient given to all the boundaries is 0 90 the incident wave is considered as arriving towards the port entrance with wave angle π 2 a significant decrease in amplification peak is observed in both the variable and constant prw of the port compared to the fully reflecting port boundaries however it is found that the partially reflecting port boundaries can significantly reduces the wave oscillations compared to the variable partially reflecting port boundaries in the port with breakwater another breakwater is constructed in the interior bounded region the image of the port with breakwater including inner breakwater is shown in fig 16 c the amplification factor is evaluated at the record station w6 and compared with the simulation of fully reflecting port boundary the comparison of the wave responses of the fully reflecting port and the port with interior breakwater of width 8 m corresponding to m 3 including fully reflecting port boundary and partially reflecting port boundary is displayed in fig 16 d on comparing the response curves in fig 16 b d it is observed that using the interior breakwater the reduction in amplification is small compared to the prw case shown in fig 16 b with green color it is seen that a partial reflecting boundary condition in the port improve the performance of breakwater by making significant reduction of the resonance peaks inside the port therefore it is concluded that modifications in the paradip port by constructing an interior breakwater along with partial reflecting port boundary can minimize the wave oscillations under the resonance condition the wave field analysis is carried out with respect to the first two resonant frequencies in the paradip port with and without breakwater the wave height contour represents the incident wave amplification inside the port corresponding to resonant frequency for a specific incident wave direction fig 17 displays the wave height contours for the incident wave with wave angle π 2 the contour plot of wave field distribution in the paradip port without breakwater is given in a and b wave height in a is evaluated with respect to the first resonant frequency i e k1l 1 02 wave height in b is evaluated with respect to the second resonant frequency k2l 1 9 similarly wave height contours for the paradip port with permeable breakwater with m 3 are given in c and d under the resonant modes 1 02 and 1 9 respectively the resonant frequencies with permeable breakwater has a significant impact on the resonance inside the paradip port for the first resonance frequency i e k 1l 1 02 without breakwater wb the wave height amplifies at record station w5 and w6 in port whereas wave height reduces at these places with the addition permeable breakwater pb the effect of wave height due to pb at the port entrance is shown in fig 17 c for the first resonant frequency permeable breakwater has strong influence on the prominent regions with high wave fields similarly for the second resonant frequency i e k 2l 1 9 without breakwater wave height is prominent at record station w1 inside the port but however for the second resonant frequency the general pattern of wave height for the case of wb and pb is almost similar at all the selected record station it is seen that permeable breakwater effectively reduces the wave height of prominent regions inside the port wb overall it is concluded that wave height can be significantly minimized by installing permeable breakwater of appropriate wave admittance or transmission coefficient at the entrance of paradip port additionally the wave field analysis provides information about safe locations for the moored ships and vessels for cargo loading and unloading activity during the seasonal weather conditions 5 discussion during the study it was observed that paradip port located in odisha india occasionally faces extreme wave amplifications encountered by the strong wind generated by typhoons in the bay of bengal the direct propagation of these waves towards the entrance could be hazardous for the moored ships in the port therefore it is suggested that suitable breakwater can be constructed at the entrance as this structure partially transmit the wave in the port due to energy dissipation and therefore shield the entrance from the direct wave attack when the port has a narrow entrance the interior breakwater can be constructed as they can also minimize the wave oscillations in such cases the entrance breakwater is not feasible as it could create inconvenience for the movement of large ships so far the present model was used to investigate incident wave impact on port with different modification strategies note that the adoption of mse as the governing equation also has significant limitations that is its inability to predict wave response over steep bathymetries there application is limited to seabed of slope up to 1 3 therefore it cannot give accurate result for rapidly varying topographies another significant limitation of mse is inherent from the linear wave propagation model as the wave propagation is based on linear theory the accuracy of the model is reduces in shallow water due to the existence of nonlinearity the incoming wave present in the exterior of the semi circular port boundary is assumed as the monochromatic incident wave therefore future research would be needed to extend the present study with multidirectional wave s conditions such as the incident wave with ambient current multidirectional irregular incident wave further the concept of breaking waves could also be considered this work was done under the assumption of irrotational flow and the effect of rotational flow with cavity near the coastal boundary is not considered in this paper these are the major limitation of the present numerical model which can be considered in the future work 6 conclusion a computational numerical scheme using the hybrid fem is developed to investigate the wave oscillations pattern in irregular shaped harbors ports with variable bathymetry including the implication of permeable and impermeable breakwaters in addition the effect of the energy dissipation including partially reflecting wall prw frictional bottom and wave transmission through impermeable and permeable breakwater on wave oscillations inside the realistic ports are discussed the present numerical scheme is validated by comparing the wave response for partially reflecting absorbing rectangular port with previous studies the wave response of fully reflecting rectangular port with constant and varying bathymetry is also validated with the existing analytical approximations the domain discretization with non uniform and uniform mesh is considered to perform the convergence analysis on a rectangular port with a permeable breakwater at the entrance the convergence analysis concludes that the domain with non uniform discretization gives better numerical accuracy as compared to domain with uniform discretization based on the validation the present numerical scheme is applied to the rectangular port to investigate the influence of boundary energy dissipaters on wave amplification in the port the non uniform irregular mesh is used for the domain discretization the performance of impermeable and permeable breakwater fixed along the entrance or connected at different locations of the inner boundary is investigated the simulation results conclude that the wave amplification decreases with the decrease of wave reflection coefficient wave amplification peak shift to lower value with the addition of permeable breakwater structure with low admittance the amplification peaks are higher for the impermeable breakwater or minimal porous breakwater structure and the peak value decreases with the decrease in wave admittance or increase in friction factor of the breakwater region the wave amplification peak is also affected by increasing the bottom frictional factor the amplification reduces with the increase in bottom roughness additionally the numerical scheme is implemented on the paradip port to examine the incident wave response using different modification plans including permeable variable constant partially reflecting absorbing boundary and bottom friction wave response is determined at the six record stations selected inside the port the wave amplification is evaluated at each of the six record stations in port without breakwater and with permeable breakwater the resonance peaks are occurring at frequencies k 1l 1 02 k 2l 1 9 k 3l 3 48 k 4l 3 66 and k 5l 5 1 in port with without breakwater from the result of the present study on paradip port it is found that the constant partially reflecting wall of the port has a significant effect in reducing the wave amplification additionally adding a permeable breakwater in the interior of the port alongwith partially reflection boundary condition is also an effective strategy to diminish the wave response of the resonant modes the wave field analysis is performed corresponding to the first two resonant modes inside the port with and without breakwater the wave field contour representing the incident wave amplitude is plotted for an incident wave with wave angle π 2 on the basis of the wave field contour plots the regions with strong and weak amplitude is also determined which assists in predicting the safest location for the water vessels under the resonance conditions it is observed that with suitable modifications in the paradip port layout by constructing breakwater of variable permeability or wave absorbers at different locations the port s resonance can reduce significantly therefore energy dissipaters can also be constructed in port modification and planning to diminish the wave induced oscillation to some extent thus the present numerical scheme is an effective tool for constructing artificial port layout design and also used as tool to modify the existing harbor layout to reduce the resonance credit authorship contribution statement rupali conceptualization methodology software data curation

21117,a mathematical model is developed based on the application of permeable and impermeable breakwaters utilizing the mild slope equation mse to analyze the wave amplification in an arbitrary shaped

for the first time the effect of breakwaters placed at the entrance and in the bounded region along with bottom friction and partially reflecting port boundary are investigated the breakwaters with small permeability transmission coefficient have high efficiency to reduce the wave resonance inside the port keywords mild slope equation hybrid finite element method permeable and impermeable breakwaters resonance paradip port 1 introduction ocean waves propagating towards the coastal region invoke port resonance as they interact with coastal boundary of port s wall the resonance state agitates wave motion in port due to effect of multiple reflections refractions and diffractions from the coastal boundaries this perturbed oscillations could cause damage to dock and ship setups severe damage to coastal property and mooring system gao et al 2016 2018b therefore appropriate measures are needed in the design of port layout to minimize wave induced oscillations permeable and impermeable breakwaters with appropriate permeability impermeability at the coastal regions including harbors ports shelter ports and can protect the moored vessels inside the port thus an accurate understanding of wave transmission through breakwater gaps including refraction and diffraction is essential for the assessment of wave response in ports protected by breakwaters in the past theoretical and numerical studies were first conducted on rectangular geometry domain including fully reflecting boundaries ippen and goda 1963 le mehaute 1961 miles and munk 1961 further their work was extended for arbitrary shaped domain with constant water depth hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 gerber 1986 extended the work of lee 1971 by including the energy dissipation due to flow separation and bottom friction but restricted to constant depth harbor over the years wave oscillations in harbors or ports have generally been analyzed by assuming the boundaries of the port as fully reflective neither of the approaches by assuming either fully reflecting boundary or zero reflecting harbor boundary are appropriate for the application on real topographies as the partial reflections from the port boundary invariably occurs several studies have been carried out to study wave oscillation behavior in the port including the partially reflecting boundary conditions berkhoff 1976 chen 1986 isaacson and qu 1990 alternatively some researchers take account of varying bathymetry including frictional seabed and the partial reflecting domain boundary chou and han 1993 zhao et al 2001 bellotti et al 2012 gao et al 2017a 2017b 2018a kumar and gulshan 2018 wave induced oscillations due to the effect of wave reflection refraction and diffraction induced by bathymetric variations and scattering structures in arbitrary shaped domain under resonance condition was addressed by tong et al 2010 ham and bathe 2012 mercadé ruiz et al 2017 their work was further extended to model the effect of wave current interaction chen et al 2005 breakwater li et al 2006 wave breaking effects zhao 2001 the high wave oscillations induced in the port are mainly caused by the extreme transient oceanic waves such as the typhoon waves maa et al 2011 tsunami wave including the n waves gao et al 2019b and solitary waves gao et al 2019a dong et al 2020a nowadays numerical model based on mild slope equation mse kumar and rupali 2018 barbosa lópez et al 2019 ma et al 2020 and boussinesq equations losada et al 2008 gao et al 2019c 2020 dong et al 2020a ma et al 2020 are popularly utilized by the researchers to study wave oscillation problem numerous numerical analysis and field observations conducted on different real ports of the world has been published by investigators zubier et al 2003 bellotti et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 kumar and gulshan 2017 2018 kumar and rupali 2018 rupali et al 2020 dong et al 2020b researches on the development of breakwater or wave attenuator to protect the coastal and offshore structure from the strong incident waves have gained enhanced attention breakwater plays a significant role in resonance problem by reducing the resonant frequency peak appearing inside the port due to accumulation of wave energy in the enclosed domains extensive literature for the problem of wave scattering by breakwater have been reviewed by many researchers ijima et al 1975 liu 1975 mattioli 1981 bettess et al 1984 gerber 1986 philip l f liu et al 1986 dalrymple and martin 1990 analyzed the reflection and transmittance of water wave interacting with offshore breakwater yu et al 2000 studied the combined diffraction and refraction phenomenon of random wave passing through breakwater gap with different incident angles wave induced oscillations are examined in semi circular port with porous breakwater yu and chwang 1994 the response of wave interacting with the porous plate breakwater were studied by kumar and sahoo 2006 behera and sahoo 2014 tabssum et al 2020 theoretical models were developed incorporating the effect of energy dissipation through rubble mound jetties placed along the sides of port entrance panchang et al 2008 sulisz 2005 2015 traditionally full protection breakwater such as the rubble mound breakwater have been used widely to restrict water circulation near the coastal region rageh and koraim 2010 alternatively permeable breakwater structure allow the waves to pass through the breakwater allows excellent water circulation and thereby improves the water quality inside the ports sahoo et al 2000 koley and sahoo 2017 darsono and yuwono 2019 moreover permeable breakwater minimize the construction cost and are environment friendly huang et al 2011 many research project have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of impermeable and permeable breakwater based on wave induced oscillations chou and han 1993 yucheng et al 2006 ji and suh 2010 koraim et al 2011 chun et al 2012 somervell et al 2018 there are limited studies conducted based on the effects of the energy dissipation by the variable absorbing boundary bottom friction and variable wave energy transmission through permeable and impermeable breakwaters on a realistic port kostense et al 1987 chang and wang 2017 somervell et al 2018 therefore there is a need to develop a validated numerical scheme to investigate the energy dissipation effects including the permeable and impermeable breakwater on a real port such as paradip port in this paper it is presented for the first time that a breakwater at the entrance or in the bounded region along with bottom friction and partially reflecting boundary condition will minimize the resonant peak inside the port for this a hybrid finite element method hfem dong et al 2020a ma et al 2020 is applied with finite elements in the bounded region and the analytical approximation for the unbounded region therefore only the bounded region need to be discretized hence it reduces the total number of equations additionally another advantage is that the variational approach of the finite element method fem is utilized for the numerical solution as it incorporates the matching conditions between the bounded and unbounded region as the natural boundary conditions this variational technique results into the symmetric stiffness matrix which is advantageous for very large and complex geometrical domains to apply the numerical scheme the permeable and impermeable breakwaters are placed at different locations inside the port and the reduction in the wave amplification is examined at the resonant frequencies or peak frequencies domain discretization with irregular mesh is considered for optimum numerical accuracy the influence of variable wave absorbing partial reflection boundaries permeable and impermeable breakwaters and bottom friction factors on the paradip port odisha india is investigated based on the simulation results some tactics such as adding permeable and impermeable breakwaters and wave absorbers at the entrance and the port boundary is suggested to reduce the resonance in the paradip port the current numerical scheme can be implemented on any other realistic port harbor connected to the open sea for the practical applications 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 model geometry the fluid region is divided into two subregions the inner region ω 1 and the outer region ω r as shown in fig 1 a the two regions are separated by a pseudo boundary denoted by ω 1 the inner region includes the wave scattering structure such as port fully reflective coastal boundaries and connected pseudo boundary ω 1 the outer boundary ω r is assumed to be lying at infinity a permeable breakwater structure is placed along the edges of port entrance to minimize the incoming wave intensity in which region 1 is incident wave region and region 3 is wave transmitted region see fig 1 b impermeable breakwaters are placed inside the port along some portions of its

incident wave strikes a breakwater at entrance some of the wave energy is partially reflected back to open sea and some part of the wave is absorbed or transmitted into the breakwater region within the breakwater region the waves are continuously reflected and transmitted and the wave motion decays due to energy dissipation when the waves propagate towards the leeward face some of the waves are partially transmitted into the port similarly the waves entrapped in the port are radiated out towards the sea through the seaward face of the breakwater to obtain the wave equation for region 2

in finite element method the weighted residual approach bellotti et al 2012 and the variational approach mei and chen 1976 are the most common approaches to solve a partial differential equation in weighted residual approach the weak formulation is deduced by integrating the weighted residual of the differential equation whereas variational approach utilizes energy conservation principle in which unknowns are determined by minimizing principle energy functional the present work utilizes the variational approach of the fem as it results into symmetric stiffness matrix a symmetric

the unknown potentials of all the node points are determined by solving the system using gauss elimination method 3 convergence and validation of the numerical scheme against existing studies 3 1 convergence of numerical scheme a numerical scheme is said to converge if the numerical solution approaches the true solution as the discretized mesh is refined the rate of convergence is also providing information about the efficiency and accuracy of any numerical scheme therefore it is important to determine the order of convergence of a numerical scheme before applying on any realistic domain here the order of convergence for the present numerical scheme with uniform and non uniform domain discretization is determined suppose the domain is discretized into n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 number of mesh elements the error norm formula is given as 40 er 1 norm ϕ n 1 ϕ n 5 2 b n 1 α er 2 norm ϕ n 2 ϕ n 5 2 b n 2 α where α refers to the order of convergence and b is the error constant to determine the convergence of the above numerical scheme a rectangular port is considered with dimensions 0 31 m length 0 06 m width and 0 26 m depth the image of the model rectangular port discretized with uniform discrete elements is displayed in fig 2 a the image of a fully open discretized port using the non uniform mesh is shown in fig 2 b and the image of the discretized port with breakwater at the entrance using the non uniform mesh is shown in fig 2 c the cartesian coordinates are lying at the entrance with x axis parallel to the coastal boundary y axis towards the open sea and the z axis is vertically upward in direction the semicircular pseudo boundary is lying at a radius r of 0 09 m from the origin the boundary reflection coefficient for the port is taken as 0 98 breakwater of width 0 006 m with wave admittance value 3 is placed at both the entrance edges the rectangular port is discretized into n 1 1625 n 2 3250 n 3 6500 n 4 13000 and n 5 26000 number of the discrete triangular elements using uniform structured and non uniform discretization here n5 26000 is considered as the maximum number of discretization to estimate the order of convergence the ratio between the minimum grid size of non uniform mesh to the grid size of uniform mesh is 2 5 in fig 3 a the error norm of the present numerical scheme is evaluated and compared for the port with uniform and non uniform discretization in fig 3 b the logarithm error norm is plotted with respect to the logarithmic value of the domain for both the discretization the two equations in eq 40 are solved to determine the value of convergence rate and the error constant the order of convergence with non uniform domain discretization is 1 6 and with the uniform domain discretization is 1 11 therefore the present numerical scheme with non uniform discretization converges faster compare to uniform domain discretization 3 2 validation of numerical scheme to validate the numerical scheme on the rectangular port the port is discretized using the non uniform mesh element in the numerical computation the total number of discretized mesh elements in the rectangular port is given as 1570 and the nodes are 934 the discretized image is given in fig 2 b in which the maximum grid size of the mesh element is 0 05 and the mesh size of the element close to the solid wall is 0 009 the boundary of the port is considered as partially reflecting the response of incident wave to port is determined by the parameter amplification factor which is defined as the ratio of wave amplitude at any point inside the port to the incident wave amplitude the wave amplification factor is computed at the back wall point of the rectangular port marked as w in fig 2 the effectiveness of the partially reflecting port boundary on amplification factor is investigated for rectangular port and the results are validated with the simulation of chen 1986 the reflection coefficient of the boundary is represented by kr with values lying between 0 and 1 here kr 1 represents fully reflecting boundary and kr 0 98 0 95 stand for partially reflecting port boundary in which kr 0 98 represents less partially reflecting port boundary compared to kr 0 95 in fig 4 a the amplification factor obtained by chen 1986 is shown including the effect of variable partially reflecting boundary in the absence of bottom friction corresponding to reflection coefficient values k r 1 0 98 0 95 and 0 90 respectively all the boundary walls were given the same reflection coefficient the wave response is determined at the back wall of the rectangular port for an incident wave angle π 2 in fig 4 b the wave response is obtained using the present numerical scheme on a rectangular port corresponding to different reflection coefficient values as taken by chen 1986 and for the same incident wave angle in the figure the ordinate represents the amplification factor computed for partially reflecting rectangular port while abscissa is considered as non dimensional or normalized wave number kl where l is the characteristic length of the port which is equal to 0 31 m on comparing the simulation results between the present and existing study it is observed that the pattern of the curve in the two figures are similar with two resonance peaks however the slight variation in the amplification is due to the difference in domain discretization the present results are simulated for port discretized into non uniform mesh elements whereas in chen 1986 the uniform regular mesh elements were used to discretize the domain additionally the validation of the present model for the port with fully reflecting boundary and constant depth is carried out by comparing the amplification factor with the analytical approximation by lee 1971 the simulation of the present and analytical approximation is displayed in fig 4 b and it is seen that the comparison shows a good agreement with analytical approximation the numerical scheme is also validated for the rectangular port with varying water depth by comparing the present result with the analytical result of wang et al 2015 the amplification factor is evaluated at the back boundary of the rectangular port with dimensions 1200 m length 200 m width and 10 m depth of the back boundary in the bounded region the bottom is exponentially varying and is given as h h 0 exp 0 001341 y for 0 y l and in the outer region the water depth is 50 m the wave response is evaluated with respect to the normalized wave number and is shown in fig 5 4 numerical simulation results in this section numerical simulations are conducted on a rectangular port to analyze the effect of the variable reflecting boundaries wave transmission through a permeable and impermeable breakwater and frictional bottom conditions the incident waves are assumed as arriving at the entrance with wave angle π 2 the rectangular port has length 0 31 m width 0 06 m and a constant depth equal to 0 26 m the port is discretized with the non uniform mesh elements of which each element has an edge length less than and equal to 0 05 the total number of mesh elements in the port are 1570 and the total nodes are 934 4 1 influence of permeable and impermeable breakwater in the rectangular port permeable and impermeable breakwaters are placed at the entrance the domain boundaries are fully reflecting and the bottom is frictionless the entrance width of the port is 0 03 m the amplification factor is computed at the location marked as w in the port the variations in the wave response of port corresponding to impermeable breakwater ib k t 0 and permeable breakwater pb of width wb 0 006m with respect to different values of m 1 3 and 5 are shown in fig 6 when the wave admittance m decreases the wave energy dissipation increases due to increasing frictional factor of the breakwater region results in slow wave transmission this has been shown in previous researches by various investigators liu et al 1986 dalrymple et al 1991 the results in fig 6 demonstrate that the breakwater with the low admittance significantly reduces the amplification or the resonance peak value compared to the high admittance value increasing breakwater friction or low admittance results in slow transmission of wave and therefore result into reduced wave fluctuations in the port when comparing the effect of wave amplification with permeable and impermeable breakwater it is observed that the amplification is high for the case of an impermeable breakwater at the entrance the reason is that the impermeable breakwater makes the entrance narrow therefore more reflection diffraction occurs and the wave entrapped in the harbor amplifies with finite small transmission coefficient i e low admittance wave transmit slowly in the port and also the waves inside the port are not entrapped and are radiated out towards the sea therefore the resonant peak decreases effectively the increase in permeability energy dissipation of the breakwater reduces the resonance as compared to an impermeable breakwater therefore adding the permeable breakwaters at the entrance in a rectangular harbor is a good strategy for reducing amplification under the resonance conditions 4 2 influence of partial full variable reflection the effect of wave response due to variable partially reflecting boundary inside the domain is demonstrated in fig 7 the wave response curve shown with the dark green line corresponds to the partially reflecting wall prw l1 see fig 7 with a reflection coefficient i e kr 0 95 and other walls are treated as fully reflecting wall the wave response plotted in red line is for the partially reflecting wall l3 blue line corresponds to partially reflecting wall l1 l3 the pink line represents the wave response when wall l1 l2 l3 are partially reflecting purple line refer to wave response when wall l1 to l5 are partially reflecting the reflection coefficient in all these cases is the same i e kr 0 95 on comparing the wave responses of various combinations of partially reflecting walls of the port it is seen that the wave amplification of the resonant peaks reduces effectively with the inclusion of partially reflecting walls of the port 4 3 influence of bottom friction parameter from eq friction factor is variable and depends on relative roughness parameter α c b f therefore in order to determine the effect of bottom friction factor on wave amplification in the rectangular port first the roughness height c b f need to be set in the study by nielsen 2009 it is suggested that the nikuradse roughness height jonsson and carlsen 1976 for a flat sand bottom with uniform granulometry is defines as c b f 2 5 d 50 whereas the motion of sediments create sand ripples thereby increase the roughness height at the bottom which in term makes an increase in the ratio of c b f d 50 to the order from few hundred to thousand pascolo et al 2018 in this way the roughness height value remains arbitrary for heterogeneous bottoms so for the present analysis default value of the roughness height are selected as 0 006 m and 0 009 m for port with bottom depth of 0 26 m as the frictional factor increases with the increase in bottom roughness height the variation in the wave response are observed corresponding to different bottom roughness values and the simulated results are displayed in fig 8 the black line indicates the amplification curve for the water depth of h 0 26 m and nikuradse roughness height cbf 0 m i e without friction whereas the red line indicate the curve for roughness height cbf 0 003 m the blue line is refer to cbf 0 006 m and the curve with orange line refer to cbf 0 009 m it is seen that the bottom roughness parameter influences the wave response in the harbor with an increase in bottom roughness value the amplification peak reduces substantially 4 4 implementation of permeable impermeable breakwater on paradip port paradip port is one of the largest industrial port situated in odisha india on the coast of bay of bengal occasionally the strong seasonal waves induce extreme wave amplification of about 3 5 m in height inside the paradip port the pier structure of the port is capable of handling cargo of 118 5 mmt million metric tons annually including 200 dwt dead weight tonnage size ship the topographic image of the port captured from the google mapping tool is shown in fig 9 for the estimation of wave response inside the port the six locations or the record stations are selected based on ship location berth which are marked as w1 to w6 see fig 9 the non uniform domain discretization of the paradip port with and without breakwater permeable is given in fig 10 the port with and without breakwater is discretized into 2714 mesh elements with 1580 nodes the maximum grid size of the mesh element in the port without breakwater is 0 081 and the boundary element has edge length less than 0 081 whereas the maximum grid size of the mesh element in the port with breakwater is 0 080 the grid size of the mesh element close to the wall is 0 02 the solution at the boundary changes frequently due to local resonance generated by reflection and diffractions of the entrapped wave in the port region the local resonance induce near the moored ship at port provide the important information for the safety of the moored vessel and the coastal structure therefore it is essential to construct refined mesh near the boundary to obtain the optimum numerical solution without losing any crucial information in non uniform mesh discretization the boundary of the port is refined as compared to the interior domain at the corner point also the mesh element is dense so that the optimum accuracy is obtained for the practical application in addition the numerical simulation is conducted for non uniform mesh elements to understand the implication of the permeable breakwater at the port entrance the bathymetry data of the paradip port is given in fig 11 with depth in the bounded region lies between 5 m and 18 m the estimated depth near the ship terminals are between 8 m and 12 m whereas around the entrance it is 15 16 m approximately to verify the number of elements selected for the discretization of port provide results with acceptable accuracy the port is discretized into 2714 and 5428 number of mesh elements and the simulations are performed for these two cases in the port without breakwater the comparison of the wave response for the two grid resolutions at the record station w3 to w6 are shown in fig 12 the response curve for 2714 number of elements is displayed with black color and the response curve for 5428 number of elements is displayed with green color from the figure it can be visualized that there is no significant change in the results with the two discretizations therefore further simulations in the paradip port are conducted for 2714 discrete mesh elements the amplification factor is computed with respect to the normalized wave number kl l is a characteristic length of the port with value 1300 m in fig 13 comparisons of the amplification factor determined at the six record stations w1 to w6 inside paradip port odisha without breakwater black line and with permeable breakwater red line of width 20 m placed at the entrance is shown the incident waves are considered as arriving at the entrance with wave angle θ0 π 2 for the current simulations the results are simulated corresponding to the admittance value equal to 3 it is observed from fig 13 that the wave amplification is stronger for the port without breakwater at all the record stations whereas the amplification decreases with the addition of permeable breakwater at the entrance there are five prominent resonance peaks which are clearly visible in fig 13 at record stations w2 w4 w5 and w6 respectively the resonance peaks are occurring at wave frequencies k1l 1 02 k2l 1 9 k3l 3 48 k4l 3 66 and k5l 5 1 in port with and without breakwater the incident wave with frequency same as the resonant frequency are very critical for the inner and outer boundary of the port as these waves could induce strong oscillations in the port these oscillations results in delaying loading unloading of cargo activity sometime damages the moored ships and the port boundaries for the first and fourth resonant mode wave amplification in the port without breakwater is strong at the record stations w1 w2 w5 and w6 as shown is fig 13 for the first resonant mode high wave amplification is seen at record station w5 and w6 and for the fourth resonant mode wave amplifies strongly at all the record stations except record station w3 from the figure it is found that the record station w6 experiences extreme wave amplification compared to the other stations this is probably expected due to the location of record station w6 wave undergoes frequent reflection and diffraction from the interior walls and corners constructing a permeable breakwater at the entrance decrease the amplification at the record station w1 substantially compared to other record stations however it is seen that permeable breakwater significantly reduces the wave amplification corresponding to all the resonant modes at each record stations this is probably expected as the permeable breakwater allows slower wave transmission into the port which results in minimum wave amplification inside the port also it allows the wave in port to transmit out towards the sea hence this process effectively subsides the wave induced oscillations in the port under the resonant conditions the amplification curve for the monochromatic incident wave falling at the entrance with wave angle θ0 π 4 is evaluated with respect to the non dimensional normalized wave number the wave response curve at six record stations is shown in fig 14 five resonant modes can be seen at record stations w1 w2 w4 and w6 respectively and values the resonant modes are the same as mentioned in the previous paragraph when comparing the wave response of the two figures figs 13 and 14 it is found that the wave amplification corresponding to the resonant modes is high in fig 13 at all record stations compared to the wave amplification shown in fig 14 this reveals that different incident wave directions also impact wave amplification from fig 14 in the port without breakwater first second and fourth resonant modes are prominent compared to the other for these resonant modes wave amplifies strongly at record station w6 the wave response curves in fig 14 reveals that the presence of permeable breakwater m 3 at the entrance is significantly diminishes the amplification at record station w1 for all the resonant modes peaks also it is observed that as the breakwater is located close to the record station w1 the wave amplification corresponding to the first resonant mode at the record station w1 decreases effectively compared to the wave response of the first resonant mode at all other stations it is visualized that the permeable breakwater is highly effective at the record stations with high amplification such as w5 and w6 however it is found that breakwater structure with a finite low transmission coefficient or wave admittance diminishes the wave amplifications peak correspond to all the resonant frequencies at each of six selected record stations in the port variations of the amplification factor curve for the paradip port with the permeable breakwater at the six record stations w1 to w6 are shown in fig 15 with respect to different partially reflecting port boundaries the curve in black color is wave response of port with fully reflected boundary with reflection coefficient 1 bottom roughness factor 0 i e kr 1 cbf 0 the response curve with red color is for port with reflection coefficient 0 95 and bottom roughness factor 0 06 m i e kr 0 95 cbf 0 06 m the curve in blue color represents wave response in port with reflection coefficient 0 90 and bottom roughness factor 0 06 m i e kr 0 90 cbf 0 06 m the admittance parameter value is 3 for all the cases from the figure it is noticed that an increase in amplitude occurs at the low wave number this is due to the local resonance generated by the wave interaction with irregular and sharp corners of the port the resonant peaks that are clearly seen at record station w1 w5 and w6 of the fully reflecting port represented with the black line disappear in the curve shown in red and blue color due to the presence of partially reflecting boundary and frictional bottom port with solid boundary walls leads to worst wave oscillations at all the record stations the increase in the reflection coefficient weakens the wave fluctuations the effect of the variable constant partially reflecting port boundary and the effect of adding a breakwater in the interior of the port on wave amplification is investigated the simulation results are obtained at record station w6 in the port with breakwater as this station experiences high wave amplification compared to other record stations the wave response curve for the variable constant partially reflecting boundaries of the paradip port with respect to the normalized dimensionless wave number is shown in fig 16 a and b and is indicated with the red and the green color curves the partial reflection coefficient given to each boundary segment ranges from 0 90 to 0 99 and the distribution of the partial reflection coefficients to each boundary is shown in fig 16 a for the constant prw the partial reflection coefficient given to all the boundaries is 0 90 the incident wave is considered as arriving towards the port entrance with wave angle π 2 a significant decrease in amplification peak is observed in both the variable and constant prw of the port compared to the fully reflecting port boundaries however it is found that the partially reflecting port boundaries can significantly reduces the wave oscillations compared to the variable partially reflecting port boundaries in the port with breakwater another breakwater is constructed in the interior bounded region the image of the port with breakwater including inner breakwater is shown in fig 16 c the amplification factor is evaluated at the record station w6 and compared with the simulation of fully reflecting port boundary the comparison of the wave responses of the fully reflecting port and the port with interior breakwater of width 8 m corresponding to m 3 including fully reflecting port boundary and partially reflecting port boundary is displayed in fig 16 d on comparing the response curves in fig 16 b d it is observed that using the interior breakwater the reduction in amplification is small compared to the prw case shown in fig 16 b with green color it is seen that a partial reflecting boundary condition in the port improve the performance of breakwater by making significant reduction of the resonance peaks inside the port therefore it is concluded that modifications in the paradip port by constructing an interior breakwater along with partial reflecting port boundary can minimize the wave oscillations under the resonance condition the wave field analysis is carried out with respect to the first two resonant frequencies in the paradip port with and without breakwater the wave height contour represents the incident wave amplification inside the port corresponding to resonant frequency for a specific incident wave direction fig 17 displays the wave height contours for the incident wave with wave angle π 2 the contour plot of wave field distribution in the paradip port without breakwater is given in a and b wave height in a is evaluated with respect to the first resonant frequency i e k1l 1 02 wave height in b is evaluated with respect to the second resonant frequency k2l 1 9 similarly wave height contours for the paradip port with permeable breakwater with m 3 are given in c and d under the resonant modes 1 02 and 1 9 respectively the resonant frequencies with permeable breakwater has a significant impact on the resonance inside the paradip port for the first resonance frequency i e k 1l 1 02 without breakwater wb the wave height amplifies at record station w5 and w6 in port whereas wave height reduces at these places with the addition permeable breakwater pb the effect of wave height due to pb at the port entrance is shown in fig 17 c for the first resonant frequency permeable breakwater has strong influence on the prominent regions with high wave fields similarly for the second resonant frequency i e k 2l 1 9 without breakwater wave height is prominent at record station w1 inside the port but however for the second resonant frequency the general pattern of wave height for the case of wb and pb is almost similar at all the selected record station it is seen that permeable breakwater effectively reduces the wave height of prominent regions inside the port wb overall it is concluded that wave height can be significantly minimized by installing permeable breakwater of appropriate wave admittance or transmission coefficient at the entrance of paradip port additionally the wave field analysis provides information about safe locations for the moored ships and vessels for cargo loading and unloading activity during the seasonal weather conditions 5 discussion during the study it was observed that paradip port located in odisha india occasionally faces extreme wave amplifications encountered by the strong wind generated by typhoons in the bay of bengal the direct propagation of these waves towards the entrance could be hazardous for the moored ships in the port therefore it is suggested that suitable breakwater can be constructed at the entrance as this structure partially transmit the wave in the port due to energy dissipation and therefore shield the entrance from the direct wave attack when the port has a narrow entrance the interior breakwater can be constructed as they can also minimize the wave oscillations in such cases the entrance breakwater is not feasible as it could create inconvenience for the movement of large ships so far the present model was used to investigate incident wave impact on port with different modification strategies note that the adoption of mse as the governing equation also has significant limitations that is its inability to predict wave response over steep bathymetries there application is limited to seabed of slope up to 1 3 therefore it cannot give accurate result for rapidly varying topographies another significant limitation of mse is inherent from the linear wave propagation model as the wave propagation is based on linear theory the accuracy of the model is reduces in shallow water due to the existence of nonlinearity the incoming wave present in the exterior of the semi circular port boundary is assumed as the monochromatic incident wave therefore future research would be needed to extend the present study with multidirectional wave s conditions such as the incident wave with ambient current multidirectional irregular incident wave further the concept of breaking waves could also be considered this work was done under the assumption of irrotational flow and the effect of rotational flow with cavity near the coastal boundary is not considered in this paper these are the major limitation of the present numerical model which can be considered in the future work 6 conclusion a computational numerical scheme using the hybrid fem is developed to investigate the wave oscillations pattern in irregular shaped harbors ports with variable bathymetry including the implication of permeable and impermeable breakwaters in addition the effect of the energy dissipation including partially reflecting wall prw frictional bottom and wave transmission through impermeable and permeable breakwater on wave oscillations inside the realistic ports are discussed the present numerical scheme is validated by comparing the wave response for partially reflecting absorbing rectangular port with previous studies the wave response of fully reflecting rectangular port with constant and varying bathymetry is also validated with the existing analytical approximations the domain discretization with non uniform and uniform mesh is considered to perform the convergence analysis on a rectangular port with a permeable breakwater at the entrance the convergence analysis concludes that the domain with non uniform discretization gives better numerical accuracy as compared to domain with uniform discretization based on the validation the present numerical scheme is applied to the rectangular port to investigate the influence of boundary energy dissipaters on wave amplification in the port the non uniform irregular mesh is used for the domain discretization the performance of impermeable and permeable breakwater fixed along the entrance or connected at different locations of the inner boundary is investigated the simulation results conclude that the wave amplification decreases with the decrease of wave reflection coefficient wave amplification peak shift to lower value with the addition of permeable breakwater structure with low admittance the amplification peaks are higher for the impermeable breakwater or minimal porous breakwater structure and the peak value decreases with the decrease in wave admittance or increase in friction factor of the breakwater region the wave amplification peak is also affected by increasing the bottom frictional factor the amplification reduces with the increase in bottom roughness additionally the numerical scheme is implemented on the paradip port to examine the incident wave response using different modification plans including permeable variable constant partially reflecting absorbing boundary and bottom friction wave response is determined at the six record stations selected inside the port the wave amplification is evaluated at each of the six record stations in port without breakwater and with permeable breakwater the resonance peaks are occurring at frequencies k 1l 1 02 k 2l 1 9 k 3l 3 48 k 4l 3 66 and k 5l 5 1 in port with without breakwater from the result of the present study on paradip port it is found that the constant partially reflecting wall of the port has a significant effect in reducing the wave amplification additionally adding a permeable breakwater in the interior of the port alongwith partially reflection boundary condition is also an effective strategy to diminish the wave response of the resonant modes the wave field analysis is performed corresponding to the first two resonant modes inside the port with and without breakwater the wave field contour representing the incident wave amplitude is plotted for an incident wave with wave angle π 2 on the basis of the wave field contour plots the regions with strong and weak amplitude is also determined which assists in predicting the safest location for the water vessels under the resonance conditions it is observed that with suitable modifications in the paradip port layout by constructing breakwater of variable permeability or wave absorbers at different locations the port s resonance can reduce significantly therefore energy dissipaters can also be constructed in port modification and planning to diminish the wave induced oscillation to some extent thus the present numerical scheme is an effective tool for constructing artificial port

21118,faraday wave means the standing wave produced in a vertically excited tank the wave characteristics and trigger conditions of various modes especially the high order modes are rarely reported in this paper an in house code newtank and a hexapod motion sloshing test platform were employed to study mode 1 to mode 5 faraday waves the two dimensional 2d nonlinear mode 1 and mode 2 faraday waves were obtained through both experiments and simulations besides the 2d strongly breaking mode 2 2d steep mode 3 and fully three dimensional 3d mode 4 faraday waves were investigated numerically the

under multiple frequency excitations keywords faraday wave parametric sloshing newtank nonlinear wave experiments wavelet analysis 1 introduction faraday wave widely exists in liquid containers under earthquake and wave excitations which can be easily triggered especially for the case that the vertical forcing frequency is equal to integer times of the system s natural frequencies the first available investigation was performed by faraday 1831 who exerted harmonic vertical oscillations to fluid and the standing wave was formed ultimately the phenomenon is also called parametric instability or parametric resonance yu et al 2020 in some extreme circumstances faraday wave may be violently breaking along with strong loads on the system which may cause devastating damage thereby this problem has attracted researchers to understand the mechanism of the nonlinear breaking phenomenon which is also of crucial importance to tank designers most of the early theoretical works followed mathieu 1868 who gave the law of vibration of elliptical membrane i e mathieu equation and concluded that the behavior of the mathieu equation was governed by the ratio of the forcing frequency to the system s natural frequency the frequency ratio and the peak acceleration benjamin and ursell 1954 found the governing equation of faraday wave could be formulated as the mathieu equation and the wave response can be explained through the analytical works of mclachlan 1947 abramowitz and segun 1968 and richards 1983 miles 1984 theoretically analyzed the parametric sloshing in partially filled cylindrical tanks henderson and miles 1990 gave a comprehensive review of the parametric sloshing zhang and vinals 1997 deduced the weakly nonlinear approximations of faraday wave the multi modal approach was applied by faltinsen and timokha 2001 to research the nonlinear sloshing and higher modes were proved to be of great importance frandsen 2004 obtained a third order solution of the parametric sloshing by the perturbation method meziani and ourrad 2014 discussed the influence of capillary effect on the vertically excited stable sloshing other works sorokin 1957 taylor and narendra 1969 richards 1976 horsley and forbes 2013 etc were aiming at viscous effects on the parametric instability through the artificial damping analytically due to the difficulty in handling the diffusion terms in navier stokes equations the instability for real viscous fluid was still left to be resolved even so several instability diagrams for the fundamental natural frequency have been obtained experimentally benjamin and ursell 1954 jiang et al 1997 kolukula et al 2015 etc recently ibrahim 2015 gave a comprehensive review of recent literatures about the parametric sloshing the mentioned theories were almost within the scope of inviscid linear weakly nonlinear or artificial viscous category therefore the fully nonlinear phenomena could not be well explained jiang et al 1997 experimentally investigated the mode 2 steep and breaking faraday waves and the extreme steepness 0 216 was obtained the flat topped mode 3 faraday waves were experimentally observed by bredmose et al 2003 frandsen and peng 2006 conducted experiments to investigate the parametric sloshing in square tanks and finally a breaking mushroom mode 2 wave was found other wave patterns for example parallel line edwards and fauve 1994 hexagon binks et al 1997 and square kityk et al 2005 were also obtained numerical modelling is mainly divided into two scenarios namely inviscid nonlinear model jiang et al 1996 frandsen 2004 ning et al 2012 buldakov 2014 and navier stokes model kim 2001 godderidge et al 2009 xue et al 2012 2019 dou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 ubal et al 2003 discussed the influence of water depth on the parametric sloshing by applying the direct numerical simulation dns based on navier stokes equations o connor 2008 presented the square pattern faraday wave by adopting the arbitrary lagrange euler spectral element method the six degree freedom violent sloshing was numerically studied by liu and lin 2008 and xue and lin 2011 by employing their in house navier stokes models perinet et al 2009 applied the finite difference method and two step projection method to solve the navier stokes equations and the hexagonal pattern wave was found elahi et al 2015 developed a 2d navier stokes solver to simulate sloshing under various excitations luo et al 2016 adopted a 3d navier stokes numerical model based on consistent particle method cpm to study the violent sloshing under regular and irregular excitations although the three elementary modes have been reported in literatures and the 2d ones are primarily considered and high modes in rectangular tanks are relatively less reported thereby this study aims to investigate various modes of 2d and 3d nonlinear breaking faraday waves including mode 1 to mode 5 through experimental and numerical methods the plunging and splashing wave as well as the symmetric fully 3d faraday wave are formed the free surface displacements and snapshots are analyzed in connection with the nonlinearity and breaking phenomenon the fft technique is adopted to identify the frequency response what s more the transfer of transient nonlinear energy is analyzed through the wavelet analysis technique finally a fully 3d anti symmetric multiple modal faraday wave is guaranteed by the multiple frequency excitations 2 experimental setup the sloshing tests were performed in laboratory of vibration test and liquid sloshing at hohai university of china xue et al 2013 2017 yu et al 2019 2020 the schematic diagram of basic setups is graphed in fig 1 the dimensions of the 3d tank are length l 0 6 m and width w 0 3 m and the water depth h is fixed at 0 12 m hence the first order and second order natural frequencies at the length direction are ω 1 5 3483 rad s and ω 2 9 3453 rad s respectively the capacitive type wave gauge with sampling frequency of 1000 hz is used to record the time history of the sloshing wave which is produced by nanjing yunchuangyuan intelligent technology co ltd the tank was inclined at the beginning moment with an angle θ being 15 and rotated to horizontal position at the first 4 3 s then the vertical excitation started the camera was put at 1 0 m away from the tank and parallel to the still water depth in order to better visualize the free surface profiles we put 10 g of ink into the water which has been proved to have less influence on physical properties of water in the contrast tests with pure water sloshing 3 methodology for faraday waves the standing wave in a 2d vertically excited confined tank length and filling depth being l and h is called faraday wave if the liquid is assumed to be inviscid and irrotational the vertical displacement of the tank follows the harmonic function z t a vcos ω v t where a v and ω v represent the forcing displacement amplitude and forcing frequency respectively then the free surface displacement z ζ x z t can be formulated as eq 1 benjamin and ursell 1954 1 ζ n 0 sin k n x z n t where k n 2 n 1 π l z n t can be derived from eq 2 homogeneous mathieu equation by giving appropriate initial conditions 2 z n t p n 2 q n cos 2 t z n t 0 where p n 4 ω n 2 ω v 2 q n 2 ω n 2 ω v 2 a v ω v 2 g 2 a v ω n 2 g t 1 2 ω v t and ω n 2 g k n tanh k n h for n 1 2 3 the free surface displacement is governed by the frequency ratio ω n ω v and peak acceleration a v ω v 2 g mclachlan 1947 abramowitz and segun 1968 and the contour plot of each natural frequency frandsen 2004 is displayed in fig 2 in order to explore the first four modes of faraday waves namely mode 1 to mode 4 as well as the multiple modal faraday wave seven test cases considered herein are displayed in fig 2 marked by star among which v1 v5 are applied to trigger mode 1 to mode 4 and v6 and v7 are adopted to motivate the anti symmetric multiple mode 4 numerical methodology the fluids air and liquid are assumed to be viscous newtonian the fluid motions are governed by the continuity equation and the spatially averaged navier stokes equations sans of which the turbulence is solved by the smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs reynolds stress model with the top hat space filter liu and lin 2008 xue and lin 2011 in order to avoid complicated moving boundaries the non inertial frame is adopted finally the total governing equations can be summarized as follows 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i f i 1 ρ τ i j x j 1 ρ τ i j r x j where u i and p are the filtered velocity and pressure respectively ρ is the fluid density f i is the external body force τ i j and τ i j r are the molecular viscous and sgs reynolds stress tensors respectively which are defined as τ i j 2 ρ ν σ i j and τ i j r 2 ρ ν t σ i j where σ i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i ν and ν t represent the molecular kinematic viscosity and the molecular eddy viscosity l s 2 2 σ i j σ i j respectively l s is formulated as the product of the smagorinsky length scale c s chosen as 0 15 and the filter width δ x δ y δ z 3 where δ x δ y and δ z are the grid lengths in the three directions the external force f i in the non inertial reference frame includes the gravitational force the translational and rotational inertia forces and the vector form is defined as follows 5 f g d u d t d ω d t r r 2 ω d r r d t ω ω r r where g u and ω denote the gravitational the translational velocity and the rotational velocity vectors respectively r and r are the position vectors of the considered point and rotational motion origin to the origin of the computation domain respectively the first two vectors g and u represent the gravity and translational accelerations respectively and the rest three d ω d t r r 2 ω d r r d t and ω ω r r denote the angular acceleration coriolis force and centrifugal force respectively here three motions surge heave and pitch are shown in fig 3 all derivatives are discretized by the finite difference method of which the time derivatives and the nonlinear convection terms are discretized by upwind and the combination of upwind and central difference schemes respectively and other terms like the pressure gradients and diffusion terms are solved by the central difference method the time varying free surface is tracked by the second order volume of fluid vof method gueyffier et al 1999 liu 2007 the two projection method is applied to solve the spatially averaged navier stokes equations and the detailed treatments are divided into two steps as follows 6 step 1 u i n 1 u i n δ t u j n u i n x j 1 ρ n τ i j n x j 1 ρ n τ i j r n x j 7 step 2 u i n 1 u i n 1 δ t 1 ρ n p n 1 x i f i where u i n 1 is an intermediate velocity u i n 1 at the n 1 th time step taking the divergence of eq 7 and recalling eq 3 the pressure poisson equation ppe can be derived 8 x i 1 ρ n p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i n 1 x i f i x i by the bi cgstab method the ppe can be resolved all the detailed treatments can be found in liu and lin 2008 5 results and discussions the section includes the experimental and numerical studies of the 2d nonlinear mode 1 and mode 2 faraday waves besides the 2d strongly breaking mode 2 and steep mode 3 faraday wave are followed in reality the fully 3d faraday wave dominating at both horizontal directions is more common than the 2d one which will also be investigated herein as a demonstration the 3d multiple modal faraday wave is guaranteed through multiple frequency excitation the frequency response and energy transfer are also identified by applying the fft and wavelet analysis techniques 5 1 numerical validations and discussions the numerical model will be validated against the self conducted experiments including 2d mode 1 and mode 2 faraday waves and the frequency response and transferring of transient nonlinear energy among various frequencies are also followed 5 1 1 nonlinear mode 1 faraday wave the analytical analysis reveals that the mode 1 faraday wave can be triggered when the forcing frequency is equal to two times of the first order natural frequency in order to obtain mode 1 v1 in fig 2 is adopted with the corresponding parameters being ω v 0 005 m and ω v 2ω 1 10 697 rad s the computation domain 0 6m 0 3m 0 21m is discretized into 120 60 42 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y δ z 0 005 m the timestep is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the comparisons of time histories of free surface displacements at gauge1 among the present numerical experimental and analytical results are shown in fig 4 a all data agree well at the first 20 s the numerical result always keeps in accordance with the experimental data as expected both results start to overestimate the analytical solution at the peak but underestimate that at the trough displaying an obvious asymmetry growing phase shifts can also be found showing the importance of non linearity while the analytical solution ignoring the nonlinear convective terms remains systematical and continues to grow exponentially hence it can be concluded that the proposed model is of good accuracy in modeling the nonlinear mode 1 faraday wave the frequency responses are demonstrated in fig 4 b both numerical and experimental results are nearly the same with the dominant and secondary response frequencies being about ω 1 and 2 ω 1 half the forcing frequency and the forcing frequency respectively and other frequencies close to integral times of ω 1 contribute to the asymmetry higher peaks and lower troughs namely wave non linearity the wavelet analysis result of the numerical data fig 4 c identifies that the main energy is distributed between 0 87 hz and 1 75 hz especially around 0 87 hz in agreement with the fft result which also means the dominant wave is mode 1 when the wave steepness increases ranging from 20 0 s to 50 0 s the non linearity is reinforced thus energy gradually rises around 1 75 hz and 3 44 hz close to integral times of the first order natural frequency in other cases it transfers to other frequencies as the free surface displacement decreases mainly due to the weakness of non linearity the comparisons of the free surface snapshots between the present numerical including pressure pa and experimental results at various moments are graphed in fig 5 as can be found the discrepancies are unapparent and rather good agreement has been guaranteed it is obvious the dominant wavelength is about two times of the tank length however due to the non linearity causing by modes competitions the wavelength is not strictly two times of the tank length considering the wave steepness is moderate wave breaking does not emerge and a 2d planar wave is guaranteed 5 1 2 nonlinear mode 2 faraday wave the mode 2 faraday wave has also been experimentally and numerically investigated other than the displacement amplitude and forcing frequency shifted into ω v 0 0025 m and ω v 2ω 2 18 691 rad s respectively resulting in a peak acceleration being 0 089 g v2 in fig 2 and the rest setups remained unchanged convergent tests have been performed for different mesh sizes 0 003 m 0 005 m and 0 0075 m and the results reveal that average mesh size 0 005 m is enough to resolve the sloshing hence the computation domain 0 6m 0 3m 0 4m is discretized into 120 60 80 uniform grids fig 6 a gives the comparisons of time histories of the free surface displacements at gauge1 among the present numerical experimental and analytical results the discrepancies among the three results are unapparent at the first 20 s but the numerical and experimental data gradually derivate from the analytical solution as time evolves besides phase shift grows as time evolves due to mode competitions although there exists some difference between the present numerical and experimental results after the first 28 s the phase is in good agreement overall the accuracy of the present model can be guaranteed furthermore the numerical and experimental free surface displacements always show relatively higher and sharper peaks and smaller and flatter troughs obvious asymmetric behaviors generally reflecting a typical non linear wave phenomenon the fft results of the numerical and experimental results are displayed in fig 6 b the response frequencies of both results are almost the same and there only exist some difference in peaks overall it can be concluded that the present model can well capture the main features of the nonlinear mode 2 faraday wave namely not only the free surface displacement but also the frequency content the dominant frequency is about ω 2 equal to half of the forcing frequency in accordance with mode 2 the secondary peak stands for ω 1 and other peaks are ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 and ω v 2 97 hz respectively contributing to the non linearity the wavelet analysis result in fig 6 c further identifies that the main energy is distributed between 0 87 hz and 1 75 hz especially around 1 49 hz meaning mode 2 is dominant but with less energy focused around 2 97 hz in agreement with the fft analysis besides when the free surface displacement gets larger which can reach 0 09 m with a comparable value to the filling depth 0 12 m resulting in growing wave steepness from 25 0 s to 33 0 s or 45 0 s to 50 0 s where wave non linearity comes to be important energy gradually rises around 2 97 hz however it transfers to other frequencies as the free surface displacement decreases and more energy focuses on ω 2 meaning higher modes become negligible weaker nonlinearity the free surface snapshots from the present numerical including pressure pa and experimental results at various moments are graphed in fig 7 the numerical sloshing waves are in good coincidence with the experimental results this further demonstrates the accuracy of the present model although the wave crest tends to be a sharp corner with moderate breaking at some moments the wave still behaves like an 2d planar wave 5 2 breaking mode 2 faraday wave besides the slightly breaking mode 2 faraday wave the violently breaking mode 2 faraday v3 in fig 2 is further discussed through numerical simulation compared to the former mode 2 faraday wave all parameters remain unchanged except a v is further increased to 0 015 m and the peak acceleration is extended from 0 089g to 0 534g the numerical free surface snapshots at various moments are graphed in fig 8 considering the wave steepness exceeds the extreme value 0 213 from jiang et al 1996 hence wave breaking is evitable compared to those in fig 7 the present wave is more energic and can reach the tank roof apparent sharp and plunging crests have been formed periodically around the middle of the tank resulting in fiercely splashing free surfaces and abundant freely falling small droplets moreover considering the filling level is low hydraulic jump phenomenon is noticeable although the excitation is only one dimensional the response wave has 3d features even so the dominant wavelength is yet twice of the tank length in accordance with non breaking mode 2 faraday wave in addition the time history of the free surface displacement at gauge1 is followed as shown in fig 9 a the maximal free surface displacement can reach 2 3 times of the filling depth reaching the tank roof 5 38 s 5 44 s in fig 8 the wave phase plane in fig 9 b displays an asymmetric characteristic higher peaks and lower troughs as time evolves due to the non linearity besides obvious chaotic behaviors exist persistently mainly on account of discontinuous wave increasement causing by the strongly breaking the dominant frequencies in fig 9 c remain similar to the former mode 2 case implying that the dominant wave is still mode 2 however some difference can be found that all peak frequencies are slightly lower than those of the former case which may be mainly attributed to the freely falling small droplets independent on the wave causing the reduction of the effective fluid volume resulting in the decrease of the natural frequency estimated from the dispersion relationship the wavelet analysis result in fig 9 d identifies that the energy transfers between 0 74 hz and 3 0 hz with apparent envelops as the free surface evolves and more energy can be found at higher frequencies when the free surface displacement is large especially in the breaking durations 5 0 s 6 0 s and 7 0 s 8 0 s revealing the importance of higher modes in violently breaking waves 5 3 steep mode 3 faraday wave bredmose et al 2003 considered steep faraday waves in confined tanks through boussinesq type model and experimental tests in the present simulation the case v21 of bredmose et al 2003 marked by v4 in fig 2 are adopted to analyze the extreme case the tank dimensions are length l 1 48 m width w 0 4 m and height h 0 75 m the filling depth h is equal to 0 302 m the first order and third order natural frequencies in the length direction are ω 1 3 4319 rad s and ω 3 7 7368 rad s respectively the vertical displacement z t a vcos ω v t is followed by the horizontal displacement x t a hcos ω h t with a time duration being 2 44 s the corresponding forcing parameters a h a v ω h and ω v are 0 01 m 0 01 m ω 1 and 2ω 3 respectively the computation domain 1 48m 0 4m 0 66m is discretized into 185 50 110 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y 0 008 m and δ z 0 006 m fig 10 gives comparisons of the free surface snapshots between the present numerical and the experimental of bredmose et al 2003 the response wave is mode 3 with the wavelength being about 2 3 time of the tank length and the wave peaks or troughs always slightly disperse away from the odd nodes of the tank due to non linearity frandsen 2004 it can be observed that the present numerical results agree well with the snapshots digitized from the experiment except some moments at the peaks but generally match well and the main features of the sloshing wave have been well captured for consistency the free surface displacement and corresponding wave phase plane at the left wall are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively due to the strong non linearity the symmetry of the free surface displacement is broken which is intuitively displayed in the wave phase plane although the dominant frequency is ω 3 fig 11 c other frequencies due to mode competitions among the dominant frequency ω 1 and ω 2 as well as 2 ω 3 and 3 ω 1 contribute to the non linearity the energy is not fixed at any frequencies but transfers among various frequencies and more energy can be found at higher frequencies for larger free surface displacements 14 0 s 17 0 s and 39 0 s 42 0 s 5 4 fully 3d mode 4 faraday wave in real circumstance faraday wave may be of obvious 3d features for a better understanding of 3d faraday waves the sloshing in a square tank is taken into consideration the tank dimensions are length l and width w being 0 6 m respectively a fixed water depth h 0 12 m is chosen the corresponding natural frequency satisfies the dispersion relationship lamb 1932 9 ω n m 2 n g π l 2 m g π w 2 tanh n π h l 2 m π h w 2 n m 0 1 2 5 4 1 symmetric mode 4 faraday wave considering mode 4 is expected thereby the forcing frequency 2ω 40 ω 40 ω 04 14 2401 rad s is adopted in order to guarantee a non breaking wave a relatively small forcing displacement amplitude a v 0 0027 m is adopted hence the resulting parameters meet v5 in fig 2 the initial disturbed free surface satisfies ζ x y 0 002 cos 4 π l x cos 4 π w y where x and y represent the distances away from the left boundaries at length and width directions respectively the vertical excitation is imposed on the tank at zero moment the numerical computation domain 0 6m 0 6m 0 2m is discretized into 150 150 50 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y δ z 0 004 m the free surface snapshots at 0 0 s 2 0 s 4 0 s 6 0 s 8 0 s 10 0 s 12 0 s 14 0 s and 16 0 s are shown in fig 12 the results reveal that the dominant wavelength is about half of the tank length in both x and y directions a fully 3d mode 4 faraday wave in both directions at some moments the wave turns to sharp crests and the symmetry is eventually broken down the free surface displacement at middle of the left wall is graphed in fig 13 a along with the analytical solution seen from the appendix and the related wave phase plane fft and wavelet analysis results are shown in fig 13 b c and d respectively as to the small free surface displacement rather good agreement has been guaranteed at the initial few seconds with the growth of the free surface displacement the numerical result deviates from the analytical solution besides from fig 13 b it follows that the wave crest grows faster than the trough an obvious non linear characteristic there exist only two obvious frequencies in fig 13 c half of the forcing frequency ω 40 and the forcing frequency ω v 2ω 40 the energy transfer shown in fig 12 d reveals that the main energy is distributed around 2 266 hz and less is focused around 4 533 hz close to the forcing frequency 5 4 2 anti symmetric multiple modal faraday wave besides the symmetric mode 4 faraday wave an anti symmetric multiple modal faraday wave is also considered in order to obtain a combined mode 4 and mode 5 faraday wave the multiple vertical displacement z a v cos 2 ω 40 t cos 2 ω 50 t is imposed on the tank where a v 0 0015 m ω 40 14 240 rad s and ω 50 15 996 rad s the initial free surface satisfies ζ x y 0 002 cos 4 π l x cos 5 π w y where x and y represent the distances away from the left boundaries at length and width directions respectively the numerical computation domain 0 6m 0 6m 0 2m is discretized into 150 150 50 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y δ z 0 004 m the free surface snapshots at 8 0 s 10 0 s 12 0 s 14 0 s 16 0 s 18 0 s 20 0 s 22 0 s and 24 0 s are shown in fig 14 there always exist two wavelengths and 2 5 wavelengths in the x and y directions respectively namely mode 4 and mode 5 the wave crests come to be sharp corners at some moments then the symmetry is destroyed 6 conclusion nonlinear faraday waves have been experimentally and numerically investigated in present study the numerical investigation is performed by applying a numerical model established on spatially averaged navier stokes equations self conducted experiments are performed to validate the numerical model as well as explain the frequency response and wave non linearity the nonlinear and breaking faraday waves are performed through experimental and numerical investigations beyond the capability of linear potential flow theory and the comparisons identify the present proposed numerical model is of good accuracy in modeling the non linear faraday waves the fast fourier transform and wavelet analysis techniques are adopted for further analysis the main energy is focused at half of the forcing frequency behaving as a resonant frequency locking phenomenon energy distributed at the lower frequencies gradually transfers to half of the forcing frequency and higher frequencies as the free surface displacement grows numerical and experimental results show that the n th modal faraday wave can be triggered when the forcing frequency is equal to two times of the n th order natural frequency the plunging and splashing as well as steep crest waves have been formed a 3d linear analytical solution of faraday wave is also derived through the linear wave theory which is validated against the numerically obtained 3d mode 4 f aradaywave and large discrepancies between analytical solution and numerical result are also developed when the free surface displacement is large resulting in nonnegligible non linearity the anti symmetric multiple modal a combined mode 4 and mode 5 faraday wave is triggered by the multiple forcing excitations considering the available damping mechanics is mainly focused on the 2d faraday wave future works are aiming at the suppression of 3d non linear or breaking faraday waves especially the anti symmetric multiple modal ones credit authorship contribution statement xin jin conceptualization methodology validation

21118,faraday wave means the standing wave produced in a vertically excited tank the wave characteristics and trigger conditions of various modes especially the high order modes are rarely reported in this paper an in house code newtank and a hexapod motion sloshing test platform were employed to study mode 1 to mode 5 faraday waves the two dimensional 2d nonlinear mode 1 and mode 2 faraday waves were obtained through both experiments and simulations besides the 2d strongly breaking mode 2 2d steep mode 3 and fully three dimensional 3d mode 4 faraday waves were investigated numerically the

under multiple frequency excitations keywords faraday wave parametric sloshing newtank nonlinear wave experiments wavelet analysis 1 introduction faraday wave widely exists in liquid containers under earthquake and wave excitations which can be easily triggered especially for the case that the vertical forcing frequency is equal to integer times of the system s natural frequencies the first available investigation was performed by faraday 1831 who exerted harmonic vertical oscillations to fluid and the standing wave was formed ultimately the phenomenon is also called parametric instability or parametric resonance yu et al 2020 in some extreme circumstances faraday wave may be violently breaking along with strong loads on the system which may cause devastating damage thereby this problem has attracted researchers to understand the mechanism of the nonlinear breaking phenomenon which is also of crucial importance to tank designers most of the early theoretical works followed mathieu 1868 who gave the law of vibration of elliptical membrane i e mathieu equation and concluded that the behavior of the mathieu equation was governed by the ratio of the forcing frequency to the system s natural frequency the frequency ratio and the peak acceleration benjamin and ursell 1954 found the governing equation of faraday wave could be formulated as the mathieu equation and the wave response can be explained through the analytical works of mclachlan 1947 abramowitz and segun 1968 and richards 1983 miles 1984 theoretically analyzed the parametric sloshing in partially filled cylindrical tanks henderson and miles 1990 gave a comprehensive review of the parametric sloshing zhang and vinals 1997 deduced the weakly nonlinear approximations of faraday wave the multi modal approach was applied by faltinsen and timokha 2001 to research the nonlinear sloshing and higher modes were proved to be of great importance frandsen 2004 obtained a third order solution of the parametric sloshing by the perturbation method meziani and ourrad 2014 discussed the influence of capillary effect on the vertically excited stable sloshing other works sorokin 1957 taylor and narendra 1969 richards 1976 horsley and forbes 2013 etc were aiming at viscous effects on the parametric instability through the artificial damping analytically due to the difficulty in handling the diffusion terms in navier stokes equations the instability for real viscous fluid was still left to be resolved even so several instability diagrams for the fundamental natural frequency have been obtained experimentally benjamin and ursell 1954 jiang et al 1997 kolukula et al 2015 etc recently ibrahim 2015 gave a comprehensive review of recent literatures about the parametric sloshing the mentioned theories were almost within the scope of inviscid linear weakly nonlinear or artificial viscous category therefore the fully nonlinear phenomena could not be well explained jiang et al 1997 experimentally investigated the mode 2 steep and breaking faraday waves and the extreme steepness 0 216 was obtained the flat topped mode 3 faraday waves were experimentally observed by bredmose et al 2003 frandsen and peng 2006 conducted experiments to investigate the parametric sloshing in square tanks and finally a breaking mushroom mode 2 wave was found other wave patterns for example parallel line edwards and fauve 1994 hexagon binks et al 1997 and square kityk et al 2005 were also obtained numerical modelling is mainly divided into two scenarios namely inviscid nonlinear model jiang et al 1996 frandsen 2004 ning et al 2012 buldakov 2014 and navier stokes model kim 2001 godderidge et al 2009 xue et al 2012 2019 dou et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 ubal et al 2003 discussed the influence of water depth on the parametric sloshing by applying the direct numerical simulation dns based on navier stokes equations o connor 2008 presented the square pattern faraday wave by adopting the arbitrary lagrange euler spectral element method the six degree freedom violent sloshing was numerically studied by liu and lin 2008 and xue and lin 2011 by employing their in house navier stokes models perinet et al 2009 applied the finite difference method and two step projection method to solve the navier stokes equations and the hexagonal pattern wave was found elahi et al 2015 developed a 2d navier stokes solver to simulate sloshing under various excitations luo et al 2016 adopted a 3d navier stokes numerical model based on consistent particle method cpm to study the violent sloshing under regular and irregular excitations although the three elementary modes have been reported in literatures and the 2d ones are primarily considered and high modes in rectangular tanks are relatively less reported thereby this study aims to investigate various modes of 2d and 3d nonlinear breaking faraday waves including mode 1 to mode 5 through experimental and numerical methods the plunging and splashing wave as well as the symmetric fully 3d faraday wave are formed the free surface displacements and snapshots are analyzed in connection with the nonlinearity and breaking phenomenon the fft technique is adopted to identify the frequency response what s more the transfer of transient nonlinear energy is analyzed through the wavelet analysis technique finally a fully 3d anti symmetric multiple modal faraday wave is guaranteed by the multiple frequency excitations 2 experimental setup the sloshing tests were performed in laboratory of vibration test and liquid sloshing at hohai university of china xue et al 2013 2017 yu et al 2019 2020 the schematic diagram of basic setups is graphed in fig 1 the dimensions of the 3d tank are length l 0 6 m and width w 0 3 m and the water depth h is fixed at 0 12 m hence the first order and second order natural frequencies at the length direction are ω 1 5 3483 rad s and ω 2 9 3453 rad s respectively the capacitive type wave gauge with sampling frequency of 1000 hz is used to record the time history of the sloshing wave which is produced by nanjing yunchuangyuan intelligent technology co ltd the tank was inclined at the beginning moment with an angle θ being 15 and rotated to horizontal position at the first 4 3 s then the vertical excitation started the camera was put at 1 0 m away from the tank and parallel to the still water depth in order to better visualize the free surface profiles we put 10 g of ink into the water which has been proved to have less influence on physical properties of water in the contrast tests with pure water sloshing 3 methodology for faraday waves the standing wave in a 2d vertically excited confined tank length and filling depth being l and h is called faraday wave if the liquid is assumed to be inviscid and irrotational the vertical displacement of the tank follows the harmonic function z t a vcos ω v t where a v and ω v represent the forcing displacement amplitude and forcing frequency respectively then the free surface displacement z ζ x z t can be formulated as eq 1 benjamin and ursell 1954 1 ζ n 0 sin k n x z n t where k n 2 n 1 π l z n t can be derived from eq 2 homogeneous mathieu equation by giving appropriate initial conditions 2 z n t p n 2 q n cos 2 t z n t 0 where p n 4 ω n 2 ω v 2 q n 2 ω n 2 ω v 2 a v ω v 2 g 2 a v ω n 2 g t 1 2 ω v t and ω n 2 g k n tanh k n h for n 1 2 3 the free surface displacement is governed by the frequency ratio ω n ω v and peak acceleration a v ω v 2 g mclachlan 1947 abramowitz and segun 1968 and the contour plot of each natural frequency frandsen 2004 is displayed in fig 2 in order to explore the first four modes of faraday waves namely mode 1 to mode 4 as well as the multiple modal faraday wave seven test cases considered herein are displayed in fig 2 marked by star among which v1 v5 are applied to trigger mode 1 to mode 4 and v6 and v7 are adopted to motivate the anti symmetric multiple mode 4 numerical methodology the fluids air and liquid are assumed to be viscous newtonian the fluid motions are governed by the continuity equation and the spatially averaged navier stokes equations sans of which the turbulence is solved by the smagorinsky subgrid scale sgs reynolds stress model with the top hat space filter liu and lin 2008 xue and lin 2011 in order to avoid complicated moving boundaries the non inertial frame is adopted finally the total governing equations can be summarized as follows 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i f i 1 ρ τ i j x j 1 ρ τ i j r x j where u i and p are the filtered velocity and pressure respectively ρ is the fluid density f i is the external body force τ i j and τ i j r are the molecular viscous and sgs reynolds stress tensors respectively which are defined as τ i j 2 ρ ν σ i j and τ i j r 2 ρ ν t σ i j where σ i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i ν and ν t represent the molecular kinematic viscosity and the molecular eddy viscosity l s 2 2 σ i j σ i j respectively l s is formulated as the product of the smagorinsky length scale c s chosen as 0 15 and the filter width δ x δ y δ z 3 where δ x δ y and δ z are the grid lengths in the three directions the external force f i in the non inertial reference frame includes the gravitational force the translational and rotational inertia forces and the vector form is defined as follows 5 f g d u d t d ω d t r r 2 ω d r r d t ω ω r r where g u and ω denote the gravitational the translational velocity and the rotational velocity vectors respectively r and r are the position vectors of the considered point and rotational motion origin to the origin of the computation domain respectively the first two vectors g and u represent the gravity and translational accelerations respectively and the rest three d ω d t r r 2 ω d r r d t and ω ω r r denote the angular acceleration coriolis force and centrifugal force respectively here three motions surge heave and pitch are shown in fig 3 all derivatives are discretized by the finite difference method of which the time derivatives and the nonlinear convection terms are discretized by upwind and the combination of upwind and central difference schemes respectively and other terms like the pressure gradients and diffusion terms are solved by the central difference method the time varying free surface is tracked by the second order volume of fluid vof method gueyffier et al 1999 liu 2007 the two projection method is applied to solve the spatially averaged navier stokes equations and the detailed treatments are divided into two steps as follows 6 step 1 u i n 1 u i n δ t u j n u i n x j 1 ρ n τ i j n x j 1 ρ n τ i j r n x j 7 step 2 u i n 1 u i n 1 δ t 1 ρ n p n 1 x i f i where u i n 1 is an intermediate velocity u i n 1 at

can be resolved all the detailed treatments can be found in liu and lin 2008 5 results and discussions the section includes the experimental and numerical studies of the 2d nonlinear mode 1 and mode 2 faraday waves besides the 2d strongly breaking mode 2 and steep mode 3 faraday wave are followed in reality the fully 3d faraday wave dominating at both horizontal directions is more common than the 2d one which will also be investigated herein as a demonstration the 3d multiple modal faraday wave is guaranteed through multiple frequency excitation the frequency response and energy transfer are also identified by applying the fft and wavelet analysis techniques 5 1 numerical validations and discussions the numerical model will be validated against the self conducted experiments including 2d mode 1 and mode 2 faraday waves and the frequency response and transferring of transient nonlinear energy among various frequencies are also followed 5 1 1 nonlinear mode 1 faraday wave the analytical analysis reveals that the mode 1 faraday wave can be triggered when the forcing frequency is equal to two times of the first order natural frequency in order to obtain mode 1 v1 in fig 2 is adopted with the corresponding parameters being ω v 0 005 m and ω v 2ω 1 10 697 rad s the computation domain 0 6m 0 3m 0 21m is discretized into 120 60 42 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y δ z 0 005 m the timestep is automatically adjusted to ensure the numerical stability the comparisons of time histories of free surface displacements at gauge1 among the present numerical experimental and analytical results are shown in fig 4 a all data agree well at the first 20 s the numerical result always keeps in accordance with the experimental data as expected both results start to overestimate the analytical solution at the peak but underestimate that at the trough displaying an obvious asymmetry growing phase shifts can also be found showing the importance of non linearity while the analytical solution ignoring the nonlinear convective terms remains systematical and continues to grow exponentially hence it can be concluded that the proposed model is of good accuracy in modeling the nonlinear mode 1 faraday wave the frequency responses are demonstrated in fig 4 b both numerical and experimental results are nearly the same with the dominant and secondary response frequencies being about ω 1 and 2 ω 1 half the forcing frequency and the forcing frequency respectively and other frequencies close to integral times of ω 1 contribute to the asymmetry higher peaks and lower troughs namely wave non linearity the wavelet analysis result of the numerical data fig 4 c identifies that the main energy is distributed between 0 87 hz and 1 75 hz especially around 0 87 hz in agreement with the fft result which also means the dominant wave is mode 1 when the wave steepness increases ranging from 20 0 s to 50 0 s the non linearity is reinforced thus energy gradually rises around 1 75 hz and 3 44 hz close to integral times of the first order natural frequency in other cases it transfers to other frequencies as the free surface displacement decreases mainly due to the weakness of non linearity the comparisons of the free surface snapshots between the present numerical including pressure pa and experimental results at various moments are graphed in fig 5 as can be found the discrepancies are unapparent and rather good agreement has been guaranteed it is obvious the dominant wavelength is about two times of the tank length however due to the non linearity causing by modes competitions the wavelength is not strictly two times of the tank length considering the wave steepness is moderate wave breaking does not emerge and a 2d planar wave is guaranteed 5 1 2 nonlinear mode 2 faraday wave the mode 2 faraday wave has also been experimentally and numerically investigated other than the displacement amplitude and forcing frequency shifted into ω v 0 0025 m and ω v 2ω 2 18 691 rad s respectively resulting in a peak acceleration being 0 089 g v2 in fig 2 and the rest setups remained unchanged convergent tests have been performed for different mesh sizes 0 003 m 0 005 m and 0 0075 m and the results reveal that average mesh size 0 005 m is enough to resolve the sloshing hence the computation domain 0 6m 0 3m 0 4m is discretized into 120 60 80 uniform grids fig 6 a gives the comparisons of time histories of the free surface displacements at gauge1 among the present numerical experimental and analytical results the discrepancies among the three results are unapparent at the first 20 s but the numerical and experimental data gradually derivate from the analytical solution as time evolves besides phase shift grows as time evolves due to mode competitions although there exists some difference between the present numerical and experimental results after the first 28 s the phase is in good agreement overall the accuracy of the present model can be guaranteed furthermore the numerical and experimental free surface displacements always show relatively higher and sharper peaks and smaller and flatter troughs obvious asymmetric behaviors generally reflecting a typical non linear wave phenomenon the fft results of the numerical and experimental results are displayed in fig 6 b the response frequencies of both results are almost the same and there only exist some difference in peaks overall it can be concluded that the present model can well capture the main features of the nonlinear mode 2 faraday wave namely not only the free surface displacement but also the frequency content the dominant frequency is about ω 2 equal to half of the forcing frequency in accordance with mode 2 the secondary peak stands for ω 1 and other peaks are ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 and ω v 2 97 hz respectively contributing to the non linearity the wavelet analysis result in fig 6 c further identifies that the main energy is distributed between 0 87 hz and 1 75 hz especially around 1 49 hz meaning mode 2 is dominant but with less energy focused around 2 97 hz in agreement with the fft analysis besides when the free surface displacement gets larger which can reach 0 09 m with a comparable value to the filling depth 0 12 m resulting in growing wave steepness from 25 0 s to 33 0 s or 45 0 s to 50 0 s where wave non linearity comes to be important energy gradually rises around 2 97 hz however it transfers to other frequencies as the free surface displacement decreases and more energy focuses on ω 2 meaning higher modes become negligible weaker nonlinearity the free surface snapshots from the present numerical including pressure pa and experimental results at various moments are graphed in fig 7 the numerical sloshing waves are in good coincidence with the experimental results this further demonstrates the accuracy of the present model although the wave crest tends to be a sharp corner with moderate breaking at some moments the wave still behaves like an 2d planar wave 5 2 breaking mode 2 faraday wave besides the slightly breaking mode 2 faraday wave the violently breaking mode 2 faraday v3 in fig 2 is further discussed through numerical simulation compared to the former mode 2 faraday wave all parameters remain unchanged except a v is further increased to 0 015 m and the peak acceleration is extended from 0 089g to 0 534g the numerical free surface snapshots at various moments are graphed in fig 8 considering the wave steepness exceeds the extreme value 0 213 from jiang et al 1996 hence wave breaking is evitable compared to those in fig 7 the present wave is more energic and can reach the tank roof apparent sharp and plunging crests have been formed periodically around the middle of the tank resulting in fiercely splashing free surfaces and abundant freely falling small droplets moreover considering the filling level is low hydraulic jump phenomenon is noticeable although the excitation is only one dimensional the response wave has 3d features even so the dominant wavelength is yet twice of the tank length in accordance with non breaking mode 2 faraday wave in addition the time history of the free surface displacement at gauge1 is followed as shown in fig 9 a the maximal free surface displacement can reach 2 3 times of the filling depth reaching the tank roof 5 38 s 5 44 s in fig 8 the wave phase plane in fig 9 b displays an asymmetric characteristic higher peaks and lower troughs as time evolves due to the non linearity besides obvious chaotic behaviors exist persistently mainly on account of discontinuous wave increasement causing by the strongly breaking the dominant frequencies in fig 9 c remain similar to the former mode 2 case implying that the dominant wave is still mode 2 however some difference can be found that all peak frequencies are slightly lower than those of the former case which may be mainly attributed to the freely falling small droplets independent on the wave causing the reduction of the effective fluid volume resulting in the decrease of the natural frequency estimated from the dispersion relationship the wavelet analysis result in fig 9 d identifies that the energy transfers between 0 74 hz and 3 0 hz with apparent envelops as the free surface evolves and more energy can be found at higher frequencies when the free surface displacement is large especially in the breaking durations 5 0 s 6 0 s and 7 0 s 8 0 s revealing the importance of higher modes in violently breaking waves 5 3 steep mode 3 faraday wave bredmose et al 2003 considered steep faraday waves in confined tanks through boussinesq type model and experimental tests in the present simulation the case v21 of bredmose et al 2003 marked by v4 in fig 2 are adopted to analyze the extreme case the tank dimensions are length l 1 48 m width w 0 4 m and height h 0 75 m the filling depth h is equal to 0 302 m the first order and third order natural frequencies in the length direction are ω 1 3 4319 rad s and ω 3 7 7368 rad s respectively the vertical displacement z t a vcos ω v t is followed by the horizontal displacement x t a hcos ω h t with a time duration being 2 44 s the corresponding forcing parameters a h a v ω h and ω v are 0 01 m 0 01 m ω 1 and 2ω 3 respectively the computation domain 1 48m 0 4m 0 66m is discretized into 185 50 110 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y 0 008 m and δ z 0 006 m fig 10 gives comparisons of the free surface snapshots between the present numerical and the experimental of bredmose et al 2003 the response wave is mode 3 with the wavelength being about 2 3 time of the tank length and the wave peaks or troughs always slightly disperse away from the odd nodes of the tank due to non linearity frandsen 2004 it can be observed that the present numerical results agree well with the snapshots digitized from the experiment except some moments at the peaks but generally match well and the main features of the sloshing wave have been well captured for consistency the free surface displacement and corresponding wave phase plane at the left wall are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively due to the strong non linearity the symmetry of the free surface displacement is broken which is intuitively displayed in the wave phase plane although the dominant frequency is ω 3 fig 11 c other frequencies due to mode competitions among the dominant frequency ω 1 and ω 2 as well as 2 ω 3 and 3 ω 1 contribute to the non linearity the energy is not fixed at any frequencies but transfers among various frequencies and more energy can be found at higher frequencies for larger free surface displacements 14 0 s 17 0 s and 39 0 s 42 0 s 5 4 fully 3d mode 4 faraday wave in real circumstance faraday wave may be of obvious 3d features for a better understanding of 3d faraday waves the sloshing in a square tank is taken into consideration the tank dimensions are length l and width w being 0 6 m respectively a fixed water depth h 0 12 m is chosen the corresponding natural frequency satisfies the dispersion relationship lamb 1932 9 ω n m 2 n g π l 2 m g π w 2 tanh n π h l 2 m π h w 2 n m 0 1 2 5 4 1 symmetric mode 4 faraday wave considering mode 4 is expected thereby the forcing frequency 2ω 40 ω 40 ω 04 14 2401 rad s is adopted in order to guarantee a non breaking wave a relatively small forcing displacement amplitude a v 0 0027 m is adopted hence the resulting parameters meet v5 in fig 2 the initial disturbed free surface satisfies ζ x y 0 002 cos 4 π l x cos 4 π w y where x and y represent the distances away from the left boundaries at length and width directions respectively the vertical excitation is imposed on the tank at zero moment the numerical computation domain 0 6m 0 6m 0 2m is discretized into 150 150 50 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y δ z 0 004 m the free surface snapshots at 0 0 s 2 0 s 4 0 s 6 0 s 8 0 s 10 0 s 12 0 s 14 0 s and 16 0 s are shown in fig 12 the results reveal that the dominant wavelength is about half of the tank length in both x and y directions a fully 3d mode 4 faraday wave in both directions at some moments the wave turns to sharp crests and the symmetry is eventually broken down the free surface displacement at middle of the left wall is graphed in fig 13 a along with the analytical solution seen from the appendix and the related wave phase plane fft and wavelet analysis results are shown in fig 13 b c and d respectively as to the small free surface displacement rather good agreement has been guaranteed at the initial few seconds with the growth of the free surface displacement the numerical result deviates from the analytical solution besides from fig 13 b it follows that the wave crest grows faster than the trough an obvious non linear characteristic there exist only two obvious frequencies in fig 13 c half of the forcing frequency ω 40 and the forcing frequency ω v 2ω 40 the energy transfer shown in fig 12 d reveals that the main energy is distributed around 2 266 hz and less is focused around 4 533 hz close to the forcing frequency 5 4 2 anti symmetric multiple modal faraday wave besides the symmetric mode 4 faraday wave an anti symmetric multiple modal faraday wave is also considered in order to obtain a combined mode 4 and mode 5 faraday wave the multiple vertical displacement z a v cos 2 ω 40 t cos 2 ω 50 t is imposed on the tank where a v 0 0015 m ω 40 14 240 rad s and ω 50 15 996 rad s the initial free surface satisfies ζ x y 0 002 cos 4 π l x cos 5 π w y where x and y represent the distances away from the left boundaries at length and width directions respectively the numerical computation domain 0 6m 0 6m 0 2m is discretized into 150 150 50 uniform grids with grid sizes δ x δ y δ z 0 004 m the free surface snapshots at 8 0 s 10 0 s 12 0 s 14 0 s 16 0 s 18 0 s 20 0 s 22 0 s and 24 0 s are shown in fig 14 there always exist two wavelengths and 2 5 wavelengths in the x and y directions respectively namely mode 4 and mode 5 the wave crests come to be sharp corners at some moments then the symmetry is destroyed 6 conclusion nonlinear faraday waves have been experimentally and numerically investigated in present study the numerical investigation is performed by applying a numerical model established on spatially averaged navier stokes equations self conducted experiments are performed to validate the numerical model as well as explain the frequency response and wave non linearity the nonlinear and breaking faraday waves are performed through experimental and numerical investigations beyond the capability of linear potential flow theory and the comparisons identify the present proposed numerical model is of good accuracy in modeling the non linear faraday waves the fast fourier transform and wavelet analysis techniques are adopted for further analysis the main energy is focused at half of the forcing frequency behaving as a resonant frequency locking phenomenon energy distributed at the lower frequencies gradually transfers to half of the forcing frequency and higher frequencies as the free surface displacement grows numerical and experimental results show that the n th modal faraday wave can be triggered when the forcing frequency is equal to two times of the n th order natural frequency the plunging and splashing as well as steep crest waves have been formed a 3d linear analytical solution of faraday wave is also derived through the linear wave theory which is validated against the numerically obtained 3d mode 4 f aradaywave and large discrepancies between analytical solution and numerical result are also developed when the free surface displacement is large resulting in nonnegligible non linearity the anti symmetric multiple modal a combined mode 4 and mode 5 faraday wave is triggered by the multiple forcing excitations considering the available damping mechanics is mainly focused on the 2d faraday wave future works are aiming at the suppression of 3d non linear or breaking faraday waves especially the anti symmetric multiple modal ones credit authorship contribution statement xin jin conceptualization methodology validation

21119,for the new sandglass type floating body with special shape this paper mainly analyzes the characteristic of the heave damping and its corresponding components by computational fluid dynamics cfd method firstly the convergence and accuracy of the cfd method to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type floating body were validated along with the experimental data secondly the numerical model of the floating body with forced heave motion was created and then hydrodynamic forces versus different motion amplitudes were calculated and compared to discuss its nonlinear characteristics afterwards based on time history curves of the hydrodynamic force heaving added mass and damping of the floating body versus various frequencies were achieved and found to be different from the potential results in order to analyze the reasons that cause difference numerical simulations using inviscid and k ε turbulent models were performed respectively and the results indicate that the effect of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic coefficients is small and not decisive then equivalent radiation damping based on cfd wave elevation was deduced to explore the relation between the inviscid cfd and potential models finally local wave field and vorticity field near the body were mainly discussed and quantitative analysis based on mechanical energy was performed to verify that the vortex due to the body shape is the essential cause of the heave damping for the sandglass type floating body keywords sandglass type fpso damping component cfd method forced heave motion hydrodynamic force equivalent radiation damping vortex 1 introduction with marine oil and gas gradually developing towards deep water floating production storage and offloading units fpso play a more and more important role in the exploration of ocean resources because of its functional advantages such as large oil storage capacity multifunction etc therein traditional ship type and cylindrical fpsos have some performance limitations wang and feng 2011 wu 2012 for better application in ocean engineering a new concept of floating body with an innovative sandglass type shape was presented by huang et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 whose excellent motion performance has been validated by both numerical and experimental studies wang et al 2017 du et al 2017 therefore the new sandglass type fpso has wide and good application prospects the response amplitude of heave motion can obviously affect the seakeeping performance and function of ocean platform such as green water phenomenon the application of riser system and so on which can be effectively reduced based on the wave free characteristic of sandglass type floating body wang et al 2018 and can be further minimized based on the initial discussion about heave damping du et al 2018 thus the heave damping plays an important role in improving the heave motion performance of the sandglass type fpso and should be further analyzed as so far the damping of floating ocean structures have been studied by various methods that are theoretical analysis model experiment and cfd numerical simulation respectively therein the cfd numerical simulation is the most widely used method because it can be effective and low cost to analyze the flow field and viscous damping based on the solution of navier stokes equations wilson et al 2006 created an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes code to achieve the motion responses of ship by considering the viscous damping zhou et al 2015 mainly studied the roll damping of a ship by means of the 3d cfd method philip et al 2019 investigated the effects of heave damping on the spar due to the circular plates based on the cfd method ji and li 2019a 2019b discussed the viscous damping performance of the anti motion structures on a cylindrical fpso by using the cfd method in addition the other studies about the simulation on the damping and anti motion structures were performed by avalos et al 2014 jiang and yeung 2014 irkal et al 2016 yildiz et al 2016 lavrov et al 2017 yildiz and katayama 2017 gadelho et al 2018 gokce and kinaci 2018 the above studies showed that the cfd numerical simulation should be a good method to study the damping characteristics of ships and ocean structures for the new sandglass type fpso its floating body has a special shape with the small waterline the inclined outward side and the sharp bottom angle which can observably influence its damping characteristic and motion responses in waves therefore it is very necessary to analyze the characteristic and various components of heave damping of the sandglass type floating body by using the cfd method along with model experiment in this paper firstly the convergence and accuracy of the cfd method to simulate the heave motion of the floating body were studied along with the experimental data secondly the numerical model of the floating body with forced heave motion was set up and then hydrodynamic forces versus different amplitudes were compared to discuss its nonlinear characteristic after that based on time history curves of the hydrodynamic force heaving added mass and damping of the body versus various frequencies were achieved and compared with the potential results furthermore the influence of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic coefficients was analyzed based on the inviscid and k ε turbulent model then equivalent radiation damping based on cfd wave elevation were deduced to analyze the differences and similarities between the inviscid solutions and potential results finally local wave field and vorticity field near the body were mainly discussed and quantitative analysis based on mechanical energy was performed to confirm the essential reason of the heave damping for the sandglass type floating body 2 validation of numerical method to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type model 2 1 description of sandglass type model and numerical method the details of the sandglass type floating body have been demonstrated by huang et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 here only the shape parameters of the sandglass type model in this study are introduced as shown in fig 1 and table 1 which are derived from the experimental tests of 1 70 scaled model by wang et al 2017 in the present research the heave motion of the sandglass type floating body was numerically simulated by using the cfd method based on the star ccm platform therein the continuity and navier stokes equations of the incompressible fluid in vector form are written as follows 1 v 0 2 ρ v t v v p μ 2 v ρ g where v is the velocity vector ρ is the density p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity g is the gravity acceleration and 2 denotes the laplace operator on this basis vof method hirt and nichols 1981 was taken to track the transient free surface based on the volume fraction equation 3 c q t c q v 0 q 1 2 where c 1 and c 2 represent the volume fraction of water and air respectively furthermore the k ε turbulent model was applied to deal with the fluid viscosity irkal et al 2016 gokce and kinaci 2018 as equations 4 and 5 the dynamic fluid body interaction model and the overset mesh system were used to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type floating body with large motion amplitude 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε 5 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k where k stands for the turbulence kinetic energy ε is the dissipation rate σ k and σ ε are prandtl number corresponding to k and ε respectively c 1 ε and c 1 ε are experience coefficient g k is the production term of turbulent kinetic energy k caused by the average velocity gradient according to the shape characteristics of the sandglass type floating body and considering the computational efficiency 1 4 of a cylindrical computational domain was applied to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type model as shown in fig 2 a furthermore based on the model experiments the bottom and outer boundaries of the computational domain were defined as no slip wall condition the top boundary was defined as pressure outlet condition the radial planes were defined as symmetry condition and a wave damping zone near outer boundary were defined to avoid wave reflection from the side wall the entire computation domain was discretized with structured hexahedral mesh and prism layer based on cartesian cut cell method as shown in fig 2 b and d then several classic regions near free surface and bottom edge of the model were created to refine the meshes so that the flow features of radiation wave and vortex can be simulated better as shown in fig 2 c and e 2 2 convergence analysis on numerical mesh and time step here the convergence of the numerical mesh and time step is discussed for numerical mesh four test cases with different mesh sizes were simulated which are coarse 0 70 million medium 1 01 million medium fine 1 46 million and fine 2 07 million respectively furthermore three different time steps were tested which are large 0 01s medium 0 005s and small 0 0025s respectively on this basis time history curves of heave motion versus different meshes with time step equals 0 0025s and different time steps with medium fine scheme 1 46 million can be achieved and shown in fig 3 and table 2 from the figure and table it can be found that with the mesh being finer or the time step being smaller to a certain degree the numerical results with different meshing schemes can agree well with each other and become not sensitive to the mesh and time step which can validate the convergence of the present numerical method in this paper furthermore based on calculation precision and efficiency the mesh scheme of 1 46 million as listed in table 3 and 0 005 s time step can be applied in the sequent analysis therein the definition of various regions should be referred to fig 2 2 3 validation of numerical method to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type floating body based on the model experiment wang 2017 the free decay heave motion of the sandglass type floating body with an initial heave displacement of 55 mm was numerically simulated by the cfd method then the numerical solutions and experimental results are compared and shown in fig 4 and table 4 therein the expt means experimental data and rel diff means the relative difference between numerical and experimental results as shown in fig 4 and table 4 the time history curve of numerical heave motion is very close to that of the experimental data and the relative differences of two methods are all less than 5 thus the numerical method of this paper has been successfully validated which means that it can be used to numerically simulate the heave motion of the sandglass type floating body 3 analysis on the characteristic of heave damping for the sandglass type floating body in this section the validated cfd method is taken to study the characteristics of the heave damping and its corresponding components for the sandglass type floating body among them the shape parameters of the sandglass type floating body are consistent with the experimental model which is listed in table 1 3 1 hydrodynamic forces of the sandglass type floating body with forced heave motion 3 1 1 numerical model of the sandglass type floating body with forced heave motion here the computational domain and boundary conditions were selected to be the same as section 2 1 therein the frequencies of the forced heave motion correspond to different radiation wave lengths were 1 8 rad s with an interval 1 rad s therefore the radius of the computational domain should be adjusted with different motion frequencies then the more coarse grids were used in the area that was away from the floating body and a wave damping zone was arranged which is close to the outer boundary in order to accurately describe the wave generation and propagation as well as the interaction between radiation waves and the floating body finer meshes were used near the free surface fig 5 shows a vertical cross sectional view of the numerical mesh the forced heave motion of the sandglass type floating body is a single dof periodic motion with fixed frequency and amplitude as shown in fig 6 the forced heave motion of the sandglass type fpso can be described as 6 ξ 3 ξ 30 sin ω t ξ 3 ξ 30 ω cos ω t ξ 3 ξ 30 ω 2 sin ω t where ω is motion frequency ξ 30 is amplitude ξ 3 ξ 3 ξ 3 are displacement velocity and acceleration respectively 3 1 2 comparison of hydrodynamic forces versus different amplitudes of forced heave motion in this section the cfd method was used to numerically simulate the forced heave motion with different motion amplitudes in order to study its effect on the hydrodynamic force of the sandglass type floating body the classic motion amplitudes were selected as 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m and 0 08 m respectively fig 7 shows the different cfd solutions of hydrodynamic forces along with the potential results versus various amplitudes under motion frequency of 5 rad s among them the potential theory means the results that were obtained by the boundary element method wang et al 2016 and the cfd refers to the solutions by the cfd method of this paper it can be found that the hydrodynamic force caused by body motion will change with amplitude firstly the greater the motion amplitude the larger the hydrodynamic force secondly the greater the motion amplitude the larger the deviation between cfd and potential results the stronger the nonlinear effect especially the hydrodynamic force for the case of amplitude of 0 08 m it has obvious deformation and irregularity which shows that the cfd method can simulate the strong nonlinear characteristics caused by the sandglass type shape and large motion amplitude very well furthermore for the cases with motion amplitudes of 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m and 0 04 m the amplitudes and periods for various curves of hydrodynamic force were achieved by the cfd method as shown in fig 7 and then the hydrodynamic rao can be obtained and shown in fig 8 along with the periods in the figure with the motion amplitude reducing to 0 01 m the hydrodynamic rao and period gradually tend to be stable the influence of nonlinearity gradually weakens for a better discussion about the characteristic of heave damping of the sandglass type floating body motion amplitude 0 01 m should be taken in the next researches of this paper 3 2 heaving added mass and damping of sandglass type model versus various motion frequencies based on the cfd method the sandglass type models with different motion frequencies 1 8 rad s of forced heave motion were numerically simulated among them the hydrodynamic forces of the sandglass type model versus different motion frequencies 2 0 rad s 4 0 rad s 6 0 rad s and 8 0 rad s are shown in fig 9 from the figure it can be found that all the curves of hydrodynamic force versus frequencies show the regular periodic change furthermore the increase in motion frequency should cause a larger amplitude of force by the phase decomposition method zhu et al 2009 jaouen et al 2011 gustavo et al 2018 the heaving added mass and damping based on the cfd can be calculated and compared with potential radiation damping as shown in fig 10 from the figure it can be seen that the heaving added mass between cfd and potential methods are almost the same but the damping based on the cfd solutions has a large difference from the potential radiation damping which should be further discussed in the next sections of this paper 3 3 discussion on the characteristic of various damping components of the sandglass type model in this section in order to study the essential reason for the difference between the viscous results and potential radiation damping in fig 10 b the inviscid cfd numerical model was established firstly the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by the inviscid and turbulent models were comparatively analyzed secondly based on the wave elevation calculated by the cfd method with inviscid model the equivalent radiation damping can be obtained and compared with the potential radiation damping finally the local wave field and vorticity field near the body were mainly discussed and quantitative analysis based on mechanical energy was performed to prove that the vortex due to the body shape is the essential cause of the heave damping for the sandglass type floating body 3 3 1 effect of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic coefficients in order to discuss the influence of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic force and the damping the cfd numerical simulations based on the inviscid model were performed for the sandglass type floating body with the forced heave motion then the hydrodynamic forces of the sandglass type floating body in viscous and inviscid fluid with different motion frequencies were shown in fig 11 based on the phase decomposed method the damping of the sandglass type floating body obtained by the cfd method with the inviscid and turbulent models can be seen in fig 12 from figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that the difference of hydrodynamic forces between the inviscid and viscous model is very small at each motion frequency in general the viscous damping is slightly larger than the damping without considering the viscosity because the frictional force exists on the body surface when considering the viscosity however the difference between the two is small which indicates that the damping component caused by the friction is relatively small therefore the viscosity has little effect on the hydrodynamic force and the damping of the sandglass type floating body while the cfd solutions of hydrodynamic parameters obtained by the inviscid model still differ greatly from the potential result 3 3 2 heaving damping based on inviscid cfd model and potential flow theory in this section according to the inviscid cfd solutions of wave elevations caused by the sandglass type model the equivalent radiation damping can be deduced and compared with the potential radiation damping firstly in order to deduce the equivalent radiation damping 3d cylindrical water domain and its 2d y o z section are created and shown in fig 13 referring to faltinsen 1990 then based on the general formula proposed by newman 1977 and the further analysis by faltinsen 1990 the total energy e kinetic and potential energy and the integral of its derivative versus time in one period can be written as 7 e t ρ ω 0 5 v 2 g z d τ 8 0 t d e d t d t 0 t d t s b p p 0 u n d s ρ 0 t d t s φ t φ n d s 0 where ω denotes the fluid domain s b is wet surface of sandglass type model s is infinity boundary s 0 is bottom boundary with infinite water depth ρ is water density g is acceleration of gravity v is velocity magnitude of water p is water pressure p 0 is the atmospheric pressure u n is the normal velocity on s b ф is velocity potential φ n is its derivative along the normal unit vector n to s positive direction is into the fluid domain therein the velocity potential and the second term in equation 6 can be rewritten as 9 φ g a 3 ω e k z cos ω t k y α 10 ρ 0 t d t s φ t φ n d s ρ 0 t d t 0 π r d θ 0 2 φ t φ n d z π r ρ g a 3 2 g 2 ω t where r is the distance between o z axis and s d θ is the differential form of rotation angle as shown in fig 13 a 3 is wave amplitude k is wave number and α is random phase angle furthermore the first term in equation 6 has been deduced by faltinsen 1990 and described as 11 0 t d t s b p p 0 u n d s ω 2 t 2 b 33 η 3 2 where η 3 represents the motion amplitude of sandglass type model b 33 is the radiation damping of potential flow theory by combining equations 6 8 and 9 the radiation damping of the three dimensional sandglass type floating body can be obtained as 12 b 33 ρ a 3 η 3 2 g 2 ω 3 π r in the cfd numerical simulation of the forced heave motion of sandglass type model with different motion frequencies time history curves of wave elevation of monitoring points with different distances from the body were achieved here the case with motion frequency 3 rad s is taken as an example and the time history curves of wave elevation of those monitoring points are shown in fig 14 from the figure it can be found that at the location near the sandglass type model 1 0 m the curve of wave elevation has noticeable deformation and nonlinear characteristics as shown in fig 14 a which corresponds to the local wavelets due to the sandglass type shape it should fade away with the propagation distance increasing as seen in fig 14 b and c based on the wave elevations at different locations obtained by the cfd method and equation 10 the wave amplitude a 33 and equivalent radiation damping with motion frequency 3 rad s can be calculated and shown in fig 15 in this figure with the distance from the body increasing the equivalent radiation damping based on cfd solutions gradually tends to a steady value of 66 23 n m on this basis equivalent radiation damping versus different heave motion frequencies can be achieved and plotted as fig 16 therein the damping by the cfd hydrodynamic force is obtained based on the phase decomposition method from the figure it can be found that the results of radiation damping based on wave potential theory and the equivalent radiation damping by cfd wave amplitude agree well with each other furthermore there are certain differences between wave potential solutions and the damping from the cfd hydrodynamic force by inviscid model which should be further analyzed from the local wave field and vorticity field near the floating body in the next chapter 3 3 3 analysis on local wave field and vorticity field near the sandglass type floating body in order to clarify the difference of heave damping between wave potential theory and phase decomposition of cfd hydrodynamic force by inviscid model here the fluid characteristic of local wave field and vorticity field near the sandglass type floating body calculated by the cfd numerical method are studied minutely 1 local wave surface of sandglass type model by the cfd method of inviscid model the wave surfaces near the floating body are numerically simulated at various typical moments during 4 0 t 5 0 t t is the motion period of sandglass type model and the wave field should become steady after fourth period of time as shown in fig 17 18 in fig 17 it can be seen that there is a phase difference of vertical motion between the sandglass type model and the wave surface near the wall when the floating body moves upwards its design of large area bottom can contra directionally raise the free surface near the body on the other hand when the body moves downwards the free surface should climb along the sloping freeboard and then cause wave rolling phenomenon fig 18 shows the wave contour by the heave motion of the floating body in the fluid domain as can be seen from fig 18 a due to the sandglass type shape five local wavelets can be generated near the body in one motion period and propagate forward together with the main radiation wave then with radiation wave spreading far away these wavelets should decay and disappear as shown in fig 18 b which can be also behaved as the generation and disappearance of the obvious deformations on the time history curves of wave elevation as shown in fig 14 a and c based on the above analysis the special shape of sandglass type model will make local wave surfaces significantly nonlinear in the heave radiation problem though the fluid viscosity is not considered by the inviscid cfd model the bottom angle of the sandglass type floating body can produce a vortex during its forced heave motion fig 19 shows the vorticity field at the bottom angle of the body with motion frequency 4 rad s at various typical moments according to the figure when the fpso moves from the highest position to the equilibrium position 4 25 4 5 t fig 19 c e a vortex should be generated and shed at the bottom angle which is named no 1 vortex the sandglass type body continues to move down to the lowest position 4 5 4 75 t fig 19 e g the vortex stays above the bottom angle then the motion direction of fpso changes from the lowest position to the equilibrium position 4 75 5 0 t fig 19 g h and a a new vortex named no 2 can be generated under the bottom angle and move downwards with the previous no 1 vortex finally while the body moves up from the equilibrium position to the highest position 5 0 5 25 t fig 19 a b and c the no 2 vortex continues with decreasing intensity and no new vortices will be created on the upper side of the bottom angle until reaching the highest position and the two vortices mentioned above should keep away from the body in summary when the sandglass type fpso changes its direction of motion a vortex should be generated at the bottom angle and the no 1 vortex has the greatest intensity at the equilibrium position while the no 2 vortex has the greatest intensity before the equilibrium position and decreases quickly on this basis the vorticity fields versus different motion frequencies are simulated and compared in fig 20 among them the moment is corresponding to the equilibrium position from top to bottom this figure indicates that the characteristics of the vortex are different with different motion frequencies in general the vortex intensity enhances as motion frequency increases furthermore another difference is the existence or nonexistence of the no 2 vortex on the other hand the no 1 vortex will move upward in the low frequency range stay at the sandglass type model s bottom angle in the middle frequency range and move downwards beyond the no 2 vortex in the high frequency range i e the developing direction of the no 1 vortex should change with frequency based on the above analysis the sandglass type model will generate a vortex when changing the direction of heave motion even based on the inviscid cfd model which is induced by the non viscous fluid separation due to the existence of the bottom corner however the radiation damping calculated by the potential flow theory cannot consider the fluid vortex generated by the non viscous fluid separation which should result in the differences between the wave potential solutions and the damping by cfd hydrodynamic force for the sandglass type model 3 3 4 quantitative analysis on the influence of vorticity in inviscid fluid based on mechanical energy here by means of the cfd simulation of the inviscid model on the heave motion of sandglass type model the mechanical energies of fluid particles in the computational domain are calculated to further quantitatively analyze the effect of the vorticity of non viscous fluid separation based on the velocity decomposition theorem of helmholtz the velocity vector of a fluid micro element can be written as 13 v m v m 0 1 2 rot v δ r s δ r where v m 0 is the translation velocity of reference point m 0 1 2 rot v δ r 2 represents the fluid velocity of point m due to the rotation around m 0 s δ r is fluid velocity of m due to fluid deformation this means that the velocity of m is the superimposition of translation rotation and deformation velocities for the fluid domain the differential form of total energy of fluid particle can be expressed as 14 t 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g z 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g z v p v where ρv 2 2 represents the fluid kinetic energy ρ g z indicates the fluid potential energy by integrating the whole fluid domain mechanical energy can be obtained as 15 v t t 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g y d v v t 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g y v d v v t p v d v where the left term of this equation is total energy of fluid particle in the whole computational domain the right terms of the equation are fluid energy transported through the top boundary almost negligible and work done on the solid wall of the sandglass type model respectively during the period that the sandglass type fpso are forced heaving the floating body and the fluid domain can be handled as a system the work done on the sandglass type floating body with forced heave motion can affect the fluid field and it should be transferred to the mechanical energy of the fluid domain furthermore the mechanical energy of fluid domain with or without considering the vortex are compared with the work done on the body calculated by the potential and cfd forces respectively for the case of motion frequency 4 rad s as shown in fig 21 therein the curves of energy without vortex and energy with vortex considered different forms of velocity equation 11 from the figure it can be found that these two kinds of curves between the work done on the sandglass type model by hydrodynamic force and the mechanical energy of fluid domain agree well with each other it means that the system of sandglass type body and fluid field can satisfy the law of conservation of energy based on the numerical solutions in fig 21 the difference of work done by hydrodynamic force between fig 21 a and fig 21 b is calculated and shown in fig 22 it reflects the discrepancy between the potential force and the cfd force on the body moreover the mechanical energy of fluid field in the figure means the difference of fluid energy with and without vortex due to the non viscous fluid separation from the figure the difference of fluid energy that whether take the inviscid vortex into consideration is consistent with the variation tendency of work done on the floating body by potential force and inviscid cfd force and has about 85 of the peak value of the curve of the work difference it shows that the inviscid vortex due to the bottom corner of the sandglass type model is the major reason for the difference between potential flow theory and inviscid cfd method lastly there are two peaks in the curve during a motion period which correspond to the two vortices generated by the body when changing motion direction 4 conclusion in the present study at first the cfd numerical model and method to simulate the heave motion of the sandglass type model are established whose convergence and accuracy are validated by comparing with the experimental data after that hydrodynamic forces with different amplitudes of forced heave motion are calculated to discuss nonlinear characteristics finally by means of various cfd models and analysis methods the characteristics of heave damping and its corresponding components for the sandglass type floating body are analyzed through these analyses the following conclusions can be made 1 for the cfd numerical model of this paper the mesh size and time step can satisfy the convergence requirement furthermore by comparing with the experimental data the present numerical method can be validated to be accurate enough to simulate the heave motion of the sandglass type floating body 2 the special shape of the sandglass type model makes its heave radiation problem strongly nonlinear on the one hand the greater the motion amplitude of the sandglass type floating body the larger the deviation between cfd and potential results the stronger the nonlinear effect of heave radiation force especially when the motion amplitude reaches a certain extent the peak of cfd force will have noticeable deformation and irregularity on the other hand with the motion amplitude decreasing to about 5 of the depth of the sandglass type model the hydrodynamic rao and period can be considered to be stable and the influence of nonlinearity can become weak enough to be neglected 3 for the sandglass type model the damping considering viscosity is slightly greater than motion damping without considering viscosity this is because there is friction effect on the fpso wall when viscosity is considered however the difference between the two is small which indicates that fluid viscosity has little effect on motion damping of the sandglass type model and is not the main cause of heave motion damping of the sandglass type floating body 4 due to the special shape of the sandglass type floating body the wavelets and wave rolling phenomenon can be generated near the body which should cause the local wave elevation to have obvious deformation and nonlinear characteristics with the propagation distance increasing these local wavelets should decay and even disappear at the same time the equivalent radiation damping based on the cfd wave amplitude gradually tends to a steady value which agrees well with the radiation damping based on wave potential theory 5 the vortex generated during the heave motion which is caused by the inviscid fluid separation due to the bottom corner of the sandglass type model is the primary reason for the difference of damping between the potential flow theory and the cfd method in the cfd numerical simulation it can be found that when the sandglass type model changes its motion direction a vortex will be generated at its bottom angle and the no 1 vortex has the greatest intensity at the equilibrium position while the no 2 vortex has the greatest intensity before the equilibrium position generally speaking the vortex intensity becomes larger with motion frequency increases and the moving direction of the vortex will also change with motion frequency 6 as to the damping of heave motion for the sandglass type floating body the radiation damping and the vortex due to the bottom corner are important factors and should be paid more attention to in the further performance research and shape design of sandglass type fpso besides in the follow up study when predicting the motion response of the sandglass type model based on the potential flow theory it should be necessary to focus on the influence of the vortex by the cfd inviscid model and correct the damping credit authorship contribution statement wen hua wang conceptualization methodology writing

21119,for the new sandglass type floating body with special shape this paper mainly analyzes the characteristic of the heave damping and its corresponding components by computational fluid dynamics cfd method firstly the convergence and accuracy of the cfd method to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type floating body were validated along with the experimental data secondly the numerical model of the floating body with forced heave motion was created and then hydrodynamic forces versus different motion amplitudes were calculated and compared to discuss its nonlinear characteristics afterwards based on time history curves of the hydrodynamic force heaving added mass and damping of the floating body versus various frequencies were achieved and found to be different from the potential results in order to analyze the reasons that cause difference numerical simulations using inviscid and k ε turbulent models were performed respectively and the results indicate that the effect of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic coefficients is small and not decisive then equivalent radiation damping based on cfd wave elevation was deduced to explore the relation between the inviscid cfd and potential models finally local wave field and vorticity field near the body were mainly discussed and quantitative analysis based on mechanical energy was performed to verify that the vortex due to the body shape is the essential cause of the heave damping for the sandglass type floating body keywords sandglass type fpso damping component cfd method forced heave motion hydrodynamic force equivalent radiation damping vortex 1 introduction with marine oil and gas gradually developing towards deep water floating production storage and offloading units fpso play a more and more important role in the exploration of ocean resources because of its functional advantages such as large oil storage capacity multifunction etc therein traditional ship type and cylindrical fpsos have some performance limitations wang and feng 2011 wu 2012 for better application in ocean engineering a new concept of floating body with an innovative sandglass type shape was presented by huang et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 whose excellent motion performance has been validated by both numerical and experimental studies wang et al 2017 du et al 2017 therefore the new sandglass type fpso has wide and good application prospects the response amplitude of heave motion can obviously affect the seakeeping performance and function of ocean platform such as green water phenomenon the application of riser system and so on which can be effectively reduced based on the wave free characteristic of sandglass type floating body wang et al 2018 and can be further minimized based on the initial discussion about heave damping du et al 2018 thus the heave damping plays an important role in improving the heave motion performance of the sandglass type fpso and should be further analyzed as so far the damping of floating ocean structures have been studied by various methods that are theoretical analysis model experiment and cfd numerical simulation respectively therein the cfd numerical simulation is the most widely used method because it can be effective and low cost to analyze the flow field and viscous damping based on the solution of navier stokes equations wilson et al 2006 created an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes code to achieve the motion responses of ship by considering the viscous damping zhou et al 2015 mainly studied the roll damping of a ship by means of the 3d cfd method philip et al 2019 investigated the effects of heave damping on the spar due to the circular plates based on the cfd method ji and li 2019a 2019b discussed the viscous damping performance of the anti motion structures on a cylindrical fpso by using the cfd method in addition the other studies about the simulation on the damping and anti motion structures were performed by avalos et al 2014 jiang and yeung 2014 irkal et al 2016 yildiz et al 2016 lavrov et al 2017 yildiz and katayama 2017 gadelho et al 2018 gokce and kinaci 2018 the above studies showed that the cfd numerical simulation should be a good method to study the damping characteristics of ships and ocean structures for the new sandglass type fpso its floating body has a special shape with the small waterline the inclined outward side and the sharp bottom angle which can observably influence its damping characteristic and motion responses in waves therefore it is very necessary to analyze the characteristic and various components of heave damping of the sandglass type floating body by using the cfd method along with model experiment in this paper firstly the convergence and accuracy of the cfd method to simulate the heave motion of the floating body were studied along with the experimental data secondly the numerical model of the floating body with forced heave motion was set up and then hydrodynamic forces versus different amplitudes were compared to discuss its nonlinear characteristic after that based on time history curves of the hydrodynamic force heaving added mass and damping of the body versus various frequencies were achieved and compared with the potential results furthermore the influence of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic coefficients was analyzed based on the inviscid and k ε turbulent model then equivalent radiation damping based on cfd wave elevation were deduced to analyze the differences and similarities between the inviscid solutions and potential results finally local wave field and vorticity field near the body were mainly discussed and quantitative analysis based on mechanical energy was performed to confirm the essential reason of the heave damping for the sandglass type floating body 2 validation of numerical method to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type model 2 1 description of sandglass type model and numerical method the details of the sandglass type floating body have been demonstrated by huang et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 here only the shape parameters of the sandglass type model in this study are introduced as shown in fig 1 and table 1 which are derived from the experimental tests of 1 70 scaled model by wang et al 2017 in the present research the heave motion of the sandglass type floating body was numerically simulated by using the cfd method based on the star ccm platform therein the continuity and navier stokes equations of the incompressible fluid in vector form are written as follows 1 v 0 2 ρ v t v v p μ 2 v ρ g where v is the velocity vector ρ is the density p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity g is the gravity acceleration and 2 denotes the laplace operator on this basis vof method hirt and nichols 1981 was taken to track the transient free surface based on the volume fraction equation 3 c q t c q v 0 q 1 2 where c 1 and c 2 represent the volume fraction of water and air respectively furthermore the k ε turbulent model was applied to deal with the fluid viscosity irkal et al 2016 gokce and kinaci 2018 as equations 4 and 5 the dynamic fluid body interaction model and the overset mesh system were used to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type floating body with large motion amplitude 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε 5 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t

are experience coefficient g k is the production term of turbulent kinetic energy k caused by the average velocity gradient according to the shape characteristics of the sandglass type floating body and considering the computational efficiency 1 4 of a cylindrical computational domain was applied to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type model as shown in fig 2 a furthermore based on the model experiments the bottom and outer boundaries of the computational domain were defined as no slip wall condition the top boundary was defined as pressure outlet condition the radial planes were defined as symmetry condition and a wave damping zone near outer boundary were defined to avoid wave reflection from the side wall the entire computation domain was discretized with structured hexahedral mesh and prism layer based on cartesian cut cell method as shown in fig 2 b and d then several classic regions near free surface and bottom edge of the model were created to refine the meshes so that the flow features of radiation wave and vortex can be simulated better as shown in fig 2 c and e 2 2 convergence analysis on numerical mesh and time step here the convergence of the numerical mesh and time step is discussed for numerical mesh four test cases with different mesh sizes were simulated which are coarse 0 70 million medium 1 01 million medium fine 1 46 million and fine 2 07 million respectively furthermore three different time steps were tested which are large 0 01s medium 0 005s and small 0 0025s respectively on this basis time history curves of heave motion versus different meshes with time step equals 0 0025s and different time steps with medium fine scheme 1 46 million can be achieved and shown in fig 3 and table 2 from the figure and table it can be found that with the mesh being finer or the time step being smaller to a certain degree the numerical results with different meshing schemes can agree well with each other and become not sensitive to the mesh and time step which can validate the convergence of the present numerical method in this paper furthermore based on calculation precision and efficiency the mesh scheme of 1 46 million as listed in table 3 and 0 005 s time step can be applied in the sequent analysis therein the definition of various regions should be referred to fig 2 2 3 validation of numerical method to simulate the heave motion of sandglass type floating body based on the model experiment wang 2017 the free decay heave motion of the sandglass type floating body with an initial heave displacement of 55 mm was numerically simulated by the cfd method then the numerical solutions and experimental results are compared and shown in fig 4 and table 4 therein the expt means experimental data and rel diff means the relative difference between numerical and experimental results as shown in fig 4 and table 4 the time history curve of numerical heave motion is very close to that of the experimental data and the relative differences of two methods are all less than 5 thus the numerical method of this paper has been successfully validated which means that it can be used to numerically simulate the heave motion of the sandglass type floating body 3 analysis on the characteristic of heave damping for the sandglass type floating body in this section the validated cfd method is taken to study the characteristics of the heave damping and its corresponding components for the sandglass type floating body among them the shape parameters of the sandglass type floating body are consistent with the experimental model which is listed in table 1 3 1 hydrodynamic forces of the sandglass type floating body with forced heave motion 3 1 1 numerical model of the sandglass type floating body with forced heave motion here the computational domain and boundary conditions were selected to be the same as section 2 1 therein the frequencies of the forced heave motion correspond to different radiation wave lengths were 1 8 rad s with an interval 1 rad s therefore the radius of the computational domain should be adjusted with different motion frequencies then the more coarse grids were used in the area that was away from the floating body and a wave damping zone was arranged which is close to the outer boundary in order to accurately describe the wave generation and propagation as well as the interaction between radiation waves and the floating body finer meshes were used near the free surface fig 5 shows a vertical cross sectional view of the numerical mesh the forced heave motion of the sandglass type floating body is a single dof periodic motion with fixed frequency and amplitude as shown in fig 6 the forced heave motion of the sandglass type fpso can be described as 6 ξ 3 ξ 30 sin ω t ξ 3 ξ 30 ω cos ω t ξ 3 ξ 30 ω 2 sin ω t where ω is motion frequency ξ 30 is amplitude ξ 3 ξ 3 ξ 3 are displacement velocity and acceleration respectively 3 1 2 comparison of hydrodynamic forces versus different amplitudes of forced heave motion in this section the cfd method was used to numerically simulate the forced heave motion with different motion amplitudes in order to study its effect on the hydrodynamic force of the sandglass type floating body the classic motion amplitudes were selected as 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m and 0 08 m respectively fig 7 shows the different cfd solutions of hydrodynamic forces along with the potential results versus various amplitudes under motion frequency of 5 rad s among them the potential theory means the results that were obtained by the boundary element method wang et al 2016 and the cfd refers to the solutions by the cfd method of this paper it can be found that the hydrodynamic force caused by body motion will change with amplitude firstly the greater the motion amplitude the larger the hydrodynamic force secondly the greater the motion amplitude the larger the deviation between cfd and potential results the stronger the nonlinear effect especially the hydrodynamic force for the case of amplitude of 0 08 m it has obvious deformation and irregularity which shows that the cfd method can simulate the strong nonlinear characteristics caused by the sandglass type shape and large motion amplitude very well furthermore for the cases with motion amplitudes of 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m and 0 04 m the amplitudes and periods for various curves of hydrodynamic force were achieved by the cfd method as shown in fig 7 and then the hydrodynamic rao can be obtained and shown in fig 8 along with the periods in the figure with the motion amplitude reducing to 0 01 m the hydrodynamic rao and period gradually tend to be stable the influence of nonlinearity gradually weakens for a better discussion about the characteristic of heave damping of the sandglass type floating body motion amplitude 0 01 m should be taken in the next researches of this paper 3 2 heaving added mass and damping of sandglass type model versus various motion frequencies based on the cfd method the sandglass type models with different motion frequencies 1 8 rad s of forced heave motion were numerically simulated among them the hydrodynamic forces of the sandglass type model versus different motion frequencies 2 0 rad s 4 0 rad s 6 0 rad s and 8 0 rad s are shown in fig 9 from the figure it can be found that all the curves of hydrodynamic force versus frequencies show the regular periodic change furthermore the increase in motion frequency should cause a larger amplitude of force by the phase decomposition method zhu et al 2009 jaouen et al 2011 gustavo et al 2018 the heaving added mass and damping based on the cfd can be calculated and compared with potential radiation damping as shown in fig 10 from the figure it can be seen that the heaving added mass between cfd and potential methods are almost the same but the damping based on the cfd solutions has a large difference from the potential radiation damping which should be further discussed in the next sections of this paper 3 3 discussion on the characteristic of various damping components of the sandglass type model in this section in order to study the essential reason for the difference between the viscous results and potential radiation damping in fig 10 b the inviscid cfd numerical model was established firstly the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by the inviscid and turbulent models were comparatively analyzed secondly based on the wave elevation calculated by the cfd method with inviscid model the equivalent radiation damping can be obtained and compared with the potential radiation damping finally the local wave field and vorticity field near the body were mainly discussed and quantitative analysis based on mechanical energy was performed to prove that the vortex due to the body shape is the essential cause of the heave damping for the sandglass type floating body 3 3 1 effect of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic coefficients in order to discuss the influence of fluid viscosity on the hydrodynamic force and the damping the cfd numerical simulations based on the inviscid model were performed for the sandglass type floating body with the forced heave motion then the hydrodynamic forces of the sandglass type floating body in viscous and inviscid fluid with different motion frequencies were shown in fig 11 based on the phase decomposed method the damping of the sandglass type floating body obtained by the cfd method with the inviscid and turbulent models can be seen in fig 12 from figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that the difference of hydrodynamic forces between the inviscid and viscous model is very small at each motion frequency in general the viscous damping is slightly larger than the damping without considering the viscosity because the frictional force exists on the body surface when considering the viscosity however the difference between the two is small which indicates that the damping component caused by the friction is relatively small therefore the viscosity has little effect on the hydrodynamic force and the damping of the sandglass type floating body while the cfd solutions of hydrodynamic parameters obtained by the inviscid model still differ greatly from the potential result 3 3 2 heaving damping based on inviscid cfd model and potential flow theory in this section according to the inviscid cfd solutions of wave elevations caused by the sandglass type model the equivalent radiation damping can be deduced and compared with the potential radiation damping firstly in order to deduce the equivalent radiation damping 3d cylindrical water domain and its 2d y o z section are created and shown in fig 13 referring to faltinsen 1990 then based on the general formula proposed by newman 1977 and the further analysis by faltinsen 1990 the total energy e kinetic and potential energy and the integral of its derivative versus time in one period can be written as 7 e t ρ ω 0 5 v 2 g z d τ 8 0 t d e d t d t 0 t d t s b p p 0 u n d s ρ 0 t d t s φ t φ n d s 0 where ω denotes the fluid domain s b is wet surface of sandglass type model s is infinity boundary s 0 is bottom boundary with infinite water depth ρ is water density g is acceleration of gravity v is velocity magnitude of water p is water pressure p 0 is the atmospheric pressure u n is the normal velocity on s b ф is velocity potential φ n is its derivative along the normal unit vector n to s positive direction is into the fluid domain therein the velocity potential and the second term in equation 6 can be rewritten as 9 φ g a 3 ω e k z cos ω t k y α 10 ρ 0 t d t s φ t φ n d s ρ 0 t d t 0 π r d θ 0 2 φ t φ n d z π r ρ g a 3 2 g 2 ω t where r is the distance between o z axis and s d θ is the differential form of rotation angle as shown in fig 13 a 3 is wave amplitude k is wave number and α is random phase angle furthermore the first term in equation 6 has been deduced by faltinsen 1990 and described as 11 0 t d t s b p p 0 u n d s ω 2 t 2 b 33 η 3 2 where η 3 represents the motion amplitude of sandglass type model b 33 is the radiation damping of potential flow theory by combining equations 6 8 and 9 the radiation damping of the three dimensional sandglass type floating body can be obtained as 12 b 33 ρ a 3 η 3 2 g 2 ω 3 π r in the cfd numerical simulation of the forced heave motion of sandglass type model with different motion frequencies time history curves of wave elevation of monitoring points with different distances from the body were achieved here the case with motion frequency 3 rad s is taken as an example and the time history curves of wave elevation of those monitoring points are shown in fig 14 from the figure it can be found that at the location near the sandglass type model 1 0 m the curve of wave elevation has noticeable deformation and nonlinear characteristics as shown in fig 14 a which corresponds to the local wavelets due to the sandglass type shape it should fade away with the propagation distance increasing as seen in fig 14 b and c based on the wave elevations at different locations obtained by the cfd method and equation 10 the wave amplitude a 33 and equivalent radiation damping with motion frequency 3 rad s can be calculated and shown in fig 15 in this figure with the distance from the body increasing the equivalent radiation damping based on cfd solutions gradually tends to a steady value of 66 23 n m on this basis equivalent radiation damping versus different heave motion frequencies can be achieved and plotted as fig 16 therein the damping by the cfd hydrodynamic force is obtained based on the phase decomposition method from the figure it can be found that the results of radiation damping based on wave potential theory and the equivalent radiation damping by cfd wave amplitude agree well with each other furthermore there are certain differences between wave potential solutions and the damping from the cfd hydrodynamic force by inviscid model which should be further analyzed from the local wave field and vorticity field near the floating body in the next chapter 3 3 3 analysis on local wave field and vorticity field near the sandglass type floating body in order to clarify the difference of heave damping between wave potential theory and phase decomposition of cfd hydrodynamic force by inviscid model here the fluid characteristic of local wave field and vorticity field near the sandglass type floating body calculated by the cfd numerical method are studied minutely 1 local wave surface of sandglass type model by the cfd method of inviscid model the wave surfaces near the floating body are numerically simulated at various typical moments during 4 0 t 5 0 t t is the motion period of sandglass type model and the wave field should become steady after fourth period of time as shown in fig 17 18 in fig 17 it can be seen that there is a phase difference of vertical motion between the sandglass type model and the wave surface near the wall when the floating body moves upwards its design of large area bottom can contra directionally raise the free surface near the body on the other hand when the body moves downwards the free surface should climb along the sloping freeboard and then cause wave rolling phenomenon fig 18 shows the wave contour by the heave motion of the floating body in the fluid domain as can be seen from fig 18 a due to the sandglass type shape five local wavelets can be generated near the body in one motion period and propagate forward together with the main radiation wave then with radiation wave spreading far away these wavelets should decay and disappear as shown in fig 18 b which can be also behaved as the generation and disappearance of the obvious deformations on the time history curves of wave elevation as shown in fig 14 a and c based on the above analysis the special shape of sandglass type model will make local wave surfaces significantly nonlinear in the heave radiation problem though the fluid viscosity is not considered by the inviscid cfd model the bottom angle of the sandglass type floating body can produce a vortex during its forced heave motion fig 19 shows the vorticity field at the bottom angle of the body with motion frequency 4 rad s at various typical moments according to the figure when the fpso moves from the highest position to the equilibrium position 4 25 4 5 t fig 19 c e a vortex should be generated and shed at the bottom angle which is named no 1 vortex the sandglass type body continues to move down to the lowest position 4 5 4 75 t fig 19 e g the vortex stays above the bottom angle then the motion direction of fpso changes from the lowest position to the equilibrium position 4 75 5 0 t fig 19 g h and a a new vortex named no 2 can be generated under the bottom angle and move downwards with the previous no 1 vortex finally while the body moves up from the equilibrium position to the highest position 5 0 5 25 t fig 19 a b and c the no 2 vortex continues with decreasing intensity and no new vortices will be created on the upper side of the bottom angle until reaching the highest position and the two vortices mentioned above should keep away from the body in summary when the sandglass type fpso changes its direction of motion a vortex should be generated at the bottom angle and the no 1 vortex has the greatest intensity at the equilibrium position while the no 2 vortex has the greatest intensity before the equilibrium position and decreases quickly on this basis the vorticity fields versus different motion frequencies are simulated and compared in fig 20 among them the moment is corresponding to the equilibrium position from top to bottom this figure indicates that the characteristics of the vortex are different with different motion frequencies in general the vortex intensity enhances as motion frequency increases furthermore another difference is the existence or nonexistence of the no 2 vortex on the other hand the no 1 vortex will move upward in the low frequency range stay at the sandglass type model s bottom angle in the middle frequency range and move downwards beyond the no 2 vortex in the high frequency range i e the developing direction of the no 1 vortex should change with frequency based on the above analysis the sandglass type model will generate a vortex when changing the direction of heave motion even based on the inviscid cfd model which is induced by the non viscous fluid separation due to the existence of the bottom corner however the radiation damping calculated by the potential flow theory cannot consider the fluid vortex generated by the non viscous fluid separation which should result in the differences between the wave potential solutions and the damping by cfd hydrodynamic force for the sandglass type model 3 3 4 quantitative analysis on the influence of vorticity in inviscid fluid based on mechanical energy here by means of the cfd simulation of the inviscid model on the heave motion of sandglass type model the mechanical energies of fluid particles in the computational domain are calculated to further quantitatively analyze the effect of the vorticity of non viscous fluid separation based on the velocity decomposition theorem of helmholtz the velocity vector of a fluid micro element can be written as 13 v m v m 0 1 2 rot v δ r s δ r where v m 0 is the translation velocity of reference point m 0 1 2 rot v δ r 2 represents the fluid velocity of point m due to the rotation around m 0 s δ r is fluid velocity of m due to fluid deformation this means that the velocity of m is the superimposition of translation rotation and deformation velocities for the fluid domain the differential form of total energy of fluid particle can be expressed as 14 t 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g z 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g z v p v where ρv 2 2 represents the fluid kinetic energy ρ g z indicates the fluid potential energy by integrating the whole fluid domain mechanical energy can be obtained as 15 v t t 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g y d v v t 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g y v d v v t p v d v where the left term of this equation is total energy of fluid particle in the whole computational domain the right terms of the equation are fluid energy transported through the top boundary almost negligible and work done on the solid wall of the sandglass type model respectively during the period that the sandglass type fpso are forced heaving the floating body and the fluid domain can be handled as a system the work done on the sandglass type floating body with forced heave motion can affect the fluid field and it should be transferred to the mechanical energy of the fluid domain furthermore the mechanical energy of fluid domain with or without considering the vortex are compared with the work done on the body calculated by the potential and cfd forces respectively for the case of motion frequency 4 rad s as shown in fig 21 therein the curves of energy without vortex and energy with vortex considered different forms of velocity equation 11 from the figure it can be found that these two kinds of curves between the work done on the sandglass type model by hydrodynamic force and the mechanical energy of fluid domain agree well with each other it means that the system of sandglass type body and fluid field can satisfy the law of conservation of energy based on the numerical solutions in fig 21 the difference of work done by hydrodynamic force between fig 21 a and fig 21 b is calculated and shown in fig 22 it reflects the discrepancy between the potential force and the cfd force on the body moreover the mechanical energy of fluid field in the figure means the difference of fluid energy with and without vortex due to the non viscous fluid separation from the figure the difference of fluid energy that whether take the inviscid vortex into consideration is consistent with the variation tendency of work done on the floating body by potential force and inviscid cfd force and has about 85 of the peak value of the curve of the work difference it shows that the inviscid vortex due to the bottom corner of the sandglass type model is the major reason for the difference between potential flow theory and inviscid cfd method lastly there are two peaks in the curve during a motion period which correspond to the two vortices generated by the body when changing motion direction 4 conclusion in the present study at first the cfd numerical model and method to simulate the heave motion of the sandglass type model are established whose convergence and accuracy are validated by comparing with the experimental data after that hydrodynamic forces with different amplitudes of forced heave motion are calculated to discuss nonlinear characteristics finally by means of various cfd models and analysis methods the characteristics of heave damping and its corresponding components for the sandglass type floating body are analyzed through these analyses the following conclusions can be made 1 for the cfd numerical model of this paper the mesh size and time step can satisfy the convergence requirement furthermore by comparing with the experimental data the present numerical method can be validated to be accurate enough to simulate the heave motion of the sandglass type floating body 2 the special shape of the sandglass type model makes its heave radiation problem strongly nonlinear on the one hand the greater the motion amplitude of the sandglass type floating body the larger the deviation between cfd and potential results the stronger the nonlinear effect of heave radiation force especially when the motion amplitude reaches a certain extent the peak of cfd force will have noticeable deformation and irregularity on the other hand with the motion amplitude decreasing to about 5 of the depth of the sandglass type model the hydrodynamic rao and period can be considered to be stable and the influence of nonlinearity can become weak enough to be neglected 3 for the sandglass type model the damping considering viscosity is slightly greater than motion damping without considering viscosity this is because there is friction effect on the fpso wall when viscosity is considered however the difference between the two is small which indicates that fluid viscosity has little effect on motion damping of the sandglass type model and is not the main cause of heave motion damping of the sandglass type floating body 4 due to the special shape of the sandglass type floating body the wavelets and wave rolling phenomenon can be generated near the body which should cause the local wave elevation to have obvious deformation and nonlinear characteristics with the propagation distance increasing these local wavelets should decay and even disappear at the same time the equivalent radiation damping based on the cfd wave amplitude gradually tends to a steady value which agrees well with the radiation damping based on wave potential theory 5 the vortex generated during the heave motion which is caused by the inviscid fluid separation due to the bottom corner of the sandglass type model is the primary reason for the difference of damping between the potential flow theory and the cfd method in the cfd numerical simulation it can be found that when the sandglass type model changes its motion direction a vortex will be generated at its bottom angle and the no 1 vortex has the greatest intensity at the equilibrium position while the no 2 vortex has the greatest intensity before the equilibrium position generally speaking the vortex intensity becomes larger with motion frequency increases and the moving direction of the vortex will also change with motion frequency 6 as to the damping of heave motion for the sandglass type floating body the radiation damping and the vortex due to the bottom corner are important factors and should be paid more attention to in the further performance research and shape design of sandglass type fpso besides in the follow up study when predicting the motion response of the sandglass type model based on the potential flow theory it should be necessary to focus on the influence of the vortex by the cfd inviscid model and correct the damping credit authorship contribution statement wen hua wang conceptualization methodology writing
