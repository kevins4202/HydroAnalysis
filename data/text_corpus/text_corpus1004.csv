5020,monitoring sediment yield is necessary for assessing erosion induced land degradation and used for planning conservation measures collecting time and space integrated as well as time distributed runoff samples cost effectively is still a challenge for hydrologists civil engineers soil scientists and environmentalists a low cost automatic runoff sampler for quantifying suspended sediment using simple mechanical and hydraulic principles was designed and a prototype developed the procedure of runoff sampling involves the interception of a defined portion of the runoff exiting the crest of a gauging structure through the triangular sectioned interceptors the intercepted volume was reduced to a manageable quantity by multiple splitting using a series of diamond sectioned interceptors after the collection of a representative volume the sample was delivered to a time stamped storage system through a clock driven arm tube the mathematical design principles at each stage defined the hydraulic and mechanical dimensions of the components which were assembled to develop the complete prototype furthermore field scale modifications to accommodate any special situations and conditions were also presented the prototype of the sampling device endured rigorous laboratory scale validation tests and was found to perform reasonably well the performance of the new sampling device was evaluated against the fine resolution manual discrete sampling the temporal resolution of 15 min adopted by the sampler was found reasonably comparable to further finer resolution options with discrepancies contained within a 10 error envelope r2 0 983 the equipment was validated in field scale experiments both in plot and natural watershed and performance metrics were found to be acceptable r2 0 78 to 0 99 moreover low cost and easy maintenance requirements indicate the high potential and field applicability of this new device keywords suspended sediment runoff sampling device flow weighted average interceptor time distributed sampling sample representativeness 1 introduction land degradation through water erosion is a global phenomenon so severe worldwide that it threatens our agricultural base about 80 of the world s agricultural soils are affected by erosion thompson 1995 whereas approximately 40 of the world s agricultural land is seriously degraded ian 2007 soil erosion from the world s terrestrial ecosystem is estimated to be 75 billion tonnes pimentel and kounang 1998 in india around126 million hectares of area are affected by various degrees of water erosion out of which 82 6 million hectares are considered degraded maji et al 2010 monitoring soil loss and sediment yield is imperative to plan conservation measures for sustainable land resource management several methods for estimating sediment production rates exist including a periodic assessment of micro topographic change change in gully geometries and measuring sediment concentration in runoff hickok and ree 1967 hudson 1993 sediment yield is typically quantified using direct and indirect methods the direct methods are more accurate though require heavy running cost and manpower whereas indirect methods are relatively cheaper in operations but require heavy capital investment and need of managing complexity to minimize estimation error miyamoto et al 1992 for example the radioisotope methods particularly the 137cs based are used in several studies agudo 1998 bajracharya et al 1998 buj√°n et al 2003 andrello et al 2004 but require sophisticated equipment and other costly logistics for measuring sediment concentration in a stream various automatic samplers have been developed but their high cost cumbersome maintenance and poor temporal resolution are some of the reasons behind their limited use in developing and less developed world sun et al 2014 roseen et al 2011 pint milk bottle trap sampler indiana sampler floating cork type sampler are some of the popular samplers that seldom collect depth integrated samples wang et al 2011 fao 1997 in many in stream runoff samplers only rising stage sediment samples are collected in bottles that do not represent the falling stage nieminen 2000 the common practice is to collect discrete samples at an arbitrary time of the runoff event at a weir or flume outlet broad crested rectangular weir or v notch with high degrees of sampling error brown et al 1970 usda 1979 allen 1981 the nappe has been considered as the better place for runoff sampling hudson 1993 however the samples collected from this area by the moment grab method are neither time integrated nor composite lessels and bishop 2020 suttles et al 2003 wang et al 2011 the poor sampling method is therefore one of the major reasons why interpretations of sediment data are highly uncertain when compared to runoff data lately land degradation assessment initiatives by intergovernmental panels suggested a reduction in spatial predictive uncertainty in water induced erosion estimates by calibrating it with the measurement of soil loss sediment loads at various landscape scales in the indian context where most of the watershed projects are implemented by government and non government agencies the unit for conservation planning remains typically small watersheds of size 500 to 1000 ha samra 2008 pathak 1991 for their operational conveniences these are the most neglected landscapes in terms of their monitoring for sediment loading due to the lack of cost effective and operationally easy alternatives for sediment sampling employing human labor at each of these gauging stations is not practical due to its exorbitant cost the remoteness of the location and continuity issues over day and night the ideal approach is to collect total runoff from the watershed and measure sediment but it needs huge tanks to be created in this method a large number of tanks occupying huge installation space along the flow path are required to obtain temporal data for sedimentograph for very small watersheds or runoff plots it can be created with considerable expenses but the requirement of manpower or alternate arrangements for diverting runoff among the tanks at a definite time post event cleaning and emptying renders it impractical and cost prohibitive even in the case of measurements from the field plots there are various sources of variations fayos et al 2006 the moving long and wide conveyor belt with its arrays of similar sized slots for collection of samples from the total discharge has been rated ideal replogle 2009 but seems to be a distant reality because of high energy cost maintenance and space requirement multi slot divisors extensively and widely used in plot scale experiments collect composite samples which are not time distributed there is a need for careful calibration proper maintenance and frequent cleaning as even minor changes in the surface condition may add an unaccounted error in sediment yield data geib 1933 sheridan et al 1996 bonilla et al 2006 coshocton wheel sampler with h flume is also commonly used sampling equipment in soil erosion studies in small plots reploge and el swaify 1985 it works with reasonable accuracy for an area less than 0 4 ha when carefully installed and commissioned however pro rata sampling errors in the quantum of samples collected and particle size distribution were also observed as compared to the original flow wang et al 1971 in a normal setting the sediment samples still fall short of an expectation to obtain a sedimentograph sun et al 2014 developed an alternative device for simultaneous measurement of runoff and sediment load from a field plot ranging from 0 005 to 0 1 ha in this device a storage tank of 15 cm depth and 20 cm diameter placed over a base frame has a splitter along with the upper rim this arrangement of storage before the splitting of the rising limb may facilitate sedimentation in the tank altering the true sediment concentration of runoff the last couple of decades witnessed colossal development efforts in automatic runoff sampling equipment including entry of the electronics modules such as microprocessors newburn 1988 pathak 1991 pathak and sudi 2004 most of them collect a pre set time discrete sediment sample from a point location or composite from multiple locations which does not realize the spatial and temporal integration of the sample roseen et al 2011 coarser time resolutions often do not concur with the event extremities that carry the heavy sediment concentration further complex gadget leads to loss of data due to failure in electronic components energy uncertainties cumbersome and higher cost of maintenance kohonen 1985 subject to these contentious issues this manuscript is aimed to deliver a concept leading to a cost effective design of a sediment sampling device that i collects a reasonably acceptable representative sample which is both space and time integrated ii employs a hierarchical sample splitting mechanism to divert sample to a clock driven distribution system at a 15 min time interval the article also explains the mathematical principle of obtaining a representative sample post a hierarchical sample splitting mechanism and complete fabrication details of the functional prototype that endured rigorous lab testing and field evaluations 2 materials and methods the process descriptions leading to the development of a prototype of sediment sampler include the collection of representative samples reducing the 15 minute cumulative volume to a size that does not exceed the volume of the storage bottles collecting the time distributed samples for storage and laboratory analysis the design is a preferable candidate for a runoff gauging structure which is of rectangular size rectangular weir either sharp or broad crested delivering runoff discharge uniformly over its crest length the geometry of the splitter can be modified to accommodate other types of weirs as well and can be designed on a case to case basis 2 1 sample apportioning 2 1 1 first stage crest to triangular interceptors obtaining an integrated representative sample of an event needs a mechanism that can draw a sample which inherits the sediment concentration of the runoff exiting the weir and reduces the volume of the sample to a manageable size the principle was explained by replogle 2009 where it was postulated that if the runoff samples were intercepted by a mechanism equispaced over the entire crest length there was a likely occurrence that each of them would receive an amount having a similar sample characteristic however the moment it forms a nappe beyond the crest the effect of gravity would result in a concentration gradient that is not uniform vertically therefore it was assumed that a segment length of 30 40 cm for small and 1 5 m for medium size length 5 10 m crest lengths may be appropriate for runoff sample interception the sample just exiting at the surface of the weir headwall was collected in triangular shaped interceptors with a 2 mm slit on the top and side expanding downward at 30 up to 10 cm that would collect the entire vertical section of the flow with the width equivalent to the width of the slits usda 1979 fig 1 a the top slit opening of 2 mm was provided to allow a maximum particle size in the suspended sediments the maximum size of suspended sediment in the nappe portion of the weir was found to be 0 2 mm the typical section of the interceptor fig s 1 was made to dissipate the cantilever load against the wall ensuring forward flow and no flow accumulation barnes and frevert 1954 barnes and johnson 1956 hudson 1993 the possibility of sediment entry to an opening is least affected if the opening size is 10 times or more than the size of the particle the triangular sectioned interceptors were permanently fixed to the crest section of the weir aligned perpendicularly to the crest the channels were having a horizontal outward grade of 10 fig 1b a mathematical description of the sampling at this stage can be given as follows the intercepted discharge q1 m3s 1 can be approximated by considering the width of the slit opening and the number of slots 1 q1 0 002n l q where n is the number of slotted channels installed l is the length of the weir in meter and q is the discharge through rectangular weir m3s 1 which is approximated by 2 q c l h1 5 where c is the weir coefficient l is the length of the crest m and h is the head of flow m on the weir 2 1 2 second stage triangular interceptors to inverted triangle channel the discharge intercepted in the first step through the triangular interceptors was channeled to another cross aligned channel having an inverted triangular section that received uniform discharge rates along its length from each of the triangular interceptors due to a defined grade in each interceptor as well as in the channel the flow remains supercritical thus the height of flow in the triangular conveyance is assumed to be less than or equal to the height of the same discharge in ideal conditions for the weir of the same angle the maximum height of flow in the inverted triangular channel fig 1b is approximated using the following formula of discharge usbr 1997 3 q1 a r2 3 s1 2 Œ∑ where q1 is discharge m3s 1 in the inverted triangular section channel r is the hydraulic radius defined as the ratio of flow cross section a expressed as m2 to the wetted perimeter p expressed as m s is the slope of the channel fraction Œ∑ is manning s roughness coefficient two types of triangular channels i e 90 and 120 section were considered simplifying and computing the coefficient for 90 and 120 section triangular channel table 1 equation 3 can be rearranged in terms of the height of flow h1 m and expressed as 4 h1 k q1 3 8 computation is made for the galvanized iron gi sheet Œ∑ 0 012 at a grade of 10 s 0 1 for 90 fig a in table 1 as well as 120 fig b in table 1 triangular channel computed k coefficient of discharge is 0 38026 and 0 16874 respectively table 1 2 1 3 third stage inverted triangular channel to diamond section the discharge was reduced to a controlled volume by splitting through a series of diamond section interceptors fig 1b and 1c each with a 2 mm slit at the top installed at 20 grade or more to the receiver channel these diamond sectioned interceptors were arranged in a vertical array to receive the discharge from the preceding interceptor which was further transferred to the succeeding interceptor while passing through the channel section of the interceptor invariably the flow in the interceptor was governed by the flow in an inverted triangular channel section as discussed in the preceding section fig 1b and c the diamond section dimensions were thus telescopically reduced following the calculations made in equations 1 through 4 the rectangular section of this conveyance barnes and frevert 1954 barnes and johnson 1956 was considered a better option for flow weighted interception if the sample size is large for low volume flow the triangular section is more sensitive to the head of flow and can deliver a more flow column to the next slit when compared to a rectangular channel a drop at every interception a grade of 20 or more small flow length 10 15 cm and higher grade for longer and or smaller flow ensures mixing and low possibility of sedimentation of the suspended sediment size 0 2 mm however the possibility of intercepting the higher proportion of coarse particles cannot be ruled out because of repeated interception from the central section of the flow and is subjected to scrutiny considering the easy availability of diamond section square section with slit opening along an edge pipe that can be made for the dual purpose of interception and conveyance computation is done mainly for 90 notch the first triangular channel is expected to handle relatively higher discharge therefore the grade of 10 was enough to minimize deposition as the discharge received in the successive interceptors are low a grade of 20 was proposed and computation was performed accordingly appendix a for the next diamond sectioned interceptor cum conveyer with a 2 mm wide slit on the top fitted centrally below the first conveyer channel the discharge q2 in m3 sec received intercepted can be computed as 5 q2 a a q1 where a is the cross sectional area of section ab dec of preceding triangular channel fig a and b that is to be intercepted by succeeding interceptor located in an array vertically a is available maximum flow section of the triangular portion of the diamond interceptor abc here uniform velocity through the flow cross section was assumed for discharge q2 m3s 1 depth of flow h2 can be computed using eq 4 further intercepted q3 m3s 1 discharge in the next interceptor cum conveyer can be computed using eq 5 and depth of flow h3 by using eq 4 the solution to these sets of equations was worked out for dimensions for each of the components of the splitter assembly starting stage 1 to stage 3 iteratively to arrive at a discharge rate less than or equal to 10 l h 1 so that the 15 min storage collector at the end would have a maximum of 2 5 l of samples in it the number of interceptors in series to obtain the desired intercepted discharge 10 l h 1 can be altered by changing the width of the interceptor s slit and the number of interceptors proposed to receive runoff directly from the weir appendix a 2 1 4 fourth stage design of clock driven distribution unit after the third stage a sample of size 10 l h 1 received from the diamond section interceptor arrays was finally delivered to a funnel attached to a mechanical clock fig 2 either through the extended length of the last diamond section interceptor or by a circular straight tube joined with the last diamond section interceptor in the case of a circular tube the radius r of the tube is computed using poiseuille s equation for laminar flow to ensure a sufficient dimension for the actual flow 6 r 8 ¬µ l qf œÅ g h1 h2 0 25 where r is the minimum radius of the tube m ¬µ is the viscosity coefficient kg m 1 s 1 l is the length of the tube m qf is final discharge m3s 1 to be taken to funnel œÅ is the specific weight of the fluid kg m 3 and g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 and h1 h2 is the head difference m proposed to be 30 or more gradient i e 30 cm or more for 1 m of maximum length to determine the tube radius the highest value of final discharge 10 l h 1 equivalent to 2 778 10 6 m3 s 1 was considered a lightweight funnel was mounted to a heavy duty mechanical clock an arm tube of 30 cm length was connected radially outwards with a grade 30 from the bottom outlet portion of the funnel fig 2 the radius of this tube was computed using equation 6 to limit the discharge rate to 10 l h 1 this arrangement ensures minimal accumulation of sample volume in the funnel which may lead to spilling due to overflow 2 1 5 fifth stage design of distribution notches and clock calibration the tubular arm connected with the funnel moves circularly and delivers discharge in different notches mounted on a circular frame of 30 cm radius fig 2 ninety six uniform size notches were planned to be installed along the perimeter each to collect discharge for 15 min duration representing 24 h however the clock was set to rotate one revolution in 25 h instead of 24 h and the extra one hour was used to make provision for four extra notches on the circular frame to accommodate an extra hour to avoid any missing events during the runoff event the size of an individual notch depends on the length of the arm tube used and can be computed as the maximum length l of the individual notch along the perimeter 7 l 2 œÄ r 100 where r is the length of the arm tube the continuous revolution of the clock arm results in a differential rate of discharge collection in the beginning as well as at the end of each notch and may induce some error 2 1 6 sixth stage collection setup for time distributed samples each notch on the circular frame is connected to a bottle cylinder through a flexible tube of a diameter large enough to carry a maximum discharge of 10 l h 1 for the head difference of 10 cm for the maximum length of 30 cm all the 100 customized sampling bottles cylinders of the following dimensions are staked in rectangular or circular fashion confined by a wireframe fig 3 the bottle cylinder having inner diameter 80 mm outer diameter 82 mm height 510 mm a cover on the top with an opening to receive the sample and a vent tube or a hole to release air was used considering the effective height of 500 mm the capacity of the bottle cylinder is 2 51 l sufficient enough to store the maximum discharge of 10 l h 1 for 15 min picture of the prototype showing the different component of the new runoff sampler is presented in fig 4 2 2 laboratory evaluation of the sediment sampler 2 2 1 realising representative sediment concentration the laboratory test was carried out using a relatively smaller discharge rate 70 to 100 l h 1 falling over a triangular sectioned interceptor of the sampler a portion of which was finally collected by the sediment sampler target samples with the described principle the sample collected from the un intercepted spilled over of the triangular sectioned interceptor was termed as reference sample three different tests using sediment concentrations of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 each for more than 4 h were conducted in which the uniform input concentration at the prescribed level was attempted through the continuous stirring of the solutions before its introduction to the sampling unit to measure the efficacy of the sampling system under compelling situations where continuous mixing is not possible one stand alone experiment was conducted with input sediment concentration of 4 g l 1 with random intermittent mixing at the input level a stirred 500 ml sub sample was collected from the references as well as target samples corresponding to all 4 experiments the samples were filtered and dried to determine sediment concentration 2 2 2 realizing representative particle size distribution for comparison of the particle size distribution of sediments separate tests of longer duration were conducted to get a minimum sediment sample size 20 g in this case the sediment concentration of 5 g l 1 was used for input target samples were collected in a bucket of 15 l capacity and reference samples from the un intercepted portion were collected in a 50 l storage reservoir samples were filtered and sediments retained on the filter were dried the particle size distribution of sediment was determined using the international pipette method of textural analysis piper 1966 in this method the sampling depths and time were computed for different particle sizes at a constant temperature of 25 c in both cases a performance comparison of characteristics of sampling in realizing a representative concentration and particle size distribution were carried out 2 3 field evaluation three functional prototypes of the sampler were installed two at the research centre vasad gujarat india and one at selaqui research farm of icar indian institute of soil and water conservation dehradun uttarakhand fig s 2 out of the two samplers at research centre vasad one was installed at a standard runoff plot of length 22 2 m at a 2 slope having a width of 1 83 m with a multi slot divisor mechanism to collect runoff samples there were two contiguous tanks joined by a 5 1 multi slot divisor the sediment concentration obtained from the second tank was used as reference samples for comparison for the sediment concentration three samples each of about 500 ml volumes were drawn while thoroughly mixing the content in the tank runoff samples were filtered sediment samples were dried and weighed and average sediment concentrations were computed the sediment concentration in different samples collected using the developed sampler target samples was simply averaged out in absence of the temporal reference data this was required to compare the daily composite reference sample with the averaged target sample another sampler was installed at the outlet of a 0 4 ha natural gully catchment with runoff measurement carried out using a stage level recorder the flow measurement was carried out using a sharp crested v notch for which the sampling method had a minor modification to capture the surface flow at the first stage the rest of the stages remain unaltered and sediment samples were collected by the developed sampler prototype the reference sediment yield syref in t ha 1 was computed using the sediment concentration s and the total runoff volume as 8 syref t ha 1 2 5 10 6 v s whereas v is the volume of runoff in litres l from the 0 4 ha catchment and s is the sediment concentration in g l 1 in the manually collected single runoff sample for the entire event using the grab method the target sediment concentration g l 1 obtained using the sampler was used for computation of the sediment yield t ha 1 using the runoff volume of the corresponding time interval 9 sytarget t ha 1 2 5 10 6 sivi where si is the sediment concentration g l 1 of the ith time interval and vi is the volume l of runoff for the same time interval obtained from the runoff chart of the stage level recorder in this watershed a comparative account of collecting reference samples at a discrete time interval of 5 min manually and sampling for each 15 min time integrated using the developed sampler was prepared table s 1 for the discrete moment sampling at 5 min interval actual sampling at 2 5 min 7 5 min and 12 5 min equation 9 was used for calculating sediment yield for the sediment concentration in the sample collected at 2 5 min 7 5 min and 12 5 min the corresponding runoff amount for 0 5 min 5 10 min and 10 15 min were used respectively for computation of the sediment yield three natural events were chosen having precipitation of 77 2 mm 32 5 mm and 84 2 mm in each of these events a runoff depth of 16 8 mm 8 1 mm and 18 6 mm was produced respectively from the 0 4 ha catchment a total of 8 spells 5 spells and 9 spells of 15 min intervals could be recorded for which reference samples at 5 min intervals and target samples of 15 min were collected the calculation of sediment yield was made using equation 9 as discussed earlier at the selaqui farm temporal component and runoff collection using a sampler are being carried out however the performance evaluation could not be done owing to the non availability of the reference sediment concentration or sediment yield data the sampler is used for receiving runoff samples from the h flume using a centrally placed perpendicularly aligned triangular interceptor at an outer grade of 10 anticipating less amount of runoff only one diamond sectioned interceptor cum channel was used field installation of the runoff samplers having different customization is presented in the supplementary material fig s 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 lab testing and validation of runoff sampler 3 1 1 consistency test in sediment concentration measurement as discussed in preceding sections sediment concentrations of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 with conditions of continuous mixing were introduced to sediment samplers the target samples and reference samples as discussed elsewhere in the manuscript were collected and sediment concentration was measured a comparison of these sample pairs concurrent to their sampling time was plotted and presented in fig 5 a as can be seen the formations of the cluster around the input sediment rates lie within 10 of the error envelope the maximum deviations in sediment concentration of target samples were 0 1 g l 1 0 26 g l 1 and 0 29 g l 1 which correspond to 10 0 1 4 and 6 1 deviation for the input sediment concentration of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 respectively this suggests a close agreement between the measured concentration values from reference and target samples r2 0 996 in a similar framework fig 5b under the limiting condition of intermittent mixing of the input samples input 4 g l 1 both target and reference samples collected were comparable with a high degree of correlation r2 0 983 and also encased in the 10 envelope in this case the maximum deviation in the sediment concentration of the target sample collected through sampler from the reference sample was 0 22 g l 1 which correspondence to a 7 54 deviation this indicated a higher degree of consistency in the target sample in realizing the representative concentration of a larger runoff volume the deviation of more than 20 have been rated acceptable for performance evaluation of runoff samplers sun et al 2014 pathak 1991 3 1 2 consistency test in downsizing the particle size measurement a separate experiment with 5 g l 1 sediment concentration input was carried out for a longer duration to obtain a minimum of 20 g of sediment and two such instances produced comparisons as shown in fig 6 a and 6b as seen both target 15 min and reference samples 5 10 and 15 min conform to a similar pattern of particle size distribution curves in all the cases the deviations from the reference sediment were 2 2 and 2 38 in the first fig 6a and 4 00 and 1 3 in another sediment type fig 6b in the particle size range of 0 002 mm and 0 002 0 02 mm respectively this indicated the sediment sampler effectively partitions representative particle sizes from a larger sediment sample size the particle size measured in all these cases was less than 0 2 mm the very minimum deviation in the particle size distribution of sediment samples from the reference as against the preferential inclusion or exclusion of coarse particles sun et al 2014 thomas and lewis 1995 pathak 1991 indicates the relative advantage of the new device 3 2 field scale evaluation of the sediment sampler to demonstrate discrepancies in measurements of discrete random and coarse resolution daily composite samples a natural watershed and field scale plot having a uniform slope was gauged fig 7 a represents the comparison of the sediment concentration of the reference sample collected from the 24 hrs composited runoff from the runoff tank and target as per its 15 minute schedule sample collected over several events from runoff plots fig 7b represents the comparison of the reference sediment yield from the 0 4 ha natural catchment computed using equation 8 with the sediment yield computed as per equation 9 table s 2 in both cases temporal runoff data generated by the monitoring station using a stage level recorder was used a reasonable linear relationship though exists between these two instances r2 0 798 and 0 699 the reason for gross over and underestimations in the plot scale the sampler underestimates the sediment concentration by almost 26 and for natural watershed overestimates the sediment yield by almost 72 remained incomprehensible and estimation uncertainties remained significant the continuous and finer time resolution measurements reduced uncertainties in measurement and were depicted in fig 8 a where three low to moderate size rainfall events were chosen for the tests with the previously described schedule and sampling strategies of collecting reference and target samples the samples were collected and compared as can be seen the target samples followed the sedimentograph trends in all the events fig 8a the maximum deviations of the target sample sediment concentrations from the reference sediment concentrations were 0 08 g l 1 0 01 g l 1 and 0 37 g l 1 which correspond to a percentage deviation of 8 1 1 7 and 10 0 for runoff event 1 2 and 3 respectively the sediment concentration measurements obtained by the new sampling device were in very close agreement with the reference concentrations fig 8b with a maximum deviation of 10 from the observed discrepancies it was concluded that the prevalent practice of collecting random grab samples was not appropriate the high uncertainties associated with opportunistic sampling and the advantage of scheduled time discrete sampling for accurate characterization of hydrological responses have been reported cassidy and jordan 2011 lessels and bishop 2015 thomas and lewis 1995 3 3 advantage over current practice the sampling device discussed in this manuscript presents a promising alternative to manual runoff sampling the system is reliable and mechanically self sustainable with a minimum requirement of energy and maintenance the importance of high frequency sampling for understanding the hydrological process and monitoring water quality has been highlighted in several studies lessels and bishop 2020 wade et al 2012 burt et al 2011 however the high cost associated with it is a major constrain in large scale adoption wade et al 2012 moreover the new device is reasonably cheap the total cost of fabrication and installation is about 22 000 indian rupees which are approximately us 300 compared to other sophisticated alternatives for time stratified samples the widely used method is to collect the sample at a given time interval using an automatic sampler harmel et al 2006 most of the commonly used automatic samplers are constrained by a limited number typically 24 samples per event the new sampler with the provision of sampling at shorter intervals 15 min has a relative advantage in terms of better accuracy 3 4 limitations the new sampling device needs a minimum 60 cm drop from the weir crest with the provision of making a watertight chamber of about 60 cm depth otherwise a crest fall of 1 2 m is required this device is suitable for suspended sediments preferably for particle size 0 2 mm even though the larger size particle up to 2 mm can enter through the opening therefore this sampling device may not be suitable for the area where sediment yield is associated with heavy overburdens from the practical point of view of assembling the different components a micro watershed or plot of a few hundred square meters to hundreds of hectares can be monitored using this sampling device 3 5 field experience problem and maintenance the sampler was installed in the field for 3 years at research centre vasad 2013 to 2015 and three years 2017 to 2019 at dehradun india the following observations were made regarding cleaning and maintenance yellowing and hardening of the transparent tube used for carrying samples from different notch to sampling bottles at the slope of 20 deposition of sediments was observed in the tube length 1 m used for carrying runoff samples to the clock mounted funnel however this was rectified by increasing the slope to 30 there is a need to adjust the clock arm position after sample collection in case of deviation from the defined position the clock needs periodic maintenance oiling and therefore the provision of a spare clock is necessary since the present experiment aimed to test the functional aspect of the sampler there is a scope of improvement of the workmanship in the final version a brief of the process to initiate a new runoff sampling device for runoff sample collection is mentioned in appendix b 4 conclusions the persistence challenge of collecting depth integrated representative time integrated and stratified samples in a cost effective manner was partially addressed by developing a low cost device for small watersheds using a simple principle of mechanics and hydraulics the new sampling device can be used to develop sedimentographs corresponding to runoff events the principle was meant to measure suspended sediment yield employing a multi stage splitting of the actual sediment volumes through a series of downsizing mechanisms and finally distribute to time stamped storage bottles at a 15 minute temporal resolution the mathematical principles of designing various components were discussed and a prototype of the sediment sampler with its peripheral accessories was developed the prototype endured rigorous laboratory and field studies to validate its capability to effectively sample representative quantity from a larger volume of runoff the cost of the equipment is approximately us 300 inr 22 000 and is capable of enduring comparable performance metrics against the other high cost alternatives to make it more adaptable for large scale monitoring of remote micro watersheds the scope of integration of flow depth turbidity and other ion sensors need to be explored the integration of field based sensors will help generate data at shorter intervals highly desired for a better understanding of the hydrological process land degradation assessment and planning conservation measures credit authorship

5020,monitoring sediment yield is necessary for assessing erosion induced land degradation and used for planning conservation measures collecting time and space integrated as well as time distributed runoff samples cost effectively is still a challenge for hydrologists civil engineers soil scientists and environmentalists a low cost automatic runoff sampler for quantifying suspended sediment using simple mechanical and hydraulic principles was designed and a prototype developed the procedure of runoff sampling involves the interception of a defined portion of the runoff exiting the crest of a gauging structure through the triangular sectioned interceptors the intercepted volume was reduced to a manageable quantity by multiple splitting using a series of diamond sectioned interceptors after the collection of a representative volume the sample was delivered to a time stamped storage system through a clock driven arm tube the mathematical design principles at each stage defined the hydraulic and mechanical dimensions of the components which were assembled to develop the complete prototype furthermore field scale modifications to accommodate any special situations and conditions were also presented the prototype of the sampling device endured rigorous laboratory scale validation tests and was found to perform reasonably well the performance of the new sampling device was evaluated against the fine resolution manual discrete sampling the temporal resolution of 15 min adopted by the sampler was found reasonably comparable to further finer resolution options with discrepancies contained within a 10 error envelope r2 0 983 the equipment was validated in field scale experiments both in plot and natural watershed and performance metrics were found to be acceptable r2 0 78 to 0 99 moreover low cost and easy maintenance requirements indicate the high potential and field applicability of this new device keywords suspended sediment runoff sampling device flow weighted average interceptor time distributed sampling sample representativeness 1 introduction land degradation through water erosion is a global phenomenon so severe worldwide that it threatens our agricultural base about 80 of the world s agricultural soils are affected by erosion thompson 1995 whereas approximately 40 of the world s agricultural land is seriously degraded ian 2007 soil erosion from the world s terrestrial ecosystem is estimated to be 75 billion tonnes pimentel and kounang 1998 in india around126 million hectares of area are affected by various degrees of water erosion out of which 82 6 million hectares are considered degraded maji et al 2010 monitoring soil loss and sediment yield is imperative to plan conservation measures for sustainable land resource management several methods for estimating sediment production rates exist including a periodic assessment of micro topographic change change in gully geometries and measuring sediment concentration in runoff hickok and ree 1967 hudson 1993 sediment yield is typically quantified using direct and indirect methods the direct methods are more accurate though require heavy running cost and manpower whereas indirect methods are relatively cheaper in operations but require heavy capital investment and need of managing complexity to minimize estimation error miyamoto et al 1992 for example the radioisotope methods particularly the 137cs based are used in several studies agudo 1998 bajracharya et al 1998 buj√°n et al 2003 andrello et al 2004 but require sophisticated equipment and other costly logistics for measuring sediment concentration in a stream various automatic samplers have been developed but their high cost cumbersome maintenance and poor temporal resolution are some of the reasons behind their limited use in developing and less developed world sun et al 2014 roseen et al 2011 pint milk bottle trap sampler indiana sampler floating cork type sampler are some of the popular samplers that seldom collect depth integrated samples wang et al 2011 fao 1997 in many in stream runoff samplers only rising stage sediment samples are collected in bottles that do not represent the falling stage nieminen 2000 the common practice is to collect discrete samples at an arbitrary time of the runoff event at a weir or flume outlet broad crested rectangular weir or v notch with high degrees of sampling error brown et al 1970 usda 1979 allen 1981 the nappe has been considered as the better place for runoff sampling hudson 1993 however the samples collected from this area by the moment grab method are neither time integrated nor composite lessels and bishop 2020 suttles et al 2003 wang et al 2011 the poor sampling method is therefore one of the major reasons why interpretations of sediment data are highly uncertain when compared to runoff data lately land degradation assessment initiatives by intergovernmental panels suggested a reduction in spatial predictive uncertainty in water induced erosion estimates by calibrating it with the measurement of soil loss sediment loads at various landscape scales in the indian context where most of the watershed projects are implemented by government and non government agencies the unit for conservation planning remains typically small watersheds of size 500 to 1000 ha samra 2008 pathak 1991 for their operational conveniences these are the most neglected landscapes in terms of their monitoring for sediment loading due to the lack of cost effective and operationally easy alternatives for sediment sampling employing human labor at each of these gauging stations is not practical due to its exorbitant cost the remoteness of the location and continuity issues over day and night the ideal approach is to collect total runoff from the watershed and measure sediment but it needs huge tanks to be created in this method a large number of tanks occupying huge installation space along the flow path are required to obtain temporal data for sedimentograph for very small watersheds or runoff plots it can be created with considerable expenses but the requirement of manpower or alternate arrangements for diverting runoff among the tanks at a definite time post event cleaning and emptying renders it impractical and cost prohibitive even in the case of measurements from the field plots there are various sources of variations fayos et al 2006 the moving long and wide conveyor belt with its arrays of similar sized slots for collection of samples from the total discharge has been rated ideal replogle 2009 but seems to be a distant reality because of high energy cost maintenance and space requirement multi slot divisors extensively and widely used in plot scale experiments collect composite samples which are not time distributed there is a need for careful calibration proper maintenance and frequent cleaning as even minor changes in the surface condition may add an unaccounted error in sediment yield data geib 1933 sheridan et al 1996 bonilla et al 2006 coshocton wheel sampler with h flume is also commonly used sampling equipment in soil erosion studies in small plots reploge and el swaify 1985 it works with reasonable accuracy for an area less than 0 4 ha when carefully installed and commissioned however pro rata sampling errors in the quantum of samples collected and particle size distribution were also observed as compared to the original flow wang et al 1971 in a normal setting the sediment samples still fall short of an expectation to obtain a sedimentograph sun et al 2014 developed an alternative device for simultaneous measurement of runoff and sediment load from a field plot ranging from 0 005 to 0 1 ha in this device a storage tank of 15 cm depth and 20 cm diameter placed over a base frame has a splitter along with the upper rim this arrangement of storage before the splitting of the rising limb may facilitate sedimentation in the tank altering the true sediment concentration of runoff the last couple of decades witnessed colossal development efforts in automatic runoff sampling equipment including entry of the electronics modules such as microprocessors newburn 1988 pathak 1991 pathak and sudi 2004 most of them collect a pre set time discrete sediment sample from a point location or composite from multiple locations which does not realize the spatial and temporal integration of the sample roseen et al 2011 coarser time resolutions often do not concur with the event extremities that carry the heavy sediment concentration further complex gadget leads to loss of data due to failure in electronic components energy uncertainties cumbersome and higher cost of maintenance kohonen 1985 subject to these contentious issues this manuscript is aimed to deliver a concept leading to a cost effective design of a sediment sampling device that i collects a reasonably acceptable representative sample which is both space and time integrated ii employs a hierarchical sample splitting mechanism to divert sample to a clock driven distribution system at a 15 min time interval the article also explains the mathematical principle of obtaining a representative sample post a hierarchical sample splitting mechanism and complete fabrication details of the functional prototype that endured rigorous lab testing and field evaluations 2 materials and methods the process descriptions leading to the development of a prototype of sediment sampler include the collection of representative samples reducing the 15 minute cumulative volume to a size that does not exceed the volume of the storage bottles collecting the time distributed samples for storage and laboratory analysis the design is a preferable candidate for a runoff gauging structure which is of rectangular size rectangular weir either sharp or broad crested delivering runoff discharge uniformly over its crest length the geometry of the splitter can be modified to accommodate other types of weirs as well and can be designed on a case to case basis 2 1 sample apportioning 2 1 1 first stage crest to triangular interceptors obtaining an integrated representative sample of an event needs a mechanism that can draw a sample which inherits the sediment concentration of the runoff exiting the weir and reduces the volume of the sample to a manageable size the principle was explained by replogle 2009 where it was postulated that if the runoff samples were intercepted by a mechanism equispaced over the entire crest length there was a likely occurrence that each of them would receive an amount having a similar sample characteristic however the moment it forms a nappe beyond the crest the effect of gravity would result in a concentration gradient that is not uniform vertically therefore it was assumed that a segment length of 30 40 cm for small and 1 5 m for medium size length 5 10 m crest lengths may be appropriate for runoff sample interception the sample just exiting at the surface of the weir headwall was collected in triangular shaped interceptors with a 2 mm slit on the top and side expanding downward at 30 up to 10 cm that would collect the entire vertical section of the flow with the width equivalent to the width of the slits usda 1979 fig 1 a the top slit opening of 2 mm was provided to allow a maximum particle size in the suspended sediments the maximum size of suspended sediment in the nappe portion of the weir was found to be 0 2 mm the typical section of the interceptor fig s 1 was made to dissipate the cantilever load against the wall ensuring forward flow and no flow accumulation barnes and frevert 1954 barnes and johnson 1956 hudson 1993 the possibility of sediment entry to an opening is least affected if the opening size is 10 times or more than the size of the particle the triangular sectioned interceptors were permanently fixed to the crest section of the weir aligned perpendicularly to the crest the channels were having a horizontal outward grade of 10 fig 1b a mathematical description of the sampling at this stage can be given as follows the intercepted discharge q1 m3s 1 can be approximated by considering the width of the slit opening and the number of slots 1 q1 0 002n l q where n is the number of slotted channels installed l is the length of the weir in meter and q is the discharge through rectangular weir m3s 1 which is approximated by 2 q c l h1 5 where c is the weir coefficient l is the length of the crest m and h is the head of flow m on the weir 2 1 2 second stage triangular interceptors to inverted triangle channel the discharge intercepted in the first step through the triangular interceptors was channeled to another cross aligned channel having an inverted triangular section that received uniform discharge rates along its length from each of the triangular interceptors due to a defined grade in each interceptor as well as in the channel the flow remains supercritical thus the height of flow in the triangular conveyance is assumed to be less than or equal to the height of the same discharge in ideal conditions for the weir of the same angle the maximum height of flow in the inverted triangular channel fig 1b is approximated using the following formula of discharge usbr 1997 3 q1 a r2 3 s1 2 Œ∑ where q1 is discharge m3s 1 in the inverted triangular section channel r is the hydraulic radius defined as the ratio of flow cross section a expressed as m2 to the wetted perimeter p expressed as m s is the slope of the channel fraction Œ∑ is manning s roughness coefficient two types of triangular channels i e 90 and 120 section were considered simplifying and computing the coefficient for 90 and 120 section triangular channel table 1 equation 3 can be rearranged in terms of the height of flow h1 m and expressed as 4 h1 k q1 3 8 computation is made for the galvanized iron gi sheet Œ∑ 0 012 at a grade of 10 s 0 1 for 90 fig a in table 1 as well as 120 fig b in table 1 triangular channel computed k coefficient of discharge is 0 38026 and 0 16874 respectively table 1 2 1 3 third stage inverted triangular channel to diamond section the discharge was reduced to a controlled volume by splitting through a series of diamond section interceptors fig 1b and 1c each with a 2 mm slit at the top installed at 20 grade or more to the receiver channel these diamond sectioned interceptors were arranged in a vertical array to receive the discharge from the preceding interceptor which was further transferred to the succeeding interceptor while passing through the channel section of the interceptor invariably the flow in the interceptor was governed by the flow in an inverted triangular channel section as discussed in the preceding section fig 1b and c the diamond section dimensions were thus telescopically reduced following the calculations made in equations 1 through 4 the rectangular section of this conveyance barnes and frevert 1954 barnes and johnson 1956 was considered a better option for flow weighted interception if the sample size is large for low volume flow the triangular section is more sensitive to the head of flow and can deliver a more flow column to the next slit when compared to a rectangular channel a drop at every interception a grade of 20 or more small flow length 10 15 cm and higher grade for longer and or smaller flow ensures mixing and low possibility of sedimentation of the suspended sediment size 0 2 mm however the possibility of intercepting the higher proportion of coarse particles cannot be ruled out because of repeated interception from the central section of the flow and is subjected to scrutiny considering the easy availability of diamond section square section with slit opening along an edge pipe that can be made for the dual purpose of interception and conveyance computation is done mainly for 90 notch the first triangular channel is expected to handle relatively higher discharge therefore the grade of 10 was enough to minimize deposition as the discharge received in the successive interceptors are low a grade of 20 was proposed and computation was performed accordingly appendix a for the next diamond sectioned interceptor cum conveyer with a 2 mm wide slit on the top fitted centrally below the first conveyer channel the discharge q2 in m3 sec received intercepted can be computed as 5 q2 a a q1 where a is the cross sectional area of section ab dec of preceding triangular channel fig a and b that is to be intercepted by succeeding interceptor located in an array vertically a is available maximum flow section of the triangular portion of the diamond interceptor abc here uniform velocity through the flow cross section was assumed for discharge q2 m3s 1 depth of flow h2 can be computed using eq 4 further intercepted q3 m3s 1 discharge in the next interceptor cum conveyer can be computed using eq 5 and depth of flow h3 by using eq 4 the solution to these sets of equations was worked out for dimensions for each of the components of the splitter assembly starting stage 1 to stage 3 iteratively to arrive at a discharge rate less than or equal to 10 l h 1 so that the 15 min storage collector at the end would have a maximum of 2 5 l of samples in it the number of interceptors in series to obtain the desired intercepted discharge 10 l h 1 can be altered by changing the width of the interceptor s slit and the number of interceptors proposed to receive runoff directly from the weir appendix a 2 1 4 fourth stage design of clock driven distribution unit after the third stage a sample of size 10 l h 1 received from the diamond section interceptor arrays was finally delivered to a funnel attached to a mechanical clock fig 2 either through the extended length of the last diamond section interceptor or by a circular straight tube joined with the last diamond section interceptor in the case of a circular tube the radius r of the tube is computed using poiseuille s equation for laminar flow to ensure a sufficient dimension for the actual flow 6 r 8 ¬µ l qf œÅ g h1 h2 0 25 where r is the minimum radius of the tube m ¬µ is the viscosity coefficient kg m 1 s 1 l is the length of the tube m qf is final discharge m3s 1 to be taken to funnel œÅ is the specific weight of the fluid kg m 3 and g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 and h1 h2 is the head difference m proposed to be 30 or more gradient i e 30 cm or more for 1 m of maximum length to determine the tube radius the highest value of final discharge 10 l h 1 equivalent to 2 778 10 6 m3 s 1 was considered a lightweight funnel was mounted to a heavy duty mechanical clock an arm tube of 30 cm length was connected radially outwards with a grade 30 from the bottom outlet portion of the funnel fig 2 the radius of this tube was computed using equation 6 to limit the discharge rate to 10 l h 1 this arrangement ensures minimal accumulation of sample volume in the funnel which may lead to spilling due to overflow 2 1 5 fifth stage design of distribution notches and clock calibration the tubular arm connected with the funnel moves circularly and delivers discharge in different notches mounted on a circular frame of 30 cm radius fig 2 ninety six uniform size notches were planned to be installed along the perimeter each to collect discharge for 15 min duration representing 24 h however the clock was set to rotate one revolution in 25 h instead of 24 h and the extra one hour was used to make provision for four extra notches on the circular frame to accommodate an extra hour to avoid any missing events during the runoff event the size of an individual notch depends on the length of the arm tube used and can be computed as the maximum length l of the individual notch along the perimeter 7 l 2 œÄ r 100 where r is the length of the arm tube the continuous revolution of the clock arm results in a differential rate of discharge collection in the beginning as well as at the end of each notch and may induce some error 2 1 6 sixth stage collection setup for time distributed samples each notch on the circular frame is connected to a bottle cylinder through a flexible tube of a diameter large enough to carry a maximum discharge of 10 l h 1 for the head difference of 10 cm for the maximum length of 30 cm all the 100 customized sampling bottles cylinders of the following dimensions are staked in rectangular or circular fashion confined by a wireframe fig 3 the bottle cylinder having inner diameter 80 mm outer diameter 82 mm height 510 mm a cover on the top with an opening to receive the sample and a vent tube or a hole to release air was used considering the effective height of 500 mm the capacity of the bottle cylinder is 2 51 l sufficient enough to store the maximum discharge of 10 l h 1 for 15 min picture of the prototype showing the different component of the new runoff sampler is presented in fig 4 2 2 laboratory evaluation of the sediment sampler 2 2 1 realising representative sediment concentration the laboratory test was carried out using a relatively smaller discharge rate 70 to 100 l h 1 falling over a triangular sectioned interceptor of the sampler a portion of which was finally collected by the sediment sampler target samples with the described principle the sample collected from the un intercepted spilled over of the triangular sectioned interceptor was termed as reference sample three different tests using sediment concentrations of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 each for more than 4 h were conducted in which the uniform input concentration at the prescribed level was attempted through the continuous stirring of the solutions before its introduction to the sampling unit to measure the efficacy of the sampling system under compelling situations where continuous mixing is not possible one stand alone experiment was conducted with input sediment concentration of 4 g l 1 with random intermittent mixing at the input level a stirred 500 ml sub sample was collected from the references as well as target samples corresponding to all 4 experiments the samples were filtered and dried to determine sediment concentration 2 2 2 realizing representative particle size distribution for comparison of the particle size distribution of sediments separate tests of longer duration were conducted to get a minimum sediment sample size 20 g in this case the sediment concentration of 5 g l 1 was used for input target samples were collected in a bucket of 15 l capacity and reference samples from the un intercepted portion were collected in a 50 l storage reservoir samples were filtered and sediments retained on the filter were dried the particle size distribution of sediment was determined using the international pipette method of textural analysis piper 1966 in this method the sampling depths and time were computed for different particle sizes at a constant temperature of 25 c in both cases a performance comparison of characteristics of sampling in realizing a representative concentration and particle size distribution were carried out 2 3 field evaluation three functional prototypes of the sampler were installed two at the research centre vasad gujarat india and one at selaqui research farm of icar indian institute of soil and water conservation dehradun uttarakhand fig s 2 out of the two samplers at research centre vasad one was installed at a standard runoff plot of length 22 2 m at a 2 slope having a width of 1 83 m with a multi slot divisor mechanism to collect runoff samples there were two contiguous tanks joined by a 5 1 multi slot divisor the sediment concentration obtained from the second tank was used as reference samples for comparison for the sediment concentration three samples each of about 500 ml volumes were drawn while thoroughly mixing the content in the tank runoff samples were filtered sediment samples were dried and weighed and average sediment concentrations were computed the sediment concentration in different samples collected using the developed sampler target samples was simply averaged out in absence of the temporal reference data this was required to compare the daily composite reference sample with the averaged target sample another sampler was installed at the outlet of a 0 4 ha natural gully catchment with runoff measurement carried out using a stage level recorder the flow measurement was carried out using a sharp crested v notch for which the sampling method had a minor modification to capture the surface flow at the first stage the rest of the stages remain unaltered and sediment samples were collected by the developed sampler prototype the reference sediment yield syref in t ha 1 was computed using the sediment concentration s and the total runoff volume as 8 syref t ha 1 2 5 10 6 v s whereas v is the volume of runoff in litres l from the 0 4 ha catchment and s is the sediment concentration in g l 1 in the manually collected single runoff sample for the entire event using the grab method the target sediment concentration g l 1 obtained using the sampler was used for computation of the sediment yield t ha 1 using the runoff volume of the corresponding time interval 9 sytarget t ha 1 2 5 10 6 sivi where si is the sediment concentration g l 1 of the ith time interval and vi is the volume l of runoff for the same time interval obtained from the runoff chart of the stage level recorder in this watershed a comparative account of collecting reference samples at a discrete time interval of 5 min manually and sampling for each 15 min time integrated using the developed sampler was prepared table s 1 for the discrete moment sampling at 5 min interval actual sampling at 2 5 min 7 5 min and 12 5 min equation 9 was used for calculating sediment yield for the sediment concentration in the sample collected at 2 5 min 7 5 min and 12 5 min the corresponding runoff amount for 0 5 min 5 10 min and 10 15 min were used respectively for computation of the sediment yield three natural events were chosen having precipitation of 77 2 mm 32 5 mm and 84 2 mm in each of these events a runoff depth of 16 8 mm 8 1 mm and 18 6 mm was produced respectively from the 0 4 ha catchment a total of 8 spells 5 spells and 9 spells of 15 min intervals could be recorded for which reference samples at 5 min intervals and target samples of 15 min were collected the calculation of sediment yield was made using equation 9 as discussed earlier at the selaqui farm temporal component and runoff collection using a sampler are being carried out however the performance evaluation could not be done owing to the non availability of the reference sediment concentration or sediment yield data the sampler is used for receiving runoff samples from the h flume using a centrally placed perpendicularly aligned triangular interceptor at an outer grade of 10 anticipating less amount of runoff only one diamond sectioned interceptor cum channel was used field installation of the runoff samplers having different customization is presented in the supplementary material fig s 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 lab testing and validation of runoff sampler 3 1 1 consistency test in sediment concentration measurement as discussed in preceding sections sediment concentrations of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 with conditions of continuous mixing were introduced to sediment samplers the target samples and reference samples as discussed elsewhere in the manuscript were collected and sediment concentration was measured a comparison of these sample pairs concurrent to their sampling time was plotted and presented in fig 5 a as can be seen the formations of the cluster around the input sediment rates lie within 10 of the error envelope the maximum deviations in sediment concentration of target samples were 0 1 g l 1 0 26 g l 1 and 0 29 g l 1 which correspond to 10 0 1 4 and 6 1 deviation for the input sediment concentration of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 respectively this suggests a close agreement between the measured concentration values from reference and target samples r2 0 996 in a similar framework fig 5b under the limiting condition of intermittent mixing of the input samples input 4 g l 1 both target and reference samples collected were comparable with a high degree of correlation r2 0 983 and also encased in the 10 envelope in this case the maximum deviation in the sediment concentration of the target sample collected through sampler from the reference sample was 0 22 g l 1 which correspondence to a 7 54 deviation this indicated a higher degree of consistency in the target sample in realizing the representative concentration of a larger runoff volume the deviation of more than 20 have been rated acceptable for performance evaluation of runoff samplers sun et al 2014 pathak 1991 3 1 2 consistency test in downsizing the particle size measurement a separate experiment with 5 g l 1 sediment concentration input was carried out for a longer duration to obtain a minimum of 20 g of sediment and two such instances produced comparisons as shown in fig 6 a and 6b as seen both target 15 min and reference samples 5 10 and 15 min conform to a similar pattern of particle size distribution curves in all the cases the deviations from the reference sediment were 2 2 and 2 38 in the first fig 6a and 4 00 and 1 3 in another sediment type fig 6b in the particle size range of 0 002 mm and 0 002 0 02 mm respectively this indicated the sediment sampler effectively partitions representative particle sizes from a larger sediment sample size the particle size measured in all these cases was less than 0 2 mm the very minimum deviation in the particle size distribution of sediment samples from the reference as against the preferential inclusion or exclusion of coarse particles sun et al 2014 thomas and lewis 1995 pathak 1991 indicates the relative advantage of the new device 3 2 field scale evaluation of the sediment sampler to demonstrate discrepancies in measurements of discrete random and coarse resolution daily composite samples a natural watershed and field scale plot having a uniform slope was gauged fig 7 a represents the comparison of the sediment concentration of the reference sample collected from the 24 hrs composited runoff from the runoff tank and target as per its 15 minute schedule sample collected over several events from runoff plots fig 7b represents the comparison of the reference sediment yield from the 0 4 ha natural catchment computed using equation 8 with the sediment yield computed as per equation 9 table s 2 in both cases temporal runoff data generated by the monitoring station using a stage level recorder was used a reasonable linear relationship though exists between these two instances r2 0 798 and 0 699 the reason for gross over and underestimations in the plot scale the sampler underestimates the sediment concentration by almost 26 and for natural watershed overestimates the sediment yield by almost 72 remained incomprehensible and estimation uncertainties remained significant the continuous and finer time resolution measurements reduced uncertainties in measurement and were depicted in fig 8 a where three low to moderate size rainfall events were chosen for the tests with the previously described schedule and sampling strategies of collecting reference and target samples the samples were collected and compared as can be seen the target samples followed the sedimentograph trends in all the events fig 8a the maximum deviations of the target sample sediment concentrations from the reference sediment concentrations were 0 08 g l 1 0 01 g l 1 and 0 37 g l 1 which correspond to a percentage deviation of 8 1 1 7 and 10 0 for runoff event 1 2 and 3 respectively the sediment concentration measurements obtained by the new sampling device were in very close agreement with the reference concentrations fig 8b with a maximum deviation of 10 from the observed discrepancies it was concluded that the prevalent practice of collecting random grab samples was not appropriate the high uncertainties associated with opportunistic sampling and the advantage of scheduled time discrete sampling for accurate characterization of hydrological responses have been reported cassidy and jordan 2011 lessels and bishop 2015 thomas and lewis 1995 3 3 advantage over current practice the sampling device discussed in this manuscript presents a promising alternative to manual runoff sampling the system is reliable and mechanically self sustainable with a minimum requirement of energy and maintenance the importance of high frequency sampling for understanding the hydrological process and monitoring water quality has been highlighted in several studies lessels and bishop 2020 wade et al 2012 burt et al 2011 however the high cost associated with it is a major constrain in large scale adoption wade et al 2012 moreover the new device is reasonably cheap the total cost of fabrication and installation is about 22 000 indian rupees which are approximately us 300 compared to other sophisticated alternatives for time stratified samples the widely used method is to collect the sample at a given time interval using an automatic sampler harmel et al 2006 most of the commonly used automatic samplers are constrained by a limited number typically 24 samples per event the new sampler with the provision of sampling at shorter intervals 15 min has a relative advantage in terms of better accuracy 3 4 limitations the new sampling device needs a minimum 60 cm drop from the weir crest with the provision of making a watertight chamber of about 60 cm depth otherwise a crest fall of 1 2 m is required this device is suitable for suspended sediments preferably for particle size 0 2 mm even though the larger size particle up to 2 mm can enter through the opening therefore this sampling device may not be suitable for the area where sediment yield is associated with heavy overburdens from the practical point of view of assembling the different components a micro watershed or plot of a few hundred square meters to hundreds of hectares can be monitored using this sampling device 3 5 field experience problem and maintenance the sampler was installed in the field for 3 years at research centre vasad 2013 to 2015 and three years 2017 to 2019 at dehradun india the following observations were made regarding cleaning and maintenance yellowing and hardening of the transparent tube used for carrying samples from different notch to sampling bottles at the slope of 20 deposition of sediments was observed in the tube length 1 m used for carrying runoff samples to the clock mounted funnel however this was rectified by increasing the slope to 30 there is a need to adjust the clock arm position after sample collection in case of deviation from the defined position the clock needs periodic maintenance oiling and therefore the provision of a spare clock is necessary since the present experiment aimed to test the functional aspect of the sampler there is a scope of improvement of the workmanship in the final version a brief of the process to initiate a new runoff sampling device for runoff sample collection is mentioned in appendix b 4 conclusions the persistence challenge of collecting depth integrated representative time integrated and stratified samples in a cost effective manner was partially addressed by developing a low cost device for small watersheds using a simple principle of mechanics and hydraulics the new sampling device can be used to develop sedimentographs corresponding to runoff events the principle was meant to measure suspended sediment yield employing a multi stage splitting of the actual sediment volumes through a series of downsizing mechanisms and finally distribute to time stamped storage bottles at a 15 minute temporal resolution the mathematical principles of designing various components were discussed and a prototype of the sediment sampler with its peripheral accessories was developed the prototype endured rigorous laboratory and field studies to validate its capability to effectively sample representative quantity from a larger volume of runoff the cost of the equipment is approximately us 300 inr 22 000 and is capable of enduring comparable performance metrics against the other high cost alternatives to make it more adaptable for large scale monitoring of remote micro watersheds the scope of integration of flow depth turbidity and other ion sensors need to be explored the integration of field based sensors will help generate data at shorter intervals highly desired for a better understanding of the hydrological process land degradation assessment and planning conservation measures credit authorship

5021,specific storage a basic hydraulic property of an aquifer is required for transient groundwater studies previous investigations have shown that specific storage decreases with depth here we collected field specific storage depth data from the literature and proposed an empirical model that describes the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth in the earth s crust the results show that the model agrees well with the field specific storage depth data there are three parameters in the proposed model which is flexible in fitting specific storage depth data the model also yields a finite value at the ground surface and a reasonable decay rate with depth this is the first model describing the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth the model is simple and can readily be applied to transient numerical models of groundwater flow and solute transport in porous media keywords specific storage aquifer groundwater hydraulic property numerical modeling 1 introduction specific storage is a fundamental hydraulic property of an aquifer that is needed in transient numerical models of flow and solute transport and is vital for groundwater storage estimations and for the management and evaluation of groundwater resources alley et al 2002 folnagy et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 richey et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the specific storage of an aquifer decreases with depth beavan et al 1991 pope and burbey 2004 contoux et al 2013 paradis and lefebvre 2013 according to an analysis of the earth s tides beavan et al 1991 found that specific storage values at shallow depths are greater than those at great depths based on several specific data points collected from the literature contoux et al 2013 also showed that the specific storage decreases with depth accurately describing the variation in specific storage with depth is vital for obtaining reliable results from flow and solute transport models especially for transient regional groundwater flow models at great depths in particular a specific storage depth model is needed to describe the decrease in specific storage with depth within the earth s crust specific storage and hydraulic conductivity are the two fundamental hydraulic parameters of an aquifer many studies have been performed on the changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth different kinds of empirical permeability depth models have been developed such as exponential models e g louis 1974 saar and manga 2004 jiang et al 2009 and power law models e g bredehoeft et al 1992 manning and ingebritsen 1999 ingebritsen and manning 2010 recently kuang and jiao 2014 proposed a permeability depth model that provides a reasonable decay rate with depth and can be used to describe the permeability depth relationship for the entire earth s crust in contrast there is no model that describes the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth the aim of this paper is to propose an empirical specific storage depth model to calculate the specific storage value at any depth in the earth s crust the proposed model is compared with field specific storage data collected from the literature and is used to describe the decay of specific storage with depth within the earth s continental curst this is the first study to propose a model that describes the decrease in specific storage with depth 2 theory specific storage s s is defined as the volume of water that is released from or taken into a unit volume of aquifer per unit change in the hydraulic head and can be generally expressed as jacob 1940 hantush 1964 bear 1979 freeze and cherry 1979 green and wang 1990 1 s s œÅ w g Œ± n Œ≤ w where œÅ w is the water density Œ± is the aquifer compressibility Œ≤ w is the water compressibility n is the porosity of the aquifer and g is the gravitational acceleration for a unit volume of aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head specific storage involves the expansion of water and compaction of the aquifer skeleton e g jacob 1940 hantush 1964 freeze and cherry 1979 the porosity n of an aquifer decreases with depth e g athy 1930 rubey and hubbert 1959 ramm and bj√∏rlykke 1994 chen et al 2020 the compressibility of water Œ≤ w has generally been taken to be a constant freeze and cherry 1979 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 igarashi and wakita 1991 fetter 2001 saar and manga 2004 lai et al 2013 the aquifer compressibility Œ± also decreases with depth due to the increase in effective stress with depth where the effective stress originates from the weight of the overlying rock and water e g freeze and cherry 1979 according to eq 1 specific storage s s also decreases with depth similarly the available field data of s s in the literature also show a general decreasing trend with depth fig 1 here an empirical model is proposed to describe the decrease in s s with depth in the earth s crust the proposed model can be expressed as 2 log s s log s s r log s s 0 log s s r 1 z Œª where s s 0 is the specific storage at the ground surface m 1 s sr is the residual specific storage m 1 Œª is the decay index dimensionless and z is the depth below the ground surface km as the decay index Œª is greater than zero the s s value calculated by eq 2 decreases as depth z increases the specific storage provided by eq 2 at the ground surface is s s 0 and the curve calculated by eq 2 decreases from the ground surface with s s s s 0 the decay rate given by eq 2 is also reasonable equation 2 shows that the model approaches a smaller value of s sr at very great depths there are three parameters in eq 2 namely s s 0 s sr and Œª the values of these parameters can be determined by fitting eq 2 to field specific storage data 3 materials and methods field specific storage data were collected from the literature to evaluate the proposed specific storage depth model the specific storage values of unconfined confined and leaky aquifers obtained by different field methods were collected from the literature five main kinds of field methods are employed to estimate the specific storage values of aquifers pumping test analysis slug test analysis seismic wave analysis analyses of earth tides and atmospheric loading and sea tide analysis details on the specific storage values and the corresponding depth ranges are provided in table 1 the number of data points from each study is also given in table 1 the collected specific storage data were grouped into two categories rocks and unconsolidated deposits freeze and cherry 1979 the types of rock aquifer materials widely vary from basalt to shale unconsolidated deposits also present very different soil textures ranging from gravel to clayey sand the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares method was used to fit eq 2 to the collected

data from both unconsolidated deposits and rocks are included in this figure there is no significant difference between the s s values of unconsolidated deposits and those of rocks all the collected s s data are from formations shallower than 4 km below the ground surface most of the s s data points are from formations shallower than 1 km especially those from unconsolidated deposits among the total 125 data points 70 data points are from depths 100 m 111 data points are from depths 500 m and 120 data points are from depths 1 km only the data points with depths 1 km were included in fig 1 the standard deviation of the s s data is 1 13 10 4 although the data points are relatively scattered a general decreasing trend can be seen the proposed model effectively describes the decay of s s with depth both the s s data and the proposed model do not show significant decrease with depth when depth is greater than approximately 0 4 km the fitted parameter values provided in table 2 show that for the earth s upper continental crust with depth 1 km s s 0 1 31 10 4 m 1 and s sr 1 40 10 6 m 1 the fitted s s 0 and s sr are empirical values which may change when more data points become available especially field s s values from great depths 4 2 unconsolidated deposits a comparison between the measured and calculated specific storage data for unconsolidated deposits is shown in fig 2

illustrate the applicability of the proposed model to specific rock types the four materials are sand sand and gravel fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks and sandstone fig 3 the first two materials are unconsolidated deposits and the other two materials are rocks the parameters for earth s crust 1 km in table 2 were used to calculate the curves for sand the specific storage data points are relatively scattered but eq 2 gives a reasonable fit to the field s s values fig 3a for sand and gravel the collected data points clearly show decreasing specific storage values with depth and eq 2 is in good agreement with the measured data fig 3b for fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks the field s s values also clearly show a decreasing trend with depth and eq 2 fits the data well fig 3c for sandstone a good fit is also obtained fig 3d due to the scattering of the data points it is difficult to determine whether the model underestimates the data points with depths between 0 1 and 0 3 km for sand more data points with depths in this range are needed to validate the performance of the model although the lithology may have significant effects on s s fig 3 shows that the parameters can be used to describe the specific storage depth relationships for the four types of aquifer materials 4 4 earth s crust with great depths fig 4 shows a comparison between the specific storage values calculated by the proposed model and the field specific storage data for earth s crust with great depths most of the data points are from depths 1 km there are only 5 data points with depths

the depth range of 0 4 km the collected specific storage values decrease with depth the proposed model was fitted to the data separately in the curve fitting process greater weight one hundred times higher than that of the other data points was assigned to the two data points with depths greater than 3 km the fitted values provided in table 2 show that for the earth s upper continental crust with all the data included s s 0 4 09 10 5 m 1 and s sr 1 58 10 8 m 1 the fitted parameters should be used with caution because there are limited data with depths greater than 1 km as the depths of all the specific storage data are shallower than 4 km the parameters listed in table 2 may change if more s s data with great depths are available however obtaining specific storage data at depths greater than 4 km below the ground surface is very difficult as very deep drill boreholes are needed to obtain appropriate in situ measurements of s s 4 5 sensitivity analysis the curve calculated by the proposed model is sensitive to the three parameters fig 5 the parameters for the earth s crust 1 km in table 2 were used as the base case the parameter s s 0 determines the point at which the curve starts to decay fig 5a shows the curves calculated with different s s 0 values the s s 0 values were set to be one order of magnitude different from each other although the curves start at different s s 0 values they tend to converge at great depth fig 5b shows that the parameter s sr also significantly affects the curves the curve calculated by the model approaches s sr at very great depths the values of the parameter s sr were similarly set to be one order of magnitude different from each other therefore the curves at very great depths will also vary by one order of magnitude the decay index Œª determines the rate of decrease in the specific storage and greater Œª values correlate with faster rates of decrease fig 5c the greater the Œª value is the faster the specific storage decreases the calculated specific storage quickly decreases to s sr when Œª is relatively large when Œª equals 5 the calculated specific storage decreases to nearly s sr at approximately 1 km depth 4

5021,specific storage a basic hydraulic property of an aquifer is required for transient groundwater studies previous investigations have shown that specific storage decreases with depth here we collected field specific storage depth data from the literature and proposed an empirical model that describes the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth in the earth s crust the results show that the model agrees well with the field specific storage depth data there are three parameters in the proposed model which is flexible in fitting specific storage depth data the model also yields a finite value at the ground surface and a reasonable decay rate with depth this is the first model describing the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth the model is simple and can readily be applied to transient numerical models of groundwater flow and solute transport in porous media keywords specific storage aquifer groundwater hydraulic property numerical modeling 1 introduction specific storage is a fundamental hydraulic property of an aquifer that is needed in transient numerical models of flow and solute transport and is vital for groundwater storage estimations and for the management and evaluation of groundwater resources alley et al 2002 folnagy et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 richey et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the specific storage of an aquifer decreases with depth beavan et al 1991 pope and burbey 2004 contoux et al 2013 paradis and lefebvre 2013 according to an analysis of the earth s tides beavan et al 1991 found that specific storage values at shallow depths are greater than those at great depths based on several specific data points collected from the literature contoux et al 2013 also showed that the specific storage decreases with depth accurately describing the variation in specific storage with depth is vital for obtaining reliable results from flow and solute transport models especially for transient regional groundwater flow models at great depths in particular a specific storage depth model is needed to describe the decrease in specific storage with depth within the earth s crust specific storage and hydraulic conductivity are the two fundamental hydraulic parameters of an aquifer many studies have been performed on the changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth different kinds of empirical permeability depth models have been developed such as exponential models e g louis 1974 saar and manga 2004 jiang et al 2009 and power law models e g bredehoeft et al 1992 manning and ingebritsen 1999 ingebritsen and manning 2010 recently kuang and jiao 2014 proposed a permeability depth model that provides a reasonable decay rate with depth and can be used to describe the permeability depth relationship for the entire earth s crust in contrast there is no model that describes the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth the aim of this paper is to propose an empirical specific storage depth model to calculate the specific storage value at any depth in the earth s crust the proposed model is compared with field specific storage data collected from the literature and is used to describe the decay of specific storage with depth within the earth s continental curst this is the first study to propose a model that describes the decrease in specific storage with depth 2 theory specific storage s s is defined as the volume of water that is released from or taken into a unit volume of aquifer per unit change in the hydraulic head and can be generally expressed as jacob 1940 hantush 1964 bear 1979 freeze and cherry 1979 green and wang 1990 1 s s œÅ w g Œ± n Œ≤ w where œÅ w is the water density Œ± is the aquifer compressibility Œ≤ w is the water compressibility n is the porosity of the aquifer and g is the gravitational acceleration for a unit volume of aquifer per unit decline in hydraulic head specific storage involves the expansion of water and compaction of the aquifer skeleton e g jacob 1940 hantush 1964 freeze and cherry 1979 the porosity n of an aquifer decreases with depth e g athy 1930 rubey and hubbert 1959 ramm and bj√∏rlykke 1994 chen et al 2020 the compressibility of water Œ≤ w has generally been taken to be a constant freeze and cherry 1979 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 igarashi and wakita 1991 fetter 2001 saar and manga 2004 lai et al 2013 the aquifer compressibility Œ± also decreases with depth due to the increase in effective stress with depth where the effective stress originates from the weight of the overlying rock and water e g freeze and cherry 1979 according to eq 1 specific storage s s also decreases with depth similarly the available field data of s s in the literature also show a general decreasing trend with depth fig 1 here an empirical model is proposed to describe the decrease in s s with depth in the earth s crust the proposed model can be expressed as 2 log s s log s s r log s s 0 log s s r 1 z Œª where s s 0 is the specific storage at the ground surface m 1 s sr is the residual specific storage m 1 Œª is the decay index dimensionless and z is the depth below the ground surface km as the decay index Œª is greater than zero the s s value calculated by eq 2 decreases as depth z increases the specific storage provided by eq 2 at the ground surface is s s 0 and the curve calculated by eq 2 decreases from the ground surface with s s s s 0 the decay rate given by eq 2 is also reasonable equation 2 shows that the model approaches a smaller value of s sr at very great depths there are three parameters in eq 2 namely s s 0 s sr and Œª the values of these parameters can be determined by fitting eq 2 to field specific storage data 3 materials and methods field specific storage data were collected from the literature to evaluate the proposed specific storage depth model the specific storage values of unconfined confined and leaky aquifers obtained by different field methods were collected from the literature five main kinds of field methods are employed to estimate the specific storage values of aquifers pumping test analysis slug test analysis seismic wave analysis analyses of earth tides and

5022,in the loess plateau regions with high and coarse sediment yields are the main sources of the yellow river sediments the responses of the interrill erosion rate of the soil in this area shenmu soil to flow intensity parameters were systematically investigated through indoor artificially simulated rainfall experiments considering five slope gradients 0 1564 0 2079 0 2588 0 309 and 0 3584 and five rainfall intensities 60 80 100 120 and 140 mm h 1 thereafter an interrill erosion model was established based on two types of soil shenmu soil and ansai soil the experimental data of ansai soil were obtained from a study by wu et al 2017 the results showed that for shenmu soil the interrill erosion mechanism can be classified into two types the first type was detachment limited interrill erosion in the initial rainfall phase and transport limited interrill erosion in the subsequent rainfall the other type was transport limited interrill erosion during the entire rainfall duration among the flow intensity parameters i e mean flow velocity r 2 0 92 shear stress r 2 0 84 stream power r 2 0 96 and unit stream power r 2 0 82 stream power was found to be satisfactory for predicting the interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil in terms of the coefficient of determination r 2 however the interrill erosion rate model based on the stream power for the two types of soil exhibited low prediction accuracy furthermore a general flow intensity parameter was derived to predict the interrill erosion rate of overland flow based on this parameter an interrill erosion rate model for the two types of soil was formulated by multiple regression analysis with an r2 value of 0 96 a relative root mean square error of 18 9 and a model efficiency of 0 94 overall this general flow intensity parameter was shown to be the preferred predictor for estimating the interrill erosion rate for steep slopes in the regions with high and coarse sediment yields keywords interrill erosion rate overland flow flow parameters general flow intensity parameter the loess plateau 1 introduction river sedimentation mainly caused by soil erosion has become a major global problem lal 1998 vigiak et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 the non equilibrium water sediment transport in the well known yellow river of china has caused the accumulation of suspended sediments critically threatening flood control in areas downriver the deposited sediments are mainly from areas with high and coarse sediment yields in the loess plateau which is a region with extreme sediment concentrations wan and wang 1994 qian and wan 1983 proposed that if the coarse sediment producing areas in the middle reaches can be identified and centrally regulated then the sediment deposition phenomenon in the lower reaches can be alleviated accordingly the yellow river conservancy commission performed a five year study on identifying the referred regions with high and coarse sediment yields as well as determining the sediment production and transport rules they found a number of regions with high and coarse sediment yields located around the hekou and longmen towns and the upper or middle reaches of the jinghe luohe and weihe rivers with a total area of 78 600 km2 fig 1 apparently in terms of reducing the amount of sediments flowing into the yellow river relieving the pressure on flood prevention in the lower reaches and improving the local survival conditions the investigation of soil erosion in regions with high and coarse sediment yields is essential for the ecological construction in the yellow river basin hillslope erosion generally includes rill and interrill erosions wagenbrenner et al 2010 rill erosion is the movement of soil particles along small channels by concentrated flow while the dominant processes in interrill erosion are the detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact and their transport by raindrop impacted overland flow zhang 2019 kinnell 2020 the formulation of an interrill soil erosion model is based on the accurate identification of the limiting process detachment limited or transport limited process meyer and wischmeier 1969 interrill soil erosion is influenced by multiple parameters such as rainfall pattern wang et al 2017 slope gradient and length zhang et al 2014 zhang and wang 2017 surface crust lu et al 2017 soil surface roughness ding and huang 2017 and soil texture nishigaki et al 2017 previous experimental studies reported contradictory results on the limiting process of interrill erosion meyer and harmon 1989 zhang and wang 2017 meyer and harmon 1989 found that the effect of slope length on interrill sediment transport on short steep slopes was negligible and concluded that the interrill erosion in these slopes was a detachment limited process in contrast interill erosion sediment concentrations were found to increase not only with slope gradient but also slope length kinnell 2000 other researchers reported that splashed sediment rates were greater than washed sediment rates at lower rainfall intensities on gentler slopes however the detachment limited process was observed at higher rainfall intensities on steeper slopes mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 wu et al 2018 moreover kinnell 2006 found that the detachment caused by impacting raindrops supplied sufficient loose soil particles for overland transport indicating that interrill erosion was a transport limited process additionally sediment transport was the process limiting the interrill erosion rate under experimental conditions where the maximum rainfall intensity was 170 mm h the maximum slope gradient was 100 and maximum slope length was 2 m fu et al 2011 zhang and wang 2017 zhang 2019 given that there are numerous factors affecting the interrill soil erosion process further research is necessary to identify the limiting process of interrill erosion based on different soil types and slope lengths as for the interrill erosion model the sediment transport from the interrill areas was modelled as a function of rainfall intensity average runoff rate and slope gradient flanagan and nearing 1995 bulygin et al 2002 in the existing soil erosion model of the water erosion prediction project the following equation is used to predict the interrill erosion rates flanagan and nearing 1995 1 d i k i i r s f where d i is the interrill erosion rate kg m 2 s 1 k i is the interrill erodibility coefficient i is the rainfall intensity m s 1 r is the runoff rate m s 1 s f is the slope factor that can be calculated by 2 s f 1 05 0 85 e 4 sin Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the slope gradient by analysing rainfall experimental data a similar equation using a power function of slope instead of s f in eq 1 was established bulygin et al 2002 3 d i k i i r j 2 3 where j sinŒ∏ furthermore zhang and wang 2017 found that the slope length was also an important factor affecting the interrill erosion thereafter the equation for predicting the interrill erosion rates is established 4 d i k i i r 0 242 s f l 0 137 where d i is the interrill erosion rate kg m 2 h 1 i is the rainfall intensity m h 1 r is the runoff rate m h 1 l is the slope length m compared with eq 1 the effect of runoff on the interrill erosion rate was weakened and that of the slope length was incorporated into eq 4 the three foregoing equations were formulated based on various experimental conditions and soil samples to predict the soil erosion using different parameters with varying exponents hence the applicability of these equations and the interrill erodibility parameter coefficient k i for the soils of the regions with high and coarse sediment yields should be studied further reza et al 2018 investigated the relationship between the aggregate size classes and interrill erodibility coefficient k i in the semi arid region of iran the increasing aggregate size associated with increasing amounts of clay consequently k i significantly decreased in addition numerous interrill erosion models were established based on flow parameters including flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power however inconsistent models were formulated because experimental conditions and soil textures were varied fox and bryan 2000 found that the flow velocity could better predict the interrill erosion rate with a linear function by investigating the rain induced overland flow erosion with arid land soils sajjadi and mahmoodabadi 2015 confirmed that the flow velocity was the best predictor of sediment concentration with a linear relationship using the combination of correlation and path analysis an et al 2012 also found that flow velocity was the most sensitive hydraulic parameter for raindrop erosion fan and wu 1999 formulated a soil loss prediction model based on shear stress cao et al 2013 found that interrill erosion soil loss could be estimated by a linear function of stream power this is consistent with the study of wu et al 2017 and qian et al 2020 an et al 2012 found that the unit stream power was an optimal composite force predictor for estimating the interrill erosion rate in the presence of raindrop impact however in its absence the interrill erosion rate was better correlated with the linear function of stream power than with the unit stream power function zhang 2019 found that the empirical equation of zhang and wang 2017 was a slightly better predictor than the stream power for interrill sediment delivery in the transport limiting regime zhang et al 2020 suggested that it is unnecessary to develop specific predictive equations for different interrill erosion regimes i e detachment limiting and transport limiting regimes wang et al 2020 improved the interrill erosion prediction by considering the impact of near surface hydraulic gradient however the critical problem was that the suitability of an equation was dependent on local conditions because the behavior of different soils may vary under the same set of experimental conditions kinnell 2020 hence these equations should be cautiously employed under conditions that differ from those for which they were developed hessel and jetten 2007 zhang et al 2018 at present it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of the interrill erosion process and establish the interrill erosion prediction model of the area under consideration in this study however no literature elaborates on the mechanism of the interrill erosion process of shenmu soil collected from the regions with high and coarse sediment yields besides in previous studies the flow parameters i e flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power have their own advantages and disadvantages in predicting the interrill erosion rate the general flow intensity parameter formula based on the relationship among the four flow parameters should be explored in the future given that the existing models cannot be used without modifying them to predict the interrill soil erosion in the loess plateau developing an interrill erosion model suitable for various soil samples from this area is crucial hence the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the interrill erosion limiting process of typical shenmu sand loess with an experimental slope length of 3 m 2 to explore the optimal flow parameter for predicting the interrill soil erosion rate 3 to establish an interrill erosion rate model based on the general flow intensity parameter for two types of soil i e shenmu sand loess and ansai sandy loam the experimental data of ansai sandy loam was obtained from the study of wu et al 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and test soil the regions with high and coarse sediment yield in the loess plateau 108 9 112 48 e 35 22 40 22 n have an area of 7 86 104 km2 and located in a hilly gullied loess region with broken topography and crisscrossed ravines and gullies this area accounts for 12 3 of the total area of the loess plateau however its annual sediment yield accounts for 62 8 of the total sediment transport of the yellow river in the same period the sediment yield of this area from june to september accounts for more than 80 of that of the entire year evidently it is the main source area of the yellow river sediments including coarse sediments the test soil materials were sand loess from shenmu county 110 23 e 38 51 n located in shaanxi province of northwest china a cross sectional area with water and wind erosions superimposed by the water flow and wind force respectively fig 1 was also considered the area belongs to the transition zone from the loess plateau to the maowusu desert and the forest grassland to the typical arid grassland it is among the areas where the ecological environment is extremely fragile in the loess plateau this area from shenmu to the wenjiachuan section has suffered from an annual sediment transport with a maximum modulus of 15 106 t km2 moreover the region has arid and semi arid monsoon climates with a mean annual temperature of 9 14 c and precipitation of 437 mm 65 85 of which falls between may and october table 1 summarises the particle composition of the experimental soil samples from shenmu the soil investigated in the study of wu et al 2017 was collected from ansai 109 19 e 36 51 n which is another area with extreme soil erosion it is located in the regions with high coarse sediment yields in the loess plateau fig 1 the test soil collected at ansai consists of 70 09 sand diameter 0 02 2 0 mm 21 42 silt diameter 0 002 0 02 mm and 8 49 clay diameter 0 002 mm the median grain diameter of the test soil was 0 039 mm wu et al 2017 table 2 summarises the range of experimental conditions and observed data applied to this study and the work of wu et al 2017 given the slight difference of the slope gradient and rainfall intensity between the two studies the final interrill erosion model was formulated based on the experimental data of the two types of soil ansai soil wu et al 2017 and shenmu soil present study the ansai soil data were derived by reading the corresponding values from the figures in the study of wu et al 2017 using the getdata graph digitizer version 2 24 software 2 2 experimental apparatus the artificially simulated rainfall tests were performed in a rainfall simulation hall at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china the water used in these tests was tap water with a conductivity of 162 and the characteristics of the water quality are given in tables 3 the conductivity of natural precipitation in the study area ranged from 7 5 to 474 8 with an average of 88 the test runoff plot was a slope adjustable steel tank with a length width and height of 3 0 0 5 and 0 4 m respectively as shown in fig 2 the investigation of the shenmu county environmental geomorphology indicates that 61 72 of the hillslopes in this area are between 8 and 25 and the areas with severe soil water erosion are concentrated in the hillslopes of 15 25 zhang et al 1993 2007 in this study five slope gradients ranged from 9 to 21 with a step length of 3 the rainfall simulation equipment used in the experiment was a side spraying artificial rainfall device with a range of 30 200 mm h the rainfall height was 16 m such that the raindrop can achieve the terminal speed several 5 mm seepage pores are arranged in the shape of quincunxes at the bottom of the tank these simulate the soil infiltration under natural conditions and weaken the supporting effect of osmotic pressure on the soil particles otherwise the osmotic pressure may cause an increase in the sediment content and leading to inaccurate results 2 3 experimental design in the loess plateau short duration erosions and high intensity local rainstorms have more considerable effects than long duration low intensity regional rainstorms the rainfall intensity causing soil erosion in this area is generally higher than 31 8 mm h 1 with a maximum intensity of 137 4 mm h 1 jiao et al 1999 because severe soil erosions are concentrated during the high intensity rainstorm period from june to september the designed rainfall intensity in this study is in the range 60 140 mm h 1 including five rainfall intensity levels i e 60 80 100 120 and 140 mm h 1 to investigate the interrill erosion rate in the complete combinatorial tests 25 simulated rainfall tests were conducted lasting until the connected rills appeared the difference between the interrill and rill erosions is that the former has no fixed flow path runoff effect whereas the latter has a temporary flow path runoff effect before the tests the soil samples were naturally air dried and then sifted through a 5 mm sieve to remove weeds and stones then a non woven fabric with a 400 g m2 density was laid at the bottom of the tank in addition permeable fine sand was placed at the surface of the test flume before the placement of filling soils to allow the drainage condition of this test soil layer to approach that of a natural slope thus avoiding seepage failure in the soils thereafter the test soils were loaded in 20 cm thick layers during this filling process the dry bulk density of soils was limited to within 1 45 g cm3 and the layer thickness was set not to exceed 5 cm to ensure a uniform antecedent moisture content of soils before each test the pre rainfall with an intensity of 30 mm h 1 lasted for approximately 30 min until runoff occurred on the slope moreover the nylon net cover over the soil pan was designed to reduce the variability in the soil surface micro relief during this pre rainfall phase the interval between the pre rainfall and rainfall phases was 1 d 24 h 2 4 data measurement there were three longitudinal cross sections observed in the flume positioned at 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 m along the water tank from the inlet to the outlet the surface flow velocity of each section was observed using the kmno4 tracer flow method a high definition camera was set up in front of the flume and the shooting direction of the camera was adjusted to keep it perpendicular to the plane of the flume the elapsed time for the mass centre of the tracer spots to pass the two observed sections are recorded via high speed photography which can continuously capture 180 image frames per minute thereafter through binarisation these were converted into clearly visible photographs of tracer spots image binarisation processing is employed to set the greyscale value of a pixel on the image to either 0 or 255 for a distinct black and white effect all pixels with greyscale values greater than or equal to the threshold value tracer material and section identification are calibrated to 255 white and the remaining pixels lighter region are calibrated to 0 black thus the boundary between the tracer material and normal water flow is identified the binarisation process and capture of images are realised and analysed by writing a python programme the elapsed time for the mass centre of the tracer spots to pass the two observed sections was calculated as the difference between the time when the mass centre passed the former section and the time when it passed the latter section finally the surface flow velocity of every section in this test was calculated based on the time and distance between the two sections runoff sediment samples were collected for the first 30 s for every minute at the tank outlet to determine the variation of the runoff and sediment production process with the rainfall duration at the end of each rainfall test the runoff sample volume was measured using a graduated cylinder and left to sit for the suspended particles to settle the clear supernatant was decanted thereafter the sediments were weighed by the oven drying method 2 5 calculations of hydraulic parameters in the sediment transport theory the flow intensity parameters are classified into three major categories the first one refers dynamics parameters in which the flow shear stress is adopted and the sediment transport is investigated using the drag force uplift force or their combined force the second type refers to kinematics parameters in which flow velocity parameters such as the surface flow velocity bottom flow velocity and mean flow velocity are mainly used to investigate the sediment motion due to the difficulties in the measurement of the near bottom flow velocity and surface flow velocity and the inaccuracy of their definitions these two parameters are not widely employed mean flow velocity u is currently extensively applied in practical sediment research the third category represents power parameters in which the stream power and unit stream power are widely used to study the sediment motion according to energy balance as for flow intensity parameters it has many expressions in this paper several representative flow intensity parameters shear stress mean flow velocity stream power and unit stream power were selected for further analysis 1 flow velocity the mean flow velocity was estimated by the surface flow velocity using the following formula 5 u k u s where u is mean flow velocity m s 1 u s is the surface flow velocity m s 1 and k is the correction coefficient as for the k it ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 according to different flow patterns emmett 1978 2 flow depth based on the continuity equation of water flows the flow depth h can be calculated as follows 6 h q u where h is the flow depth m q is unit width flow discharge m2 s 1 and u is mean flow velocity m s 1 3 shear stress duboys defined the flow shear stress as the force applied by flowing water on the soil surface per unit bed area in 1879 ali et al 2011 which can be calculated as 7 œÑ Œ≥ w r j where Œ≥ w denotes the water unit weight Œ≥ w œÅ g r denotes the hydraulic radius which approximately equals to h in overland flow and j denotes the slope gradient and is approximately set as sinŒ∏ teta is the slope angle 4 stream power bagnold 1966 proposed the concept of stream power i e the change rate of the water potential energy per unit time which can be expressed as 8 w Œ≥ w q j Œ≥ w h u j œÑ u where w is stream power n m s 5 unit stream power yang 1996 proposed unit stream power for the prediction of the sediment transport which was defined as the product of the mean flow velocity and slope gradient 9 p u j where p is the unit stream power m s 6 interrill erosion rate interrill erosion rate in this study was defined as sediment weight per unit area per unit time of each simulated rainfall test which is a mean value of all runoff sediment samples 10 d i 1 n i 1 n m i tlb where d i is interrill erosion rate kg m 2 s 1 mi is the weight of sediments of each runoff sediment sample after oven drying kg l is the tank length m b is the flume width m and t is the time of collecting sample 30 s n is the number of runoff sediment samples 7 sediment concentration sediment concentration was defined as the sediment weight per unit volume for each runoff sediment sample 11 c m i v i where c is sediment concentration kg m 3 mi is the weight of sediments of each runoff sediment sample after oven drying kg vi is the volume of each runoff sediment sample m3 2 6 data analysis the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the performance of the equations describing the relationship between the interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil slope gradient rainfall intensity and flow parameters in estimating the interrill erosion model based on the two types of soils the dataset of shenmu soil was divided into two groups the dataset sizes for estimating the interrill erosion model and evaluating its performance were 18 and 7 respectively for the ansai soil each dataset size was 18 according to the study of wu et al 2017 overall the datasets for estimating the interrill erosion model and evaluating its performance were 36 and 25 respectively the first group of datasets was used to estimate the interrill erosion models based on the stream power and general flow intensity parameter as well as to derive the coefficient of determination r2 the second group of datasets was used to evaluate the performance of the two models using r2 root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and model efficiency me to evaluate the performance of eqs 1 3 and 4 for the two types of soil r2 was employed the smaller the rmse and rrmse the closer the predicted values to those observed the range of me is from to 1 the closer the value is to 1 the better the model predictions mahmoodabadi et al 2014 the r 2 rmse and me values are obtained as follows thomann 1982 nash and sutcliffe 1970 12 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2

predicted values respectively n is the total number of paired values 3 results 3 1 full temporal evolution of runoff and sediment concentration for experiments using shenmu soil fig 3 shows the changes with time in the unit width flow discharge q and sediment concentration c for different slope gradients and rainfall intensities the change in the unit width flow discharge with increasing time had three patterns r fl i and fl in the r fl pattern the unit width flow discharge first increased and then fluctuated during the rainfall duration accounting for 12 25 of all experimental tests in the i pattern the unit width flow discharge gradually increased throughout the rainfall duration in the fl pattern the unit width flow discharge fluctuated with the rainfall time the i and fl patterns accounted for 12 25 and 1 25 of all experimental tests respectively in the beginning the soil maximum infiltration rate was greater than the rainfall intensity resulting in no runoff occurred on the slope surface thereafter the soil infiltration rate gradually decreased with the rainfall duration when the rainfall intensity was greater than the soil infiltration rate the runoff occurred then the soil infiltration rate continued to decrease and the runoff rate continued to increase finally when the soil infiltration rate reached a stable infiltration rate the runoff rate became stable besides the fluctuation of rainfall runoff may be due to the temporary blocking of the runoff path which is caused by the accumulation of soil particles due to the change of surface microtopography during rainfall therefore if the soil infiltration rate finally reached the stable infiltration rate the runoff rate curve first rose and then fluctuated r fl if the soil infiltration rate did not reach the stable infiltration rate the runoff rate curve would always rise i or fluctuate fl the changes in the sediment concentration with time can be classified into three patterns first in the f r pattern the sediment concentration first decreased and then increased with increasing rainfall duration accounting for 18 25 of all experimental tests in the second pattern i the sediment concentration constantly increased with the rainfall duration in the last pattern r fl the sediment concentration first increased and then fluctuated with increasing rainfall duration the proportions of i and r fl were 5 25 and 2 25 of all experimental tests respectively based on the study of martinezmena et al 2002 a negative relationship between the unit width flow discharge and sediment concentration indicated that the pattern of interrill erosion was a detachment limited process in this period however as q increased c also gradually increased hence a positive relationship between q and c was observed indicating that the sediment transport limited process existed in this situation accordingly as shown in fig 3 the interrill erosion mechanism can be classified into two types d t and t patterns the d t pattern indicated the occurrence of detachment limited interrill erosion during the initial rainfall period then followed by the transport limited interrill erosion during the remaining rainfall time the critical times when the detachment limited process shifted to a transport limited process are listed in table 4 the t pattern signified transport limited interrill erosion throughout the rainfall duration the table also lists the interrill erosion mechanism for each combination of rainfall intensity and slope gradient meanwhile the interrill erosion process of the d t and t patterns accounted for 18 25 and 7 25 of the interrill erosion mechanism observed respectively fig 4 shows the relationship between the sediment concentration and unit width flow discharge in general a positive linear relationship between the unit width flow discharge and sediment concentration was observed in this study indicating that the dominant erosion process was transport limited in some cases the sediment concentration first decreased and then increased as the unit width flow discharge increased the explanation is that the decrease in sediment concentration may be due to the progressive exhaustion of fine sediment loosened by raindrop impact prior to the initiation of runoff then the runoff depth 0 44 0 89 mm in this study has little effect on the soil detachment ability of raindrops leads to the sufficient supply of detached soil particles resulting an increase of sediment concentration 3 2 effect of slope gradient and rainfall intensity on interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil table 5 summarises the measured unit width flow discharges and calculated mean flow velocities flow depths and interrill erosion rates of 25 combinations of slope gradients and rainfall intensities fig 5 shows the relationship between the interrill erosion rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient the interrill erosion rate was significantly influenced by rainfall intensity and slope gradient by data fitting the interrill erosion rate was observed to increase in terms of its power function with increasing rainfall intensity at a certain slope gradient this relationship also existed between the interrill erosion rate and slope gradient at a certain rainfall intensity based on multiple regression analysis eq 16 was derived to predict the interrill erosion rate the power exponent of the slope gradient was smaller than that of the rainfall intensity indicating that the interrill erosion rate was more sensitive to the rainfall intensity than to the slope gradient 16 d i 1 21 10 6 i 2 28 j 2 01 r 2 0 96 n 25 3 3 relationship between interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil and flow parameters 3 3 1 relationship between interrill erosion rate and mean flow velocity the mean flow velocities under each combination of rainfall intensity and slope gradient are summarised in table 6 based on the list at a certain slope gradient the mean flow velocity increased with the rainfall intensity however when the intensity exceeded 120 mm h 1 the effect of rainfall intensity on the flow velocity gradually decreased this indicates that when the rainfall intensity increases the flow turbulence intensifies and the energy consumed by the turbulence increases reducing the rate of increase of flow velocity specifically on average the mean flow velocity increased by 94 with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients under a certain rainfall intensity the mean flow velocity increased with the slope gradient in particular as the rainfall intensity increased the contribution of the slope gradient to the varying mean flow velocity gradually increased however when the slope gradient exceeded 0 309 it only had a minimal effect on the mean flow velocity as for the five rainfall intensities on average the mean flow velocity increased by 76 with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 this indicates that the mean flow velocity is more sensitive to the rainfall intensity than to the slope gradient fig 6 a displays the relationship between the mean flow velocity and interrill erosion rate it is observed that the interrill erosion rate increases as a power function with the mean flow velocity the power exponent is equal to 3 89 by data fitting the regression equation representing the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and mean flow velocity can be written as follow 17 d i 25 05 u 3 89 r 2 0 92 n 25 3 3 2 relationship between interrill erosion rate and shear stress the shear stresses under different test conditions are listed in table 7 it is observed that under the same rainfall intensity condition the shear stress gradually increases with increasing slope gradient specifically for the five rainfall intensities the shear stress increased by 106 on average with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 when the slope gradients were 0 1564 and 0 2079 the shear stress exhibited no distinct variation with the increase in rainfall intensity as the slope gradient exceeded 0 2079 the shear stress sharply increased with the rainfall intensity in particular the shear stress increased by 62 on average with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients this indicates that the shear stress is more sensitive to the slope gradient than to the rainfall intensity fig 6 b displays the relationship between the shear stress and interrill erosion rate indicating that the interrill erosion rate is directly proportional to 2 56 times the magnitude of the shear stress by data fitting the regression equation reflecting the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and shear stress can be written as 18 d i 6 95 10 4 œÑ 2 56 r 2 0 84 n 25 where d i denotes the interrill erosion rate kg m 2 s 1 3 3 3 relationship between interrill erosion rate and stream power the stream power w values under different test conditions are listed in table 8 it is observed that at a certain slope gradient the stream power increases with the rainfall intensity in particular the stream power increased by 204 on average with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients under a certain rainfall condition the stream power increased with increasing slope gradient specifically for the five rainfall intensities the stream power increased by 256 on average with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 this indicates that the stream power is more sensitive to the slope gradient than to the rainfall intensity see table 8 fig 6 c shows the relationship between the stream power and interrill erosion rate it can be concluded that the interrill erosion rate was directly proportional to the stream power with a power exponent of 1 70 after data fitting the following expression for the interrill erosion rate was derived 19 d i 0 057 w 1 70 r 2 0 96 n 25 by definition the stream power is the product of shear stress œÑ and mean flow velocity u œÑ is related to the slope gradient and flow depth thus the stream power involves more hydraulic parameters than the shear stress this implies that the calculation for the interrill erosion rate using the stream power can provide more accurate results 3 3 4 relationship between interrill erosion rate and unit stream power the unit stream power reflects the variation rate of the water potential energy per unit weight over time and also denotes the energy of water per unit weight consumed in the sediment transport therefore the total sediment content or total sediment runoff must be directly related to the unit stream power the calculated unit stream power is listed in table 9 it is observed that at a certain slope gradient the unit stream power increases with the rainfall intensity when the rainfall exceeded 120 mm h 1 the unit stream power slightly increased in particular the stream power increased by 93 on average with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients under a certain rainfall intensity the unit stream power increased with the slope gradient specifically for the five rainfall intensities stream power increased by 304 on average with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 this indicates that the effect of the slope gradient on the unit stream power variation is significantly larger than that induced by varying the rainfall intensity fig 6 d shows the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and unit stream power moreover eq 20 shows that the interrill erosion rate is directly proportional to the unit stream power with a power exponent of 2 05 by data fitting the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and unit stream power can be expressed as follows 20 d i 5 11 p 2 05 r 2 0 82 n 25 3 4 interrill erosion rate model based on stream power for two types of soils as shown in fig 6 among the flow parameters i e mean flow velocity r2 0 92 shear stress r2 0 84 stream power r2 0 96 and unit stream power r2 0 82 stream power is found adequate for predicting the interrill erosion rate in terms of r2 these results agree with those of the study of wu et al 2017 in which the stream power is also found to be the optimal predictor for the interrill erosion rate fig 7 a shows the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and stream power for the two types of soil although there was a partition phenomenon in the relationship curves between the interrill erosion rate and stream power for the two types of soil the interrill erosion rate was correlated to the stream power with a power function according to the experimental data the interrill erosion rate prediction model can be expressed as eq 21 fig 7 b illustrates the predicted interrill erosion rate versus the observed values it was found that the data points were more dispersed with high rrmse 68 and low values of r2 0 37 and me 0 20 indicating that the prediction accuracy of model results based on the stream power was low d i 0 021 w 0 97 r 2 0 79 n 36 21 3 5 interrill erosion rate model based on general flow intensity parameter for two types of soils based on their definitions the shear stress stream power and unit stream power were all found to be derived from the mean flow velocity mean flow depth and slope gradient accordingly a general flow intensity parameter can be derived from these three basic hydraulic parameters to predict the interrill erosion rate the general flow intensity parameter can be expressed as 22 Œ∑ k u a h b j c where Œ∑ is the general flow intensity parameter k is the proportionality coefficient related to the median soil grain diameter and flow condition a b and c are the power exponents as summarised in table 10 different flow intensity parameters can be obtained when k a b and c are assigned different values the interrill erosion rate can be affected by flow conditions including flow velocity flow depth slope gradient and gravity it is also sensitive to the physical properties of flow and soil hence the median soil grain diameter was considered for establishing the interrill erosion rate model based on the general flow intensity parameter to improve the accuracy of this model sha 1965 found that there was an existing power function between the bed sediment transport capacity and variables the general interrill erosion rate model can be established as 23 d i a Œ∑ b d 50 t where a is constant b and t are power exponents substituting eq 22 into eq 23 yields 24 d i k 1 u m h n j s d 50 t where k 1 is constant m n s and t are power exponents the comprehensive form of the interrill erosion rate model is shown in eq 24 by means of multiple regression analysis using spss statistics 19 software the interrill erosion rate model eq 25 is obtained fig 8 a 25 d i 0 60 u 2 346 h 1 367 j 0 922 d 50 1 23 r 2 0 99 n 36 fig 8 b shows the comparison between the measured interrill erosion rate and that predicted by eq 25 the comparison indicates that the model accurately predicts the interrill erosion rate based on the general flow intensity parameter with high values of r2 0 96 and me 0 94 and low rrmse 18 9 4 discussion 4 1 interrill erosion process mechanism of shenmu soil in this study the dominant soil erosion mechanism is the sediment transport limited process this agrees with the study of zhang and wang 2017 in which the average interrill erosion rates per unit area are found to decrease as the slope length increases from 80 to 200 cm the splash rates remain practically unchanged along the slope demonstrating that sediment transport is the limiting process however this result is not consistent with the study of martinezmena et al 2002 who demonstrated that the predominant erosion process depended on the rainfall intensity with a prevailing detachment limited condition in high intensity events and prevailing transport limited conditions in those events of medium intensity a plausible reason for this is the effect of flow depth on sediment transport that is the soil particle detachment rate decreases as the flow depth increases from 0 to 2 mm diameter of a single drop in contrast the sediment transport rate generally increases and then decreases as the flow depth increases from 0 to 2 mm and then from 2 to 6 mm respectively kinnell 1991 furthermore zhang and wang 2017 found that optimal flow depth for the maximal transport enhancement under the raindrop impact was 0 1 mm it was also found that the sediment transport patterns were the transport by raindrop induced rolling or creeping when the flow depth was 0 1 mm the transport by flow driven rolling or sliding for flow depths ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 mm and the transport by flow driven saltation when the flow depth exceeded 0 3 mm in this study the mean flow depth range was 0 468 0 91 mm hence the influence of flow depth on soil detachment was negligible because a flow depth of 1 mm was considerably shallow to restrict raindrop detachment parsons et al 1994 however the sediment transport rate did not reach the maximum because of the flow depth limitation resulting in the sediment transport limited process therefore it can be inferred that the detachment and transport mechanism of the shenmu soil interill erosion in this study was raindrop induced and flow driven saltation as well as flow driven rolling respectively 4 2 relationship between interrill erosion model and flow parameters in the present work a power function is found to exist between the interrill erosion rate and shear stress this result is consistent with the findings of van liew and saxton 1983 fan and wu 1999 and zhang et al 2008 in contrast fox and bryan 2000 found that a linear function exists between the overland flow erosion rate and shear stress however r 2 is only 0 23 this implies that the power function between the interrill erosion rate and shear stress is more suitable as shown in fig 6 the correlation between the interrill erosion rate and flow velocity r 2 0 92 is better than that between the sediment transport and shear stress r 2 0 84 the results obtained in this study are consistent with the results of wu et al 2016 they proposed a more accurate sediment transport prediction based on mean flow velocity however the results obtained in this study contradict the results of zhang et al 2009 their work demonstrated that shear stress was a better predictor for sediment transport than flow velocity this inconsistency is mainly attributed to the property differences between the two soils used in the experiments the soil used by zhang et al 2009 was cohesionless sediments collected from the yongding river bed near beijing whereas the soil in this study and that of wu et al 2016 were viscous sediments collected from the loess plateau therefore it can be concluded that the incipience of viscous sediments on a riverbed is mainly controlled by the flow velocity for the sediment incipience or blowing whereas the adoption of shear stress as the control condition is more appropriate for cohesionless sediments in this study a power function is found to exist between the interrill erosion rate and stream power this result is consistent with the reports of other researchers zhang et al 2003 xiao et al 2017 however these results contradict those of cao et al 2013 they demonstrated that a linear function existed between the sheet erosion rate and stream power with a slope gradient range of 4 26 8 however for shenmu soil the interrill erosion was investigated with a slope gradient range of 15 64 35 84 indicating that the linear relationship cannot be extended to steep slope gradients in this work the interrill erosion rate is found to be directly proportional to the unit stream power with a power exponent of 2 05 this agreed with the findings of ali et al 2011 ali et al 2013 who concluded that the sediment transport can be modelled as a power function of the unit stream power however this outcome was contrary to that of li et al 2019 who found that linear function was superior to the power function relationship between the overland flow soil detachment and unit stream power when the unit stream power was equal to or even less than the critical value the soil detachment should be approximately zero or negative according to the linear function relationship thus limiting its use under other experimental conditions such as low flow discharge and gentle slope gradient 4 3 performance of existing interrill erosion models for two types of soil it is finally concluded that the general flow intensity parameter performs well in predicting the interrill erosion rate of the two types of soil other researchers also used variable parameters to predict the sheet erosion rate e g eqs 1 3 and 4 table 11 summarises the performance rates of existing interrill erosion models and interrill erodibility coefficients for the two types of soil among eqs 1 3 and 4 eq 3 which was proposed by bulygin et al 2002 performed well in predicting the interrill erosion rate of the two types of soil the interrill erodibility coefficients k i deduced using eq 4 was 402 for shenmu soil and 222 for ansai soil respectively this demonstrated that the erodibility of shenmu soil is more considerable than that of ansai soil these results agree with the influence of soil texture on the interrill erodibility in the present study shenmu sand loess with a 6 6 clay content was investigated whereas in the study of wu et al 2017 ansai soil with a higher clay content 8 49 was examined this soil condition affects the interrill erodibility because it generally decreases with the clay content of soil moreover eq 4 proposed by zhang and wang 2017 performed better in predicting the interrill erosion rate for ansai soil r2 0 74 than that for shenmu soil r2 0 65 a probable explanation is that the sequence of detachment and transport mechanisms varies under different experimental conditions resulting in the limitation of one model to predict the interrill erosion rate based on different data kinnell 2020 furthermore the interrill erosion per unit area first increased and then decreased as the slope length increased from 0 to 4 m the critical slope length was between 2 5 and 3 3 m zhang et al 2017 the 1 4 m slope length applied to the study of wu et al 2017 was included in the experimental slope length 2 m under the model formulation condition of zhang and wang 2017 however for shenmu soil the interrill erosion was investigated with a slope length of 3 m which exceeded the condition under which the model eq 4 was established in addition as reported by hessel and jetten 2007 the suitability of an equation depends on the local conditions accordingly further investigations on the general soil erosion model based on considerable amounts of experimental data are necessary 5 conclusions in this study the interrill erosion in the region with high and coarse sediment yields has been studied with steep slope gradients in simulated rainfall experiments according to the relationship between the unit width flow discharge and sediment concentration the interrill erosion mechanism of shenmu soil in this study can be classified into two types one type involves the detachment limited interrill erosion in the initial phrase and then transport limited interrill erosion in the subsequent rainfall duration the other type involves the transport limited interrill erosion throughout the rainfall duration in the simulated rainfall experiments the interrill erosion rate increased according to a power function relationship with the flow intensity parameter specifically the interrill erosion rate was found to be directly proportional to the shear stress mean flow velocity stream power and unit stream power with exponential powers of 2 56 3 89 1 70 and 2 05 respectively among the flow parameters i e shear stress r 2 0 84 mean flow velocity r 2 0 92 stream power r 2 0 96 and unit stream power r 2 0 82 the stream power was found adequate for predicting the interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil in terms of r 2 however for the two types of soil the interrill erosion model derived based on the stream power exhibited inadequate prediction accuracy with high rrmse 68 and low values of r2 0 37 and me 0 20 according to the analysis of the four flow intensity parameters i e shear stress mean flow velocity stream power and unit stream power the general flow intensity parameter was obtained to predict the interrill erosion rate on overland flow finally an empirical formula for predicting the interrill erosion rate was established by multiple regression analysis based on the general flow intensity parameter equation 25 also performed well in predicting the interrill erosion rate of the two types of soils with high values of r2 0 96 and me 0 94 and low rrmse 16 8 this empirical formula is based on the laboratory runoff plot tests of the two types of soil this derived formula should be used judiciously when predicting the soil erosion rate under conditions that differ from those of this research the results obtained in this study are anticipated to provide a theoretical basis for the investigation of the slope soil loss model 6 data availability all data used during the study are available from the corresponding author by request we declare that we do

5022,in the loess plateau regions with high and coarse sediment yields are the main sources of the yellow river sediments the responses of the interrill erosion rate of the soil in this area shenmu soil to flow intensity parameters were systematically investigated through indoor artificially simulated rainfall experiments considering five slope gradients 0 1564 0 2079 0 2588 0 309 and 0 3584 and five rainfall intensities 60 80 100 120 and 140 mm h 1 thereafter an interrill erosion model was established based on two types of soil shenmu soil and ansai soil the experimental data of ansai soil were obtained from a study by wu et al 2017 the results showed that for shenmu soil the interrill erosion mechanism can be classified into two types the first type was detachment limited interrill erosion in the initial rainfall phase and transport limited interrill erosion in the subsequent rainfall the other type was transport limited interrill erosion during the entire rainfall duration among the flow intensity parameters i e mean flow velocity r 2 0 92 shear stress r 2 0 84 stream power r 2 0 96 and unit stream power r 2 0 82 stream power was found to be satisfactory for predicting the interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil in terms of the coefficient of determination r 2 however the interrill erosion rate model based on the stream power for the two types of soil exhibited low prediction accuracy furthermore a general flow intensity parameter was derived to predict the interrill erosion rate of overland flow based on this parameter an interrill erosion rate model for the two types of soil was formulated by multiple regression analysis with an r2 value of 0 96 a relative root mean square error of 18 9 and a model efficiency of 0 94 overall this general flow intensity parameter was shown to be the preferred predictor for estimating the interrill erosion rate for steep slopes in the regions with high and coarse sediment yields keywords interrill erosion rate overland flow flow parameters general flow intensity parameter the loess plateau 1 introduction river sedimentation mainly caused by soil erosion has become a major global problem lal 1998 vigiak et al 2005 zhao et al 2013 the non equilibrium water sediment transport in the well known yellow river of china has caused the accumulation of suspended sediments critically threatening flood control in areas downriver the deposited sediments are mainly from areas with high and coarse sediment yields in the loess plateau which is a region with extreme sediment concentrations wan and wang 1994 qian and wan 1983 proposed that if the coarse sediment producing areas in the middle reaches can be identified and centrally regulated then the sediment deposition phenomenon in the lower reaches can be alleviated accordingly the yellow river conservancy commission performed a five year study on identifying the referred regions with high and coarse sediment yields as well as determining the sediment production and transport rules they found a number of regions with high and coarse sediment yields located around the hekou and longmen towns and the upper or middle reaches of the jinghe luohe and weihe rivers with a total area of 78 600 km2 fig 1 apparently in terms of reducing the amount of sediments flowing into the yellow river relieving the pressure on flood prevention in the lower reaches and improving the local survival conditions the investigation of soil erosion in regions with high and coarse sediment yields is essential for the ecological construction in the yellow river basin hillslope erosion generally includes rill and interrill erosions wagenbrenner et al 2010 rill erosion is the movement of soil particles along small channels by concentrated flow while the dominant processes in interrill erosion are the detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact and their transport by raindrop impacted overland flow zhang 2019 kinnell 2020 the formulation of an interrill soil erosion model is based on the accurate identification of the limiting process detachment limited or transport limited process meyer and wischmeier 1969 interrill soil erosion is influenced by multiple parameters such as rainfall pattern wang et al 2017 slope gradient and length zhang et al 2014 zhang and wang 2017 surface crust lu et al 2017 soil surface roughness ding and huang 2017 and soil texture nishigaki et al 2017 previous experimental studies reported contradictory results on the limiting process of interrill erosion meyer and harmon 1989 zhang and wang 2017 meyer and harmon 1989 found that the effect of slope length on interrill sediment transport on short steep slopes was negligible and concluded that the interrill erosion in these slopes was a detachment limited process in contrast interill erosion sediment concentrations were found to increase not only with slope gradient but also slope length kinnell 2000 other researchers reported that splashed sediment rates were greater than washed sediment rates at lower rainfall intensities on gentler slopes however the detachment limited process was observed at higher rainfall intensities on steeper slopes mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 wu et al 2018 moreover kinnell 2006 found that the detachment caused by impacting raindrops supplied sufficient loose soil particles for overland transport indicating that interrill erosion was a transport limited process additionally sediment transport was the process limiting the interrill erosion rate under experimental conditions where the maximum rainfall intensity was 170 mm h the maximum slope gradient was 100 and maximum slope length was 2 m fu et al 2011 zhang and wang 2017 zhang 2019 given that there are numerous factors affecting the interrill soil erosion process further research is necessary to identify the limiting process of interrill erosion based on different soil types and slope lengths as for the interrill erosion model the sediment transport from the interrill areas was modelled as a function of rainfall intensity average runoff rate and slope gradient flanagan and nearing 1995 bulygin et al 2002 in the existing soil erosion model of the water erosion prediction project the following equation is used to predict the interrill erosion rates flanagan and nearing 1995 1 d i k i i r s f where d i is the interrill erosion rate kg m 2 s 1 k i is the interrill erodibility coefficient i is the rainfall intensity m s 1 r is the runoff rate m s 1 s f is the slope factor that can be calculated by 2 s f 1 05 0 85 e 4 sin Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the slope gradient by analysing rainfall experimental data a similar equation using a power function of slope instead of s f in eq 1 was established bulygin et al 2002 3 d i k i i r j 2 3 where j sinŒ∏ furthermore zhang and wang 2017 found that the slope length was also an important factor affecting the interrill erosion thereafter the equation for predicting the interrill erosion rates is established 4 d i k i i r 0 242 s f l 0 137 where d i is the interrill erosion rate kg m 2 h 1 i is the rainfall intensity m h 1 r is the runoff rate m h 1 l is the slope length m compared with eq 1 the effect of runoff on the interrill erosion rate was weakened and that of the slope length was incorporated into eq 4 the three foregoing equations were formulated based on various experimental conditions and soil samples to predict the soil erosion using different parameters with varying exponents hence the applicability of these equations and the interrill erodibility parameter coefficient k i for the soils of the regions with high and coarse sediment yields should be studied further reza et al 2018 investigated the relationship between the aggregate size classes and interrill erodibility coefficient k i in the semi arid region of iran the increasing aggregate size associated with increasing amounts of clay consequently k i significantly decreased in addition numerous interrill erosion models were established based on flow parameters including flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power however inconsistent models were formulated because experimental conditions and soil textures were varied fox and bryan 2000 found that the flow velocity could better predict the interrill erosion rate with a linear function by investigating the rain induced overland flow erosion with arid land soils sajjadi and mahmoodabadi 2015 confirmed that the flow velocity was the best predictor of sediment concentration with a linear relationship using the combination of correlation and path analysis an et al 2012 also found that flow velocity was the most sensitive hydraulic parameter for raindrop erosion fan and wu 1999 formulated a soil loss prediction model based on shear stress cao et al 2013 found that interrill erosion soil loss could be estimated by a linear function of stream power this is consistent with the study of wu et al 2017 and qian et al 2020 an et al 2012 found that the unit stream power was an optimal composite force predictor for estimating the interrill erosion rate in the presence of raindrop impact however in its absence the interrill erosion rate was better correlated with the linear function of stream power than with the unit stream power function zhang 2019 found that the empirical equation of zhang and wang 2017 was a slightly better predictor than the stream power for interrill sediment delivery in the transport limiting regime zhang et al 2020 suggested that it is unnecessary to develop specific predictive equations for different interrill erosion regimes i e detachment limiting and transport limiting regimes wang et al 2020 improved the interrill erosion prediction by considering the impact of near surface hydraulic gradient however the critical problem was that the suitability of an equation was dependent on local conditions because the behavior of different soils may vary under the same set of experimental conditions kinnell 2020 hence these equations should be cautiously employed under conditions that differ from those for which they were developed hessel and jetten 2007 zhang et al 2018 at present it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of the interrill erosion process and establish the interrill erosion prediction model of the area under consideration in this study however no literature elaborates on the mechanism of the interrill erosion process of shenmu soil collected from the regions with high and coarse sediment yields besides in previous studies the flow parameters i e flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power have their own advantages and disadvantages in predicting the interrill erosion rate the general flow intensity parameter formula based on the relationship among the four flow parameters should be explored in the future given that the existing models cannot be used without modifying them to predict the interrill soil erosion in the loess plateau developing an interrill erosion model suitable for various soil samples from this area is crucial hence the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the interrill erosion limiting process of typical shenmu sand loess with an experimental slope length of 3 m 2 to explore the optimal flow parameter for predicting the interrill soil erosion rate 3 to establish an interrill erosion rate model based on the general flow intensity parameter for two types of soil i e shenmu sand loess and ansai sandy loam the experimental data of ansai sandy loam was obtained from the study of wu et al 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and test soil the regions with high and coarse sediment yield in the loess plateau 108 9 112 48 e 35 22 40 22 n have an area of 7 86 104 km2 and located in a hilly gullied loess region with broken topography and crisscrossed ravines and gullies this area accounts for 12 3 of the total area of the loess plateau however its annual sediment yield accounts for 62 8 of the total sediment transport of the yellow river in the same period the sediment yield of this area from june to september accounts for more than 80 of that of the entire year evidently it is the main source area of the yellow river sediments including coarse sediments the test soil materials were sand loess from shenmu county 110 23 e 38 51 n located in shaanxi province of northwest china a cross sectional area with water and wind erosions superimposed by the water flow and wind force respectively fig 1 was also considered the area belongs to the transition zone from the loess plateau to the maowusu desert and the forest grassland to the typical arid grassland it is among the areas where the ecological environment is extremely fragile in the loess plateau this area from shenmu to the wenjiachuan section has suffered from an annual sediment transport with a maximum modulus of 15 106 t km2 moreover the region has arid and semi arid monsoon climates with a mean annual temperature of 9 14 c and precipitation of 437 mm 65 85 of which falls between may and october table 1 summarises the particle composition of the experimental soil samples from shenmu the soil investigated in the study of wu et al 2017 was collected from ansai 109 19 e 36 51 n which is another area with extreme soil erosion it is located in the regions with high coarse sediment yields in the loess plateau fig 1 the test soil collected at ansai consists of 70 09 sand diameter 0 02 2 0 mm 21 42 silt diameter 0 002 0 02 mm and 8 49 clay diameter 0 002 mm the median grain diameter of the test soil was 0 039 mm wu et al 2017 table 2 summarises the range of experimental conditions and observed data applied to this study and the work of wu et al 2017 given the slight difference of the slope gradient and rainfall intensity between the two studies the final interrill erosion model was formulated based on the experimental data of the two types of soil ansai soil wu et al 2017 and shenmu soil present study the ansai soil data were derived by reading the corresponding values from the figures in the study of wu et al 2017 using the getdata graph digitizer version 2 24 software 2 2 experimental apparatus the artificially simulated rainfall tests were performed in a rainfall simulation hall at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china the water used in these tests was tap water with a conductivity of 162 and the characteristics of the water quality are given in tables 3 the conductivity of natural precipitation in the study area ranged from 7 5 to 474 8 with an average of 88 the test runoff plot was a slope adjustable steel tank with a length width and height of 3 0 0 5 and 0 4 m respectively as shown in fig 2 the investigation of the shenmu county environmental geomorphology indicates that 61 72 of the hillslopes in this area are between 8 and 25 and the areas with severe soil water erosion are concentrated in the hillslopes of 15 25 zhang et al 1993 2007 in this study five slope gradients ranged from 9 to 21 with a step length of 3 the rainfall simulation equipment used in the experiment was a side spraying artificial rainfall device with a range of 30 200 mm h the rainfall height was 16 m such that the raindrop can achieve the terminal speed several 5 mm seepage pores are arranged in the shape of quincunxes at the bottom of the tank these simulate the soil infiltration under natural conditions and weaken the supporting effect of osmotic pressure on the soil particles otherwise the osmotic pressure may cause an increase in the sediment content and leading to inaccurate results 2 3 experimental design in the loess plateau short duration erosions and high intensity local rainstorms have more considerable effects than long duration low intensity regional rainstorms the rainfall intensity causing soil erosion in this area is generally higher than 31 8 mm h 1 with a maximum intensity of 137 4 mm h 1 jiao et al 1999 because severe soil erosions are concentrated during the high intensity rainstorm period from june to september the designed rainfall intensity in this study is in the range 60 140 mm h 1 including five rainfall intensity levels i e 60 80 100 120 and 140 mm h 1 to investigate the interrill erosion rate in the complete combinatorial tests 25 simulated rainfall tests were conducted lasting until the connected rills appeared the difference between the interrill and rill erosions is that the former has no fixed flow path runoff effect whereas the latter has a temporary flow path runoff effect before the tests the soil samples were naturally air dried and then sifted through a 5 mm sieve to remove weeds and stones then a non woven fabric with a 400 g m2 density was laid at the bottom of the tank in addition permeable fine sand was placed at the surface of the test flume before the placement of filling soils to allow the drainage condition of this test soil layer to approach that of a natural slope thus avoiding seepage failure in the soils thereafter the test soils were loaded in 20 cm thick layers during this filling process the dry bulk density of soils was limited to within 1 45 g cm3 and the layer thickness was set not to exceed 5 cm to ensure a uniform antecedent moisture content of soils before each test the pre rainfall with an intensity of 30 mm h 1 lasted for approximately 30 min until runoff occurred on the slope moreover the nylon net cover over the soil pan was designed to reduce the variability in the soil surface micro relief during this pre rainfall phase the interval between the pre rainfall and rainfall phases was 1 d 24 h 2 4 data measurement there were three longitudinal cross sections observed in the flume positioned at 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 m along the water tank from the inlet to the outlet the surface flow velocity of each section was observed using the kmno4 tracer flow method a high definition camera was set up in front of the flume and the shooting direction of the camera was adjusted to keep it perpendicular to the plane of the flume the elapsed time for the mass centre of the tracer spots to pass the two observed sections are recorded via high speed photography which can continuously capture 180 image frames per minute thereafter through binarisation these were converted into clearly visible photographs of tracer spots image binarisation processing is employed to set the greyscale value of a pixel on the image to either 0 or 255 for a distinct black and white effect all pixels with greyscale values greater than or equal to the threshold value tracer material and section identification are calibrated to 255 white and the remaining pixels lighter region are calibrated to 0 black thus the boundary between the tracer material and normal water flow is identified the binarisation process and capture of images are realised and analysed by writing a python programme the elapsed time for the mass centre of the tracer spots to pass the two observed sections was calculated as the difference between the time when the mass centre passed the former section and the time when it passed the latter section finally the surface flow velocity of every section in this test was calculated based on the time and distance between the two sections runoff sediment samples were collected for the first 30 s for every minute at the tank outlet to determine the variation of the runoff and sediment production process with the rainfall duration at the end of each rainfall test the runoff sample volume was measured using a graduated cylinder and left to sit for the suspended particles to settle the clear supernatant was decanted thereafter the sediments were weighed by the oven drying method 2 5 calculations of hydraulic parameters in the sediment transport theory the flow intensity parameters are classified into three major categories the first one refers dynamics parameters in which the flow shear stress is adopted and the sediment transport is investigated using the drag force uplift force or their combined force the second type refers to kinematics parameters in which flow velocity parameters such as the surface flow velocity bottom flow velocity and mean flow velocity are mainly used to investigate the sediment motion due to the difficulties in the measurement of the near bottom flow velocity and surface flow velocity and the inaccuracy of their definitions these two parameters are not widely employed mean flow velocity u is currently extensively applied in practical sediment research the third category represents power parameters in which the stream power and unit stream power are widely used to study the sediment motion according to energy balance as for flow intensity parameters it has many expressions in this paper several representative flow intensity parameters shear stress mean flow velocity stream power and unit stream power were selected for further analysis 1 flow velocity the mean flow velocity was estimated by the surface flow velocity using the following formula 5 u k u s where u is mean flow velocity m s 1 u s is the surface flow velocity m s 1 and k is the correction coefficient as for the k it ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 according to different flow patterns emmett 1978 2 flow depth based on the continuity equation of water flows the flow depth h can be calculated as follows 6 h q u where h is the flow depth m q is unit width flow discharge m2 s 1 and u is mean flow velocity m s 1 3 shear stress duboys defined the flow shear stress as the force applied by flowing water on the soil surface per unit bed area in 1879 ali et al 2011 which can be calculated as 7 œÑ Œ≥ w r j where Œ≥ w denotes the water unit weight Œ≥ w œÅ g r denotes the hydraulic radius which approximately equals to h in overland flow and j denotes the slope gradient and is approximately set as sinŒ∏ teta is the slope angle 4 stream power bagnold 1966 proposed the concept of stream power i e the change rate of the water potential energy per unit time which can be expressed as 8 w Œ≥ w q j Œ≥ w h u j œÑ u where w is stream power n m s 5 unit stream power yang 1996 proposed unit stream power for the prediction of the sediment transport which was defined as the product of the mean flow velocity and slope gradient 9 p u j where p is the unit stream power m s 6 interrill erosion rate interrill erosion rate in this study was defined as sediment weight per unit area per unit time of each simulated rainfall test which is a mean value of all runoff sediment samples 10 d i 1 n i 1 n m i tlb where d i is interrill erosion rate kg m 2 s 1 mi is the weight of sediments of each runoff sediment sample after oven drying kg l is the tank length m b is the flume width m and t is the time of collecting sample 30 s n is the number of runoff sediment samples 7 sediment concentration sediment concentration was defined as the sediment weight per unit volume for each runoff sediment sample 11 c m i v i where c is sediment concentration kg m 3 mi is the weight of sediments of each runoff sediment sample after oven drying kg vi is the volume of each runoff sediment sample m3 2 6 data analysis the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the performance of the equations describing the relationship between the interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil slope gradient rainfall intensity and flow parameters in estimating the interrill erosion model based on the two types of soils the dataset of shenmu soil was divided into two groups the dataset sizes for estimating the interrill erosion model and evaluating its performance were 18 and 7 respectively for the ansai soil each dataset size was 18 according to the study of wu et al 2017 overall the datasets for estimating the interrill erosion model and evaluating its performance were 36 and 25 respectively the first group of datasets was used to estimate the interrill erosion models based on the stream power and general flow intensity parameter as well as to derive the coefficient of determination r2 the second group of datasets was used to evaluate the performance of the two models using r2 root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and model efficiency me to evaluate the performance of eqs 1 3 and 4 for the two types of soil r2 was employed the smaller the rmse and rrmse the closer the predicted values to those observed the range of me is from to 1 the closer the value is to 1 the better the model predictions mahmoodabadi et al 2014 the r 2 rmse and me values are obtained as follows thomann 1982 nash and sutcliffe 1970 12 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2

predicted values respectively n is the total number of paired values 3 results 3 1 full temporal evolution of runoff and sediment concentration for experiments using shenmu soil fig 3 shows the changes with time in the unit width flow discharge q and sediment concentration c for different slope gradients and rainfall intensities the change in the unit width flow discharge with increasing time had three patterns r fl i and fl in the r fl pattern the unit width flow discharge first increased and then fluctuated during the rainfall duration accounting for 12 25 of all experimental tests in the i pattern the unit width flow discharge gradually increased throughout the rainfall duration in the fl pattern the unit width flow discharge fluctuated with the rainfall time the i and fl patterns accounted for 12 25 and 1 25 of all experimental tests respectively in the beginning the soil maximum infiltration rate was greater than the rainfall intensity resulting in no runoff occurred on the slope surface thereafter the soil infiltration rate gradually decreased with the rainfall duration when the rainfall intensity was greater than the soil infiltration rate the runoff occurred then the soil infiltration rate continued to decrease and the runoff rate continued to increase finally when the soil infiltration rate reached a stable infiltration rate the runoff rate became stable besides the fluctuation of rainfall runoff may be due to the temporary blocking of the runoff path which is caused by the accumulation of soil particles due to the change of surface microtopography during rainfall therefore if the soil infiltration rate finally reached the stable infiltration rate the runoff rate curve first rose and then fluctuated r fl if the soil infiltration rate did not reach the stable infiltration rate the runoff rate curve would always rise i or fluctuate fl the changes in the sediment concentration with time can be classified into three patterns first in the f r pattern the sediment concentration first decreased and then increased with increasing rainfall duration accounting for 18 25 of all experimental tests in the second pattern i the sediment concentration constantly increased with the rainfall duration in the last pattern r fl the sediment concentration first increased and then fluctuated with increasing rainfall duration the proportions of i and r fl were 5 25 and 2 25 of all experimental tests respectively based on the study of martinezmena et al 2002 a negative relationship between the unit width flow discharge and sediment concentration indicated that the pattern of interrill erosion was a detachment limited process in this period however as q increased c also gradually increased hence a positive relationship between q and c was observed indicating that the sediment transport limited process existed in this situation accordingly as shown in fig 3 the interrill erosion mechanism can be classified into two types d t and t patterns the d t pattern indicated the occurrence of detachment limited interrill erosion during the initial rainfall period then followed by the transport limited interrill erosion during the remaining rainfall time the critical times when the detachment limited process shifted to a transport limited process are listed in table 4 the t pattern signified transport limited interrill erosion throughout the rainfall duration the table also lists the interrill erosion mechanism for each combination of rainfall intensity and slope gradient meanwhile the interrill erosion process of the d t and t patterns accounted for 18 25 and 7 25 of the interrill erosion mechanism observed respectively fig 4 shows the relationship between the sediment concentration and unit width flow discharge in general a positive linear relationship between the unit width flow discharge and sediment concentration was observed in this study indicating that the dominant erosion process was transport limited in some cases the sediment concentration first decreased and then increased as the unit width flow discharge increased the explanation is that the decrease in sediment concentration may be due to the progressive exhaustion of fine sediment loosened by raindrop impact prior to the initiation of runoff then the runoff depth 0 44 0 89 mm in this study has little effect on the soil detachment ability of raindrops leads to the sufficient supply of detached soil particles resulting an increase of sediment concentration 3 2 effect of slope gradient and rainfall intensity on interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil table 5 summarises the measured unit width flow discharges and calculated mean flow velocities flow depths and interrill erosion rates of 25 combinations of slope gradients and rainfall intensities fig 5 shows the relationship between the interrill erosion rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient the interrill erosion rate was significantly influenced by rainfall intensity and slope gradient by data fitting the interrill erosion rate was observed to increase in terms of its power function with increasing rainfall intensity at a certain slope gradient this relationship also existed between the interrill erosion rate and slope gradient at a certain rainfall intensity based on multiple regression analysis eq 16 was derived to predict the interrill erosion rate the power exponent of the slope gradient was smaller than that of the rainfall intensity indicating that the interrill erosion rate was more sensitive to the rainfall intensity than to the slope gradient 16 d i

mean flow velocities under each combination of rainfall intensity and slope gradient are summarised in table 6 based on the list at a certain slope gradient the mean flow velocity increased with the rainfall intensity however when the intensity exceeded 120 mm h 1 the effect of rainfall intensity on the flow velocity gradually decreased this indicates that when the rainfall intensity increases the flow turbulence intensifies and the energy consumed by the turbulence increases reducing the rate of increase of flow velocity specifically on average the mean flow velocity increased by 94 with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients under a certain rainfall intensity the mean flow velocity increased with the slope gradient in particular as the rainfall intensity increased the contribution of the slope gradient to the varying mean flow velocity gradually increased however when the slope gradient exceeded 0 309 it only had a minimal effect on the mean flow velocity as for the five rainfall intensities on average the mean flow velocity increased by 76 with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 this indicates that the mean flow velocity is more sensitive to the rainfall intensity than to the slope gradient fig 6 a displays the relationship between the mean flow velocity and interrill erosion rate it is observed that the interrill erosion rate increases as a power function with the mean flow velocity the power exponent is equal to 3 89 by data fitting the regression equation representing the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and mean flow velocity can be written as follow 17 d i 25 05 u 3 89 r 2 0 92 n 25 3 3 2 relationship between interrill erosion rate and shear stress the shear stresses under different test conditions are listed in table 7 it is observed that under the same rainfall intensity condition the shear stress gradually increases with increasing slope gradient specifically for the five rainfall intensities the shear stress increased by 106 on average with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 when the slope gradients were 0 1564 and 0 2079 the shear stress exhibited no distinct variation with the increase in rainfall intensity as the slope gradient exceeded 0 2079 the shear stress sharply increased with the rainfall intensity in particular the shear stress increased by 62 on average with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients this indicates that the shear stress is more sensitive to the slope gradient than to the rainfall intensity fig 6 b displays the relationship between the shear stress and interrill erosion rate indicating that the interrill erosion rate is directly proportional to 2 56 times the magnitude of the shear stress by data fitting the regression equation reflecting the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and shear stress can be written as 18 d i 6 95 10 4 œÑ 2 56 r 2 0 84 n 25 where d i denotes the interrill erosion rate kg m 2 s 1 3 3 3 relationship between interrill erosion rate and stream power the stream power w values under different test conditions are listed in table 8 it is observed that at a certain slope gradient the stream power increases with the rainfall intensity in particular the stream power increased by 204 on average with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients under a certain rainfall condition the stream power increased with increasing slope gradient specifically for the five rainfall intensities the stream power increased by 256 on average with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 this indicates that the stream power is more sensitive to the slope gradient than to the rainfall intensity see table 8 fig 6 c shows the relationship between the stream power and interrill erosion rate it can be concluded that the interrill erosion rate was directly proportional to the stream power with a power exponent of 1 70 after data fitting the following expression for the interrill erosion rate was derived 19 d i 0 057 w 1 70 r 2 0 96 n 25 by definition the stream power is the product of shear stress œÑ and mean flow velocity u œÑ is related to the slope gradient and flow depth thus the stream power involves more hydraulic parameters than the shear stress this implies that the calculation for the interrill erosion rate using the stream power can provide more accurate results 3 3 4 relationship between interrill erosion rate and unit stream power the unit stream power reflects the variation rate of the water potential energy per unit weight over time and also denotes the energy of water per unit weight consumed in the sediment transport therefore the total sediment content or total sediment runoff must be directly related to the unit stream power the calculated unit stream power is listed in table 9 it is observed that at a certain slope gradient the unit stream power increases with the rainfall intensity when the rainfall exceeded 120 mm h 1 the unit stream power slightly increased in particular the stream power increased by 93 on average with a 60 140 mm h 1 rainfall intensity range for the five slope gradients under a certain rainfall intensity the unit stream power increased with the slope gradient specifically for the five rainfall intensities stream power increased by 304 on average with a slope gradient range of 0 1564 0 3584 this indicates that the effect of the slope gradient on the unit stream power variation is significantly larger than that induced by varying the rainfall intensity fig 6 d shows the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and unit stream power moreover eq 20 shows that the interrill erosion rate is directly proportional to the unit stream power with a power exponent of 2 05 by data fitting the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and unit stream power can be expressed as follows 20 d i 5 11 p 2 05 r 2 0 82 n 25 3 4 interrill erosion rate model based on stream power for two types of soils as shown in fig 6 among the flow parameters i e mean flow velocity r2 0 92 shear stress r2 0 84 stream power r2 0 96 and unit stream power r2 0 82 stream power is found adequate for predicting the interrill erosion rate in terms of r2 these results agree with those of the study of wu et al 2017 in which the stream power is also found to be the optimal predictor for the interrill erosion rate fig 7 a shows the relationship between the interrill erosion rate and stream power for the two types of soil although there was a partition phenomenon in the relationship curves between the interrill erosion rate and stream power for the two types of soil the interrill erosion rate was correlated to the stream power with a power function according to the experimental data the interrill erosion rate prediction model can be expressed as eq 21 fig 7 b illustrates the predicted interrill erosion rate versus the observed values it was found that the data points were more dispersed with high rrmse 68 and low values of r2 0 37 and me 0 20 indicating that the prediction accuracy of model results based on the stream power was low d i 0 021 w 0 97 r 2 0 79 n 36 21 3 5 interrill erosion rate model based on general flow intensity parameter for two types of soils based on their definitions the shear stress stream power and unit stream power were all found to be derived from the mean flow velocity mean flow depth and slope gradient accordingly a general flow intensity parameter can be derived from these three basic hydraulic parameters to predict the interrill erosion rate the general flow intensity parameter can be expressed as 22 Œ∑ k u a h b j c where Œ∑ is the general flow intensity parameter k is the proportionality coefficient related to the median soil grain diameter and flow condition a b and c are the power exponents as summarised in table 10 different flow intensity parameters can be obtained when k a b and c are assigned different values the interrill erosion rate can be affected by flow conditions including flow velocity flow depth slope gradient and gravity it is also sensitive to the physical properties of flow and soil hence the median soil grain diameter was considered for establishing the interrill erosion rate model based on the general flow intensity parameter to improve the accuracy of this model sha 1965 found that there was an existing power function between the bed sediment transport capacity and variables the general interrill erosion rate model can be established as 23 d i a Œ∑ b d 50 t where a is constant b and t are power exponents substituting eq 22 into eq 23 yields 24 d i k 1 u m h n j s d 50 t where k 1 is constant m n s and t are power exponents the comprehensive form of the interrill erosion rate model is shown in eq 24 by means of multiple regression analysis using spss statistics 19 software the interrill erosion rate model eq 25 is obtained fig 8 a 25 d i 0 60 u 2 346 h 1 367 j 0 922 d 50 1 23 r 2 0 99 n 36 fig 8 b shows the comparison between the measured interrill erosion rate and that predicted by eq 25 the comparison indicates that the model accurately predicts the interrill erosion rate based on the general flow intensity parameter with high values of r2 0 96 and me 0 94 and low rrmse 18 9 4 discussion 4 1 interrill erosion process mechanism of shenmu soil in this study the dominant soil erosion mechanism is the sediment transport limited process this agrees with the study of zhang and wang 2017 in which the average interrill erosion rates per unit area are found to decrease as the slope length increases from 80 to 200 cm the splash rates remain practically unchanged along the slope demonstrating that sediment transport is the limiting process however this result is not consistent with the study of martinezmena et al 2002 who demonstrated that the predominant erosion process depended on the rainfall intensity with a prevailing detachment limited condition in high intensity events and prevailing transport limited conditions in those events of medium intensity a plausible reason for this is the effect of flow depth on sediment transport that is the soil particle detachment rate decreases as the flow depth increases from 0 to 2 mm diameter of a single drop in contrast the sediment transport rate generally increases and then decreases as the flow depth increases from 0 to 2 mm and then from 2 to 6 mm respectively kinnell 1991 furthermore zhang and wang 2017 found that optimal flow depth for the maximal transport enhancement under the raindrop impact was 0 1 mm it was also found that the sediment transport patterns were the transport by raindrop induced rolling or creeping when the flow depth was 0 1 mm the transport by flow driven rolling or sliding for flow depths ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 mm and the transport by flow driven saltation when the flow depth exceeded 0 3 mm in this study the mean flow depth range was 0 468 0 91 mm hence the influence of flow depth on soil detachment was negligible because a flow depth of 1 mm was considerably shallow to restrict raindrop detachment parsons et al 1994 however the sediment transport rate did not reach the maximum because of the flow depth limitation resulting in the sediment transport limited process therefore it can be inferred that the detachment and transport mechanism of the shenmu soil interill erosion in this study was raindrop induced and flow driven saltation as well as flow driven rolling respectively 4 2 relationship between interrill erosion model and flow parameters in the present work a power function is found to exist between the interrill erosion rate and shear stress this result is consistent with the findings of van liew and saxton 1983 fan and wu 1999 and zhang et al 2008 in contrast fox and bryan 2000 found that a linear function exists between the overland flow erosion rate and shear stress however r 2 is only 0 23 this implies that the power function between the interrill erosion rate and shear stress is more suitable as shown in fig 6 the correlation between the interrill erosion rate and flow velocity r 2 0 92 is better than that between the sediment transport and shear stress r 2 0 84 the results obtained in this study are consistent with the results of wu et al 2016 they proposed a more accurate sediment transport prediction based on mean flow velocity however the results obtained in this study contradict the results of zhang et al 2009 their work demonstrated that shear stress was a better predictor for sediment transport than flow velocity this inconsistency is mainly attributed to the property differences between the two soils used in the experiments the soil used by zhang et al 2009 was cohesionless sediments collected from the yongding river bed near beijing whereas the soil in this study and that of wu et al 2016 were viscous sediments collected from the loess plateau therefore it can be concluded that the incipience of viscous sediments on a riverbed is mainly controlled by the flow velocity for the sediment incipience or blowing whereas the adoption of shear stress as the control condition is more appropriate for cohesionless sediments in this study a power function is found to exist between the interrill erosion rate and stream power this result is consistent with the reports of other researchers zhang et al 2003 xiao et al 2017 however these results contradict those of cao et al 2013 they demonstrated that a linear function existed between the sheet erosion rate and stream power with a slope gradient range of 4 26 8 however for shenmu soil the interrill erosion was investigated with a slope gradient range of 15 64 35 84 indicating that the linear relationship cannot be extended to steep slope gradients in this work the interrill erosion rate is found to be directly proportional to the unit stream power with a power exponent of 2 05 this agreed with the findings of ali et al 2011 ali et al 2013 who concluded that the sediment transport can be modelled as a power function of the unit stream power however this outcome was contrary to that of li et al 2019 who found that linear function was superior to the power function relationship between the overland flow soil detachment and unit stream power when the unit stream power was equal to or even less than the critical value the soil detachment should be approximately zero or negative according to the linear function relationship thus limiting its use under other experimental conditions such as low flow discharge and gentle slope gradient 4 3 performance of existing interrill erosion models for two types of soil it is finally concluded that the general flow intensity parameter performs well in predicting the interrill erosion rate of the two types of soil other researchers also used variable parameters to predict the sheet erosion rate e g eqs 1 3 and 4 table 11 summarises the performance rates of existing interrill erosion models and interrill erodibility coefficients for the two types of soil among eqs 1 3 and 4 eq 3 which was proposed by bulygin et al 2002 performed well in predicting the interrill erosion rate of the two types of soil the interrill erodibility coefficients k i deduced using eq 4 was 402 for shenmu soil and 222 for ansai soil respectively this demonstrated that the erodibility of shenmu soil is more considerable than that of ansai soil these results agree with the influence of soil texture on the interrill erodibility in the present study shenmu sand loess with a 6 6 clay content was investigated whereas in the study of wu et al 2017 ansai soil with a higher clay content 8 49 was examined this soil condition affects the interrill erodibility because it generally decreases with the clay content of soil moreover eq 4 proposed by zhang and wang 2017 performed better in predicting the interrill erosion rate for ansai soil r2 0 74 than that for shenmu soil r2 0 65 a probable explanation is that the sequence of detachment and transport mechanisms varies under different experimental conditions resulting in the limitation of one model to predict the interrill erosion rate based on different data kinnell 2020 furthermore the interrill erosion per unit area first increased and then decreased as the slope length increased from 0 to 4 m the critical slope length was between 2 5 and 3 3 m zhang et al 2017 the 1 4 m slope length applied to the study of wu et al 2017 was included in the experimental slope length 2 m under the model formulation condition of zhang and wang 2017 however for shenmu soil the interrill erosion was investigated with a slope length of 3 m which exceeded the condition under which the model eq 4 was established in addition as reported by hessel and jetten 2007 the suitability of an equation depends on the local conditions accordingly further investigations on the general soil erosion model based on considerable amounts of experimental data are necessary 5 conclusions in this study the interrill erosion in the region with high and coarse sediment yields has been studied with steep slope gradients in simulated rainfall experiments according to the relationship between the unit width flow discharge and sediment concentration the interrill erosion mechanism of shenmu soil in this study can be classified into two types one type involves the detachment limited interrill erosion in the initial phrase and then transport limited interrill erosion in the subsequent rainfall duration the other type involves the transport limited interrill erosion throughout the rainfall duration in the simulated rainfall experiments the interrill erosion rate increased according to a power function relationship with the flow intensity parameter specifically the interrill erosion rate was found to be directly proportional to the shear stress mean flow velocity stream power and unit stream power with exponential powers of 2 56 3 89 1 70 and 2 05 respectively among the flow parameters i e shear stress r 2 0 84 mean flow velocity r 2 0 92 stream power r 2 0 96 and unit stream power r 2 0 82 the stream power was found adequate for predicting the interrill erosion rate of shenmu soil in terms of r 2 however for the two types of soil the interrill erosion model derived based on the stream power exhibited inadequate prediction accuracy with high rrmse 68 and low values of r2 0 37 and me 0 20 according to the analysis of the four flow intensity parameters i e shear stress mean flow velocity stream power and unit stream power the general flow intensity parameter was obtained to predict the interrill erosion rate on overland flow finally an empirical formula for predicting the interrill erosion rate was established by multiple regression analysis based on the general flow intensity parameter equation 25 also performed well in predicting the interrill erosion rate of the two types of soils with high values of r2 0 96 and me 0 94 and low rrmse 16 8 this empirical formula is based on the laboratory runoff plot tests of the two types of soil this derived formula should be used judiciously when predicting the soil erosion rate under conditions that differ from those of this research the results obtained in this study are anticipated to provide a theoretical basis for the investigation of the slope soil loss model 6 data availability all data used during the study are available from the corresponding author by request we declare that we do

5023,evapotranspiration et is a key component in terrestrial climate and vegetation interactions a generalized complementary relationship proposed by brutsaert 2015 brutsaert et al 2020 has been shown to be a powerful tool for et estimation as the single parameter in the generalized complementary relationship it is generally accepted that Œ±c has high spatial variability and is closely correlated to the land surface conditions however understanding of the temporal variability in Œ±c is also important in a changing environment in this study we investigated the impacts of climate change and revegetation on et by establishing the relationship between Œ±c and the climatic vegetation factors in 14 catchments of the loess plateau the results showed that Œ±c presented both spatial and temporal variability where the aridity index ai and the average normalized difference vegetation index ndvi during the growing season are two dominant factors that control the variability in Œ±c furthermore combing the generalized complementary relationship and the empirical model of Œ±c proposed in this study the impacts of climate change and revegetation on the et increase were quantified in the loess plateau the results show that climate change mainly expressed by an increase in precipitation contributed the most to the et increase approximately 68 on average whereas revegetation quantified by the ndvi increase also played a dominant role approximately 32 on average in the et increase which suggests that revegetation planning management should pay more attention to the increased water consumption by evapotranspiration in the sustainable economic and ecological development of the loess plateau keywords evapotranspiration complementary relationship parameter Œ±c climate change revegetation 1 introduction the exchange of water through the continuum of the atmosphere soil and vegetation spac is an important process in the global energy water and carbon cycles as a key climate variable evapotranspiration et links these cycles and plays an important role in climate soil vegetation interactions yang et al 2009 compared with streamflow and precipitation et is more difficult to measure directly or estimate using standard observations in practice due to data requirements and nonideal conditions mcmahon et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 a better estimate and understanding of et attributed to climate change and revegetation over a range of spatial and temporal scales can help explain the complex interactions between global and regional energy water and carbon cycles however it is difficult to discriminate the impacts of different factors on et due to the collective influences of changes in climate and vegetation conditions the elasticity method has been proven to be capable of quantifying the contributions of climatic and anthropogenic factors to hydrological variables e g runoff q and et liang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li et al 2020 to apply the elasticity method to et studies we need to explicitly model the dependence of et on climate and vegetation factors over the years a number of methods for estimating et have been developed among them the complementary principle has received more attention over the years due to its simple mathematical expression physical plausibility and accessible input datasets brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 brutsaert and parlange 1998 ram√≠rez 2005 the complementary relationship between evapotranspiration demand and actual evapotranspiration was first set forth by bouchet 1963 with a linear equation and this original complementary principle involved only one boundary condition since bouchet s original linear equation is physically realistic several studies have tried to accurately interpret and implement this concept in practice e g brutsaert and stricker 1979 parlange and katul 1992 zhang et al 2001 sugita et al 2001 xu and singh 2005 yang et al 2013 to provide a more rigorous base and help clarify some uncertainties for the original complementary principle brutsaert 2015 brutsaert et al 2020 proposed a nonlinear complementary relationship that invokes three additional but necessary boundary conditions based on strictly physical considerations brutsaert 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 brutsaert et al 2020 this new nonlinear complementary relationship has been tested and applied at several sites or catchments under different climate and vegetation conditions and has a convincing predictive power liu et al 2016 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2017 brutsaert et al 2017 2020 ai et al 2017 hu et al 2018 gao et al 2018 in addition to a reliable estimate of et the generalized complementary relationship proposed by brutsaert 2015 brutsaert et al 2020 offers the opportunity to discriminate the contribution of climate and vegetation factors as the climatic factors are explicitly included in the model description and the variability of the single parameter in the generalized complementary relationship has been found mainly related to the land surface conditions of the catchments including climate characteristics and vegetation conditions for climatic characteristics the aridity index ai has been shown to alter the parameter in the eastern monsoon region of china liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 established the relationship between ai and the parameter for 524 catchments in different parts of the world additionally some studies have shown that vegetation conditions may influence a single parameter of the nonlinear complementary relationship zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2018a 2018b hu et al 2018 however most of these studies analyzed the relationship between the related characteristics of the land surface and the single parameter on the multi year average scale which may overwhelm the complementary relationship s superiority in et estimation on the annual scale in addition limited research has been conducted to investigate the variability in the single parameter and its driving factors in regions undergoing significant vegetation changes the objective of this study was to i improve the generalized complementary relationship by quantitatively relating its single parameter Œ±c to climate and vegetation variables and ii quantify the relative contribution of climate change and revegetation on et by applying the elasticity method to the improved complementary relationship we tested our new method in the loess plateau of china where a well known revegetation program has been in operation for approximately 60 years to reduce floods and sediment restore ecological degradation and improve carbon sequestration liu et al 2008 through the implementation of these projects soil erosion and ecological degradation have been significantly mitigated recently however the newly planted vegetation needs more water to grow which inevitably increases the consumption such as et of substantial water resources this contradiction has attracted many scholars to explore the impacts of revegetation on the water cycle under climate change e g mcvicar et al 2007 2010 zhang et al 2009 liang et al 2015 feng et al 2016 since et is more difficult to measure and estimate with standard meteorological observations limited studies have specifically described the annual et change process and quantitatively analyzed the impacts of revegetation and climate change on et in this region however by investigating the relationship between the single parameter of the nonlinear complementary relationship and the descriptors of climatic status and vegetation conditions the nonlinear complementary relationship that can estimate annual et allows us to further explore the et changing process under the significant vegetation variation and climate change in the loess plateau 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as one of the regions with the most serious soil erosion and the most ecologically fragile areas in the world the loess plateau 100 e 116 e 31 n 43 n is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin which has a population of 97 81 million and a cultivated area of 12 000 km2 fig 1 the loess plateau belongs to an arid and semiarid continental climate region with annual mean precipitation ranging from 150 mm to 750 mm the annual precipitation in this region shows strong seasonality and approximately 60 70 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in the flood season june september except for a few stony mountain areas the thickness of the loess on the surface is between 50 and 80 m which results in serious erosion in the loess plateau to prevent soil erosion and ecosystem degradation and ensure sustainable development in the loess plateau the chinese government initiated a series of ecological restoration programs since 1950s such as the grain for green project gfg and the nature forest grassland protection project nfpp specifically the large scale revegetation program belonging to the gfg has been operating since 1999 zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 as a result many previously cultivated lands have been converted to perennial vegetation such as forest and grass which will inevitably influence the water cycle in this region hence 14 main catchments across the loess plateau their distribution is shown in fig 1 were selected to investigate the mechanism of et response to the revegetation program under the context of climate change table 1 summarizes the hydrometeorological characteristics of these catchments 2 2 data the meteorological datasets from 62 meteorological stations within the loess plateau were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration their locations are shown in fig 1 the meteorological data include daily precipitation p average air temperature t wind speed at 10 m u10 sunshine duration s and relative humidity rh from 1981 to 2014 additionally daily solar net radiation rn at the national meteorological stations was calculated using the method recommended by allen et al 1998 involving daily sunshine duration the daily ground

u 2 u r 2 z r 1 7 where zr is the height of the wind speed which is taken as 10 m in this study all the meteorological elements mentioned above were spatially averaged by the thiessen polygons method using arcgis software in addition the monthly stream discharge data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china for 14 hydrological stations their locations are shown in fig 1 to calculate the change in terrestrial soil water storage and soil moisture content Œ∏ mm of the catchments monthly soil moisture Œ∏m kg m2 data derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model rodell et al 2004 were used in this study these soil moisture datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 from 1981 to 2013 and represent the soil moisture content conditions between 0 and 2000 mm depth in addition to investigate the impacts of vegetation conditions on the value of the single parameter in the complementary principle the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data sets from 1981 to 2014 were derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor 3 methodology 3 1 generalized nonlinear complementary relationship bouchet 1963 postulated that the actual evapotranspiration et from a sufficiently large natural land surface under non moist conditions and the potential evapotranspiration epa which represents evapotranspiration demand and can occur on a small saturated surface under the same environment as et exhibiting a complementary relationship while another potential evapotranspiration epo which is defined following thornthwaite 1948 when et and epa are assumed under conditions of ample water supply brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert et al 2020 is introduced bouchet 1963 proposed that the complementary relationship can be expressed as the exact equality between the values of epo et and epa epo and it can yield the following linear relationship 2 et 2 e po e pa subsequently brutsaert and parlange 1998 extended eq 2 by assuming that the relationship between epo et and epa epo is not symmetrical and exactly equal but proportional which can be expressed as follows 3 et b 1 e po e pa b where b is a coefficient however when the values of epa are large enough under strongly advective conditions the values of et in eqs 2 and 3 may be negative to avoid this unrealistic possibility brutsaert 2015 postulated a more general complementary relationship 4 e pa e po e pa f e po e t e pa where f is the function determined by brutsaert 2015 since epo estimation is difficult in normal conditions that are non potential brutsaert et al 2020 argued that the complementary deviations of et and epa do not have to be from the potential evaporation epo as the base and further introduced a more flexible base denoted as Œ± c e e into eq 4 the improved complementary principle can be expressed as follows 5 et Œ± c e e e pa 2 2 e pa Œ± c e e where Œ±c is an adjustable parameter which is also the single parameter in the improved complementary relationship ee is the equilibrium evapotranspiration defined by slatyer and mcilroy 1961 and epa estimation

represent potential evaporation epo specifically Œ± c e e will infinitely approach epo i e Œ± c e e e po when the surface has a sufficient water supply i e the surface is under potential conditions and the value of Œ±c will close to priestley and taylor s coefficient of 1 26 priestley and taylor 1972 whenever there is no longer an ample water supply or under the non potential conditions Œ± c e e will always be an intermediate term between et and epa i e et Œ± c e e e pa and the value of Œ±c will become smaller than 1 26 and then Œ± c e e and Œ±c will be sufficiently small when the ambient conditions become extremely dry and or windy brutsaert et al 2020 apparently the improved complementary principle i e eq 5 is more flexible and tenable for et estimation in practice and the single parameter Œ±c can flexibly vary from sufficiently small when the surface conditions are extremely dry and or windy to a value of around 1 26 when the surface is under potential conditions to make the complementary principle flexible and accurately estimate et under different water and energy supply conditions therefore the improved complementary principle i e eq 5 is selected to estimate and analyze et in our study 3 2 annual water balance in catchments in all 14 catchments located in the loess plateau the value of the annual observed et is calculated by the water balance equation 8 et p q d Œ¥ s where p represents the annual precipitation mm yr q represents the annual runoff mm yr d is the annual groundwater recharge mm yr and Œ¥ s is the annual change in soil water storage mm yr as the unsaturated zone and the groundwater system are very deep and the root depth is less than 2 m in the loess plateau gao et al 2017 schenk and jackson 2005 the water exchange between the groundwater system and the unsaturated zone is very small and can be neglected i e d 0 zhang et al 2014 besides the change of yearly soil moisture content Œ∏ between 0 and 2000 mm which was aggregated from the soil moisture of gldas was used to succinctly represent the value of Œ¥ s in this study notably the gldas datasets were generated by integrating satellite and ground based observational data products using land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 and this dataset can produce global high resolution with a 0 25 0 25 resolution and continuous soil moisture datasets that have been applied in many prior studies and have been proven to be rational and reliable for example syed et al 2008 found that global gldas simulations are in good agreement with those obtained from grace based storage changes which provides first estimates of land water storage variations by monitoring the time variable component of earth s gravity field cheng 2012 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2015 and bi et al 2016 found that gldas soil moisture data can better describe the surface soil moisture status in china compared with other data product sets and liu et al 2016 used gldas soil moisture to quantify the monthly water storage change for 241 catchments in the eastern monsoon region of china and proved the practicability of gldas soil moisture data in the loess plateau liu et al 2018a 2018b proved that gldas soil moisture data has the satisfactory results in this region by comparing field measurements of top 10 cm soil moisture in cropland with the gldas soil moisture data feng et al 2016 used gldas soil moisture data quantitatively described the water storage change for estimating water balance in the loess plateau therefore based on evidences from theses previous studies the gldas soil moisture data Œ∏ between 0 and 2000 mm was selected to estimate the soil water storage change in the loess plateau in this study 3 3 description of the predictors of Œ±c both the land surface climate conditions liu et al 2016 and vegetation conditions zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 have been found to control the variability in Œ±c in some prior studies for the near surface climate status the basic climatic factors such as p temperature terms tmean tmax tmin rh u2 and s are usually considered as the important indicators and these factors can be roughly divided into two types water elements and energy elements moreover the latitude and distance to the ocean of the sits or catchments has been proven to affect the value of Œ±c by yang et al 2008 thus ai i e ai e pa p which not only tend to be closely correlated with the latitude and distance to the ocean of the sits or catchments liu et al 2016 but also combines two type climatic factors water elements and energy elements that controls the rate of the evaporation budyko 1974 has been selected as the preferred predictor to simulate the parameter Œ±c by previous studies at the small catchment scale liu et al 2016 found a significant negative correlation between Œ±c and ai across the eastern monsoon region of china and brutsaert et al 2020 confirmed the strong correlation between Œ±c and ai across 524 catchments in different regions of the world and both of them proposed empirical formulas for Œ±c estimation at the long term average scale therefore to investigate the impacts of climate status on the temporal and spatial variability in Œ±c across 14 catchments in the loess plateau the annual ai is selected as the climatic predictor of Œ±c in this study as transpiration is one of the important features of the biological processes that play a key role in the catchment water balance rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 considering or introducing vegetation dynamic in the evapotranspiration estimation has proven to be important donohue et al 2007 for the impacts of vegetation dynamic on the generalized complementary relationship zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 and liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018b found that the variation in vegetation conditions can affect the spatial and temporal variability in Œ±c besides the significant vegetation changes over several years in the loess plateau will undoubtedly result in changes of evapotranspiration in order to describe and simulate the interannual variation of parameter Œ±c in the loess plateau more comprehensively it is decided to use the ndvi during the growing season april october as the vegetation predictor of Œ±c in this study while the ndvi has been widely used to describe vegetation characteristics such as plant growth conditions and plant structure in many hydrology and ecology studies e g yang et al 2009 li et al 2013 feng et al 2016 to summarize two dimensionless indices defined as ai and ndvi are selected to describe the characteristics of climate and vegetation conditions which are the potential factors affecting the variability in Œ±c in this study 3 4 modeling Œ±c based on the statistical analysis between the parameter Œ±c which was calculated by inversion eqs 5 7 using the observations and the explanatory predictors of catchment characteristics listed in section 3 3 an empirical model is considered to reveal the potential relationship between annual Œ±c and two key descriptors for climate status and vegetation conditions which are denoted as ai and ndvi the experiential model used to calculate the annual parameter Œ±c can be expressed as follows 9 Œ± c f a i n d v i where f is a function to be determined and the parameter Œ±c obtained in this way is called the basin specific modeled Œ±c which is denoted as Œ± c the objective of this nonlinear model for calculating Œ±c is to minimize the mean squared errors between the annual observed et calculated by the water balance equation i e equation 8 and the modeled annual evapotranspiration e t calculated by eq 5 with Œ± c the objective function can be expressed as follows 10 f obj min i n e t i e t i 2 min i n e t i Œ± c e ei e pai 2 2 e pai Œ± c e ei 2 where i is the year and n is the data set length in the time series therefore the performance of this nonlinear model can be evaluated by i comparing the values of Œ±c calculated by eqs 5 7 using the observations against the values of the simulated Œ± c and ii comparing the observed value of annual et against the modeled annual et the pearson s correlation coefficient r determination coefficient r 2 and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the performance of the nonlinear model and the basic two statistics can be estimated by the following equations 11 r i n x i x y i y i n x i x 2 i n x i x 2 12 rmse 1 n i n y i x i 2 where x i n x i n and y i n y i n are the average of the observed variable xi and the average of the simulated variable yi i 1 2 n respectively n is the number of spatial steps 3 5 elasticity method the second objective of this paper is to quantify the contribution of climate change and revegetation to et change the concept of the elasticity method was first introduced to assess the impact of climate change on hydrology by schaake 1990 and since then it has been widely used to quantify the elasticity and contribution of climatic and anthropogenic factors to runoff e g fu et al 2007 zheng et al 2009 yang and yang 2011 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2016 according to yang and yang 2011 and wang et al 2016 we defined the change in et based on the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship eqs 5 7 13 de t d e t d t d t e t d u 2 d u 2 e t d r h d r h e t d s d s e t d Œ± c d Œ± c where e t d represents daily evapotranspiration equation 13 can be rearranged as follows 14 de t d e t d 1 e t d e t d t d t u 2 e t d e t d u 2 d u 2 u 2 rh e t d e t d r h drh rh s e t d e t d s ds s Œ± c e t d e t d Œ± c d Œ±

the elasticity of et with respect to t u2 rh s and Œ±c are expressed as Œµ t 1 et i m e t d t Œµ u 2 u 2 et i m e t d u 2 Œµ rh rh et i m e t d r h Œµ s s et i m e t d s Œµ Œ± c Œ± c et i m e t d Œ± c if there is a significant change such as breakpoint in et during the study period it could be meaningful to analyze the attribution of the changes in related factors to the et change based on eq 15 the change in evapotranspiration Œ¥ e t can be estimated as follows 16 Œ¥ e t Œµ t e t Œ¥ t Œµ u 2 et u 2 Œ¥ u 2 Œµ rh et rh Œ¥ r h Œµ s et s Œ¥ s Œµ Œ± c et Œ± c Œ¥ Œ± c Œ¥ e t t Œ¥ e t u 2 Œ¥ e t rh

the contribution rates of t rh s u2 and Œ± c changes to the total et change 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variability in Œ±c to reflect the influences of different Œ±c values on the complementary relationship i e eq 5 the annual et estimated from the annual water balance equation i e eq 8 and observed climate forcing data were used to reverse the annual parameter Œ±c based on eqs 5 7 fig 2 presents the complementary relationship between epa ee and et ee in 14 catchments across the loess plateau and each data point represents the multi year average values of the single catchment as shown in fig 2 the average values of Œ±c obtained in 14 catchments across the loess plateau are mainly concentrated between 0 7 and 1 0 according to the definition of Œ± c e e the minimum value of Œ±c would be sufficiently small Œ± c 0 when the surface conditions are extremely dry and or windy whenever the water supply of the land surface is ample and the surface is under potential conditions the maximum value of Œ±c will be close to the value of around 1 26 i e roughly within1 0 1 5 priestley and taylor 1972 chen and brutsaert 1995 brutsaert et al 2020 obviously the values of Œ±c obtained in the loess plateau are reasonable according to the definition of Œ±c in addition it is remarkable that the average values of Œ±c shown in fig 2 are generally consistent with the results obtained by brutsaert et al 2020 which indicated that the average values of Œ±c in the loess plateau range from 0 7 to 1 0 see its fig 6 additionally the average values of Œ±c obtained in this study are also close to the values of Œ±c obtained by liu et al 2016 in the eastern monsoon region of china and brutsaert et al 2017 in the loess plateau from fig 2 it is also evident that the complementary relationship between epa ee and et ee based on eq 5 is basin dependent and parameter Œ±c differs from basin to basin moreover the Œ±c values of catchments 1 7 are smaller than those of catchments 8 14 while catchments 1 7 are located at higher latitudes see fig 1 and in more arid zone based on a comparison of the value of ai in table 1 than catchments 8 14 these findings are consistent with the conclusion of yang et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 which pointed out that the value of Œ±c mainly depends on the ai in addition the interannual variability in Œ±c in each catchment across the loess plateau should also be seriously considered as shown in table 2 the differences between the maximum and minimum values of annual Œ±c in all 14 catchments are quite obvious during the study period the spatial and temporal variability in the complementary relationship between epa ee and ea ee may mainly caused by the differences in interannual ee and epa for different catchments however the fact that Œ±c differs from basin to basin and varies year to year calls for more detailed research on exploring the impacts of the spatiotemporal variability in Œ±c on the changes in the complementary relationship between epa ee and et ee in the loess plateau therefore accurate estimation of Œ±c for different basins or regions at the annual scale is meaningful for applying the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship in practice 4 2 relationships among indices of catchment characteristics and Œ±c statistically significant relationships among annual Œ±c which was calculated by inversion eqs 5 7 with annual et from the water balance equation and other observed variables e g epa Œ≥ Œ¥ and r n and two dimensionless indices proposed in section 3 3 were found in 14 catchments of the loess plateau using simple linear pearson s correlation coefficients and the f test fig 3 a and b show the correlations between Œ±c and ai and between Œ±c and ndvi during the growing season april october in all 14 catchments respectively from fig 3a strong negative correlations were found between ai and Œ±c while the absolute value of r reached 0 87 and passed f test at the 99 significance level notably the correlations between Œ±c and ai all passed the f test at the 99 significance level in each catchment the highest value of r was present in catchment 13 i e r 0 97 while the lowest value of r was presented in catchment 5 i e r 0 81 the findings are consistent with the results found by liu et al 2016 in the eastern monsoon region of china and brutsaert et al 2020 in 524 catchments in different parts of the world which showed that the increase in ai will lead to a reduction in Œ±c in addition significant positive correlations were found between Œ±c and ndvi in fig 3b while the value of r is 0 63 and passes f test at the 99 significance level specifically most catchments passed the f test at the 99 significance level while a few catchments catchments 6 10 12 and 13 do not pass this finding can be explained by the notion of evapotranspiration being generated more in regions with more abundant vegetation coverage because Œ±c is usually positively correlated with et 4 3 modeling the empirical formula of Œ±c as shown in fig 3 the parameter Œ±c in the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship proposed by brutsaert et al 2020 is closely correlated with the two dimensionless key descriptors denoted as ai and ndvi for climate status and vegetation conditions in 14 catchments across the loess plateau this finding suggests that the parameter Œ±c can be estimated by these two key descriptors without measured evapotranspiration and runoff data in ungauged basins to model the optimal function f in the empirical model i e eq 9 which can be used to estimate Œ±c all 14 catchments in the loess plateau were separated into two groups catchments 1 4 were used for calibration and the other catchments catchments 5 14 were used for validation considering the boundary conditions of the generalized nonlinear complementary principle and the correlations among ai ndvi and Œ±c the optimal function f was derived from the datasets of catchments 1 4 by using the stepwise regression analysis the final fitted expression of eq 9 was determined as follows 18 Œ± c 3 03 n d v i 0 14 1 a i 0 84 the negative correlation between Œ±c and ai presented in this empirical equation is consistent with liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 the new finding here is that the temporal and spatial variability in Œ±c also has a positive correlation with ndvi in the loess plateau as the large scale revegetation program has been under operation considering only the impact of climate variability i e ai would unintentionally miss the impact of vegetation changes on Œ±c and et in this region in fact the vegetation dynamic is closer to steady state on a multi year average scale which remove short or medium variability based on this previous studies such as liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 naturally and reasonably ignore the impacts of vegetation changes when fitting the empirical formula of parameter Œ±c on a multi year average scale however one of the most important objectives of this study is to investigate the Œ±c and et variability on the annual scale and the dramatic vegetation change in the loess plateau will disturb steady state conditions within catchments alter original processes of evapotranspiration and make the accurate estimation of et more complicated on the annual scale donohue et al 2007 thus the dimensionless indices of vegetation conditions denoted as ndvi were introduced into the empirical eq 18 to optimize the fitting calculation of the parameter Œ±c in this study as shown in table 3 the introduction of ndvi does improve the simulation accuracy of the parameter Œ±c and et which confirms the rationality and reliability of the empirical formula eq 18 on the other hand 4 4 validation of the empirical formula of Œ±c to validate the empirical formula of Œ±c the datasets from catchments 5 14 which are selected to validate the performance of the empirical formula of Œ±c are used in this section fig 4 compares the annual Œ±c which is estimated using eqs 5 7 with the annual et from the water balance equation and other observed variables against the simulated annual Œ± c by the empirical formula i e eq 18 for catchments 5 14 good agreement can be found with the coefficients of determination r2 all above 0 70 and the rmse within 0 13 in each validation catchment notably this empirical formula of Œ± c is not affected by the choice of catchments to calibrate parameter Œ±c and the expression of the empirical formula is robust and does not change much with the catchments used for calibration changes for example if catchments 11 14 were selected as the catchments to calibrate the empirical formal of Œ± c the optimal empirical formula can be expressed as 19 Œ± c 3 06 n d v i 0 28 1 a i 0 80 which indicates that the basic relationship between the parameter Œ±c and the two dimensionless key descriptors denoted as ai and ndvi obtained in eq 18 is reasonable and credible and according to different calibration validation procedures the current format and coefficients of the empirical formula are similar or close to the optimal values additionally the empirical formula of Œ±c is used together with eq 5 to validate the annual et estimation for all 14 catchments in the loess plateau as indicated by the results in fig 5 the actual evapotranspiration e t simulated by eq 5 with the empirical formula of Œ± c can well explain the changing process of et calculated by the water balance equation i e eq 8 in the loess plateau the rmse between et and et are all smaller than 81 mm in each catchment these results indicate that parameter Œ±c can be calculated by using the empirical formula i e eq 18 with the indices of catchment characteristics which mainly include dimensionless key descriptors for climate status ai and vegetation conditions ndvi and the simulated Œ± c is reliable and robust for estimating annual et 4 5 impacts of revegetation and climate change on et in addition to the results of the et validation in fig 5 it is worth noting that the annual et from 1981 to 2014 in all 14 catchments had an increasing trend of approximately 17 mm decade 1 since the loess plateau is a typical water limited area in china the growing water consumption caused by increased et will be a great challenge for the sustainable use of water resources in this region in addition to climate change some prior studies found that revegetation is a main reason for changes in the water cycles i e r decline et increase in the loess plateau e g mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 liang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 feng et al 2016 in this study as the single parameter Œ±c in the complementary principle was found to be closely related to the ndvi during the growing season it allows us to better understand the impacts of revegetation and climate change on the et increase in the loess plateau 4 5 1 temporal trend analysis and breakpoint detection of variables the temporal trends of annual climatic and hydrological variables for the 14 catchments were examined using the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 the results are shown in table 4 significantly positive trends in t and ndvi were found in all 14 catchments which is consistent with the warming phenomenon reported across china during the past 50 years li et al 2018 and the revegetation program in the loess plateau the annual et represented an increasing trend of 17 mm decade on average but in most catchments this value could not pass the significant trend test similarly the annual p increased slightly in most catchments catchments 1 13 with an increasing rate of 9 mm decade on average the annual rh exhibited a decreasing trend across all 14 catchments while most of them could not pass the significant trend test in addition the annual s and u2 depicted a mixed changing trend which indicates irregular varying patterns of s and u2 in the loess plateau during 1981 2013 additionally the breakpoints of et and ndvi for the 14 catchments were detected using the pettitt test pettitt 1979 from table 4 it is found that the breakpoints of et and ndvi in most catchments in the loess plateau occurred around 2000 this finding can be proven by the fact that the large scale revegetation program belonging to the gtg has been under operation since 1999 in the loss plateau actually newly planted vegetation could consume water for transpiration as this planted vegetation grows older it would consume more water for transpiration thus et in this region will increase with the implementation of the gtg project therefore to investigate the impacts of revegetation and climate change on et increase in the loess plateau the study period of all 14 catchments was divided into two periods based on the breakpoints of et in this section 4 5 2 quantitative contribution analysis of increased et combining the empirical equation for Œ±c estimation eq 18 and eq 16 which is used to estimate the change in evapotranspiration Œ¥ e t Œ¥ e t can be further expressed as follows 20 Œ¥ e t Œµ t e t Œ¥ t Œµ u 2 et u 2 Œ¥ u 2 Œµ rh et rh Œ¥ r h Œµ s et s Œ¥ s Œµ p et p Œ¥ p Œµ ndvi et ndvi Œ¥ n d v i Œ¥ e t t Œ¥ e t u 2 Œ¥ e t rh Œ¥ e t s Œ¥ e t p Œ¥ e t ndvi where Œ¥ e t t Œ¥ e t u 2 Œ¥ e t rh Œ¥ e t s Œ¥ e t p and Œ¥ e t ndvi represent the et change rate due to changes in t rh s u2 p and ndvi similarly the elasticity of et to p and ndvi can be estimated as follows Œµ p p et e t p Œµ ndvi ndvi et e t n d v i based on the estimated elasticities of et and the changes in et p ndvi and other meteorological factors t rh s and u2 from period 1 to period 2 the et increase due to climate change and revegetation can be obtained using eq 20 table 5 counts the total modeled et change rate due to changes in t rh s u2 p and ndvi the results show that with contribution rates of 69 and 31 on average the changes in the p and ndvi were the two dominant factors for et increase in all 14 catchments across the loess plateau while both accounted for nearly the total et increase during the study period t and rh presented positive and negative contributions across all 14 catchments respectively but the contribution rates were much less than the contribution rates of p and ndvi additionally the contribution rates of rh and u 2 presented mixed results since the mixed change from period 1 to period 2 was exhibited in rh and u 2 moreover to quantify the relative contributions of climate change and revegetation to the et increase the sums of Œ∑ p Œ∑ t Œ∑ rh Œ∑ u 2 and Œ∑ s are treated as the contributions of climate change while Œ∑ ndvi is treated as the contribution of revegetation in this section fig 6 presents the relative contributions of climate change and revegetation to the et increase in all 14 catchments on average climate change 68 contributes more than revegetation 32 to the increase in et specifically revegetation is found to be one of the main driving forces for et increase in the loess plateau in this study which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by feng et al 2016 and this is very important for investigating the impacts of the revegetation program gfg and nfpp on the water cycle in this region in general increased leaf area due to the revegetation program allows more transpiration and evaporation from the plant surface of intercepted precipitation donohue et al 2007 revegetation can also improve the photosynthetic rate by altering the albedo surface roughness and rn while all of them can influence et estimation in addition variation of the vegetation types and age due to revegetation can lead to changes in rooting depth as vegetation is planted and vegetation grow older the extension of roots can assume more substantial soil water for transpiration while the loess deposits and the groundwater system are very deep in the loess plateau in addition to revegetation the climate change induced increase in et is mainly caused by the p increase from period 1 to period 2 notably the et increase is more than the p increase during the study period in all 14 catchments see table 3 which may be partly related to the increased vegetation coverage and the increased plant water use efficiency under climate change and rising atmospheric co2 concentration drake et al 1997 wullschleger et al 2002 donohue et al 2013 therefore the operating revegetation program in the loess plateau resulted in more water consumption by evapotranspiration increases under climate change which may lead to a potential conflict between the ecosystem water demand and economic water demand 4 5 3 uncertainty analysis of the contribution analysis fig 7 compares the observed et change estimated as the changes of observed et between period 1 and period 2 with the modeled change estimated as the changes in modeled et between period 1 and period 2 analyzed in section 4 5 2 although good agreement was presented in most catchments across the loess plateau there was still an obvious rmse between the observed et change and the modeled et change therefore it is necessary to discuss the causes of the error to improve the theoretical framework of the attribution analysis used in this study first the empirical model of the parameter Œ±c established in this study cannot fully simulate the observed ones and therefore introduce error into the et simulation which can introduce errors in the contribution analyses of et change second eqs 13 14 and 20 used in this study were based on the approximation of the first order taylor expansion which ignores the second and higher orders of the taylor expansion may be one of the reasons for the error between the modeled et change and the observed et change yang et al 2014 third the interactions between climate change and revegetation may an important reason for the uncertainty in the contribution analysis it is noted that the vegetation increase in the loess plateau was almost due to large scale and continuous artificial afforestation rather than natural growth driven by climate change such as increased precipitation and solar radiation and the feedback of revegetation to the climate change from period 1 to period 2 is very limited while the large scale revegetation program mainly operated during the period 2 after the breakpoint therefore the uncertainty caused by interactions between climate change and revegetation is still controllable in this study in addition there are other causes for the error between the observed et change and the modeled et change for example the interactions between input elements could introduce the uncertainty in the attribution analysis xing et al 2018 while these input elements are not absolutely independent the temporal and spatial variability in the empirical parameters used for Œ¥ Œ≥ and r n estimations may raise uncertainty in the attribution analysis li et al 2018 nonetheless the error between the observed et change and the modeled et change due to the above reasons was relatively small and controllable and it is not enough to influence us to understand and quantify the evapotranspiration response to the changes in climate and revegetation in the loess plateau 5 conclusions in this study the performance of the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship was investigated in the main 14 catchments across the loess plateau and the results showed that this nonlinear relationship was a practical and reliable way to predict annual landscape evapotranspiration we also found that the temporal and spatial variability in the single parameter of the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship Œ±c was not only related to the ai which has been indicated by previous studies but was also related to the ndvi during the growing season furthermore an empirical model was established to simulate the basin specific Œ±c based on the boundary conditions of the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship and the correlations among ai ndvi and Œ±c from the validation of the empirical model of Œ±c it is found that the proposed model can well simulate the change in annual Œ±c in all 14 catchments during which a high correlation coefficient and relatively small root mean square errors were observed it also showed that the empirical model of Œ±c was efficient in predicting the annual et the results indicated that the simulated et can explain more than 75 of the calculated et in all 14 catchments across the loess plateau moreover combining the empirical model of Œ±c and the nonlinear complementary relationship the impacts of climate change and revegetation on the et increase were quantified in the 14 catchments across the loess plateau the results show that climate change mainly expressed by p increase contributed the most to the et increase approximately 68 on average whereas revegetation quantized by the ndvi increase also played a dominant role approximately 32 on average in the et increase since the p increase is less than the et increase during the study period in all 14 catchments the operating revegetation program in the loess plateau may result in more water consumption by evapotranspiration increase under climate change which may lead to a potential conflict of water demand between the ecosystem and sustainable economic development therefore current and future local water resource management and revegetation planning management should pay more attention to the increased water consumption due to evapotranspiration for sustainable economic and ecological development of the loess plateau credit authorship contribution statement tiansheng li conceptualization investigation methodology software

5023,evapotranspiration et is a key component in terrestrial climate and vegetation interactions a generalized complementary relationship proposed by brutsaert 2015 brutsaert et al 2020 has been shown to be a powerful tool for et estimation as the single parameter in the generalized complementary relationship it is generally accepted that Œ±c has high spatial variability and is closely correlated to the land surface conditions however understanding of the temporal variability in Œ±c is also important in a changing environment in this study we investigated the impacts of climate change and revegetation on et by establishing the relationship between Œ±c and the climatic vegetation factors in 14 catchments of the loess plateau the results showed that Œ±c presented both spatial and temporal variability where the aridity index ai and the average normalized difference vegetation index ndvi during the growing season are two dominant factors that control the variability in Œ±c furthermore combing the generalized complementary relationship and the empirical model of Œ±c proposed in this study the impacts of climate change and revegetation on the et increase were quantified in the loess plateau the results show that climate change mainly expressed by an increase in precipitation contributed the most to the et increase approximately 68 on average whereas revegetation quantified by the ndvi increase also played a dominant role approximately 32 on average in the et increase which suggests that revegetation planning management should pay more attention to the increased water consumption by evapotranspiration in the sustainable economic and ecological development of the loess plateau keywords evapotranspiration complementary relationship parameter Œ±c climate change revegetation 1 introduction the exchange of water through the continuum of the atmosphere soil and vegetation spac is an important process in the global energy water and carbon cycles as a key climate variable evapotranspiration et links these cycles and plays an important role in climate soil vegetation interactions yang et al 2009 compared with streamflow and precipitation et is more difficult to measure directly or estimate using standard observations in practice due to data requirements and nonideal conditions mcmahon et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 a better estimate and understanding of et attributed to climate change and revegetation over a range of spatial and temporal scales can help explain the complex interactions between global and regional energy water and carbon cycles however it is difficult to discriminate the impacts of different factors on et due to the collective influences of changes in climate and vegetation conditions the elasticity method has been proven to be capable of quantifying the contributions of climatic and anthropogenic factors to hydrological variables e g runoff q and et liang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li et al 2020 to apply the elasticity method to et studies we need to explicitly model the dependence of et on climate and vegetation factors over the years a number of methods for estimating et have been developed among them the complementary principle has received more attention over the years due to its simple mathematical expression physical plausibility and accessible input datasets brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 brutsaert and parlange 1998 ram√≠rez 2005 the complementary relationship between evapotranspiration demand and actual evapotranspiration was first set forth by bouchet 1963 with a linear equation and this original complementary principle involved only one boundary condition since bouchet s original linear equation is physically realistic several studies have tried to accurately interpret and implement this concept in practice e g brutsaert and stricker 1979 parlange and katul 1992 zhang et al 2001 sugita et al 2001 xu and singh 2005 yang et al 2013 to provide a more rigorous base and help clarify some uncertainties for the original complementary principle brutsaert 2015 brutsaert et al 2020 proposed a nonlinear complementary relationship that invokes three additional but necessary boundary conditions based on strictly physical considerations brutsaert 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 brutsaert et al 2020 this new nonlinear complementary relationship has been tested and applied at several sites or catchments under different climate and vegetation conditions and has a convincing predictive power liu et al 2016 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2017 brutsaert et al 2017 2020 ai et al 2017 hu et al 2018 gao et al 2018 in addition to a reliable estimate of et the generalized complementary relationship proposed by brutsaert 2015 brutsaert et al 2020 offers the opportunity to discriminate the contribution of climate and vegetation factors as the climatic factors are explicitly included in the model description and the variability of the single parameter in the generalized complementary relationship has been found mainly related to the land surface conditions of the catchments including climate characteristics and vegetation conditions for climatic characteristics the aridity index ai has been shown to alter the parameter in the eastern monsoon region of china liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 established the relationship between ai and the parameter for 524 catchments in different parts of the world additionally some studies have shown that vegetation conditions may influence a single parameter of the nonlinear complementary relationship zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2018a 2018b hu et al 2018 however most of these studies analyzed the relationship between the related characteristics of the land surface and the single parameter on the multi year average scale which may overwhelm the complementary relationship s superiority in et estimation on the annual scale in addition limited research has been conducted to investigate the variability in the single parameter and its driving factors in regions undergoing significant vegetation changes the objective of this study was to i improve the generalized complementary relationship by quantitatively relating its single parameter Œ±c to climate and vegetation variables and ii quantify the relative contribution of climate change and revegetation on et by applying the elasticity method to the improved complementary relationship we tested our new method in the loess plateau of china where a well known revegetation program has been in operation for approximately 60 years to reduce floods and sediment restore ecological degradation and improve carbon sequestration liu et al 2008 through the implementation of these projects soil erosion and ecological degradation have been significantly mitigated recently however the newly planted vegetation needs more water to grow which inevitably increases the consumption such as et of substantial water resources this contradiction has attracted many scholars to explore the impacts of revegetation on the water cycle under climate change e g mcvicar et al 2007 2010 zhang et al 2009 liang et al 2015 feng et al 2016 since et is more difficult to measure and estimate with standard meteorological observations limited studies have specifically described the annual et change process and quantitatively analyzed the impacts of revegetation and climate change on et in this region however by investigating the relationship between the single parameter of the nonlinear complementary relationship and the descriptors of climatic status and vegetation conditions the nonlinear complementary relationship that can estimate annual et allows us to further explore the et changing process under the significant vegetation variation and climate change in the loess plateau 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as one of the regions with the most serious soil erosion and the most ecologically fragile areas in the world the loess plateau 100 e 116 e 31 n 43 n is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin which has a population of 97 81 million and a cultivated area of 12 000 km2 fig 1 the loess plateau belongs to an arid and semiarid continental climate region with annual mean precipitation ranging from 150 mm to 750 mm the annual precipitation in this region shows strong seasonality and approximately 60 70 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in the flood season june september except for a few stony mountain areas the thickness of the loess on the surface is between 50 and 80 m which results in serious erosion in the loess plateau to prevent soil erosion and ecosystem degradation and ensure sustainable development in the loess plateau the chinese government initiated a series of ecological restoration programs since 1950s such as the grain for green project gfg and the nature forest grassland protection project nfpp specifically the large scale revegetation program belonging to the gfg has been operating since 1999 zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 as a result many previously cultivated lands have been converted to perennial vegetation such as forest and grass which will inevitably influence the water cycle in this region hence 14 main catchments across the loess plateau their distribution is shown in fig 1 were selected to investigate the mechanism of et response to the revegetation program under the context of climate change table 1 summarizes the hydrometeorological characteristics of these catchments 2 2 data the meteorological datasets from 62 meteorological stations within the loess plateau were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration their locations are shown in fig 1 the meteorological data include daily precipitation p average air temperature t wind speed at 10 m u10 sunshine duration s and relative humidity rh from 1981 to 2014 additionally daily solar net radiation rn at the national meteorological stations was calculated using the method recommended by allen et al 1998 involving daily sunshine duration the daily ground heat flux g is neglected because the daily or long term average value of g is close to zero wind speed at 2 m height u2 was estimated from u10 by using their recommended relationship brutsaert 2005 1 u 2 u r 2 z r 1 7 where zr is the height of the wind speed which is taken as 10 m in this study all the meteorological elements mentioned above were spatially averaged by the thiessen polygons method using arcgis software in addition the monthly stream discharge data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china for 14 hydrological stations their locations are shown in fig 1 to calculate the change in terrestrial soil water storage and soil moisture content Œ∏ mm of the catchments monthly soil moisture Œ∏m kg m2 data derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model rodell et al 2004 were used in this study these soil moisture datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 from 1981 to 2013 and represent the soil moisture content conditions between 0 and 2000 mm depth in addition to investigate the impacts of vegetation conditions on the value of the single parameter in the complementary principle the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data sets from 1981 to 2014 were derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor 3 methodology 3 1 generalized nonlinear complementary relationship bouchet 1963 postulated that the actual evapotranspiration et from a sufficiently large natural land surface under non moist conditions and the potential evapotranspiration epa which represents evapotranspiration demand and can occur on a small saturated surface under the same environment as et exhibiting a complementary relationship while another potential evapotranspiration epo which is defined following thornthwaite 1948 when et and epa are assumed under conditions of ample water supply brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert et al 2020 is introduced bouchet 1963 proposed that the complementary relationship can be expressed as the exact equality between the values of epo et and epa epo and it can yield the following linear relationship 2 et 2 e po e pa subsequently brutsaert and parlange 1998 extended eq 2 by assuming that the relationship between epo et and epa epo is not symmetrical and exactly equal but proportional which can be expressed as follows 3 et b 1 e po e pa b where b is a coefficient however when the values of epa are large enough under strongly advective conditions the values of et in eqs 2 and 3 may be negative to avoid this unrealistic possibility brutsaert 2015 postulated a more general complementary relationship 4 e pa e po e pa f e po e t e pa where f is the function determined by brutsaert 2015 since epo estimation is difficult in normal conditions that are non potential brutsaert et al 2020 argued that the complementary deviations of et and epa do not have to be from the potential evaporation epo as the base and further introduced a more flexible base denoted as Œ± c e e into eq 4 the improved complementary principle can be expressed as follows 5 et Œ± c e e e pa 2 2 e pa Œ± c e e where Œ±c is an adjustable parameter which is also the single parameter in the improved complementary relationship ee is the equilibrium evapotranspiration defined by slatyer and mcilroy 1961 and epa estimation follows the method recommended by penman 1948 6 e e Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g l e 7 e pa Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g l e Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ f e u 2 e 2 e 2 where le is the latent heat of vaporization j kg Œ¥ is the slope of saturated vapor pressure at the given air temperature kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mjm 2day 1 g is the ground heat flux mjm 2day 1 e 2 e 2 represents the vapor pressure deficit of the air kpa e 2 is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e2 is the vapor pressure at a height z2 above the surface kpa Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and the wind function f e u 2 can be determined with mean wind speed m s at the 2 m height u 2 by using the method recommended by penman 1948 i e f e u 2 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 based on the definition of Œ± c e e and epo it is clear that Œ± c e e is not meant to represent potential evaporation epo specifically Œ± c e e will infinitely approach epo i e Œ± c e e e po when the surface has a sufficient water supply i e the surface is under potential conditions and the value of Œ±c will close to priestley and taylor s coefficient of 1 26 priestley and taylor 1972 whenever there is no longer an ample water supply or under the non potential conditions Œ± c e e will always be an intermediate term between et and epa i e et Œ± c e e e pa and the value of Œ±c will become smaller than 1 26 and then Œ± c e e and Œ±c will be sufficiently small when the ambient conditions become extremely dry and or windy brutsaert et al 2020 apparently the improved complementary principle i e eq 5 is more flexible and tenable for et estimation in practice and the single parameter Œ±c can flexibly vary from sufficiently small when the surface conditions are extremely dry and or windy to a value of around 1 26 when the surface is under potential conditions to make the complementary principle flexible and accurately estimate et under different water and energy supply conditions therefore the improved complementary principle i e eq 5 is selected to estimate and analyze et in our study 3 2 annual water balance in catchments in all 14 catchments located in the loess plateau the value of the annual observed et is calculated by the water balance equation 8 et p q d Œ¥ s where p represents the annual precipitation mm yr q represents the annual runoff mm yr d is the annual groundwater recharge mm yr and Œ¥ s is the annual change in soil water storage mm yr as the unsaturated zone and the groundwater system are very deep and the root depth is less than 2 m in the loess plateau gao et al 2017 schenk and jackson 2005 the water exchange between the groundwater system and the unsaturated zone is very small and can be neglected i e d 0 zhang et al 2014 besides the change of yearly soil moisture content Œ∏ between 0 and 2000 mm which was aggregated from the soil moisture of gldas was used to succinctly represent the value of Œ¥ s in this study notably the gldas datasets were generated by integrating satellite and ground based observational data products using land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 and this dataset can produce global high resolution with a 0 25 0 25 resolution and continuous soil moisture datasets that have been applied in many prior studies and have been proven to be rational and reliable for example syed et al 2008 found that global gldas simulations are in good agreement with those obtained from grace based storage changes which provides first estimates of land water storage variations by monitoring the time variable component of earth s gravity field cheng 2012 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2015 and bi et al 2016 found that gldas soil moisture data can better describe the surface soil moisture status in china compared with other data product sets and liu et al 2016 used gldas soil moisture to quantify the monthly water storage change for 241 catchments in the eastern monsoon region of china and proved the practicability of gldas soil moisture data in the loess plateau liu et al 2018a 2018b proved that gldas soil moisture data has the satisfactory results in this region by comparing field measurements of top 10 cm soil moisture in cropland with the gldas soil moisture data feng et al 2016 used gldas soil moisture data quantitatively described the water storage change for estimating water balance in the loess plateau therefore based on evidences from theses previous studies the gldas soil moisture data Œ∏ between 0 and 2000 mm was selected to estimate the soil water storage change in the loess plateau in this study 3 3 description of the predictors of Œ±c both the land surface climate conditions liu et al 2016 and vegetation conditions zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 have been found to control the variability in Œ±c in some prior studies for the near surface climate status the basic climatic factors such as p temperature terms tmean tmax tmin rh u2 and s are usually considered as the important indicators and these factors can be roughly divided into two types water elements and energy elements moreover the latitude and distance to the ocean of the sits or catchments has been proven to affect the value of Œ±c by yang et al 2008 thus ai i e ai e pa p which not only tend to be closely correlated with the latitude and distance to the ocean of the sits or catchments liu et al 2016 but also combines two type climatic factors water elements and energy elements that controls the rate of the evaporation budyko 1974 has been selected as the preferred predictor to simulate the parameter Œ±c by previous studies at the small catchment scale liu et al 2016 found a significant negative correlation between Œ±c and ai across the eastern monsoon region of china and brutsaert et al 2020 confirmed the strong correlation between Œ±c and ai across 524 catchments in different regions of the world and both of them proposed empirical formulas for Œ±c estimation at the long term average scale therefore to investigate the impacts of climate status on the temporal and spatial variability in Œ±c across 14 catchments in the loess plateau the annual ai is selected as the climatic predictor of Œ±c in this study as transpiration is one of the important features of the biological processes that play a key role in the catchment water balance rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 considering or introducing vegetation dynamic in the evapotranspiration estimation has proven to be important donohue et al 2007 for the impacts of vegetation dynamic on the generalized complementary relationship zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2018 and liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018b found that the variation in vegetation conditions can affect the spatial and temporal variability in Œ±c besides the significant vegetation changes over several years in the loess plateau will undoubtedly result in changes of evapotranspiration in order to describe and simulate the interannual variation of parameter Œ±c in the loess plateau more comprehensively it is decided to use the ndvi during the growing season april october as the vegetation predictor of Œ±c in this study while the ndvi has been widely used to describe vegetation characteristics such as plant growth conditions and plant structure in many hydrology and ecology studies e g yang et al 2009 li et al 2013 feng et al 2016 to summarize two dimensionless indices defined as ai and ndvi are selected to describe the characteristics of climate and vegetation conditions which are the potential factors affecting the variability in Œ±c in this study 3 4 modeling Œ±c based on the statistical analysis between the parameter Œ±c which was calculated by inversion eqs 5 7 using the observations and the explanatory predictors of catchment characteristics listed in section 3 3 an empirical model is considered to reveal the potential relationship between annual Œ±c and two key descriptors for climate status and vegetation conditions which are denoted as ai and ndvi the experiential model used to calculate the annual parameter Œ±c can be expressed as follows 9 Œ± c f a i n d v i where f is a function to be determined and the parameter Œ±c obtained in this way is called the basin specific modeled Œ±c which is denoted as Œ± c the objective of this nonlinear model for calculating Œ±c is to minimize the mean squared errors between the annual observed et calculated by the water balance equation i e equation 8 and the modeled annual evapotranspiration e t calculated by eq 5 with Œ± c the objective function can be expressed as follows 10 f obj min i n e t i e t i 2 min i n e t i Œ± c e ei e pai 2 2 e pai Œ± c e ei 2 where i is the year and n is the data set length in the time series therefore the performance of this nonlinear model can be evaluated by i comparing the values of Œ±c calculated by eqs 5 7 using the observations against the values of the simulated Œ± c and ii comparing the observed value of annual et against the modeled annual et the pearson s correlation coefficient r determination coefficient r 2 and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the performance of the nonlinear model and the basic two statistics can be estimated by the following equations 11 r i n x i x y i y i n x i x 2 i n x i x 2 12 rmse 1 n i n y i x i 2 where x i n x i n and y i n y i n are the average of the observed variable xi and the average of the simulated variable yi i 1 2 n respectively n is the number of spatial steps 3 5 elasticity method the second objective of this paper is to quantify the contribution of climate change and revegetation to et change the concept of the elasticity method was first introduced to assess the impact of climate change on hydrology by schaake 1990 and since then it has been widely used to quantify the elasticity and contribution of climatic and anthropogenic factors to runoff e g fu et al 2007 zheng et al 2009 yang and yang 2011 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2016 according to yang and yang 2011 and wang et al 2016 we defined the change in et based on the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship eqs 5 7 13 de t d e t d t d t e t d u 2 d u 2 e t d r h d r h e t d s d s e t d Œ± c d Œ± c where e t d represents daily evapotranspiration equation 13 can be rearranged as follows 14 de t d e t d 1 e t d e t d t d t u 2 e t d e t d u 2 d u 2 u 2 rh e t d e t d r h drh rh s e t d e t d s ds s Œ± c e t d e t d Œ± c d Œ±

2 d u 2 u 2 rh et i m e t d r h drh rh s et i m e t d s ds s Œ± c et i m e t d Œ± c d Œ± c Œ± c Œµ t d t Œµ u 2 d u 2 u 2 Œµ rh drh rh Œµ s ds s Œµ Œ± c d Œ± c Œ± c where m is the days in a year and the elasticity of et with respect to t u2 rh s and Œ±c are expressed as Œµ t 1 et i m e t d t Œµ u 2 u 2 et i m e t d u 2 Œµ rh rh et i m e t d r h Œµ s s et i m e t d s Œµ Œ± c Œ± c et i m e t d Œ± c if there is a significant change such as breakpoint in et during the study period it could be meaningful to analyze the attribution of the changes in related factors to the et change based on eq 15 the change in evapotranspiration Œ¥ e t can be estimated as follows 16 Œ¥ e t Œµ t e t Œ¥ t Œµ u 2 et u 2 Œ¥ u 2 Œµ rh et rh Œ¥ r h Œµ s et s Œ¥ s Œµ Œ± c et Œ± c Œ¥ Œ± c Œ¥ e t t Œ¥ e t u 2 Œ¥ e t rh

the contribution rates of t rh s u2 and Œ± c changes to the total et change 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variability in Œ±c to reflect the influences of different Œ±c values on the complementary relationship i e eq 5 the annual et estimated from the annual water balance equation i e eq 8 and observed climate forcing data were used to reverse the annual parameter Œ±c based on eqs 5 7 fig 2 presents the complementary relationship between epa ee and et ee in 14 catchments across the loess plateau and each data point represents the multi year average values of the single catchment as shown in fig 2 the average values of Œ±c obtained in 14 catchments across the loess plateau are mainly concentrated between 0 7 and 1 0 according to the definition of Œ± c e e the minimum value of Œ±c would be sufficiently small Œ± c 0 when the surface conditions are extremely dry and or windy whenever the water supply of the land surface is ample and the surface is under potential conditions the maximum value of Œ±c will be close to the value of around 1 26 i e roughly within1 0 1 5 priestley and taylor 1972 chen and brutsaert 1995 brutsaert et al 2020 obviously the values of Œ±c obtained in the loess plateau are reasonable according to the definition of Œ±c in addition it is remarkable that the average values of Œ±c shown in fig 2 are generally consistent with the results obtained by brutsaert et al 2020 which indicated that the average values of Œ±c in the loess plateau range from 0 7 to 1 0 see its fig 6 additionally the average values of Œ±c obtained in this study are also close to the values of Œ±c obtained by liu et al 2016 in the eastern monsoon region of china and brutsaert et al 2017 in the loess plateau from fig 2 it is also evident that the complementary relationship between epa ee and et ee based on eq 5 is basin dependent and parameter Œ±c differs from basin to basin moreover the Œ±c values of catchments 1 7 are smaller than those of catchments 8 14 while catchments 1 7 are located at higher latitudes see fig 1 and in more arid zone based on a comparison of the value of ai in table 1 than catchments 8 14 these findings are consistent with the conclusion of yang et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 which pointed out that the value of Œ±c mainly depends on the ai in addition the interannual variability in Œ±c in each catchment across the loess plateau should also be seriously considered as shown in table 2 the differences between the maximum and minimum values of annual Œ±c in all 14 catchments are quite obvious during the study period the spatial and temporal variability in the complementary relationship between epa ee and ea ee may mainly caused by the differences in interannual ee and epa for different catchments however the fact that Œ±c differs from basin to basin and varies year to year calls for more detailed research on exploring the impacts of the spatiotemporal variability in Œ±c on the changes in the complementary relationship between epa ee and et ee in the loess plateau therefore accurate estimation of Œ±c for different basins or regions at the annual scale is meaningful for applying the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship in practice 4 2 relationships among indices of catchment characteristics and Œ±c statistically significant relationships among annual Œ±c which was calculated by inversion eqs 5 7 with annual et from the water balance equation and other observed variables e g epa Œ≥ Œ¥ and r n and two dimensionless indices proposed in section 3 3 were found in 14 catchments of the loess plateau using simple linear pearson s correlation coefficients and the f test fig 3 a and b show the correlations between Œ±c and ai and between Œ±c and ndvi during the growing season april october in all 14 catchments respectively from fig 3a strong negative correlations were found between ai and Œ±c while the absolute value of r reached 0 87 and passed f test at the 99 significance level notably the correlations between Œ±c and ai all passed the f test at the 99 significance level in each catchment the highest value of r was present in catchment 13 i e r 0 97 while the lowest value of r was presented in catchment 5 i e r 0 81 the findings are consistent with the results found by liu et al 2016 in the eastern monsoon region of china and brutsaert et al 2020 in 524 catchments in different parts of the world which showed that the increase in ai will lead to a reduction in Œ±c in addition significant positive correlations were found between Œ±c and ndvi in fig 3b while the value of r is 0 63 and passes f test at the 99 significance level specifically most catchments passed the f test at the 99 significance level while a few catchments catchments 6 10 12 and 13 do not pass this finding can be explained by the notion of evapotranspiration being generated more in regions with more abundant vegetation coverage because Œ±c is usually positively correlated with et 4 3 modeling the empirical formula of Œ±c as shown in fig 3 the parameter Œ±c in the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship proposed by brutsaert et al 2020 is closely correlated with the two dimensionless key descriptors denoted as ai and ndvi for climate status and vegetation conditions in 14 catchments across the loess plateau this finding suggests that the parameter Œ±c can be estimated by these two key descriptors without measured evapotranspiration and runoff data in ungauged basins to model the optimal function f in the empirical model i e eq 9 which can be used to estimate Œ±c all 14 catchments in the loess plateau were separated into two groups catchments 1 4 were used for calibration and the other catchments catchments 5 14 were used for validation considering the boundary conditions of the generalized nonlinear complementary principle and the correlations among ai ndvi and Œ±c the optimal function f was derived from the datasets of catchments 1 4 by using the stepwise regression analysis the final fitted expression of eq 9 was determined as follows 18 Œ± c 3 03 n d v i 0 14 1 a i 0 84 the negative correlation between Œ±c and ai presented in this empirical equation is consistent with liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 the new finding here is that the temporal and spatial variability in Œ±c also has a positive correlation with ndvi in the loess plateau as the large scale revegetation program has been under operation considering only the impact of climate variability i e ai would unintentionally miss the impact of vegetation changes on Œ±c and et in this region in fact the vegetation dynamic is closer to steady state on a multi year average scale which remove short or medium variability based on this previous studies such as liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 naturally and reasonably ignore the impacts of vegetation changes when fitting the empirical formula of parameter Œ±c on a multi year average scale however one of the most important objectives of this study is to investigate the Œ±c and et variability on the annual scale and the dramatic vegetation change in the loess plateau will disturb steady state conditions within catchments alter original processes of evapotranspiration and make the accurate estimation of et more complicated on the annual scale donohue et al 2007 thus the dimensionless indices of vegetation conditions denoted as ndvi were introduced into the empirical eq 18 to optimize the fitting calculation of the parameter Œ±c in this study as shown in table 3 the introduction of ndvi does improve the simulation accuracy of the parameter Œ±c and et which confirms the rationality and reliability of the empirical formula eq 18 on the other hand 4 4 validation of the empirical formula of Œ±c to validate the empirical formula of Œ±c the datasets from catchments 5 14 which are selected to validate the performance of the empirical formula of Œ±c are used in this section fig 4 compares the annual Œ±c which is estimated using eqs 5 7 with the annual et from the water balance equation and other observed variables against the simulated annual Œ± c by the empirical formula i e eq 18 for catchments 5 14 good agreement can be found with the coefficients of determination r2 all above 0 70 and the rmse within 0 13 in each validation catchment notably this empirical formula of Œ± c is not affected by the choice of catchments to calibrate parameter Œ±c and the expression of the empirical formula is robust and does not change much with the catchments used for calibration changes for example if catchments 11 14 were selected as the catchments to calibrate the empirical formal of Œ± c the optimal empirical formula can be expressed as 19 Œ± c 3 06 n d v i 0 28 1 a i 0 80 which indicates that the basic relationship between the parameter Œ±c and the two dimensionless key descriptors denoted as ai and ndvi obtained in eq 18 is reasonable and credible and according to different calibration validation procedures the current format and coefficients of the empirical formula are similar or close to the optimal values additionally the empirical formula of Œ±c is used together with eq 5 to validate the annual et estimation for all 14 catchments in the loess plateau as indicated by the results in fig 5 the actual evapotranspiration e t simulated by eq 5 with the empirical formula of Œ± c can well explain the changing process of et calculated by the water balance equation i e eq 8 in the loess plateau the rmse between et and et are all smaller than 81 mm in each catchment these results indicate that parameter Œ±c can be calculated by using the empirical formula i e eq 18 with the indices of catchment characteristics which mainly include dimensionless key descriptors for climate status ai and vegetation conditions ndvi and the simulated Œ± c is reliable and robust for estimating annual et 4 5 impacts of revegetation and climate change on et in addition to the results of the et validation in fig 5 it is worth noting that the annual et from 1981 to 2014 in all 14 catchments had an increasing trend of approximately 17 mm decade 1 since the loess plateau is a typical water limited area in china the growing water consumption caused by increased et will be a great challenge for the sustainable use of water resources in this region in addition to climate change some prior studies found that revegetation is a main reason for changes in the water cycles i e r decline et increase in the loess plateau e g mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 liang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 feng et al 2016 in this study as the single parameter Œ±c in the complementary principle was found to be closely related to the ndvi during the growing season it allows us to better understand the impacts of revegetation and climate change on the et increase in the loess plateau 4 5 1 temporal trend analysis and breakpoint detection of variables the temporal trends of annual climatic and hydrological variables for the 14 catchments were examined using the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 the results are shown in table 4 significantly positive trends in t and ndvi were found in all 14 catchments which is consistent with the warming phenomenon reported across china during the past 50 years li et al 2018 and the revegetation program in the loess plateau the annual et represented an increasing trend of 17 mm decade on average but in most catchments this value could not pass the significant trend test similarly the annual p increased slightly in most catchments catchments 1 13 with an increasing rate of 9 mm decade on average the annual rh exhibited a decreasing trend across all 14 catchments while most of them could not pass the significant trend test in addition the annual s and u2 depicted a mixed changing trend which indicates irregular varying patterns of s and u2 in the loess plateau during 1981 2013 additionally the breakpoints of et and ndvi for the 14 catchments were detected using the pettitt test pettitt 1979 from table 4 it is found that the breakpoints of et and ndvi in most catchments in the loess plateau occurred around 2000 this finding can be proven by the fact that the large scale revegetation program belonging to the gtg has been under operation since 1999 in the loss plateau actually newly planted vegetation could consume water for transpiration as this planted vegetation grows older it would consume more water for transpiration thus et in this region will increase with the implementation of the gtg project therefore to investigate the impacts of revegetation and climate change on et increase in the loess plateau the study period of all 14 catchments was divided into two periods based on the breakpoints of et in this section 4 5 2 quantitative contribution analysis of increased et combining the empirical equation for Œ±c estimation eq 18 and eq 16 which is used to estimate the change in evapotranspiration Œ¥ e t Œ¥ e t can be further expressed as follows 20 Œ¥ e t Œµ t e t Œ¥ t Œµ u 2 et u 2 Œ¥ u 2 Œµ rh et rh Œ¥ r h Œµ s et s Œ¥ s Œµ p et p Œ¥ p Œµ ndvi et ndvi Œ¥ n d v i Œ¥ e t t Œ¥ e t u 2 Œ¥ e t rh Œ¥ e t s Œ¥ e t p Œ¥ e t ndvi where Œ¥ e t t Œ¥ e t u 2 Œ¥ e t rh Œ¥ e t s Œ¥ e t p and Œ¥ e t ndvi represent the et change rate due to changes in t rh s u2 p and ndvi similarly the elasticity of et to p and ndvi can be estimated as follows Œµ p p et e t p Œµ ndvi ndvi et e t n d v i based on the estimated elasticities of et and the changes in et p ndvi and other meteorological factors t rh s and u2 from period 1 to period 2 the et increase due to climate change and revegetation can be obtained using eq 20 table 5 counts the total modeled et change rate due to changes in t rh s u2 p and ndvi the results show that with contribution rates of 69 and 31 on average the changes in the p and ndvi were the two dominant factors for et increase in all 14 catchments across the loess plateau while both accounted for nearly the total et increase during the study period t and rh presented positive and negative contributions across all 14 catchments respectively but the contribution rates were much less than the contribution rates of p and ndvi additionally the contribution rates of rh and u 2 presented mixed results since the mixed change from period 1 to period 2 was exhibited in rh and u 2 moreover to quantify the relative contributions of climate change and revegetation to the et increase the sums of Œ∑ p Œ∑ t Œ∑ rh Œ∑ u 2 and Œ∑ s are treated as the contributions of climate change while Œ∑ ndvi is treated as the contribution of revegetation in this section fig 6 presents the relative contributions of climate change and revegetation to the et increase in all 14 catchments on average climate change 68 contributes more than revegetation 32 to the increase in et specifically revegetation is found to be one of the main driving forces for et increase in the loess plateau in this study which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by feng et al 2016 and this is very important for investigating the impacts of the revegetation program gfg and nfpp on the water cycle in this region in general increased leaf area due to the revegetation program allows more transpiration and evaporation from the plant surface of intercepted precipitation donohue et al 2007 revegetation can also improve the photosynthetic rate by altering the albedo surface roughness and rn while all of them can influence et estimation in addition variation of the vegetation types and age due to revegetation can lead to changes in rooting depth as vegetation is planted and vegetation grow older the extension of roots can assume more substantial soil water for transpiration while the loess deposits and the groundwater system are very deep in the loess plateau in addition to revegetation the climate change induced increase in et is mainly caused by the p increase from period 1 to period 2 notably the et increase is more than the p increase during the study period in all 14 catchments see table 3 which may be partly related to the increased vegetation coverage and the increased plant water use efficiency under climate change and rising atmospheric co2 concentration drake et al 1997 wullschleger et al 2002 donohue et al 2013 therefore the operating revegetation program in the loess plateau resulted in more water consumption by evapotranspiration increases under climate change which may lead to a potential conflict between the ecosystem water demand and economic water demand 4 5 3 uncertainty analysis of the contribution analysis fig 7 compares the observed et change estimated as the changes of observed et between period 1 and period 2 with the modeled change estimated as the changes in modeled et between period 1 and period 2 analyzed in section 4 5 2 although good agreement was presented in most catchments across the loess plateau there was still an obvious rmse between the observed et change and the modeled et change therefore it is necessary to discuss the causes of the error to improve the theoretical framework of the attribution analysis used in this study first the empirical model of the parameter Œ±c established in this study cannot fully simulate the observed ones and therefore introduce error into the et simulation which can introduce errors in the contribution analyses of et change second eqs 13 14 and 20 used in this study were based on the approximation of the first order taylor expansion which ignores the second and higher orders of the taylor expansion may be one of the reasons for the error between the modeled et change and the observed et change yang et al 2014 third the interactions between climate change and revegetation may an important reason for the uncertainty in the contribution analysis it is noted that the vegetation increase in the loess plateau was almost due to large scale and continuous artificial afforestation rather than natural growth driven by climate change such as increased precipitation and solar radiation and the feedback of revegetation to the climate change from period 1 to period 2 is very limited while the large scale revegetation program mainly operated during the period 2 after the breakpoint therefore the uncertainty caused by interactions between climate change and revegetation is still controllable in this study in addition there are other causes for the error between the observed et change and the modeled et change for example the interactions between input elements could introduce the uncertainty in the attribution analysis xing et al 2018 while these input elements are not absolutely independent the temporal and spatial variability in the empirical parameters used for Œ¥ Œ≥ and r n estimations may raise uncertainty in the attribution analysis li et al 2018 nonetheless the error between the observed et change and the modeled et change due to the above reasons was relatively small and controllable and it is not enough to influence us to understand and quantify the evapotranspiration response to the changes in climate and revegetation in the loess plateau 5 conclusions in this study the performance of the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship was investigated in the main 14 catchments across the loess plateau and the results showed that this nonlinear relationship was a practical and reliable way to predict annual landscape evapotranspiration we also found that the temporal and spatial variability in the single parameter of the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship Œ±c was not only related to the ai which has been indicated by previous studies but was also related to the ndvi during the growing season furthermore an empirical model was established to simulate the basin specific Œ±c based on the boundary conditions of the generalized nonlinear complementary relationship and the correlations among ai ndvi and Œ±c from the validation of the empirical model of Œ±c it is found that the proposed model can well simulate the change in annual Œ±c in all 14 catchments during which a high correlation coefficient and relatively small root mean square errors were observed it also showed that the empirical model of Œ±c was efficient in predicting the annual et the results indicated that the simulated et can explain more than 75 of the calculated et in all 14 catchments across the loess plateau moreover combining the empirical model of Œ±c and the nonlinear complementary relationship the impacts of climate change and revegetation on the et increase were quantified in the 14 catchments across the loess plateau the results show that climate change mainly expressed by p increase contributed the most to the et increase approximately 68 on average whereas revegetation quantized by the ndvi increase also played a dominant role approximately 32 on average in the et increase since the p increase is less than the et increase during the study period in all 14 catchments the operating revegetation program in the loess plateau may result in more water consumption by evapotranspiration increase under climate change which may lead to a potential conflict of water demand between the ecosystem and sustainable economic development therefore current and future local water resource management and revegetation planning management should pay more attention to the increased water consumption due to evapotranspiration for sustainable economic and ecological development of the loess plateau credit authorship contribution statement tiansheng li conceptualization investigation methodology software

5024,an increase in climate change has been leading to non stationarity in hydrological variables therefore a simple framework within the budyko hypothesis is proposed to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution and provide a new method for practical application in hydrological design under the non stationarity in this framework the annual runoff statistic parameters mean value mar and standard deviation std are derived by the choudhury yang equation at the same time a magnification factor Œ≥ 1 1 358 is introduced to correct the underestimation of the budyko based estimated std according to observation data in 291 catchments across china furthermore the p —à type frequency curve is selected to calculate the annual runoff on a specific design return period here the impacts of non stationarity caused by climate change was considered to be encoded in the changes in statistic parameters and frequency distribution based on this framework the changes in water resources in 207 three level basins across china during 2020 2050 are given the results show that the average mar will decrease by 2 7 for all basins and the spatial distribution of mar will be more even i e it will increase in the north of china and decrease in the south of china however the inter annual variability of annual runoff shown as std and variance coefficient cv will increase in more than 70 of basins additionally in the dry year about 65 of basins show decreased runoff change which indicates a larger reservoir capacity is need for water resource allocation these findings offer a simple and effective way to re examine the effects of non stationarity on projected annual runoff keywords budyko hypothesis annual runoff frequency prediction non stationarity 1 introduction hydrologic design is the process of assessing the impact of hydrologic events on a water resource system and choosing the key variables of the system so that it will perform adequately chow et al 1988 generally the hydrologic design responding to water resource planning and management is based on the assumption that hydrological events are independent and stationary which means that the controlling factors of hydrological processes e g climate condition remain statistically stable in the past present and future gilroy and mccuen 2012 khaliq et al 2006 however after the industrial revolution the dramatic climate changes such as increasing temperature and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have destabilized the climate system and altered the independent and identical distribution of hydrological variables it would undoubtedly lead to a higher actual risk and cost of practical projects with the original stationarity assumption brown and caldeira 2017 ipcc 2013 milly et al 2005 2008 yang et al 2015 the estimation of annual runoff ar frequency as the core and fundamental of hydrological design has always been the interest for engineers and managers a better understanding of how annual runoff response to the climate changes is of great significance to a reasonable water resources allocation and management the mean annual runoff mar as a first order statistic parameter of ar generally represents the long term accessible water resource many previous studies have explored the impacts of climate change on mar hodgkins 2009 huang et al 2016 among existing studies hydrological and atmosphere models have been commonly used cao et al 2010 gedney et al 2006 the generic steps of these methods are firstly simulating continuous runoff and subsequently analyzing the trend and its causes for example based on the geomorphology based hydrological model proposed by yang et al 2002 cong et al 2009 revealed that intensification of climate change after the 1990 s accelerated the runoff decrease in the yellow river basin a positive change of runoff in the hei river basin was reported by zhang et al 2016a with the combination of soil water assessment tool swat model and global climate models gcms although such models provide an effective way to identify the runoff trend their complicated structure and numerous parameters would largely increase computation cost and lead to high unquantified uncertainties beck et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2012a 2012b zaherpour et al 2018 in that case the budyko framework budyko 1974 linking long term mean actual evapotranspiration et to precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet is favored as an explicit approach to describe the land surface water balance compared to the former method such conceptual bottom up model basically has only one or zero parameter needed to be calibrated which largely reduces uncertainties and calculative burden in conjunction with the elasticity approach schaake 1990 the budyko type rainfall runoff model has been proved as an extremely useful tool in the analysis of long term runoff changes roderick et al 2014 yang and yang 2011 in the elasticity method the changes in runoff was generally divided to contributions from p and pet which respectively represent the water supply to and demand from a catchment a comprehensive study conducted by huang et al 2016 showed that the p plays a dominant role in runoff changes in china and the similar conclusion was also found in other regions brikowski 2015 donohue et al 2011 singh and kumar 2015 milly et al 2018 used the budyko type framework to clarify that the temperature change which embedded in pet could significant affects the variation of ar besides the budyko method has been also widely applied to runoff projection in the changing climate roderick et al 2014 yang et al 2019 xing et al 2018 projected a spatial pattern of increase mar change in north of china and decrease change in the south the findings from which was also reported by guo et al 2015 based on the budyko based analysis of several hundred basins across china chen et al 2017 claimed that more than half of them will experience water shortages mar decrease by the middle of the coming century besides the first order parameter mar the second order parameter i e the standard deviation std which represents the inter annual runoff variability iarv was also the essential for estimating ar frequency distribution similarly the iarv could also divide into the individual and co variability of p and pet a straightforward extension of budyko equation is to estimate the std of runoff or et with the central moment method in the recent decades the temporal variability of et on the region and global scales have been widely investigated with the original or improved approach of koster and suarez 1999 which firstly proposed an analytical method within budyko framework to assess the response of inter annual variability of et to climate forcings arora 2002 koster et al 2006 li 2014 zeng and cai 2015 2016 analogously the framework could be also used to examine the iarv and its drivers arora 2002 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 tekleab et al 2011 yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 the common conclusion is that the iarv is mainly controlled by the variability of p especially in the humid regions liu et al 2019 milly and dunne 2002 wang and alimohammadi 2012 by accounting for variance of terrestrial storage the framework could be also applied to evaluate the effects of climate on runoff variability on intra annual or seasonal scales liu et al 2019 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b as mentioned above the central moment derived method is the mathematical tool for estimating ar second order parameters std there would be some inevitably uncertainty in the mix moment estimation which results in more or less deviations in previous studies a underestimation 10 30 of budyko based estimated std was found through the comparison with observations mcmahon et al 2011 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 yu et al 2015 in this study we will examine whether the deviation is temporal spatial stable and introduce a simple and practical correction method for subsequent frequency estimation overall the budyko based method does provide a simple and effective way to quantify the responses of annual runoff to climate forcings this study will use the budyko based approach to develop a conceptual rainfall runoff model for calculating annual runoff statistic parameters here we consider the effects of non stationarity are embedded in the changes of the statistic parameters mar and std under historical period and future scenarios the p iii distribution function is further selected to obtain the characteristic ar on any return period or probability p yang et al 2014a in summary the objectives of this study are to i correct the deviation of budyko based estimated std ii develop a framework for annual runoff frequency estimation with the consideration of the non stationarity iii apply the framework to predict the changes in ar statistic parameters and frequency distribution across china the wet year p 25 and dry year p 75 are chosen as the specific calculations of frequency estimation the materials and methodology are introduced in section 2 and 3 the results are presented in section 4 and followed by the detailed discussions in section 5 2 materials 2 1 catchments across china in total 291 catchments across china with areas spanning from 372 to 142 963 km2 were selected the annual restored runoff data from 1956 to 2000 of each catchment was collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the effect of human activities i e dam construction and irrigation has already been mostly removed and the restored data can be considered as the approximate natural runoff fig 1 a 261 out of the 291 catchments had ar series longer than 40 years and others had record lengths of at least 21 years daily series of p and meteorological data were collected from 736 stations and interpolated to 10 km grid by yang et al 2014b with the inverse distance weighted method the daily pet was estimated by the penman equation penman 1948 for each grid then the daily p and pet were summed the annual value and averaged to each catchment the aridity index of catchments ranging from 0 5 to 13 is shown in fig 1 b here we define the climate conditions as follows humid condition aridity index 0 76 equitant condition 0 76 aridity index 1 35 and general aridity condition aridity index 1 35 mcvicar et al 2012 additionally the extreme aridity condition is defined by an aridity index larger than 3 2 2 third level basins across china total of 209 third level basins across china with areas spanning from 3 100 to 682 700 km2 were investigated due to no observation ar data in third level basins we estimated the mar from 1961 to 2000 by multiplying the mean annual p by the mar coefficient in each basin which was collected from hydrological year books of china fig 2 a and b the aridity index of third level basins ranging from 0 5 to 47 91 of basins range from 0 5 to 8 is shown in fig 2 c mar coefficients of tarim river mainstream basin no 53 and taklamakan desert basin no 67 were equal to zero thus total of 207 third level basins were finally selected two kinds of meteorological datasets were used for third level basins the first one was the 10 km gridded dataset yang et al 2014b as mentioned in section 2 1 the second one which included the daily p maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed at 0 5 spatial resolution was from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 of the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project the 1961 2000 was set as the historical period and 2020 2050 as the future period five global climate models gcms namely gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m under three scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used here for convenience we call the two datasets as the observation data and the gcm data respectively 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic design for water use the frequency density function for ar can be described by the p iii type distribution 1 f x Œ≤ Œ± Œ≥ Œ± x a 0 Œ± 1 e Œ≤ x a 0 where x is the variable Œ≥ Œ± is the gama function with Œ± and Œ≤ and a 0 being parameters the three parameters can be estimated as Œ± 4 c s 2 Œ≤ 2 x c v c s and a 0 x 1 2 c v c s where x is the average of the random variable cv is the variation coefficient and c s is the skewness coefficient the probability that the random variable x is not less than x p can be written as 2 p x x p x p f x d x for the ar design a set of observations r 1 r 2 rl of the ar series can be chosen and considered as a sample drawn from a hypothetical infinite ar series with constant statistical properties thus we can obtain the characteristic ar of a certain probability and define the wet year and dry year with corresponding p values from eq 1 three ar statistic parameters namely mar cv and c s are need for frequency estimation the mar can be calculated as 3 r 1 l i 1 l r i where the l is the record length and ri is annual runoff in the i th year the variation coefficient can be estimated as 4 c v r œÉ r r where the œÉ r is the std of ar and could be computed as 5 œÉ r 1 l 1 i 1 l r i r 2 the skewness coefficient is usually estimated as yang et al 2014a yu et al 2015 6 c s r Œª c v r where Œª is the proportional coefficient and varies from 2 to 3 with a step size of 0 5 for catchments across china yang et al 2014a from the above only two parameters mar and std are materially required for ungauged or poor gauged basins without long term runoff observations the two parameters could be derived from the climatic forcings with the budyko type rainfall runoff model as introduced below 3 2 estimation of ar statistic parameters with the budyko model the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 an analytically derived and widely used budyko type equation was selected to estimate the statistical parameters based on the choudhury yang equation and the long term water balance the mar can be estimated as 7a r p e p e 0 p p e 0 n 1 n where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration e 0 is the mean annual pet that calculated by penman 1948 and n is the land specific parameter which representing catchment characteristics for convenience the eq 7a was denoted as 7b g e 0 p n p e 0 p p n e 0 n 1 n the estimated ar can be written as 8 r est g e 0 p n thus the variation in r Œ¥ r can be estimated as 9 Œ¥ r g e 0 Œ¥ e 0 g p Œ¥ p g n Œ¥ n neglecting the changes in catchment characteristics the eq 9 can be simplified as 10 Œ¥ r g e 0 Œ¥ e 0 g p Œ¥ p the g e 0 and g p can be calculated from eq 8 as 11 g e 0 1 e 0 p n n 1 n g p 1 1 e 0 p n n 1 n here we use Œµ e 0 and Œµ p to respectively represent g e 0 and g p for clarity thus eq 10 can be written as 12 Œ¥ r Œµ e 0 Œ¥ e 0 Œµ p Œ¥ p therefore the estimated std is 13 œÉ r est Œµ e 0 2 œÉ e 0 2 Œµ p 2 œÉ p 2 2 Œµ e 0 Œµ p c o v e 0 p where the œÉ e 0 and œÉ p are the std of e 0 and p respectively and the term of cov is the covariance function if e 0 and p are independent and œÉ e 0 can be neglected as mentioned in koster and suarez 1999 eq 13 leads to 14 œÉ r e s t Œµ p œÉ p a certain underestimation of the œÉ r e s t is founded by either the complete eq 13 or simplified eq 14 and it had a value of 11 in mcmahon et al 2011 and a higher proportion of 29 in sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 thus we suppose that the deviation could be corrected efficiently as 15 œÉ r Œ≥ 1 œÉ r e s t where œÉ r is the observed std of ar and Œ≥ 1 is the magnification factor combining eqs 5 8 14 and 15 the variation coefficient c v r est can be estimated as 16 c v r est Œ≥ 1 1 1 e 0 p n n 1 n 1 1 e 0 p n 1 n œÉ p p 3 3 the correction of gcm output data to explore the ar changes in the third level basins under the future scenario the projected meteorological data from the gcms were used to drive the model to correct the first order error of the data output by gcms we assumed there is a systematic bias Œ¥ a between the output of the gcms and the observation data for each basin which can be written as 17 Œ¥ a a gcm a obs where a gcm and a obs are the gcm output and observation data respectively Œ¥ a was calculated according to the historical data and then applied to correct the projected data for each basin additionally the systematic bias of inter annual variability of p between observed data and output of gcms was corrected simultaneously as 18 œÉ p b Œ≥ 2 œÉ p b gcm where œÉ p b and œÉ p b gcm are the std of the observation annual p and the gcm annual p respectively thus factor Œ≥ 2 can be estimated as Œ≥ 2 œÉ p b œÉ p b gcms in each basin during the historical period and then applied to estimate the std of p under future scenarios 3 4 the consideration of non stationarity the annual runoff statistic parameters mar and std are estimated by eq 7 and 15 and cv can be subsequently calculated as std mar or eq 16 in this study the effects of non stationarity caused by climate change are considered to be encoded in the projected changes in the three statistic parameters more specifically for a given basin the two sets parameters under historical and future scenarios are both obtained through eq 7 15 and 16 but driven by climate forcings on the corresponding study period after projected data is corrected ultimately the characteristics of hydrological events i e characteristic annual runoff and return periods will change accordingly the relative results are provided in the next section 4 results 4 1 the magnification factor fig 3 a shows a very strong linear relationship between the estimated œÉ r e s t by the complete eq 13 and the simplified eq 14 with a slope of 0 932 and a correlation coefficient of 0 998 this indicates that the simplified equation can model the annual variance accurately and the covariance and pet terms could be arguably neglected fig 3 b shows an underestimation in the estimated std by eq 14 through the comparison with observed data and the high correlation r2 of 0 93 indicates the underestimation is spatial stable among basins with different characteristics see the temporal stable analysis in discussion section here we introduce a magnification factor of Œ≥ 1 1 358 to correct the deviation 4 2 future ar change in the third level basins 4 2 1 the mar change the changes in mar under the three climate scenarios show similar spatial patterns fig 4 increased changes mainly appear in western and northeastern china and the increase is smaller than 20 mm year in most basins but larger than 20 mm year in the upstream region of the southwestern rivers basin and even larger than 40 mm year in southern tibet decreased change mainly appears in the central and southern regions of china and in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin the decrease is less than 20 mm year in the yellow river basin besides the decrease ranges within 0 40 mm year in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin but is larger than 40 mm year in its middle reaches significantly in the pearl river basin the decrease is generally more than 40 mm year and is even larger than 80 mm year under rcp8 5 as shown in fig 5 there are small variations in the number of basins within different ar intervals under the three scenarios relative to historical period with the increase of mar the number of basin decreases rapidly and mar in more than 50 basins are less than 300 mm year no matter in historical period or projected scenarios under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 relative to average mar of 348 mm year in the historical period the projected values shows small decreased changes of 5 and 7 mm year while a larger negative trend of 16 mm year is detected under the rcp8 5 it may suggest that the intensification of global warming would further reduce the available water resources the further analysis shows that although there would be a increase of the mean annual precipitation about 18 mm year under three scenarios a higher increase of atmosphere evaporation demanding pet of 95 mm year leads to a slight decrease in mean annual runoff ultimately table s1 overall although mar has shown a certain trend of decrease the total accessible water amount in china will remain relatively constant in the coming decades fig 6 shows the relationship between the mar change and the aridity index 188 basins are shown in which 19 basins with an aridity index greater than 8 were excluded the proportion of basins with an increased mar are 51 44 and 43 under the three scenarios respectively the mar shows decreases in all humid basins and increases in almost all extreme arid basins under equitant and general arid conditions as the aridity index increases the number of basins with decreased mar gradually decreases this result positively indicates a more even spatial distribution of the future available water resources in china 4 2 2 the iarv change fig 7 shows the Œ≥ 2 values of which more than 85 basins ranges from 0 6 to 1 4 according to eqs 15 and 19 the std of ar in each basin can be estimated as œÉ r b Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 œÉ r e s t b gcms 1 358 Œ≥ 2 œÉ r e s t b gcms under the three scenarios the std has a similar spatial distribution that decreases from southeast to northwest fig 8 in most basins in northern china the std is less than 50 mm year and reaches more than 300 mm year in the southeastern rivers basin and pearl river basin for the spatial distribution of cv the basins with a high cv greater than 0 4 are mainly located in the lower reaches of the yellow river basin hai river basin huai river basin and liao river basin and the basins with a low cv less than 0 2 are located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin and east of the southwest river basin remarkably the largest cv greater than 1 2 appears in several sub basins in the hai river basin additionally under rcp4 5 northern region of yellow river basin shows the largest cv under the three scenarios the proportions of basins with an increased std are 80 70 and 68 average 74 respectively in which approximately 20 will change by more than 20 the proportions of basins with an increased cv are 84 76 and 77 average 79 respectively in which approximately 12 will change by more than 20 the basins with decreased iarv change are mainly in the northwestern part of the northwest rivers basin pearl river basin lower reach of yellow river basin and lower reach of yangtze river basin in fig 9 we can see that the std changes show a positive trend with the aridity index increase and cv in most basins with a high historical value greater than 0 4 will continue to increase in the future overall there will be a larger fluctuation in the temporal variability of annual runoff under future scenarios 4 2 3 the ar changes in the wet year and dry year the specified probability values of p 25 and p 75 are selected to represent the wet year and the dry year respectively as shown in fig 10 in the wet year ar increases mainly occur in the northwestern river basin songhua river basin liao river basin southwest river basin upper reaches of the yellow river basin and upper reaches of the yangtze river basin significantly the increase exceeds 40 mm year in the southeast river basin south of tibet as for the decrease change of wet year although it is generally no more than 60 mm year under rcp2 6 it could even exceed 80 mm year in the upper reaches of the pearl river basin under rcp8 5 in the dry year ar increases are generally no more than 40 mm year and the basins with decreases are mainly located in the southeastern central and northern parts of china and south of the southwestern rivers basin remarkably in parts of sub basins in the pearl river basin and the middle southern region of the yangtze river basin the decrease exceeds 80 mm year under rcp8 5 under the three rcps the proportions of basins with the decreased annual runoff changes in the wet year are 50 and that in dry year is 66 table 1 as shown in fig 11 considering all basins as average the ar in the wet dry year is 431 270 mm year in the historical period and under the three scenarios respectively are 431 258 mm year 426 260 mm year and 416 252 mm year with the relative changes of 0 4 1 4 and 3 6 5 discussion 5 1 the parameter estimation for the annual runoff frequency distribution this study proposed a framework to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution based on the choudhury yang equation in this framework it is critical to accurately estimate the std of the ar œÉ r e s t previous studies reported that the value of œÉ r e s t was generally underestimated by the budyko hypothesis mcmahon et al 2011 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 yu et al 2015 therefore we made two assumptions i e 1 the interannual variation in ar mainly comes from that of p and 2 there is a stable systematic bias in the estimated interannual variation in ar by the budyko method fig 3 a reveals that assumption 1 can lead to 7 underestimation of œÉ r e s t in the 291 catchments in addition the comparison of estimated third level basin std using the complete and simplified equations in historical period and under future scenarios are given in fig 12 a which shows that the regression coefficients range from 0 914 to 0 928 representing an 8 underestimate very close to the value of 7 in the 291 catchments these values are also similar to the result of mcmahon et al 2011 who found a regression coefficient of 0 917 across global 699 catchments accordingly it can be speculated that the underestimate caused by the simplified equation is relatively small and stable at approximately 7 8 this underestimation also leads to part of the systematic bias in assumption 2 to test assumption 2 we selected 170 catchments with 55 year runoff observations which were categorized into two periods the first period p1 from 1956 to 1990 35 years and the second period p2 from 1991 to 2010 20 years fig 12 b shows that the ratio of observed std over the estimated std in the two periods œÉ r o s b p 1 œÉ r e s t p 1 œÉ r o s b p 2 œÉ r e s t p 2 ranges from 0 6 to 1 4 in more than 80 of the basins and ranges from 0 8 to 1 2 in nearly 60 of the basins a recent global study by liu et al 2019 showed that the proportion of precipitation contribution to std is relatively constant in neither humid or arid basins which may further support the rationality of assumption 2 these results indicate that combining a deviation correction using only variance of p to estimate std is applicable and sufficient for practical application besides of the p —à type distribution curve other distribution types can be also used in this framework table 2 lists several distribution types and their statistical parameters regarding the distribution functions with two parameters the parameters the mean value and the std can be estimated directly using our proposed framework regarding the distribution functions with three parameters the third parameter can be estimated by deriving the third moment of ar based on the choudhury yang equation or proposing a relationship between the skewness coefficient and the variance coefficient e g when the logarithmic normal is used the relationship is c s 3 c v c v 3 chow 1954 actually previous study has demonstrated that these distribution types can all capture the ar well and there is little difference among them kuang et al 2018 in addition in the previous study the distribution curve was considered as time varying by introducing a time varying controlling parameter for curve shape and the original p —à distribution used in this study is found with the highest accuracy xiong et al 2014 it should be mentioned that a strong empirical method is applied to estimate the skewness coefficient cs a fixed relationship cs 2 5cv was used in each third level basin due to the large uncertainty in the calculation of the mix moment the linear relationship between cs and cv has always been considered be acceptable for practical application yu et al 2015 for comparison we also estimated the wet and dry year annual runoff with cs 2 0cv and cs 3 0cv table3 and the result shows that the difference among the three relationships is little remarkably this result is the average for all basins and for a given basin this coefficient should be further refined to reduce uncertainty in this framework the parameter n was assumed to be constant for a specific catchment in the choudhury yang equation some previous studies have shown that setting the n as a fixed value in the temporal dimension is materially feasible to investigate long term runoff change donohue et al 2011 roderick et al 2014 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2019 indeed the parameter n was influenced by various of external factors such as vegetation states berghuijs et al 2017 li et al 2013 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2018 elevated co2 donohue et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 dynamic balance of plant roots guswa 2008 liu et al 2016 decrease in glaciers snowmelt and frozen ground wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 change in soil properties and urbanization debbage and shepherd 2018 mejia et al 2015 dam construction jaramillo and destouni 2015 and disaster events such as fires donohue et al 2017 however the accurate modelling of n with interior physics is still unclear and needs further exploration padron et al 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 to further clarify the effect of ignoring the change of n in the proposed framework we test the sensitivity of mean value std cv and the wet year and dry year ar to a 20 change of n across 291 catchments table 4 except about 1 5 times proportionate change is shown between cv and n a 1 change in n results in a 1 5 relative change in cv others are weakly sensitive to n especially the mar and characteristic annual runoff showed changes of 1 furthermore using an empirical relationship of n and vegetation state we roughly projected the changes in n under rcp8 5 text s1 and figure s1 and applied it to estimate the mar and std results shows little differences in the estimated statistic parameters and the estimated wet and dry year annual runoff that respectively using the projected and fixed n figure s2 and s3 therefore setting n as a fixed value for a given basin is robustly acceptable and sufficient for our objectives 5 2 the change in future water resources under the non stationarity an accurate estimation of ar statistic parameters and frequency distribution is critical to practical projects the spatial distributions of the mar change under the three scenarios are similar and in terms of the overall pattern it will decrease by 2 7 showing a decreasing trend in southern china and an increasing trend in northern china a summary of previous studies which also projected the mar change in china is given in table 5 our study is consistent with most of the others and indicates that from the perspective of the spatial distribution of mar change the northern dry and southern wet condition will be eased and future water use is optimistic additionally our results could offer the suggestion for some large scale water conservancy projects to maintain the balance between the supply and demand however the iarv will continuously increase in more than 70 of the basins which is mainly caused by the increased variability in p text s2 and figure s4 leng et al 2015 also projected the similar iarv changes by using variable inflation capacity vic model it may indicate that larger capacity for inter annual water resources allocation is required to further clarify the effects of non stationarity on annual runoff we selected several basins to calculate the return period of the wet and dry years under two sets of statistical parameters table 6 and figure s5 for example the no 95 beiluo river basin located in the middle reach of the yellow river basin and with general aridity climatic conditions aridity index 2 04 the mar and cv values are 38 mm year and 0 76 in the historical period and 32 mm year and 0 88 in the future respectively the ar values of 50 and 17 mm year correspond to the specified probabilities of 25 and 75 in the historical period in the future with the new statistic parameters the ar of 50 and 17 mm year will respectively correspond to 19 and 62 and the return period increases and decreases from 4 years to 5 4 and 2 6 years thus for this basin a larger reservoir capacity is required to meet the water use demand besides the systemic bias in the climate model has been described in some previous studies chen et al 2011 liu et al 2017 vetter et al 2017 specifically for the beiluo river basin we quantified the uncertainty by calculating the standard deviation of typical years return periods of the five gcms as shown in fig 13 the standard deviation in the wet year is about 0 9 and that in the day year is about 1 5 in the future study more gcms should be selected for analysis to obtain a more reliable projections 5 3 potential applications in spite of the impacts of human activities and vegetation variation has not been take into account which mainly influence the value of parameter n the sensitivity analysis have shown that such impacts would not change our conclusion materially besides these external influences may be implicitly encoded in the changes in statistic parameters due to co evolution between climate and vegetation actually the proposed framework has the potential to analytically quantify such effects on the annual runoff for example dividing the study period of 1961 2000 used as the historical period in this study into two stages and the parameter n could be inverted based on two stage long term water balance respectively the relationship of n and external controlling factors as mentioned in section 5 1 could be developed empirically and the contribution of these factors could further detected from the difference of the two n values jiang et al 2015 ning et al 2020 wei et al 2018 besides the two stage separation approach the moving average analysis with 5 or 10 year period would be also a useful method to quantify the response of temporal hydrological changes to external influences zhang et al 2016c 6 conclusion climate change has broken the stationarity of the hydrological process to estimate the ar frequency distribution under non stationarity this study proposed a framework to quantify the response of typical hydrological events to climate forcings the statistic parameters mar and std were approached using the budyko based choudhury yang equation a magnification factor of 1 358 was introduced to correct the widely reported underestimation of estimated std with the budyko based method furthermore by combining with p —à frequency function we estimated the ar frequency distribution of 207 three level basins across china during 2020 2050 under three rcps specifically the cases of the wet year p 25 and dry year p 75 were given compared with the historical period the mar shows a decreased change in southern china and an increased change in northern china with a negative 2 7 change of the total accessible water resource additionally the spatial distribution of mar is tend to be even in the future however the increment of the iarv appearing in more than 70 of the basins highlighted a new difficulty in water resource allocation for the ar in two typical hydrological years approximately half of the basins show a decreased change in the wet year and that in dry year is approximately 65 particularly in the basin with an increase return period of the wet year and a decrease return period of the dry year a larger reservoir capacity may be required for the inter annual regulation of water resources these findings clarify the effects of climate change on the spatial temporal distribution of future water

5024,an increase in climate change has been leading to non stationarity in hydrological variables therefore a simple framework within the budyko hypothesis is proposed to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution and provide a new method for practical application in hydrological design under the non stationarity in this framework the annual runoff statistic parameters mean value mar and standard deviation std are derived by the choudhury yang equation at the same time a magnification factor Œ≥ 1 1 358 is introduced to correct the underestimation of the budyko based estimated std according to observation data in 291 catchments across china furthermore the p —à type frequency curve is selected to calculate the annual runoff on a specific design return period here the impacts of non stationarity caused by climate change was considered to be encoded in the changes in statistic parameters and frequency distribution based on this framework the changes in water resources in 207 three level basins across china during 2020 2050 are given the results show that the average mar will decrease by 2 7 for all basins and the spatial distribution of mar will be more even i e it will increase in the north of china and decrease in the south of china however the inter annual variability of annual runoff shown as std and variance coefficient cv will increase in more than 70 of basins additionally in the dry year about 65 of basins show decreased runoff change which indicates a larger reservoir capacity is need for water resource allocation these findings offer a simple and effective way to re examine the effects of non stationarity on projected annual runoff keywords budyko hypothesis annual runoff frequency prediction non stationarity 1 introduction hydrologic design is the process of assessing the impact of hydrologic events on a water resource system and choosing the key variables of the system so that it will perform adequately chow et al 1988 generally the hydrologic design responding to water resource planning and management is based on the assumption that hydrological events are independent and stationary which means that the controlling factors of hydrological processes e g climate condition remain statistically stable in the past present and future gilroy and mccuen 2012 khaliq et al 2006 however after the industrial revolution the dramatic climate changes such as increasing temperature and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have destabilized the climate system and altered the independent and identical distribution of hydrological variables it would undoubtedly lead to a higher actual risk and cost of practical projects with the original stationarity assumption brown and caldeira 2017 ipcc 2013 milly et al 2005 2008 yang et al 2015 the estimation of annual runoff ar frequency as the core and fundamental of hydrological design has always been the interest for engineers and managers a better understanding of how annual runoff response to the climate changes is of great significance to a reasonable water resources allocation and management the mean annual runoff mar as a first order statistic parameter of ar generally represents the long term accessible water resource many previous studies have explored the impacts of climate change on mar hodgkins 2009 huang et al 2016 among existing studies hydrological and atmosphere models have been commonly used cao et al 2010 gedney et al 2006 the generic steps of these methods are firstly simulating continuous runoff and subsequently analyzing the trend and its causes for example based on the geomorphology based hydrological model proposed by yang et al 2002 cong et al 2009 revealed that intensification of climate change after the 1990 s accelerated the runoff decrease in the yellow river basin a positive change of runoff in the hei river basin was reported by zhang et al 2016a with the combination of soil water assessment tool swat model and global climate models gcms although such models provide an effective way to identify the runoff trend their complicated structure and numerous parameters would largely increase computation cost and lead to high unquantified uncertainties beck et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2012a 2012b zaherpour et al 2018 in that case the budyko framework budyko 1974 linking long term mean actual evapotranspiration et to precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet is favored as an explicit approach to describe the land surface water balance compared to the former method such conceptual bottom up model basically has only one or zero parameter needed to be calibrated which largely reduces uncertainties and calculative burden in conjunction with the elasticity approach schaake 1990 the budyko type rainfall runoff model has been proved as an extremely useful tool in the analysis of long term runoff changes roderick et al 2014 yang and yang 2011 in the elasticity method the changes in runoff was generally divided to contributions from p and pet which respectively represent the water supply to and demand from a catchment a comprehensive study conducted by huang et al 2016 showed that the p plays a dominant role in runoff changes in china and the similar conclusion was also found in other regions brikowski 2015 donohue et al 2011 singh and kumar 2015 milly et al 2018 used the budyko type framework to clarify that the temperature change which embedded in pet could significant affects the variation of ar besides the budyko method has been also widely applied to runoff projection in the changing climate roderick et al 2014 yang et al 2019 xing et al 2018 projected a spatial pattern of increase mar change in north of china and decrease change in the south the findings from which was also reported by guo et al 2015 based on the budyko based analysis of several hundred basins across china chen et al 2017 claimed that more than half of them will experience water shortages mar decrease by the middle of the coming century besides the first order parameter mar the second order parameter i e the standard deviation std which represents the inter annual runoff variability iarv was also the essential for estimating ar frequency distribution similarly the iarv could also divide into the individual and co variability of p and pet a straightforward extension of budyko equation is to estimate the std of runoff or et with the central moment method in the recent decades the temporal variability of et on the region and global scales have been widely investigated with the original or improved approach of koster and suarez 1999 which firstly proposed an analytical method within budyko framework to assess the response of inter annual variability of et to climate forcings arora 2002 koster et al 2006 li 2014 zeng and cai 2015 2016 analogously the framework could be also used to examine the iarv and its drivers arora 2002 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 tekleab et al 2011 yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 the common conclusion is that the iarv is mainly controlled by the variability of p especially in the humid regions liu et al 2019 milly and dunne 2002 wang and alimohammadi 2012 by accounting for variance of terrestrial storage the framework could be also applied to evaluate the effects of climate on runoff variability on intra annual or seasonal scales liu et al 2019 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b as mentioned above the central moment derived method is the mathematical tool for estimating ar second order parameters std there would be some inevitably uncertainty in the mix moment estimation which results in more or less deviations in previous studies a underestimation 10 30 of budyko based estimated std was found through the comparison with observations mcmahon et al 2011 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 yu et al 2015 in this study we will examine whether the deviation is temporal spatial stable and introduce a simple and practical correction method for subsequent frequency estimation overall the budyko based method does provide a simple and effective way to quantify the responses of annual runoff to climate forcings this study will use the budyko based approach to develop a conceptual rainfall runoff model for calculating annual runoff statistic parameters here we consider the effects of non stationarity are embedded in the changes of the statistic parameters mar and std under historical period and future scenarios the p iii distribution function is further selected to obtain the characteristic ar on any return period or probability p yang et al 2014a in summary the objectives of this study are to i correct the deviation of budyko based estimated std ii develop a framework for annual runoff frequency estimation with the consideration of the non stationarity iii apply the framework to predict the changes in ar statistic parameters and frequency distribution across china the wet year p 25 and dry year p 75 are chosen as the specific calculations of frequency estimation the materials and methodology are introduced in section 2 and 3 the results are presented in section 4 and followed by the detailed discussions in section 5 2 materials 2 1 catchments across china in total 291 catchments across china with areas spanning from 372 to 142 963 km2 were selected the annual restored runoff data from 1956 to 2000 of each catchment was collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the effect of human activities i e dam construction and irrigation has already been mostly removed and the restored data can be considered as the approximate natural runoff fig 1 a 261 out of the 291 catchments had ar series longer than 40 years and others had record lengths of at least 21 years daily series of p and meteorological data were collected from 736 stations and interpolated to 10 km grid by yang et al 2014b with the inverse distance weighted method the daily pet was estimated by the penman equation penman 1948 for each grid then the daily p and pet were summed the annual value and averaged to each catchment the aridity index of catchments ranging from 0 5 to 13 is shown in fig 1 b here we define the climate conditions as follows humid condition aridity index 0 76 equitant condition 0 76 aridity index 1 35 and general aridity condition aridity index 1 35 mcvicar et al 2012 additionally the extreme aridity condition is defined by an aridity index larger than 3 2 2 third level basins across china total of 209 third level basins across china with areas spanning from 3 100 to 682 700 km2 were investigated due to no observation ar data in third level basins we estimated the mar from 1961 to 2000 by multiplying the mean annual p by the mar coefficient in each basin which was collected from hydrological year books of china fig 2 a and b the aridity index of third level basins ranging from 0 5 to 47 91 of basins range from 0 5 to 8 is shown in fig 2 c mar coefficients of tarim river mainstream basin no 53 and taklamakan desert basin no 67 were equal to zero thus total of 207 third level basins were finally selected two kinds of meteorological datasets were used for third level basins the first one was the 10 km gridded dataset yang et al 2014b as mentioned in section 2 1 the second one which included the daily p maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed at 0 5 spatial resolution was from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 of the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project the 1961 2000 was set as the historical period and 2020 2050 as the future period five global climate models gcms namely gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m under three scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used here for convenience we call the two datasets as the observation data and the gcm data respectively 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic design for water use the frequency density function for ar can be described by the p iii type distribution 1 f x Œ≤ Œ± Œ≥ Œ± x a 0 Œ± 1 e Œ≤ x a 0 where x is the variable Œ≥ Œ± is the gama function with Œ± and Œ≤ and a 0 being parameters the three parameters can be estimated as Œ± 4 c s 2 Œ≤ 2 x c v c s and a 0 x 1 2 c v c s where x is the average of the random variable cv is the variation coefficient and c s is the skewness coefficient the probability that the random variable x is not less than x p can be written as 2 p x x p x p f x d x for the ar design a set of observations r 1 r 2 rl of the ar series can be chosen and considered as a sample drawn from a hypothetical infinite ar series with constant statistical properties thus we can obtain the characteristic ar of a certain probability and define the wet year and dry year with corresponding p values from eq 1 three ar statistic parameters namely mar cv and c s are need for frequency estimation the mar can be calculated as 3 r 1 l i 1 l r i where the l is the record length and ri is annual runoff in the i th year the variation coefficient can be estimated as 4 c v r œÉ r r where the œÉ r is the std of ar and could be computed as 5 œÉ r 1 l 1 i 1 l r i r 2 the skewness coefficient is usually estimated as yang et al 2014a yu et al 2015 6 c s r Œª c v r where Œª is the proportional coefficient and varies from 2 to 3 with a step size of 0 5 for catchments across china yang et al 2014a from the above only two parameters mar and std are materially required for ungauged or poor gauged basins without long term runoff observations the two parameters could be derived from the climatic forcings with the budyko type rainfall runoff model as introduced below 3 2 estimation of ar statistic parameters with the budyko model the choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 an analytically derived and widely used budyko type equation was selected to estimate the statistical parameters based on the choudhury yang equation and the long term water balance the mar can be estimated as 7a r p e p e 0 p p e 0 n 1 n where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration e 0 is the mean annual pet that calculated by penman 1948 and n is the land specific parameter which representing catchment characteristics for convenience the eq 7a was denoted as 7b g e 0 p n p e 0 p p n e 0 n 1 n the estimated ar can be written as 8 r est g e 0 p n thus the variation in r Œ¥ r can be estimated as 9 Œ¥ r g e 0 Œ¥ e 0 g p Œ¥ p g n Œ¥ n neglecting the changes in catchment characteristics the eq 9 can be simplified as 10 Œ¥ r g e 0 Œ¥ e 0 g p Œ¥ p the g e 0 and g p can be calculated from eq 8 as 11 g e 0 1 e 0 p n n 1 n g p 1 1 e 0 p n n 1 n here we use Œµ e 0 and Œµ p to respectively represent g e 0 and g p for clarity thus eq 10 can be written as 12 Œ¥ r Œµ e 0 Œ¥ e 0 Œµ p Œ¥ p therefore the estimated std is 13 œÉ r est Œµ e 0 2 œÉ e 0 2 Œµ p 2 œÉ p 2 2 Œµ e 0 Œµ p c o v e 0 p where the œÉ e 0 and œÉ p are the std of e 0 and p respectively and the term of cov is the covariance function if e 0 and p are independent and œÉ e 0 can be neglected as mentioned in koster and suarez 1999 eq 13 leads to 14 œÉ r e s t Œµ p œÉ p a certain underestimation of the œÉ r e s t is founded by either the complete eq 13 or simplified eq 14 and it had a value of 11 in mcmahon et al 2011 and a higher proportion of 29 in sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 thus we suppose that the deviation could be corrected efficiently as 15 œÉ r Œ≥ 1 œÉ r e s t where œÉ r is the observed std of ar and Œ≥ 1 is the magnification factor combining eqs 5 8 14 and 15 the variation coefficient c v r est can be estimated as 16 c v r est Œ≥ 1 1 1 e 0 p n n 1 n 1 1 e 0 p n 1 n œÉ p p 3 3 the correction of gcm output data to explore the ar changes in the third level basins under the future scenario the projected meteorological data from the gcms were used to drive the model to correct the first order error of the data output by gcms we assumed there is a systematic bias Œ¥ a between the output of the gcms and the observation data for each basin which can be written as 17 Œ¥ a a gcm a obs where a gcm and a obs are the gcm output and observation data respectively Œ¥ a was calculated according to the historical data and then applied to correct the projected data for each basin additionally the systematic bias of inter annual variability of p between observed data and output of gcms was corrected simultaneously as 18 œÉ p b Œ≥ 2 œÉ p b gcm where œÉ p b and œÉ p b gcm are the std of the observation annual p and the gcm annual p respectively thus factor Œ≥ 2 can be estimated as Œ≥ 2 œÉ p b œÉ p b gcms in each basin during the historical period and then applied to estimate the std of p under future scenarios 3 4 the consideration of non stationarity the annual runoff statistic parameters mar and std are estimated by eq 7 and 15 and cv can be subsequently calculated as std mar or eq 16 in this study the effects of non stationarity caused by climate change are considered to be encoded in the projected changes in the three statistic parameters more specifically for a given basin the two sets parameters under historical and future scenarios are both obtained through eq 7 15 and 16 but driven by climate forcings on the corresponding study period after projected data is corrected ultimately the characteristics of hydrological events i e characteristic annual runoff and return periods will change accordingly the relative results are provided in the next section 4 results 4 1 the magnification factor fig 3 a shows a very strong linear relationship between the estimated œÉ r e s t by the complete eq 13 and the simplified eq 14 with a slope of 0 932 and a correlation coefficient of 0 998 this indicates that the simplified equation can model the annual variance accurately and the covariance and pet terms could be arguably neglected fig 3 b shows an underestimation in the estimated std by eq 14 through the comparison with observed data and the high correlation r2 of 0 93 indicates the underestimation is spatial stable among basins with different characteristics see the temporal stable analysis in discussion section here we introduce a magnification factor of Œ≥ 1 1 358 to correct the deviation 4 2 future ar change in the third level basins 4 2 1 the mar change the changes in mar under the three climate scenarios show similar spatial patterns fig 4 increased changes mainly appear in western and northeastern china and the increase is smaller than 20 mm year in most basins but larger than 20 mm year in the upstream region of the southwestern rivers basin and even larger than 40 mm year in southern tibet decreased change mainly appears in the central and southern regions of china and in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin the decrease is less than 20 mm year in the yellow river basin besides the decrease ranges within 0 40 mm year in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin but is larger than 40 mm year in its middle reaches significantly in the pearl river basin the decrease is generally more than 40 mm year and is even larger than 80 mm year under rcp8 5 as shown in fig 5 there are small variations in the number of basins within different ar intervals under the three scenarios relative to historical period with the increase of mar the number of basin decreases rapidly and mar in more than 50 basins are less than 300 mm year no matter in historical period or projected scenarios under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 relative to average mar of 348 mm year in the historical period the projected values shows small decreased changes of 5 and 7 mm year while a larger negative trend of 16 mm year is detected under the rcp8 5 it may suggest that the intensification of global warming would further reduce the available water resources the further analysis shows that although there would be a increase of the mean annual precipitation about 18 mm year under three scenarios a higher increase of atmosphere evaporation demanding pet of 95 mm year leads to a slight decrease in mean annual runoff ultimately table s1 overall although mar has shown a certain trend of decrease the total accessible water amount in china will remain relatively constant in the coming decades fig 6 shows the relationship between the mar change and the aridity index 188 basins are shown in which 19 basins with an aridity index greater than 8 were excluded the proportion of basins with an increased mar are 51 44 and 43 under the three scenarios respectively the mar shows decreases in all humid basins and increases in almost all extreme arid basins under equitant and general arid conditions as the aridity index increases the number of basins with decreased mar gradually decreases this result positively indicates a more even spatial distribution of the future available water resources in china 4 2 2 the iarv change fig 7 shows the Œ≥ 2 values of which more than 85 basins ranges from 0 6 to 1 4 according to eqs 15 and 19 the std of ar in each basin can be estimated as œÉ r b Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 œÉ r e s t b gcms 1 358 Œ≥ 2 œÉ r e s t b gcms under the three scenarios the std has a similar spatial distribution that decreases from southeast to northwest fig 8 in most basins in northern china the std is less than 50 mm year and reaches more than 300 mm year in the southeastern rivers basin and pearl river basin for the spatial distribution of cv the basins with a high cv greater than 0 4 are mainly located in the lower reaches of the yellow river basin hai river basin huai river basin and liao river basin and the basins with a low cv less than 0 2 are located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin and east of the southwest river basin remarkably the largest cv greater than 1 2 appears in several sub basins in the hai river basin additionally under rcp4 5 northern region of yellow river basin shows the largest cv under the three scenarios the proportions of basins with an increased std are 80 70 and 68 average 74 respectively in which approximately 20 will change by more than 20 the proportions of basins with an increased cv are 84 76 and 77 average 79 respectively in which approximately 12 will change by more than 20 the basins with decreased iarv change are mainly in the northwestern part of the northwest rivers basin pearl river basin lower reach of yellow river basin and lower reach of yangtze river basin in fig 9 we can see that the std changes show a positive trend with the aridity index increase and cv in most basins with a high historical value greater than 0 4 will continue to increase in the future overall there will be a larger fluctuation in the temporal variability of annual runoff under future scenarios 4 2 3 the ar changes in the wet year and dry year the specified probability values of p 25 and p 75 are selected to represent the wet year and the dry year respectively as shown in fig 10 in the wet year ar increases mainly occur in the northwestern river basin songhua river basin liao river basin southwest river basin upper reaches of the yellow river basin and upper reaches of the yangtze river basin significantly the increase exceeds 40 mm year in the southeast river basin south of tibet as for the decrease change of wet year although it is generally no more than 60 mm year under rcp2 6 it could even exceed 80 mm year in the upper reaches of the pearl river basin under rcp8 5 in the dry year ar increases are generally no more than 40 mm year and the basins with decreases are mainly located in the southeastern central and northern parts of china and south of the southwestern rivers basin remarkably in parts of sub basins in the pearl river basin and the middle southern region of the yangtze river basin the decrease exceeds 80 mm year under rcp8 5 under the three rcps the proportions of basins with the decreased annual runoff changes in the wet year are 50 and that in dry year is 66 table 1 as shown in fig 11 considering all basins as average the ar in the wet dry year is 431 270 mm year in the historical period and under the three scenarios respectively are 431 258 mm year 426 260 mm year and 416 252 mm year with the relative changes of 0 4 1 4 and 3 6 5 discussion 5 1 the parameter estimation for the annual runoff frequency distribution this study proposed a framework to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution based on the choudhury yang equation in this framework it is critical to accurately estimate the std of the ar œÉ r e s t previous studies reported that the value of œÉ r e s t was generally underestimated by the budyko hypothesis mcmahon et al 2011 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 yu et al 2015 therefore we made two assumptions i e 1 the interannual variation in ar mainly comes from that of p and 2 there is a stable systematic bias in the estimated interannual variation in ar by the budyko method fig 3 a reveals that assumption 1 can lead to 7 underestimation of œÉ r e s t in the 291 catchments in addition the comparison of estimated third level basin std using the complete and simplified equations in historical period and under future scenarios are given in fig 12 a which shows that the regression coefficients range from 0 914 to 0 928 representing an 8 underestimate very close to the value of 7 in the 291 catchments these values are also similar to the result of mcmahon et al 2011 who found a regression coefficient of 0 917 across global 699 catchments accordingly it can be speculated that the underestimate caused by the simplified equation is relatively small and stable at approximately 7 8 this underestimation also leads to part of the systematic bias in assumption 2 to test assumption 2 we selected 170 catchments with 55 year runoff observations which were categorized into two periods the first period p1 from 1956 to 1990 35 years and the second period p2 from 1991 to 2010 20 years fig 12 b shows that the ratio of observed std over the estimated std in the two periods œÉ r o s b p 1 œÉ r e s t p 1 œÉ r o s b p 2 œÉ r e s t p 2 ranges from 0 6 to 1 4 in more than 80 of the basins and ranges from 0 8 to 1 2 in nearly 60 of the basins a recent global study by liu et al 2019 showed that the proportion of precipitation contribution to std is relatively constant in neither humid or arid basins which may further support the rationality of assumption 2 these results indicate that combining a deviation correction using only variance of p to estimate std is applicable and sufficient for practical application besides of the p —à type distribution curve other distribution types can be also used in this framework table 2 lists several distribution types and their statistical parameters regarding the distribution functions with two parameters the parameters the mean value and the std can be estimated directly using our proposed framework regarding the distribution functions with three parameters the third parameter can be estimated by deriving the third moment of ar based on the choudhury yang equation or proposing a relationship between the skewness coefficient and the variance coefficient e g when the logarithmic normal is used the relationship is c s 3 c v c v 3 chow 1954 actually previous study has demonstrated that these distribution types can all capture the ar well and there is little difference among them kuang et al 2018 in addition in the previous study the distribution curve was considered as time varying by introducing a time varying controlling parameter for curve shape and the original p —à distribution used in this study is found with the highest accuracy xiong et al 2014 it should be mentioned that a strong empirical method is applied to estimate the skewness coefficient cs a fixed relationship cs 2 5cv was used in each third level basin due to the large uncertainty in the calculation of the mix moment the linear relationship between cs and cv has always been considered be acceptable for practical application yu et al 2015 for comparison we also estimated the wet and dry year annual runoff with cs 2 0cv and cs 3 0cv table3 and the result shows that the difference among the three relationships is little remarkably this result is the average for all basins and for a given basin this coefficient should be further refined to reduce uncertainty in this framework the parameter n was assumed to be constant for a specific catchment in the choudhury yang equation some previous studies have shown that setting the n as a fixed value in the temporal dimension is materially feasible to investigate long term runoff change donohue et al 2011 roderick et al 2014 xing et al 2018 yang et al 2019 indeed the parameter n was influenced by various of external factors such as vegetation states berghuijs et al 2017 li et al 2013 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2018 elevated co2 donohue et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 dynamic balance of plant roots guswa 2008 liu et al 2016 decrease in glaciers snowmelt and frozen ground wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 change in soil properties and urbanization debbage and shepherd 2018 mejia et al 2015 dam construction jaramillo and destouni 2015 and disaster events such as fires donohue et al 2017 however the accurate modelling of n with interior physics is still unclear and needs further exploration padron et al 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 to further clarify the effect of ignoring the change of n in the proposed framework we test the sensitivity of mean value std cv and the wet year and dry year ar to a 20 change of n across 291 catchments table 4 except about 1 5 times proportionate change is shown between cv and n a 1 change in n results in a 1 5 relative change in cv others are weakly sensitive to n especially the mar and characteristic annual runoff showed changes of 1 furthermore using an empirical relationship of n and vegetation state we roughly projected the changes in n under rcp8 5 text s1 and figure s1 and applied it to estimate the mar and std results shows little differences in the estimated statistic parameters and the estimated wet and dry year annual runoff that respectively using the projected and fixed n figure s2 and s3 therefore setting n as a fixed value for a given basin is robustly acceptable and sufficient for our objectives 5 2 the change in future water resources under the non stationarity an accurate estimation of ar statistic parameters and frequency distribution is critical to practical projects the spatial distributions of the mar change under the three scenarios are similar and in terms of the overall pattern it will decrease by 2 7 showing a decreasing trend in southern china and an increasing trend in northern china a summary of previous studies which also projected the mar change in china is given in table 5 our study is consistent with most of the others and indicates that from the perspective of the spatial distribution of mar change the northern dry and southern wet condition will be eased and future water use is optimistic additionally our results could offer the suggestion for some large scale water conservancy projects to maintain the balance between the supply and demand however the iarv will continuously increase in more than 70 of the basins which is mainly caused by the increased variability in p text s2 and figure s4 leng et al 2015 also projected the similar iarv changes by using variable inflation capacity vic model it may indicate that larger capacity for inter annual water resources allocation is required to further clarify the effects of non stationarity on annual runoff we selected several basins to calculate the return period of the wet and dry years under two sets of statistical parameters table 6 and figure s5 for example the no 95 beiluo river basin located in the middle reach of the yellow river basin and with general aridity climatic conditions aridity index 2 04 the mar and cv values are 38 mm year and 0 76 in the historical period and 32 mm year and 0 88 in the future respectively the ar values of 50 and 17 mm year correspond to the specified probabilities of 25 and 75 in the historical period in the future with the new statistic parameters the ar of 50 and 17 mm year will respectively correspond to 19 and 62 and the return period increases and decreases from 4 years to 5 4 and 2 6 years thus for this basin a larger reservoir capacity is required to meet the water use demand besides the systemic bias in the climate model has been described in some previous studies chen et al 2011 liu et al 2017 vetter et al 2017 specifically for the beiluo river basin we quantified the uncertainty by calculating the standard deviation of typical years return periods of the five gcms as shown in fig 13 the standard deviation in the wet year is about 0 9 and that in the day year is about 1 5 in the future study more gcms should be selected for analysis to obtain a more reliable projections 5 3 potential applications in spite of the impacts of human activities and vegetation variation has not been take into account which mainly influence the value of parameter n the sensitivity analysis have shown that such impacts would not change our conclusion materially besides these external influences may be implicitly encoded in the changes in statistic parameters due to co evolution between climate and vegetation actually the proposed framework has the potential to analytically quantify such effects on the annual runoff for example dividing the study period of 1961 2000 used as the historical period in this study into two stages and the parameter n could be inverted based on two stage long term water balance respectively the relationship of n and external controlling factors as mentioned in section 5 1 could be developed empirically and the contribution of these factors could further detected from the difference of the two n values jiang et al 2015 ning et al 2020 wei et al 2018 besides the two stage separation approach the moving average analysis with 5 or 10 year period would be also a useful method to quantify the response of temporal hydrological changes to external influences zhang et al 2016c 6 conclusion climate change has broken the stationarity of the hydrological process to estimate the ar frequency distribution under non stationarity this study proposed a framework to quantify the response of typical hydrological events to climate forcings the statistic parameters mar and std were approached using the budyko based choudhury yang equation a magnification factor of 1 358 was introduced to correct the widely reported underestimation of estimated std with the budyko based method furthermore by combining with p —à frequency function we estimated the ar frequency distribution of 207 three level basins across china during 2020 2050 under three rcps specifically the cases of the wet year p 25 and dry year p 75 were given compared with the historical period the mar shows a decreased change in southern china and an increased change in northern china with a negative 2 7 change of the total accessible water resource additionally the spatial distribution of mar is tend to be even in the future however the increment of the iarv appearing in more than 70 of the basins highlighted a new difficulty in water resource allocation for the ar in two typical hydrological years approximately half of the basins show a decreased change in the wet year and that in dry year is approximately 65 particularly in the basin with an increase return period of the wet year and a decrease return period of the dry year a larger reservoir capacity may be required for the inter annual regulation of water resources these findings clarify the effects of climate change on the spatial temporal distribution of future water
