6180,characterization of geological fault networks in sedimentary basins targeted for coal seam gas development typically use deep penetrating seismic data such methods can reveal the presence of numerous fault zones at depths greater than 100 m but not necessarily show if these extend to the surface or provide a significant degree of hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallower geological formations our combined multi tracer and hydrogeophysical study used transient electromagnetic surveys to image the subsurface in a sedimentary coal seam gas basin gloucester basin nsw australia and indicated that deep faults greater than 200 m from seismic analysis may extend to within metres of the ground surface analysis of environmental tracers in surface water and groundwater samples near fault traces showed the presence of hotspots of deeper groundwater from the coal seams discharging into the stream network via the alluvial aquifer the isotopic composition of methane was extremely variable in groundwater δ13c ch4 from 81 6 to 29 2 v pdb and surface water δ 13c ch4 from 56 0 to 19 9 v pdb suggesting several sources of methane being recycled in the connected alluvial aquifer and stream network a 4he hotspot 1 67 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 in the alluvial aquifer close to a fault line showed high methane 463 µg l 1 with a thermogenic signature δ 13c ch4 of 62 4 and δ2h ch4 of 174 7 the gloucester basin which has experienced multiple episodes of complex restructuring displays high dilation tendency of fractures close to fault damage zones with fracture orientations parallel to the orientation of maximum horizontal stress as a result there is increased permeability for wells close to the fault damage zone and with increasing depth these findings resulted in a robust hydrogeological conceptual model of a faulted basin which can be used in a monitoring and modelling framework for improved evaluation of risk associated with unconventional gas developments keywords geological faults coal seam gas and coal bed methane environmental tracers hydrogeophysics surface water groundwater interactions methane 1 introduction recent developments of unconventional gas resources in australia in particular coal seam gas csg have raised a number of environmental concerns around the associated risk of hydraulic fracturing fluids and methane leakage from coal seams into aquifers with leaky wells potentially providing the most plausible pathway commonwealth of australia 2014 shanafield et al 2018 wu et al 2016 a recent review of plausible pathways including geological faults for migration of unconventional gas chemicals e g hydraulic fracturing and geogenic chemicals natural gas into productive aquifers concluded that on the basis of micro seismic and hydrochemical studies on deep shale and tight gas in north america fluid migration pathways associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing that have the potential to contaminate productive aquifers are unlikely to exist in the absence of conductive faults or fractures mallants et al 2018a if on the other hand geological faults do exist assessment of their potential impact on groundwater quality in an unconventional gas development context requires adequate characterization faulkner et al 2010 and numerical modelling to explore the controls of fluid release kissinger et al 2013 reagan et al 2015 in australia csg reservoirs occur at significant depths between 300 and 1 000 m below ground williams et al 2012 and are often isolated from shallow aquifers and surface water systems via low permeability formations referred to as seals cap rocks or aquitards restricting vertical groundwater movement smith et al 2018 turnadge et al 2018 even in the presence of such low permeable formations migration of natural gas from a hydrocarbon resource into a groundwater body can still happen via natural or anthropogenic pathways natural pathways include very slow diffusion dominated migration across the aquitard rock matrix leythaeuser et al 1982 and relatively fast advection dominated migration via faults and fracture networks boothroyd et al 2017 or other geological features that provide a seal bypass cartwright et al 2007 anthropogenic pathways include leaky well casings abandoned wells and induced inter aquifer leakage caused by over pressurization of gas bearing formations shanafield et al 2018 wu et al 2016 thus to understand fault zone hydrogeology a conceptual framework is often used to classify fault zone behaviour as a conduit barrier or barrier conduit bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 caine and forster 1999 scibek et al 2016 to what degree such preferential flow pathways faults fracture networks and seal bypasses increase vertical hydraulic connectivity across low permeability formations is a key requirement for baseline assessments and monitoring programs jackson et al 2013 raynauld et al 2016 vengosh et al 2014 in many csg environments the location of faults at depth is determined via field surveys and drilling exploration assessments of the resource e g borehole geophysics juxtapositions observed in core and log correlations seismic surveys however the presence of faults at depth does not necessarily result in an enhanced vertical connectivity between deep and surficial geological formations because they may not extend to the surface or may not have increased vertical permeability in all circumstances hooper 1991 the influence of faults on regional groundwater flow and chemical transport has also been studied by means of environmental tracers bense et al 2013 darrah et al 2014 in groundwater surface water interaction studies common tracers include major ions including salinity the stable isotope ratios of the water molecule δ2h and δ18o noble gases including helium 4he and radon 222rn 3h and 14c banks et al 2011 brennwald et al 2016 cook et al 2006 ellins et al 1990 kipfer et al 2002 lamontagne et al 2015 222rn is considered to represent total groundwater discharge i e not to be source specific whereas 4he is more typically associated with regional older groundwater discharge cartwright and hofmann 2016 ellins et al 1990 gardner et al 2011 although methane as a natural gas is primarily of economic interest it is also an informative natural tracer in groundwater studies methane and its stable isotopes δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 have been used as tracers of fugitive emissions from hydrocarbon developments atkins et al 2015 boothroyd et al 2016 eyer et al 2015 hatch et al 2018 iverach et al 2015 mayer et al 2015 other studies have also used stream based methane concentrations to evaluate impacts of unconventional gas development heilweil et al 2013 and the fate of methane in coastal stream environments heilweil et al 2016 methane is produced either by bacteria biogenic methane or by geologic processes involving heat and pressure thermogenic methane cicerone and oremland 1988 whiticar et al 1986 in australia thermogenic methane source rocks typically occur at depths greater than 600 m faiz and hendry 2006 shallow geophysical surveys electrical resistivity tomography ert and transient electromagnetics tem have been used extensively to assist with the characterisation of near surface structural features auken et al 2015 auken et al 2006 loke et al 2013 they provide the means to determine whether deep fault traces found on seismic images extend to the surface while each of the above techniques i e environmental tracers methane and its isotopes and geophysics have been used separately to study the role of geological faults on groundwater we are not aware of any published study where the three techniques have been combined there have been studies that use in combination geophysics and tracers to improve characterisation of groundwater systems or oil and gas reservoirs however the tracers were artificially introduced and part of inter well tracer tests day lewis et al 2003 huseby et al 2008 in the specific context of csg related hydrogeological studies several hydrogeochemical and tracer studies have been reported however without a geophysical research component iverach et al 2015 owen and cox 2015 in australia the independent expert scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coal mining development iesc has recognised that one of the biggest knowledge gaps in hydrology and hydrogeology and geochemistry studies of groundwater systems in relation to coal and gas resource development is the almost complete lack of integration between classical petroleum geology and engineering analysis geophysics and hydrogeochemistry middlemis and peeters 2018 in this study the potential for enhanced vertical hydraulic connectivity near previously identified faults in a coal bearing sedimentary basin gloucester basin nsw is evaluated by 1 using shallow geophysical techniques transient electromagnetics to demonstrate whether deep seated faults extend to the surface and 2 determining the location and source of groundwater discharge to the alluvium and surface water network using environmental tracers we discuss the basic geological properties including the location of suspected major faults in the gloucester basin with an emphasis on an area previously identified as potentially suitable for csg development the methodology used to identify near surface faults and fault damage zones is presented and compared with previous seismic assessments more specifically this study 1 uses shallow near surface geophysical techniques to verify whether deeper faults and fault damage zones as identified through seismic interpretation connect through to the land surface 2 evaluates the range in environmental tracer signatures in the different hydrostratigraphic units at the site coal seam interburden and alluvium from a groundwater sampling campaign with a protocol adapted for pressurised aquifers banks et al 2017 and 3 identifies likely locations of regional groundwater discharge in a river network with a synoptic river sampling survey for environmental tracers during low flow conditions the findings are used to generate a conceptual model for vertical solute transport in the gloucester basin to determine whether faults do contribute to the vertical migration of water dissolved chemicals and gases and to discuss its implications for risk assessments for csg development it is one of the first studies to integrate multiple tracers methane isotopes and both deep and shallow geophysics to better constrain the role of geological faults in a basin with unconventional gas resources 1 1 study site the gloucester basin is a relatively small approximately 10 40 km2 permian basin within the broader southern new england fold belt of south eastern australia it is a broadly synclinal structure and contains both coal and hydrocarbon resources hodgkinson et al 2014 but is highly deformed with significant e w shortening and intense faulting that records multiple deformation episodes ward et al 2001 the gloucester basin lithostratigraphy is floored by devonian and carboniferous volcanics the permian section begins with the alum mountain volcanics that also include clastic sediments and coal zones above this is a series of early permian coal members with variable interburden of mudstone siltstone and sandstone that together make up the dewrang group 570 m thick the late permian avon subgroup coal measures lie above the dewrang group the avon subgroup consists of nine coal members with variable interburden of mudstone siltstone and sandstone 452 m thick the subsequent speldon formation is a sandstone with marine influences which is overlain by the craven subgroup 800 m thick containing eight coal measures with sandstone and siltstone interburden topped by the crowthers road conglomerate 350 m thick the avon and craven subgroups contain the economically interesting csg resources loughnan 1954 a thin 15 m at most quaternary alluvium associated with the current surface drainage covers much of the region in the study area tiedman property and surrounding area near the town of gloucester fig 1 sediments are typically strongly dipping to the west for hydrostratigraphic purposes the basin is generally separated into quaternary alluvial surface deposits generally 15 m deep shallow 150 m fractured bedrock interburden siltstones mudstones sandstones each up to several hundreds of meters thick and several thin coal measures overlying the impermeable alum mountain volcanics formation mcvicar et al 2014 over 50 groundwater monitoring wells and seven surface water gauging stations had previously been installed in the study area as part of a baseline and impact monitoring network should csg development occur the study area is in the catchment of the avon river including most of the waukivory tributary these are small gaining perennial streams flowing through well developed pool riffle sequences the source of the groundwater baseflow to the stream network is thought to be principally from the alluvium and shallow fractured bedrock groundwater flow in the interburden and coal seams is thought to be limited by the low permeabilities 10 3 m day 1 below 300 m mcvicar et al 2014 climate is subtropical with average precipitation 1982 2012 of 1095 mm year 1 and potential evapotranspiration of 1587 mm year 1 mcvicar et al 2014 aside from coal mining activities the primary land use is pastures 1 2 fault architecture the fault architecture in the study area has previously been evaluated through various seismic surveys grieves and saunders 2003 roberts et al 1991 srk onsulting 2005 which are briefly summarised here several episodes of deformation have occurred in the gloucester basin resulting in a complex pattern of strain and present day fault zone architecture the two surveys by grieves and saunders 2003 and srk consulting 2005 concluded that there were two major tectonic episodes for the development of the permian sequence within the gloucester basin 1 early to late permian extension that resulted in normal and strike slip reactivation of older pre permian faults and 2 late permian compression and tilting of the basin during the early stages of the hunter bowen orogeny that resulted in reactivation and inversion of many faults and new thrust faulting and erosion review and re interpretation of available 3d seismic data indicates that observable structures are oriented parallel to the axis of the valley fig 1 in a series of discontinuous roughly north south trending en echelon displacements previously mapped as continuous faults consistent with right lateral shear deformation right lateral faults segments tend to have an individual lateral extent of 500 m or less with the north south structural trend occasionally being offset by high angle cross faults however whether these faults extend up through the whole interburden to shallow fractured bedrock zones is unclear some of the faults appear to be associated with significant damaged zones where the original lithostratigraphy has been eroded by the current river drainage network parsons brinckerhoff 2013 also examined the available seismic data in the area of the tiedman property near the stratford 4 well southern area of the field study site and interpreted a series of westerly dipping thrust faults and high angle easterly dipping oblique faults that they also interpreted to be more recent strike slip one of these easterly dipping strike slip faults was interpreted to come to the surface some 300 m east of the stratford 4 gas well pumping tests near this strike slip fault indicated that at the scale of the alluvium and shallow fractured bedrock this fault did not significantly enhance or increase horizontal groundwater flow across fault but may provide slightly enhanced vertical along fault permeability compared to the host rock taking global fault observations elsewhere as a guide e g bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 caine and forster 1999 scibek et al 2016 the complex tectonic history of the gloucester basin and observed fault zone architecture with many en echelon fault segments roughly parallel to the main valley axis with occasional high angle cross faults would suggest that there are likely to be locations of structurally enhanced permeability related to the detailed fault zone architecture and prevailing stress field in this paper we look for field evidence of this and match it to the fault zone characterization 2 methods 2 1 near surface geophysics transient electromagnetic tem surveys using a zonge engineering nanotem system were undertaken to locate structural geological features within 100 m depth of the near surface in the study site this investigation depth using conventional 2d and 3d seismic surveys typically provide poor image quality i e they are designed to target the deeper strata two major east west transect lines were surveyed designed to cross over the major inferred north south fault lines north line 1420 m long and south line 1960 m long see fig 1 the transmitter for this system outputs 2 amps into a single turn with a 20 m 20 m square transmitter loop the single turn 5 m 5 m receiving antenna was located in the centre of the transmitter loop data were collected at a sampling rate of 625 000 samples per second stacking 256 cycles at a repetition rate of 32 hz the data were processed by averaging each of the data stacks discarding late time data that were no longer true decay figure s2 suppl material the averaged data were run through zonge engineering s steminv inversion routine that converts observed magnetic field decay data i e measured voltages and times at each location to depths and electrical resistivity assuming that the underlying earth is 1d macinnes 2005 the underlying 1d inversion assumption is valid in sub horizontal layered sedimentary settings as encountered in this field area in other words at the site the technique is best suited to detect shifts in the depth of the interface of the alluvium and fractured bedrock associated with different fault blocks figure s1 suppl material vertical fault structures and other 2d 3d features are slightly distorted when processed using a 1d inversion because there are no lateral or spatial constraints between each measurement site sounding the 1d inversion results from each measurement site location were then joined together for presentation as resistivity depth sections the resulting resistivity depth sections were correlated with topography surrounding land usage and geomorphology of the surface water system using google earth images and other available spatial gis datasets and nearby monitoring wells additionally geological and geophysical logs were also used for comparison and interpretation of the data mallants et al 2018b the transect lines ran across mixed use farmland dominated by grasslands used primarily for cattle and sheep grazing they were positioned in a roughly east west direction that ran across or near to the waukivory avon river system fig 1 2 2 water sampling and analytical techniques surface water and groundwater from the waukivory study site in the gloucester basin were sampled between 22 february and 2 march 2016 surface water sampling was conducted at 22 locations along the avon and waukivory rivers fig 1 samples were collected from 26 groundwater and coal seam gas monitoring wells completed in three major aquifer units alluvial interburden and coal seam which ranged from 6 5 to 230 m below ground surface and were completed with screen intervals typically 12 m and casing diameter between 50 and 100 mm suppl material table s1 most wells were selected for sampling based on proximity to the proposed coal seam gas development and identified fault structures some were also chosen based on previous sampling

measured from the top of casing toc using an electric water level indicator purging of at least three volumes from the well screen was made prior to sampling whenever possible but was occasionally less due to low yields in some wells groundwater sample collection was made by pumping to the surface except for gas samples which were collected at in situ pressures by deploying a downhole sampler

major anions were analysed using a dionex ics 2500 ion chromatograph the ion charge balance error for each sample were better than 5 all stable water isotope compositions were measured using a picarro

samples were submitted to the csiro environmental tracer laboratory adelaide south australia within 3 days of sample collection and counted by liquid scintillation on a lkb wallac quantulus counter

durridge company inc 2015 using the methods described in burnett et al 2001 and reported measurement accuracy of 5 groundwater samples for dissolved noble gases were collected in copper tubes weiss

survey identified major subsurface features along each of the transect lines and adjacent to the river system fig 2 the north line crosses the avon river just north of the confluence between the waukivory and the avon river systems at approximately station 900 fig 1 the south line runs adjacent to waukivory river for much of its length and crosses the river at approximately stations 3680 4200 and 4600 fig 1 typical features of the south line include more conductive material towards the bottom of the profile which likely represents the fault damage zone or infill of weathered and alluvial material along the south line the geometry of the slightly displaced bedrock blocks interpreted from the tem shallow imaging is consistent with deeper displacement strike slip transgressional structures where shallow brittle tips of individual fault segments can form various geometries including wing cracks horsetail splays antithetic faults and synthetic branch faults mouslopoulou et al 2007 results from the north line show similar characteristics in the resistivity depth sections to the south line with zones of more conductive material representing fault locations fig 2 much of the near surface to a depth of approximately 40 m from station 900 towards the east appears to be dominated by a sedimentary sequence that starts at the surface with a layer of conductive soils and clays this is followed by a more resistive gravel layer and the bottom layer is made up of mixed siltstones and sandstones and intermixed tuffaceous layers extending to depth to the west of station 900 about half of the observed faults appear to extend to the surface lithological logs from nearby deeper boreholes also support the resistivity depth profiles if the faults are terminated by reworking of the near surface sediments by the river system it suggests that there has not been any reactivation of the faults the locations of the inferred faults based on the tem data tended to match up with the existing inferred faulting that was analysed and reinterpreted as part of this study from the 3d seismic survey data parsons brinckerhoff 2013 most seismic reflection data does not provide good resolution of the near surface this can be seen in the seismic data shown in fig 3 which shows poor resolution of the top 150 m over the survey area areas highlighted in blue ellipses are left un interpreted so the reader can judge if displacements extend up to the shallow tem the combination of both datasets improves the confidence that faulting and fault zones extend towards the ground surface at several locations at the study site 3 2 hydrochemical tracers and water sources a large hydrochemistry database was assembled for this study and is only summarised in the following the section synoptic river survey describes several of the key tracers measured in the surface water the following sections describe these key tracers and other hydrochemical tracers to identify the contributing groundwater sources to the river system and how they can be used to investigate surface water groundwater connectivity interested readers can consult tables s2 and s4 suppl material for an overview of all parameters measured for the surface water and tables s3 and s5 suppl material for the groundwater samples 3 2 1 synoptic river survey the synoptic river survey included two long sections one along the avon river downstream from the avon waukivory river confluence until jack s road river crossing and one along the waukivory river starting at sampling point w12 until the avon waukivory river confluence as well as one short section along the avon river above the confluence with the waukivory river with only two samples collected fig 1 the rivers were gently flowing during the survey following recent rainfall in late january with the largest flow occurring in the avon river approximately 0 25 m3 s 1 while the flow recorded in the waukivory river was 0 05 m3 s 1 fig 4 a the flow in the waukivory river was characterised by distinct pool shallow riffles sequences which were also present but less pronounced in the avon streamflow steadily increased in the downstream direction in both the waukivory and avon rivers fig 4a as there were no obvious surface water inputs along the study reach this indicated the rivers were gaining groundwater along their courses these observations are consistent with the findings in mcvicar et al 2014 and parsons brinckerhoff 2015 where the avon river system is considered to be gaining even under low flow conditions their findings also showed that there is distinct seasonality in the river flow conditions throughout the year which are characterised by a flashy response to rainfall events during the wetter months whereby surface water levels rise within hours of significant rainfall events and then also recede within a few weeks time and defined by steep recession curves the analysis of environmental tracers provides further evidence for the gaining characteristic of the waukivory river chloride concentrations were higher in the waukivory river 58 98 mg l 1 than in the avon river 56 61 mg l 1 upstream of their junction fig 1 and fig 4a for the waukivory river chloride concentrations were lowest 58 mg l 1 upstream at sampling point w12 increased mid reach to a maximum of 98 mg l 1 at sampling point w5 and decreasing again to nearly 65 mg l 1 at w0 before the confluence with the avon river in the avon river chloride concentrations peaked at about 70 mg l 1 downstream of the confluence with the waukivory river sampling point a4 and declined thereafter the steady increase from w12 to w5 in the waukivory river is a clear indication of saline groundwater being discharged into the stream the surface water samples had δ18o isotopic values that ranged from 2 57 to 4 05 and those from the upstream reach of both rivers and furthest downstream in the avon were most depleted fig 4b the isotopic values were more variable in the waukivory than in the avon river varying by 1 5 over 200 m this short range variability indicates significantly smaller scale exchanges between the river and the alluvium driven by hyporheic and parafluvial processes such as those driven by head differences between pools see discussion while the rivers are overall gaining throughout the study reach the variations and concentrations in chloride and stable isotopes of water suggest that there may be more than one groundwater source a mix of different sources i e from the interburden coals seams and alluvium for both rivers and that there is significant hyporheic and parafluvial exchange with the alluvium radon 222rn activities were highest and most variable in the waukivory river with activities ranging between 0 3 and 2 3 bq l 1 fig 4c several radon concentration hotspots greater than 1 bq l 1 were identified between sample sites w1 and w10 fig 1 these may represent reaches where groundwater is directly discharging into the river or where significant parafluvial return flow occurs radon activity along the avon river above its confluence with the waukivory was 0 1 bq l 1 rising to 0 5 bq l 1 downstream of the confluence most helium 4he samples were near solubility equilibrium 4 1 4 5 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 cubic centimetres of gas at standard temperature and pressure per gram of water between 10 and 30 c indicating surface water helium is in equilibrium with helium in the atmosphere meteoric helium there are two samples with higher than solubility equilibrium helium concentration i e one sample from the waukivory river 4 8 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 and another from the avon river 4 7 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 just upstream of their confluence fig 4c the observed above solubility equilibrium helium at several sites suggests a localised contribution from an older groundwater source which is consistent with the 222rn hotspots across the synoptic survey and indicative of a generally gaining river environment methane in surface water was greater than 9 μg l 1 throughout the synoptic survey fig 4d there were four notable methane concentration hotspots greater than 60 μg l 1 at sites along the waukivory river fig 1 these were at stations w1 w8 and w11 with especially high levels at site w0 444 μg l 1 the δ13c ch4 values at these sites ranged from 56 0 to 43 4 v pdb with values most variable at waukivory stations upstream of the junction with the avon river more limited sampling for δ2h ch4 also showed widely fluctuating values within the waukivory reach 231 to 88 3 vsmow fig 4d 3 2 2 major ions and methane concentrations the major ion composition of the two shallow alluvial aquifer samples gr p10 and gr p11 is of a na hco3 cl type and had a similar composition to the surface water samples figure s3 suppl material other samples from the alluvial aquifer are of the na cl type salinity in the alluvium was variable 590 7300 μs cm 1 and could result from either evapo concentration of shallow groundwater due to transpiration by phreatophytes or from the mixing of infiltrated surface water with more saline groundwater discharging to the alluvium from the underlying interburden the groundwater samples from the interburden and coal seams have water types ranging from na hco3 na hco3 cl and na cl figure s3 suppl material typically low in ca mg and so4 like other csg areas globally duvert et al 2015 hamawand et al 2013 van voast 2003 some of the coal seam and interburden samples show evidence of methanogenesis the microbial breakdown of coal organic matter and production of methane based on the relatively low sulphate concentrations figure s3 suppl material coal seam water often predominantly consists of sodium and bicarbonate and where influenced by connate water of marine association also chloride and is essentially devoid of sulphate calcium and magnesium cheung et al 2010 van voast 2003 low sulphate concentrations are the result of the biochemical sulphate reduction reactions that commonly precede methanogenesis golding et al 2013 rice et al 2008 van voast 2003 the predominant process for calcium and magnesium depletion is likely to be the inorganic precipitation of calcite and dolomite cement due to reduced solubility in the presence of the elevated bicarbonate concentrations van voast 2003 the na hco3 na hco3 cl water types may also evolve via cation exchange and other carbonate processes which commonly occur in non coal bearing aquifers owen and cox 2015 venturelli et al 2003 however the other environmental tracer data suggests that this is not the case in the gloucester basin the broad range of methane concentrations 4 to 215 000 μg l 1 mean 45 900 median 9 090 μg l 1 and isotopic ratios 81 6 to 29 2 v pdb mean 56 9 median 57 1 observed in the groundwater samples reflects the range of sample depths and the various microbiological and hydrogeological environments aquifer type presence or absence of coal seams etc that samples were collected from fig 5 and figure s4 suppl material in general surface water and alluvial groundwater had the lowest concentrations 10 500 μg l 1 while the interburden and coal seams had the highest concentrations 1 000 greater than 100 000 μg l 1 figure s5 suppl material however at least one alluvial sample gr p11 had ch4 and isotope concentrations more like the deeper aquifer units methane isotopic values δ13c ch4 for samples collected in the interburden also varied widely across all units ranging from 80 to 20 v pdb in comparison the lowest δ13c ch4 from a surface water sample was approximately 56 v pdb δ2h ch4 values for groundwater samples ranged from 224 to 195 vsmow because it was anticipated that some groundwater samples would have high methane concentrations special care was taken in this study to sample groundwater at in situ pressures to prevent degassing during sampling banks et al 2017 this appears warranted because many methane samples collected from all units were above the critical concentration at 1 atm pressure vertical line in figure s4 suppl material corresponding to 20 c and 25 000 µg l 1 and would probably have partially degassed leading to underestimation of methane concentration without the use of appropriate sampling techniques 3 2 3 stable isotopes of water the stable isotopes of water were used to identify the potential water sources contributing baseflow to the avon and waukivory rivers tables s4 and s5 suppl material there was a large range in δ18o 7 5 to 1 5 and δ2h 50 to 10 in surface water and groundwater from the alluvial interburden and coal seams fig 6 a in general the deeper groundwater samples were most depleted and surface water most enriched in oxygen 18 and deuterium with some overlap between water types the surface water samples fall along an evaporation line slope 5 5 away from the brisbane local meteoric water line lmwl and are more isotopically enriched than the brisbane averaged weighted rainfall δ18o 3 48 δ2h 13 14 crosbie et al 2012 the original source of the surface water is where the evaporation line joins the lmwl δ18o 4 δ2h 20 which is alluvial groundwater the coal seam samples are far more depleted than the alluvial samples indicating groundwater recharge under different climatic conditions to present day thus both a modern and an older source of water are present in the alluvial groundwater which indicate a mixture of sources note that due to the basin being relatively flat with only some modest topography at the edges where the alum mountain volcanics outcrop the altitudinal effect on the stable isotopic composition of localised recharge to the main aquifer units is considered negligible comparing δ2h to chloride shows that the bulk of the groundwater samples from the deeper geological units have higher chloride concentrations than the surface water and are therefore not likely to be the major source of water discharging into the surface water system fig 6b however there are six groundwater samples from the alluvium and interburden that have chloride concentrations like surface water as well as similar in isotopic composition as there is no strong evaporation signal in the groundwater samples the higher chloride concentrations in the alluvial groundwater 1 500 2 500 mg l 1 are likely to be the result of a combination of transpiration by phreatophytes where chloride would be concentrated while the isotopic signature left unchanged and saline groundwater discharge from deeper geological units 3 2 4 tritium carbon 14 and dissolved noble gases analysis of tritium concentrations shows that most of the groundwater samples within the study site are older than 1960 with 8 out of 13 samples analysed from the february 2016 campaign less than background tritium concentrations i e 0 1 tu table s5 suppl material and fig 7 a by comparison the only two available surface water samples had tritium concentrations of 1 76 and 1 80 tu tritium concentration in rainwater across the gloucester basin ranges between 1 6 and 2 4 tu tadros et al 2014 one sample from a well completed in a coal seam mid screen depth at 63 m below surface had tritium concentrations of 1 2 tu reflecting modern groundwater gw080840 1 however the carbon 14 25 72 pmc and helium 4 1 26 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 concentrations for this sample suggest that the water is much older this mixed age composition suggests that the sample may be contaminated by drilling fluid and poor well development purging and flushing the well screen associated with the very low yield of this well which was constructed in late 2015 i e less than a year before sampling occurred this would also mean that the radiocarbon data is indicative of too young groundwater when most of the other coal seam wells had lower carbon 14 concentrations the carbon 14 activities in the groundwater samples from the february 2016 field campaign ranged from 0 7 to 96 pmc and the δ13c values ranged between 15 7 and 21 6 table s5 suppl material and fig 7b 14c only the alluvial samples were greater than 79 pmc i e reflective of groundwater younger than 50 years while the majority of the coal seam samples were 10 pmc i e reflective of groundwater older than 10 000 of years increases of the total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic or alkalinity via geochemical processes can potentially decrease the isotopic ratio of 14c 12c and make the water sample appear older than it actually is plummer and glynn 2013 this is of special importance when fossil sources of carbon are available as is the case in coal seam gas areas overall the carbon 14 data showed that concentrations decreased i e increasing groundwater apparent age residence time with increasing depth helium concentrations in groundwater had a very large range from 6 4 10 8 to 2 0 10 5 cm3 stp g 1 and were higher at depth than in the alluvium fig 7c one sample from the shallow alluvial aquifer gr p11 had a very high helium concentration 1 7 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 indicating a source of groundwater coming from greater depth with a much longer residence time mixing with the shallow groundwater the methane concentration in this sample was also very high 463 μg l 1 with an isotopic signature in δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 of 62 4 and 174 7 respectively the latter two values are in the thermogenic range supporting the assumption of older groundwater being admixed the alluvium sample with the second highest helium concentration gr p1 with 2 8 10 7 cm3 stp g 1 again has high ch4 39 4 μg l 1 and a δ13c ch4 of 44 1 characterising it as thermogenic although there were no δ2h ch4 values for this sample the tritium and 14c values of 0 3 tu and 79 4 pmc respectively show that the bulk of the water was young with at least 15 being even younger than 50 years these multi tracer results clearly show this sample as young alluvium groundwater with an old admixture both alluvium samples exhibit ch4 and 4he concentrations that are rather characteristic for the coal and interburden layers helium concentrations in groundwater from the interburden and coal layers were all higher than 7 10 7 cm3 stp g 1 which is at least a factor 5 in some cases a factor of 500 higher than what can be explained by equilibrium with atmospheric helium at the time of recharge 4 4 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 at 20 c and 150 m elevation above sea level one exception is the sample completed in the interburden gr p6 which is located at the edge of the basin margin completed to a shallow depth 23 m below ground and is likely showing some direct infiltration and downward flow this indicates subsurface production of helium within the aquifer and therefore evidence of an older groundwater end member table s5 suppl material by comparison the dissolved helium concentrations in the surface water samples were close to atmospheric equilibrium 4 1 4 5 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 4 discussion in the gloucester basin study area the bulk of the groundwater discharge to the waukivory and avon rivers is via shallow flowpaths and characterized as relatively young groundwater associated with the alluvial deposits and superficial fractured weathered bedrock presence of tritiated water concentrations of 1 76 and 1 795 tu indicative of water younger than 50 years in these sources and in the river underpins this assertion evidence for discharge of older and deeper groundwater includes the steady increase in salinity from w12 to w5 in the waukivory river and the presence of hotspots of methane and helium rich groundwater in both the surface water e g w0 and alluvial groundwater samples e g gr 11 fig 8 some of these hotspots were also associated with particular faults identified by the near surface geophysical measurements and 3d seismic datasets such as the one at the junction of the waukivory and avon rivers and another at the base of the mograni range on the waukivory river adjacent to gr 11 previous studies banwell and parizek 1988 tolstikhin et al 2017 have also found that helium is more concentrated in groundwater in close proximity to faulting thus despite the large number of faults previously identified in the gloucester basin only a subset or specific faults show hydrochemical evidence of potential vertical connectivity to the near surface as they cross over the river system 4 1 fault structures and vertical connectivity in many hydrogeological settings only a subset of the geological faults with a particular combination of local fault architecture and in situ stress may contribute to increasing the vertical hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallower geological formations bense et al 2003 caine et al 1996 being able to identify the faults that behave as vertical conduits is pivotal to any groundwater risk assessment scibek et al 2016 an example risk assessment in the gloucester basin was previously reported by zhang et al 2018 who conducted a numerical study of transient stress pore pressure and fluid flow patterns during coal seam gas production under different background regional stress scenarios with the aim of understanding potential geomechanical failure states in both faults and coal beds to achieve this requires a combination of different and complementary techniques to map the fault architecture and attempt to classify fault zone behaviour as a conduit barrier or barrier conduit and to quantify the potential for fluid flow in many cases faults identified by deeper seismic analysis the most common approach to map faults appear to not extend to the surface or to shallower geological formations often the result of poor resolution of the near surface geologic environment near surface geophysical techniques such as the shallow tem survey adopted in this study provide the required resolution from the surface down to depths of 50 80 m the multi method approach highlighted the complexity of these geological environments and for those faults extending to the surface specific conditions are required for a significant enhancement in vertical connectivity for example the fault segment slightly north of the junction of the avon and waukivory rivers indicated as north line nanotem on fig 1 where one of the likely deep groundwater discharge hotspots was identified higher than equilibrium helium concentration at sampling point a5 appears part of a horsetail strike slip fault splay architecture in the seismic data fig 3b in such systems tensional forces can cause dilation of smaller scale strain in the relay zone between different faults offering a potential enhanced vertical pathway for groundwater flow fig 9 we have shown on the basis of acoustic borehole image logs that wells close to sampling point a5 exhibit high fracture density with fracture orientations parallel or subparallel to the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress s hmax with the angle between s hmax i e in dilatant stress conditions and fracture orientation being depth dependent while wells at greater distance have less fractures that are oriented orthogonal to s hmax in compressional stress conditions mallants et al 2018b this likely contributes to the observed from drill stem test interpretation increased permeability i for wells within or close to the fault damage zone and ii with increasing depth for instance near sampling point a5 interpreted permeability increases slightly from 0 34 md at about 450 m depth to 0 59 md at about 600 m depth when the angle decreases from about 35 to 15 at a similar depth interpreted permeability is about an order of magnitude greater when fracture orientation is parallel or sub parallel results not shown an alternative hypothesis is for lateral and vertical displacement along a strike slip fault to create extensive damage zones where the permeability of the overburden is increased with pervasive small scale strain near fault planes these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and could combine to create a localised zone of increased vertical hydraulic conductivity and groundwater discharge 4 2 tracer patterns in surface water the extensive spatial variability in tracer signatures along the waukivory river fig 4 can be attributed to a combination of processes including localised groundwater discharge from deeper sources and the geomorphology of the stream using 222rn as an example the processes contributing to variations in tracer concentration along a groundwater fed river have been conceptualised through the mass balance of 222rn fig 10 the hyporheic flux is the small scale exchange of surface and groundwater induced by flow over an uneven riverbed or due to head differences between pool riffle sections or meander bends cartwright and hofmann 2016 jones and mulholland 2000 the latter also called parafluvial flow woessner 2000 from the above an increase in 222rn at a given point along a river could be due to a combination of factors including 1 an increase in groundwater discharge higher f gw in 2 an increase in groundwater 222rn activity higher radon concentration in f gw in 3 a lower degassing rate to the atmosphere decreasing f a 4 the stream narrowing changing the surface area and thus decreasing f a and 5 an increase in hyporheic exchange higher f hyp in general degassing is a large component of the mass balance for gaseous tracers hence variations in water depth and streambed roughness i e rapids will have a profound impact on radon concentrations this is consistent with the large variations in 222rn observed in the waukivory river relative to the avon river downstream of waukivory as the former has well defined pool riffle sections along its course and the riffles are relatively wide about 1 10 m and shallow 5 20 cm a typical rate for both degassing and hyporheic exchange for a small stream is 1 2 m day 1 cook et al 2006 this implies that when a stream has extensive shallow riffles the radon pool in surface water is continuously being replaced by new radon at the scale of hundreds of meters of downstream travel or less thus for detecting localised deep groundwater discharge points smaller streams tend to provide a higher spatial resolution because pulses in gaseous tracer inputs are less likely to travel far downstream from their point of discharge whilst 222rn is usually considered an indicator of total groundwater discharge 4he is thought to be more specific to regional older groundwater sources gardner et al 2011 zhou and ballentine 2006 4he concentrations along the waukivory river were mostly close to atmospheric values suggesting groundwater originated from the alluvium rather than from deeper formations fig 8 on the other hand because the gas transfer velocity across the water surface kg for helium is approximately 2 5 times larger than the one of radon gardner et al 2011 the old groundwater signature may have been lost at waukivory due to more rapid 4he degassing relative to radon thus it may be desirable to sample surface water for helium at a higher spatial resolution than for radon to achieve a similar hotspot detection footprint being intermediate in molar weight between helium and radon the degassing coefficient for methane should be intermediate for a localised deeper groundwater discharge of a tracer to surface water and for a tracer concentration in alluvial groundwater different than in the localised deeper groundwater source hyporheic exchange would play a similar role to degassing by dispersing the tracer in the alluvial groundwater adjacent to the stream a more quantitative analysis of the volume of groundwater discharge using the tracers was not attempted here because characterising degassing losses and hyporheic exchange rates was beyond the scope for this study however because the rivers were relatively small and shallow they provided a suitable environment to identify local groundwater discharge zones using synoptic river surveys 4 3 methane and helium as indicator of deep groundwater discharge the different groups of environmental tracers used here have different strengths and weaknesses for aquifer inter connectivity studies radioactive tracers like tritium 14c or even 36cl are not very suitable to detect admixtures of old water in young water e g resulting from upward flow along a fault however they are sensitive indicators for the admixture of young water in old water as for instance during downward flow along a fault their dynamic range is a factor of 20 for tritium 2 tu in modern rain detection limit 0 1 tu and 1000 for 14c 100 pmc in modern water and 0 1 pmc detection limit unfortunately analysis of tritium and 14c may be compromised when the groundwater sample is contaminated during drilling drilling mud may contain surface water and cellulose and therefore being young with respect to tritium and 14c or when young water intrudes leaky wells creating mixed samples on the other hand tracers whose concentration increase due to ingrowth e g 4he are excellent indicators for upward flow along faults the dynamic range of 4he is also much higher it ranges over 4 5 magnitudes from 4 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 for recharging water at solubility equilibrium to 1 10 3 cm3 stp g 1 for very old waters in the case of helium care must be taken to avoid gas loss during sampling which can be avoided with appropriate sampling techniques banks et al 2017 contamination with too much helium however can be excluded therefore the measured helium concentration is always a minimum indicator of the in situ concentration this implies that helium can detect admixtures of deep old water in young groundwater and is more sensitive than tritium or 14c the latter two tracers are better at detecting young water in old water the combination of both kinds of tracers is necessary if the flow direction along a fault is a priori unknown a large range in methane isotopic composition was found in gloucester basin surface and groundwater suggesting that more than one source for methane may be present fig 11 and figure s4 suppl material numerous studies have investigated low temperature thermal generation of hydrocarbon gases in sedimentary basins hamilton et al 2014 rowe and muehlenbachs 1999 and used the stable isotopic compositions of methane δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 to distinguish between the biogenic and thermogenic components of the methane source and depth of origin for δ13c ch4 delta values between approximately 70 and 50 are interpreted as indicating a biogenic source similarly delta values between approximately 55 and 30 are interpreted to be from a thermogenic source cicerone and oremland 1988 however strict methane gas composition and classification as biogenic or thermogenic origin has been found to be problematic in systems which have mixtures of biogenic and thermogenic gases due to complex formation pathways and the hydro biogeochemical reaction processes that take place in the subsurface golding et al 2013 kirk et al 2015 whiticar 1999 whiticar et al 1986 additionally some methane is created from the incomplete combustion of organic materials and the delta values for this methane are less negative than thermogenic methane ferretti et al 2005 ferretti et al 2007 data from australian coal basins show that there is extensive microbial activity particularly in coal beds shallower than 600 m depth faiz and hendry 2006 microbial activity causes secondary biogenic gas generation with co2 reduction being the main pathway of this secondary biogenic methane generation hence co2 and biogenic methane are often the major constituents in australian coal seam gas reservoirs kinnon et al 2010 stolper et al 2014a 2015 2014b have used a methane clumped isotope geothermometer approach to provide some additional constraints on the formation temperatures to determine the relative amounts of biogenic and thermogenic gases however to achieve this requires separating the individual isotopologues of methane during analysis of the sample such analysis was beyond the scope of this study the δ13c ch4 values observed in the gloucester basin fig 11 were similar to the range in values 90 9 to 29 5 v pdb found during a baseline study of the richmond river catchment nsw atkins et al 2015 their study concluded that a bacterial methane source had been subject to partial oxidation additional biogeochemical effects may be anticipated in the vicinity of rivers where both bacterial production and consumption may occur bigeleisen and wolfsberg 1958 partial methane oxidation in rivers would enrich the remaining methane pool and blur the distinction between thermogenic and biogenic methane coleman et al 1981 nevertheless the combination of the δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 values provides some evidence for a thermogenic methane component in the waukivory and avon rivers fig 11 this would be consistent with either deeper groundwater discharge or some process favouring the migration of deeper methane to the surface in addition to discharge via faults a small diffusive flux of methane through the interburden is possible because of the very high concentration gradients between the coal bearing formations and the surface however the significance of this process is unclear for the gloucester basin at present but consistent with the widespread occurrence of methane in the river network the case of the two alluvium samples showing high helium and ch4 concentrations with thermogenic isotopic signature in ch4 gr p11 and gr p1 see results section demonstrates the importance of combined measurement of helium and methane isotopes only the combination of multiple environmental tracers can reveal admixtures of deep groundwater along a fault tritium and 14c in this case demonstrate that the bulk of the alluvial groundwater is young elevated ch4 and 4he concentrations demonstrate the presence of an admixed deeper component while the isotopes of ch4 indicate the source of this deeper component the concentration and isotopic signature of methane however may be altered in the alluvium itself by biogenic methane production resulting in a mixed isotope signature or by anaerobic methane consumption reducing the signal altogether no such biogenic alteration is possible for helium since it is a noble gas the intruding helium from a deeper source in a shallow aquifer can only be diluted by hydrodynamic mixing to below the detection limit since the deeper aquifers as demonstrated in the present study may provide four orders of magnitude higher helium concentrations in the deep groundwater component this requires a significant dilution factor and makes helium the most valuable tracer to detect a deep groundwater component in a shallow aquifer 5 conclusion the potential for enhanced vertical connectivity in a heavily faulted coal bearing sedimentary basin was studied by combining a multi tracer geochemical approach with evidence from near surface geophysical surveys deep seismic analysis and well log data we identified that in the gloucester basin nsw australia 1 there is a noticeable deep groundwater baseflow component in the river network and also in the shallow alluvial aquifer with hotspots in 4he and methane isotopes associated with nearby fault traces 2 using transient electromagnetic surveys some of the deeper faults identified by seismic analysis were shown to extend to the land surface and 3 the discharge hotspots of deep groundwater are associated with fault damage zones that were shown to have high dilatation tendency of fractures with increased permeability this deeper groundwater discharge is a relatively small component of the total groundwater baseflow to the streams as was demonstrated by major ion stable isotope and salinity data all pointing at a mix of discharging groundwaters i e from interburden coal seams and alluvium as was shown here whether or not fault structures exhibit hydraulic connectivity from deeper aquifer systems to near surface environments can be best demonstrated by combining different environmental tracers tritium and 14c for downward flow 4he and ch4 for upward groundwater movement and the isotopes of ch4 as indicator of a thermogenic or biogenic source furthermore the study has shown that it is invaluable to conduct baseline surveys in areas of csg or unconventional gas development using multiple techniques and lines of evidence because in most cases there is insufficient conclusions from one dataset to adequately evaluate anthropogenic and or natural pathways of dissolved gases and the geological controls that are contributing to them in order of priority it is recommended that baseline surveys should include the following workflow where the datasets are available or can be measured 1 local and regional scale mapping of hydraulic heads and basic chemical parameters e g salinity to look for spatial anomalies 2 overly these parameter maps with identified fault lines based on structural geological maps and seismic data 3 where anomalies are identified select areas for surface tem surveys or similar near surface geophysical techniques to verify the subsurface geological structure likely location of fault and damage zones and their potential impact the vertical hydraulic connectivity between the surface water and deeper groundwater system 4 conduct synoptic river sampling surveys that focus on areas where anomalies intersect with surface water features starting with simple parameters like chloride radon helium and methane concentrations 5 based on where there are observed tracer concentration hotspots analyse methane isotopic composition and other hydrocarbons 6 progressively narrow down the area of investigation to those areas where there are a combination of datasets to confirm or reject hypothesis about the source of groundwater and their relative contribution to the overlying surface water system the present study focused on developing a qualitative understanding and conceptualisation of discharge of deep groundwater into the alluvial aquifer and connected stream network a more quantitative analysis of the volume of groundwater discharge would require among others characterising degassing losses and hyporheic exchanges for tracers such as 4he 222rn and ch4 and a numerical analysis that would integrate the various types of data in a solute transport model to explore plausible flow conditions of faults that could provide an adequate description of the observed tracer patterns finally our study contributes to building greater confidence in hydrogeological conceptualisation and impact modelling which is critical to define operational conditions for unconventional gas developments that will minimise groundwater impacts by identifying the locations where one could expect the most likely locations of future fugitive

6180,characterization of geological fault networks in sedimentary basins targeted for coal seam gas development typically use deep penetrating seismic data such methods can reveal the presence of numerous fault zones at depths greater than 100 m but not necessarily show if these extend to the surface or provide a significant degree of hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallower geological formations our combined multi tracer and hydrogeophysical study used transient electromagnetic surveys to image the subsurface in a sedimentary coal seam gas basin gloucester basin nsw australia and indicated that deep faults greater than 200 m from seismic analysis may extend to within metres of the ground surface analysis of environmental tracers in surface water and groundwater samples near fault traces showed the presence of hotspots of deeper groundwater from the coal seams discharging into the stream network via the alluvial aquifer the isotopic composition of methane was extremely variable in groundwater δ13c ch4 from 81 6 to 29 2 v pdb and surface water δ 13c ch4 from 56 0 to 19 9 v pdb suggesting several sources of methane being recycled in the connected alluvial aquifer and stream network a 4he hotspot 1 67 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 in the alluvial aquifer close to a fault line showed high methane 463 µg l 1 with a thermogenic signature δ 13c ch4 of 62 4 and δ2h ch4 of 174 7 the gloucester basin which has experienced multiple episodes of complex restructuring displays high dilation tendency of fractures close to fault damage zones with fracture orientations parallel to the orientation of maximum horizontal stress as a result there is increased permeability for wells close to the fault damage zone and with increasing depth these findings resulted in a robust hydrogeological conceptual model of a faulted basin which can be used in a monitoring and modelling framework for improved evaluation of risk associated with unconventional gas developments keywords geological faults coal seam gas and coal bed methane environmental tracers hydrogeophysics surface water groundwater interactions methane 1 introduction recent developments of unconventional gas resources in australia in particular coal seam gas csg have raised a number of environmental concerns around the associated risk of hydraulic fracturing fluids and methane leakage from coal seams into aquifers with leaky wells potentially providing the most plausible pathway commonwealth of australia 2014 shanafield et al 2018 wu et al 2016 a recent review of plausible pathways including geological faults for migration of unconventional gas chemicals e g hydraulic fracturing and geogenic chemicals natural gas into productive aquifers concluded that on the basis of micro seismic and hydrochemical studies on deep shale and tight gas in north america fluid migration pathways associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing that have the potential to contaminate productive aquifers are unlikely to exist in the absence of conductive faults or fractures mallants et al 2018a if on the other hand geological faults do exist assessment of their potential impact on groundwater quality in an unconventional gas development context requires adequate characterization faulkner et al 2010 and numerical modelling to explore the controls of fluid release kissinger et al 2013 reagan et al 2015 in australia csg reservoirs occur at significant depths between 300 and 1 000 m below ground williams et al 2012 and are often isolated from shallow aquifers and surface water systems via low permeability formations referred to as seals cap rocks or aquitards restricting vertical groundwater movement smith et al 2018 turnadge et al 2018 even in the presence of such low permeable formations migration of natural gas from a hydrocarbon resource into a groundwater body can still happen via natural or anthropogenic pathways natural pathways include very slow diffusion dominated migration across the aquitard rock matrix leythaeuser et al 1982 and relatively fast advection dominated migration via faults and fracture networks boothroyd et al 2017 or other geological features that provide a seal bypass cartwright et al 2007 anthropogenic pathways include leaky well casings abandoned wells and induced inter aquifer leakage caused by over pressurization of gas bearing formations shanafield et al 2018 wu et al 2016 thus to understand fault zone hydrogeology a conceptual framework is often used to classify fault zone behaviour as a conduit barrier or barrier conduit bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 caine and forster 1999 scibek et al 2016 to what degree such preferential flow pathways faults fracture networks and seal bypasses increase vertical hydraulic connectivity across low permeability formations is a key requirement for baseline assessments and monitoring programs jackson et al 2013 raynauld et al 2016 vengosh et al 2014 in many csg environments the location of faults at depth is determined via field surveys and drilling exploration assessments of the resource e g borehole geophysics juxtapositions observed in core and log correlations seismic surveys however the presence of faults at depth does not necessarily result in an enhanced vertical connectivity between deep and surficial geological formations because they may not extend to the surface or may not have increased vertical permeability in all circumstances hooper 1991 the influence of faults on regional groundwater flow and chemical transport has also been studied by means of environmental tracers bense et al 2013 darrah et al 2014 in groundwater surface water interaction studies common tracers include major ions including salinity the stable isotope ratios of the water molecule δ2h and δ18o noble gases including helium 4he and radon 222rn 3h and 14c banks et al 2011 brennwald et al 2016 cook et al 2006 ellins et al 1990 kipfer et al 2002 lamontagne et al 2015 222rn is considered to represent total groundwater discharge i e not to be source specific whereas 4he is more typically associated with regional older groundwater discharge cartwright and hofmann 2016 ellins et al 1990 gardner et al 2011 although methane as a natural gas is primarily of economic interest it is also an informative natural tracer in groundwater studies methane and its stable isotopes δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 have been used as tracers of fugitive emissions from hydrocarbon developments atkins et al 2015 boothroyd et al 2016 eyer et al 2015 hatch et al 2018 iverach et al 2015 mayer et

electromagnetics tem have been used extensively to assist with the characterisation of near surface structural features auken et al 2015 auken et al 2006 loke et al 2013 they provide the means to determine whether deep fault traces found on seismic images extend to the surface while each of the above techniques i e environmental tracers methane and its isotopes and geophysics have been used separately to study the role of geological faults on groundwater we are not aware of any published study where the three techniques have been combined there have been studies that use in combination geophysics and tracers to improve characterisation of groundwater systems or oil and gas reservoirs however the tracers were artificially introduced and part of inter well tracer tests day lewis et al 2003 huseby et al 2008 in the specific context of csg related hydrogeological studies several hydrogeochemical and tracer studies have been reported however without a geophysical research component iverach et al 2015 owen and cox 2015 in australia the independent expert scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coal mining development iesc has recognised that one of the biggest knowledge gaps in hydrology and hydrogeology and geochemistry studies of groundwater systems in relation to coal and gas resource development is the almost complete lack of integration between classical petroleum geology and engineering analysis geophysics and hydrogeochemistry middlemis and peeters 2018 in this study the potential for enhanced vertical hydraulic connectivity near previously identified faults in a coal bearing sedimentary basin gloucester basin nsw is evaluated by 1 using shallow geophysical techniques transient electromagnetics to demonstrate whether deep seated faults extend to the surface and 2 determining the location and source of groundwater discharge to the alluvium and surface water network using environmental tracers we discuss the basic geological properties including the location of suspected major faults in the gloucester basin with an emphasis on an area previously identified as potentially suitable for csg development the methodology used to identify near surface faults and fault damage zones is presented and compared with previous seismic assessments more specifically this study 1 uses shallow near surface geophysical techniques to verify whether deeper faults and fault damage zones as identified through seismic interpretation connect through to the land surface 2 evaluates the range in environmental tracer signatures in the different hydrostratigraphic units at the site coal seam interburden and alluvium from a groundwater sampling campaign with a protocol adapted for pressurised aquifers banks et al 2017 and 3 identifies likely locations of regional groundwater discharge in a river network with a synoptic river sampling survey for environmental tracers during low flow conditions the findings are used to generate a conceptual model for vertical solute transport in the gloucester basin to determine whether faults do contribute to the vertical migration of water dissolved chemicals and gases and to discuss its implications for risk assessments for csg development it is one of the first studies to integrate multiple tracers methane isotopes and both deep and shallow geophysics to better constrain the role of geological faults in a basin with unconventional gas resources 1 1 study site the gloucester basin is a relatively small approximately 10 40 km2 permian basin within the broader southern

begins with the alum mountain volcanics that also include clastic sediments and coal zones above this is a series of early permian coal members with variable interburden of mudstone siltstone and sandstone that together make up the dewrang group 570 m thick the late permian avon subgroup coal measures lie above the dewrang group the avon subgroup consists of nine coal members with variable interburden of mudstone siltstone and sandstone 452 m thick the subsequent speldon formation is a sandstone with marine influences which is overlain by the craven subgroup 800 m thick containing eight coal measures with sandstone and siltstone interburden topped by the crowthers road conglomerate 350 m thick the avon and craven subgroups contain the economically interesting csg resources loughnan 1954 a thin 15 m at most quaternary alluvium associated with the current surface drainage covers much of the region in the study area tiedman property and surrounding area near the town of gloucester fig 1 sediments are typically strongly dipping to the west for hydrostratigraphic purposes the basin is generally separated into quaternary alluvial surface deposits generally 15 m deep shallow 150 m

mcvicar et al 2014 over 50 groundwater monitoring wells and seven surface water gauging stations had previously been installed in the study area as part of a baseline and impact monitoring network should csg development occur the study area is in the catchment of the avon river including most of the waukivory tributary these are small gaining perennial streams flowing through well developed pool riffle sequences the source of the groundwater baseflow to the stream network is thought to be principally from the alluvium and shallow fractured bedrock groundwater flow in the interburden and coal seams is thought to be limited by the low permeabilities 10 3 m day 1 below 300 m mcvicar et al 2014 climate is subtropical with average precipitation 1982 2012 of 1095 mm year 1 and potential evapotranspiration of 1587 mm year 1 mcvicar et al 2014 aside from coal mining activities the primary land use is pastures 1 2 fault architecture the fault architecture in the study area has previously been evaluated through various seismic surveys grieves and saunders 2003 roberts et al 1991 srk onsulting 2005 which are briefly summarised here several episodes of deformation have occurred in the gloucester basin resulting in a complex pattern of strain and present day fault zone architecture the two surveys by grieves and saunders 2003 and srk consulting 2005 concluded that there were two major tectonic episodes for the development of the permian sequence within the gloucester basin 1 early to late permian extension that resulted in normal and strike slip reactivation of older pre permian faults and 2 late permian compression and tilting of the basin during the early stages of the hunter bowen orogeny that resulted in reactivation and inversion of many faults and new thrust faulting and erosion review and re interpretation of available 3d seismic data indicates that observable structures are oriented parallel to the axis of the valley fig 1 in a series of discontinuous roughly north south trending en echelon displacements previously mapped as continuous faults consistent with right lateral shear deformation right lateral faults segments tend to have an individual lateral extent of 500 m or less with the north south structural trend occasionally being offset by high angle cross faults however whether these faults extend up through the whole interburden to shallow fractured bedrock zones is unclear some of the faults appear to be associated with significant damaged zones where the original lithostratigraphy has been eroded by the current river drainage network parsons brinckerhoff 2013 also examined the available seismic data in the area of the tiedman property near the stratford 4 well southern area of the field study site and interpreted a series of westerly dipping thrust faults and high angle easterly dipping oblique faults that they also interpreted to be more recent strike slip one of these easterly dipping strike slip faults was interpreted to come to the surface some 300 m east of the stratford 4 gas well pumping tests near this strike slip fault indicated that at the scale of the alluvium and shallow fractured bedrock this fault did not significantly enhance or increase horizontal groundwater flow across fault but may provide slightly enhanced vertical along fault permeability compared to the host rock taking global fault observations elsewhere as a guide e g bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 caine and forster 1999 scibek et al 2016 the complex tectonic history of the gloucester basin and observed fault zone architecture with many en echelon fault segments roughly parallel to the main valley axis with occasional high angle cross faults would suggest that there are likely to be locations of structurally enhanced permeability related to the detailed fault zone architecture and prevailing stress field in this paper we look for field evidence of this and match it to the fault zone characterization 2 methods 2 1 near surface geophysics transient electromagnetic tem surveys using a zonge engineering nanotem system were undertaken to locate structural geological features within 100 m depth of the near surface in the study site this investigation depth using conventional 2d and 3d seismic surveys typically provide poor image quality i e they are designed to target the deeper strata two major east west transect lines were surveyed designed to cross over the major inferred north south fault lines north line 1420 m long and south line 1960 m long see fig 1 the transmitter for this system outputs 2 amps into a single turn with a 20 m 20 m square transmitter loop the single turn 5 m 5 m receiving antenna was located in the centre of the transmitter loop data were collected at a sampling rate of 625 000 samples per second stacking 256 cycles at a repetition rate of 32 hz the data were processed by averaging each of the data stacks discarding late time data that were no longer true decay figure s2 suppl material the averaged data were run through zonge engineering s steminv inversion routine that converts observed magnetic field decay data i e measured voltages and times at each location to depths and electrical resistivity assuming that the underlying earth is 1d macinnes 2005 the underlying 1d inversion assumption is valid in sub horizontal layered sedimentary settings as encountered in this field area in other words at the site the technique is best suited to detect shifts in the depth of the interface of the alluvium and fractured bedrock associated with different fault blocks figure s1 suppl material vertical fault structures and other 2d 3d features are slightly distorted when processed using a 1d inversion because there are no lateral or spatial constraints between each measurement site sounding the 1d inversion results from each measurement site location were then joined together for presentation as resistivity depth sections the resulting resistivity depth sections were correlated with topography surrounding land usage and geomorphology of the surface water system using google earth images and other available spatial gis datasets and nearby monitoring wells additionally geological and geophysical logs were also used for comparison and interpretation of the data mallants et al 2018b the transect lines ran across mixed use farmland dominated by grasslands used primarily for cattle and sheep grazing they were positioned in a roughly east west direction that ran across or near to the waukivory avon river system fig 1 2 2 water sampling and analytical techniques surface water and groundwater from the waukivory study site in the gloucester basin were sampled between 22 february and 2 march 2016 surface water sampling was conducted at 22 locations along the avon and waukivory rivers fig 1 samples were collected from 26 groundwater and coal seam gas monitoring wells completed in three major aquifer units alluvial interburden and coal seam which ranged from 6 5 to 230 m below ground surface and were completed with screen intervals typically 12 m and casing diameter between 50 and 100 mm suppl material table s1 most wells were selected for sampling based on proximity to the proposed coal seam gas development and identified fault structures some were also chosen based on previous sampling

survey identified major subsurface features along each of the transect lines and adjacent to the river system fig 2 the north line crosses the avon river just north of the confluence between the waukivory and the avon river systems at approximately station 900 fig 1 the south line runs adjacent to waukivory river for much of its length and crosses the river at approximately stations 3680 4200 and 4600 fig 1 typical features of the south line include more conductive material towards the bottom of the profile which likely represents the fault damage zone or infill of weathered and alluvial material along the south line the geometry of the slightly displaced bedrock blocks interpreted from the tem shallow imaging is consistent with deeper displacement strike slip transgressional structures where shallow brittle tips of individual fault segments can form various geometries including wing cracks horsetail splays antithetic faults and synthetic branch faults mouslopoulou et al 2007 results from the north line show similar characteristics in the resistivity depth sections to the south line with zones of more conductive material representing fault locations fig 2 much of the near surface to a depth of approximately 40 m from station 900 towards the east appears to be dominated by a sedimentary sequence that starts at the surface with a layer of conductive soils and clays this is followed by a more resistive gravel layer and the bottom layer is made up of mixed siltstones and sandstones and intermixed tuffaceous layers extending to depth to the west of station 900 about half of the observed faults appear to extend to the surface lithological logs from nearby deeper boreholes also support the resistivity depth profiles if the faults are terminated by reworking of the near surface sediments by the river system it suggests that there has not been any reactivation of the faults the locations of the inferred faults based on the tem data tended to match up with the existing inferred faulting that was analysed and reinterpreted as part of this study from the 3d seismic survey data parsons brinckerhoff 2013 most seismic reflection data does not provide good resolution of the near surface this can be seen in the seismic data shown in fig 3 which shows poor resolution of the top 150 m over the survey area areas highlighted in blue ellipses are left un interpreted so the reader can judge if displacements extend up to the shallow tem the combination of both datasets improves the confidence that faulting and fault zones extend towards the ground surface at several locations at the study site 3 2 hydrochemical tracers and water sources a large hydrochemistry database was assembled for this study and is only summarised in the following the section synoptic river survey describes several of the key tracers measured in the surface water the following sections describe these key tracers and other hydrochemical tracers to identify the contributing groundwater sources to the river system and how they can be used to investigate surface water groundwater connectivity interested readers can consult tables s2 and s4 suppl material for an overview of all parameters measured for the surface water and tables s3 and s5 suppl material for the groundwater samples 3 2 1 synoptic river survey the synoptic river survey included two long sections one along the avon river downstream from the avon waukivory river confluence until jack s road river crossing and one along the waukivory river starting at sampling point w12 until the avon waukivory river confluence as well as one short section along the avon river above the confluence with the waukivory river with only two samples collected fig 1 the rivers were gently flowing during the survey following recent rainfall in late january with the largest flow occurring in the avon river approximately 0 25 m3 s 1 while the flow recorded in the waukivory river was 0 05 m3 s 1 fig 4 a the flow in the waukivory river was characterised by distinct pool shallow riffles sequences which were also present but less pronounced in the avon streamflow steadily increased in the downstream direction in both the waukivory and avon rivers fig 4a as there were no obvious surface water inputs along the study reach this indicated the rivers were gaining groundwater along their courses these observations are consistent with the findings in mcvicar et al 2014 and parsons brinckerhoff 2015 where the avon river system is considered to be gaining even under low flow conditions their findings also showed that there is distinct seasonality in the river flow conditions throughout the year which are characterised by a flashy response to rainfall events during the wetter months whereby surface water levels rise within hours of significant rainfall events and then also recede within a few weeks time and defined by steep recession curves the analysis of environmental tracers provides further evidence for the gaining characteristic of the waukivory river chloride concentrations were higher in the waukivory river 58 98 mg l 1 than in the avon river 56 61 mg l 1 upstream of their junction fig 1 and fig 4a for the waukivory river chloride concentrations were lowest 58 mg l 1 upstream at sampling point w12 increased mid reach to a maximum of 98 mg l 1 at sampling point w5 and decreasing again to nearly 65 mg l 1 at w0 before the confluence with the avon river in the avon river chloride concentrations peaked at about 70 mg l 1 downstream of the confluence with the waukivory river sampling point a4 and declined thereafter the steady increase from w12 to w5 in the waukivory river is a clear indication of saline groundwater being discharged into the stream the surface water samples had δ18o isotopic values that ranged from 2 57 to 4 05 and those from the upstream reach of both rivers and furthest downstream in the avon were most depleted fig 4b the isotopic values were more variable in the waukivory than in the avon river varying by 1 5 over 200 m this short range variability indicates significantly smaller scale exchanges between the river and the alluvium driven by hyporheic and parafluvial processes such as those driven by head differences between pools see discussion while the rivers are overall gaining throughout the study reach the variations and concentrations in chloride and stable isotopes of water suggest that there may be more than one groundwater source a mix of different sources i e from the interburden coals seams and alluvium for both rivers and that there is significant hyporheic and parafluvial exchange with the alluvium radon 222rn activities were highest and most variable in the waukivory river with activities ranging between 0 3 and 2 3 bq l 1 fig 4c several radon concentration hotspots greater than 1 bq l 1 were identified between sample sites w1 and w10 fig 1 these may represent reaches where groundwater is directly discharging into the river or where significant parafluvial return flow occurs radon activity along the avon river above its confluence with the waukivory was 0 1 bq l 1 rising to 0 5 bq l 1 downstream of the confluence most helium 4he samples were near solubility equilibrium 4 1 4 5 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 cubic centimetres of gas at standard temperature and pressure per gram of water between 10 and 30 c indicating surface water helium is in equilibrium with helium in the atmosphere meteoric helium there are two samples with higher than solubility equilibrium helium concentration i e one sample from the waukivory river 4 8 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 and another from the avon river 4 7 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 just upstream of their confluence fig 4c the observed above solubility equilibrium helium at several sites suggests a localised contribution from an older groundwater source which is consistent with the 222rn hotspots across the synoptic survey and indicative of a generally gaining river environment methane in surface water was greater than 9 μg l 1 throughout the synoptic survey fig 4d there were four notable methane concentration hotspots greater than 60 μg l 1 at sites along the waukivory river fig 1 these were at stations w1 w8 and w11 with especially high levels at site w0 444 μg l 1 the δ13c ch4 values at these sites ranged from 56 0 to 43 4 v pdb with values most variable at waukivory stations upstream of the junction with the avon river more limited sampling for δ2h ch4 also showed widely fluctuating values within the waukivory reach 231 to 88 3 vsmow fig 4d 3 2 2 major ions and methane concentrations the major ion composition of the two shallow alluvial aquifer samples gr p10 and gr p11 is of a na hco3 cl type and had a similar composition to the surface water samples figure s3 suppl material other samples from the alluvial aquifer are of the na cl type salinity in the alluvium was variable 590 7300 μs cm 1 and could result from either evapo concentration of shallow groundwater due to transpiration by phreatophytes or from the mixing of infiltrated surface water with more saline groundwater discharging to the alluvium from the underlying interburden the groundwater samples from the interburden and coal seams have water types ranging from na hco3 na hco3 cl and na cl figure s3 suppl material typically low in ca mg and so4 like other csg areas globally duvert et al 2015 hamawand et al 2013 van voast 2003 some of the coal seam and interburden samples show evidence of methanogenesis the microbial breakdown of coal organic matter and production of methane based on the relatively low sulphate concentrations figure s3 suppl material coal seam water often predominantly consists of sodium and bicarbonate and where influenced by connate water of marine association also chloride and is essentially devoid of sulphate calcium and magnesium cheung et al 2010 van voast 2003 low sulphate concentrations are the result of the biochemical sulphate reduction reactions that commonly precede methanogenesis golding et al 2013 rice et al 2008 van voast 2003 the predominant process for calcium and magnesium depletion is likely to be the inorganic precipitation of calcite and dolomite cement due to reduced solubility in the presence of the elevated bicarbonate concentrations van voast 2003 the na hco3 na hco3 cl water types may also evolve via cation exchange and other carbonate processes which commonly occur in non coal bearing aquifers owen and cox 2015 venturelli et al 2003 however the other environmental tracer data suggests that this is not the case in the gloucester basin the broad range of methane concentrations 4 to 215 000 μg l 1 mean 45 900 median 9 090 μg l 1 and isotopic ratios 81 6 to 29 2 v pdb mean 56 9 median 57 1 observed in the groundwater samples reflects the range of sample depths and the various microbiological and hydrogeological environments aquifer type presence or absence of coal seams etc that samples were collected from fig 5 and figure s4 suppl material in general surface water and alluvial groundwater had the lowest concentrations 10 500 μg l 1 while the interburden and coal seams had the highest concentrations 1 000 greater than 100 000 μg l 1 figure s5 suppl material however at least one alluvial sample gr p11 had ch4 and isotope concentrations more like the deeper aquifer units methane isotopic values δ13c ch4 for samples collected in the interburden also varied widely across all units ranging from 80 to 20 v pdb in comparison the lowest δ13c ch4 from a surface water sample was approximately 56 v pdb δ2h ch4 values for groundwater samples ranged from 224 to 195 vsmow because it was anticipated that some groundwater samples would have high methane concentrations special care was taken in this study to sample groundwater at in situ pressures to prevent degassing during sampling banks et al 2017 this appears warranted because many methane samples collected from all units were above the critical concentration at 1 atm pressure vertical line in figure s4 suppl material corresponding to 20 c and 25 000 µg l 1 and would probably have partially degassed leading to underestimation of methane concentration without the use of appropriate sampling techniques 3 2 3 stable isotopes of water the stable isotopes of water were used to identify the potential water sources contributing baseflow to the avon and waukivory rivers tables s4 and s5 suppl material there was a large range in δ18o 7 5 to 1 5 and δ2h 50 to 10 in surface water and groundwater from the alluvial interburden and coal seams fig 6 a in general the deeper groundwater samples were most depleted and surface water most enriched in oxygen 18 and deuterium with some overlap between water types the surface water samples fall along an evaporation line slope 5 5 away from the brisbane local meteoric water line lmwl and are more isotopically enriched than the brisbane averaged weighted rainfall δ18o 3 48 δ2h 13 14 crosbie et al 2012 the original source of the surface water is where the evaporation line joins the lmwl δ18o 4 δ2h 20 which is alluvial groundwater the coal seam samples are far more depleted than the alluvial samples indicating groundwater recharge under different climatic conditions to present day thus both a modern and an older source of water are present in the alluvial groundwater which indicate a mixture of sources note that due to the basin being relatively flat with only some modest topography at the edges where the alum mountain volcanics outcrop the altitudinal effect on the stable isotopic composition of localised recharge to the main aquifer units is considered negligible comparing δ2h to chloride shows that the bulk of the groundwater samples from the deeper geological units have higher chloride concentrations than the surface water and are therefore not likely to be the major source of water discharging into the surface water system fig 6b however there are six groundwater samples from the alluvium and interburden that have chloride concentrations like surface water as well as similar in isotopic composition as there is no strong evaporation signal in the groundwater samples the higher chloride concentrations in the alluvial groundwater 1 500 2 500 mg l 1 are likely to be the result of a combination of transpiration by phreatophytes where chloride would be concentrated while the isotopic signature left unchanged and saline groundwater discharge from deeper geological units 3 2 4 tritium carbon 14 and dissolved noble gases analysis of tritium concentrations shows that most of the groundwater samples within the study site are older than 1960 with 8 out of 13 samples analysed from the february 2016 campaign less than background tritium concentrations i e 0 1 tu table s5 suppl material and fig 7 a by comparison the only two available surface water samples had tritium concentrations of 1 76 and 1 80 tu tritium concentration in rainwater across the gloucester basin ranges between 1 6 and 2 4 tu tadros et al 2014 one sample from a well completed in a coal seam mid screen depth at 63 m below surface had tritium concentrations of 1 2 tu reflecting modern groundwater gw080840 1 however the carbon 14 25 72 pmc and helium 4 1 26 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 concentrations for this sample suggest that the water is much older this mixed age composition suggests that the sample may be contaminated by drilling fluid and poor well development purging and flushing the well screen associated with the very low yield of this well which was constructed in late 2015 i e less than a year before sampling occurred this would also mean that the radiocarbon data is indicative of too young groundwater when most of the other coal seam wells had lower carbon 14 concentrations the carbon 14 activities in the groundwater samples from the february 2016 field campaign ranged from 0 7 to 96 pmc and the δ13c values ranged between 15 7 and 21 6 table s5 suppl material and fig 7b 14c only the alluvial samples were greater than 79 pmc i e reflective of groundwater younger than 50 years while the majority of the coal seam samples were 10 pmc i e reflective of groundwater older than 10 000 of years increases of the total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic or alkalinity via geochemical processes can potentially decrease the isotopic ratio of 14c 12c and make the water sample appear older than it actually is plummer and glynn 2013 this is of special importance when fossil sources of carbon are available as is the case in coal seam gas areas overall the carbon 14 data showed that concentrations decreased i e increasing groundwater apparent age residence time with increasing depth helium concentrations in groundwater had a very large range from 6 4 10 8 to 2 0 10 5 cm3 stp g 1 and were higher at depth than in the alluvium fig 7c one sample from the shallow alluvial aquifer gr p11 had a very high helium concentration 1 7 10 6 cm3 stp g 1 indicating a source of groundwater coming from greater depth with a much longer residence time mixing with the shallow groundwater the methane concentration in this sample was also very high 463 μg l 1 with an isotopic signature in δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 of 62 4 and 174 7 respectively the latter two values are in the thermogenic range supporting the assumption of older groundwater being admixed the alluvium sample with the second highest helium concentration gr p1 with 2 8 10 7 cm3 stp g 1 again has high ch4 39 4 μg l 1 and a δ13c ch4 of 44 1 characterising it as thermogenic although there were no δ2h ch4 values for this sample the tritium and 14c values of 0 3 tu and 79 4 pmc respectively show that the bulk of the water was young with at least 15 being even younger than 50 years these multi tracer results clearly show this sample as young alluvium groundwater with an old admixture both alluvium samples exhibit ch4 and 4he concentrations that are rather characteristic for the coal and interburden layers helium concentrations in groundwater from the interburden and coal layers were all higher than 7 10 7 cm3 stp g 1 which is at least a factor 5 in some cases a factor of 500 higher than what can be explained by equilibrium with atmospheric helium at the time of recharge 4 4 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 at 20 c and 150 m elevation above sea level one exception is the sample completed in the interburden gr p6 which is located at the edge of the basin margin completed to a shallow depth 23 m below ground and is likely showing some direct infiltration and downward flow this indicates subsurface production of helium within the aquifer and therefore evidence of an older groundwater end member table s5 suppl material by comparison the dissolved helium concentrations in the surface water samples were close to atmospheric equilibrium 4 1 4 5 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 4 discussion in the gloucester basin study area the bulk of the groundwater discharge to the waukivory and avon rivers is via shallow flowpaths and characterized as relatively young groundwater associated with the alluvial deposits and superficial fractured weathered bedrock presence of tritiated water concentrations of 1 76 and 1 795 tu indicative of water younger than 50 years in these sources and in the river underpins this assertion evidence for discharge of older and deeper groundwater includes the steady increase in salinity from w12 to w5 in the waukivory river and the presence of hotspots of methane and helium rich groundwater in both the surface water e g w0 and alluvial groundwater samples e g gr 11 fig 8 some of these hotspots were also associated with particular faults identified by the near surface geophysical measurements and 3d seismic datasets such as the one at the junction of the waukivory and avon rivers and another at the base of the mograni range on the waukivory river adjacent to gr 11 previous studies banwell and parizek 1988 tolstikhin et al 2017 have also found that helium is more concentrated in groundwater in close proximity to faulting thus despite the large number of faults previously identified in the gloucester basin only a subset or specific faults show hydrochemical evidence of potential vertical connectivity to the near surface as they cross over the river system 4 1 fault structures and vertical connectivity in many hydrogeological settings only a subset of the geological faults with a particular combination of local fault architecture and in situ stress may contribute to increasing the vertical hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallower geological formations bense et al 2003 caine et al 1996 being able to identify the faults that behave as vertical conduits is pivotal to any groundwater risk assessment scibek et al 2016 an example risk assessment in the gloucester basin was previously reported by zhang et al 2018 who conducted a numerical study of transient stress pore pressure and fluid flow patterns during coal seam gas production under different background regional stress scenarios with the aim of understanding potential geomechanical failure states in both faults and coal beds to achieve this requires a combination of different and complementary techniques to map the fault architecture and attempt to classify fault zone behaviour as a conduit barrier or barrier conduit and to quantify the potential for fluid flow in many cases faults identified by deeper seismic analysis the most common approach to map faults appear to not extend to the surface or to shallower geological formations often the result of poor resolution of the near surface geologic environment near surface geophysical techniques such as the shallow tem survey adopted in this study provide the required resolution from the surface down to depths of 50 80 m the multi method approach highlighted the complexity of these geological environments and for those faults extending to the surface specific conditions are required for a significant enhancement in vertical connectivity for example the fault segment slightly north of the junction of the avon and waukivory rivers indicated as north line nanotem on fig 1 where one of the likely deep groundwater discharge hotspots was identified higher than equilibrium helium concentration at sampling point a5 appears part of a horsetail strike slip fault splay architecture in the seismic data fig 3b in such systems tensional forces can cause dilation of smaller scale strain in the relay zone between different faults offering a potential enhanced vertical pathway for groundwater flow fig 9 we have shown on the basis of acoustic borehole image logs that wells close to sampling point a5 exhibit high fracture density with fracture orientations parallel or subparallel to the orientation of the maximum horizontal stress s hmax with the angle between s hmax i e in dilatant stress conditions and fracture orientation being depth dependent while wells at greater distance have less fractures that are oriented orthogonal to s hmax in compressional stress conditions mallants et al 2018b this likely contributes to the observed from drill stem test interpretation increased permeability i for wells within or close to the fault damage zone and ii with increasing depth for instance near sampling point a5 interpreted permeability increases slightly from 0 34 md at about 450 m depth to 0 59 md at about 600 m depth when the angle decreases from about 35 to 15 at a similar depth interpreted permeability is about an order of magnitude greater when fracture orientation is parallel or sub parallel results not shown an alternative hypothesis is for lateral and vertical displacement along a strike slip fault to create extensive damage zones where the permeability of the overburden is increased with pervasive small scale strain near fault planes these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and could combine to create a localised zone of increased vertical hydraulic conductivity and groundwater discharge 4 2 tracer patterns in surface water the extensive spatial variability in tracer signatures along the waukivory river fig 4 can be attributed to a combination of processes including localised groundwater discharge from deeper sources and the geomorphology of the stream using 222rn as an example the processes contributing to variations in tracer concentration along a groundwater fed river have been conceptualised through the mass balance of 222rn fig 10 the hyporheic flux is the small scale exchange of surface and groundwater induced by flow over an uneven riverbed or due to head differences between pool riffle sections or meander bends cartwright and hofmann 2016 jones and mulholland 2000 the latter also called parafluvial flow woessner 2000 from the above an increase in 222rn at a given point along a river could be due to a combination of factors including 1 an increase in groundwater discharge higher f gw in 2 an increase in groundwater 222rn activity higher radon concentration in f gw in 3 a lower degassing rate to the atmosphere decreasing f a 4 the stream narrowing changing the surface area and thus decreasing f a and 5 an increase in hyporheic exchange higher f hyp in general degassing is a large component of the mass balance for gaseous tracers hence variations in water depth and streambed roughness i e rapids will have a profound impact on radon concentrations this is consistent with the large variations in 222rn observed in the waukivory river relative to the avon river downstream of waukivory as the former has well defined pool riffle sections along its course and the riffles are relatively wide about 1 10 m and shallow 5 20 cm a typical rate for both degassing and hyporheic exchange for a small stream is 1 2 m day 1 cook et al 2006 this implies that when a stream has extensive shallow riffles the radon pool in surface water is continuously being replaced by new radon at the scale of hundreds of meters of downstream travel or less thus for detecting localised deep groundwater discharge points smaller streams tend to provide a higher spatial resolution because pulses in gaseous tracer inputs are less likely to travel far downstream from their point of discharge whilst 222rn is usually considered an indicator of total groundwater discharge 4he is thought to be more specific to regional older groundwater sources gardner et al 2011 zhou and ballentine 2006 4he concentrations along the waukivory river were mostly close to atmospheric values suggesting groundwater originated from the alluvium rather than from deeper formations fig 8 on the other hand because the gas transfer velocity across the water surface kg for helium is approximately 2 5 times larger than the one of radon gardner et al 2011 the old groundwater signature may have been lost at waukivory due to more rapid 4he degassing relative to radon thus it may be desirable to sample surface water for helium at a higher spatial resolution than for radon to achieve a similar hotspot detection footprint being intermediate in molar weight between helium and radon the degassing coefficient for methane should be intermediate for a localised deeper groundwater discharge of a tracer to surface water and for a tracer concentration in alluvial groundwater different than in the localised deeper groundwater source hyporheic exchange would play a similar role to degassing by dispersing the tracer in the alluvial groundwater adjacent to the stream a more quantitative analysis of the volume of groundwater discharge using the tracers was not attempted here because characterising degassing losses and hyporheic exchange rates was beyond the scope for this study however because the rivers were relatively small and shallow they provided a suitable environment to identify local groundwater discharge zones using synoptic river surveys 4 3 methane and helium as indicator of deep groundwater discharge the different groups of environmental tracers used here have different strengths and weaknesses for aquifer inter connectivity studies radioactive tracers like tritium 14c or even 36cl are not very suitable to detect admixtures of old water in young water e g resulting from upward flow along a fault however they are sensitive indicators for the admixture of young water in old water as for instance during downward flow along a fault their dynamic range is a factor of 20 for tritium 2 tu in modern rain detection limit 0 1 tu and 1000 for 14c 100 pmc in modern water and 0 1 pmc detection limit unfortunately analysis of tritium and 14c may be compromised when the groundwater sample is contaminated during drilling drilling mud may contain surface water and cellulose and therefore being young with respect to tritium and 14c or when young water intrudes leaky wells creating mixed samples on the other hand tracers whose concentration increase due to ingrowth e g 4he are excellent indicators for upward flow along faults the dynamic range of 4he is also much higher it ranges over 4 5 magnitudes from 4 10 8 cm3 stp g 1 for recharging water at solubility equilibrium to 1 10 3 cm3 stp g 1 for very old waters in the case of helium care must be taken to avoid gas loss during sampling which can be avoided with appropriate sampling techniques banks et al 2017 contamination with too much helium however can be excluded therefore the measured helium concentration is always a minimum indicator of the in situ concentration this implies that helium can detect admixtures of deep old water in young groundwater and is more sensitive than tritium or 14c the latter two tracers are better at detecting young water in old water the combination of both kinds of tracers is necessary if the flow direction along a fault is a priori unknown a large range in methane isotopic composition was found in gloucester basin surface and groundwater suggesting that more than one source for methane may be present fig 11 and figure s4 suppl material numerous studies have investigated low temperature thermal generation of hydrocarbon gases in sedimentary basins hamilton et al 2014 rowe and muehlenbachs 1999 and used the stable isotopic compositions of methane δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 to distinguish between the biogenic and thermogenic components of the methane source and depth of origin for δ13c ch4 delta values between approximately 70 and 50 are interpreted as indicating a biogenic source similarly delta values between approximately 55 and 30 are interpreted to be from a thermogenic source cicerone and oremland 1988 however strict methane gas composition and classification as biogenic or thermogenic origin has been found to be problematic in systems which have mixtures of biogenic and thermogenic gases due to complex formation pathways and the hydro biogeochemical reaction processes that take place in the subsurface golding et al 2013 kirk et al 2015 whiticar 1999 whiticar et al 1986 additionally some methane is created from the incomplete combustion of organic materials and the delta values for this methane are less negative than thermogenic methane ferretti et al 2005 ferretti et al 2007 data from australian coal basins show that there is extensive microbial activity particularly in coal beds shallower than 600 m depth faiz and hendry 2006 microbial activity causes secondary biogenic gas generation with co2 reduction being the main pathway of this secondary biogenic methane generation hence co2 and biogenic methane are often the major constituents in australian coal seam gas reservoirs kinnon et al 2010 stolper et al 2014a 2015 2014b have used a methane clumped isotope geothermometer approach to provide some additional constraints on the formation temperatures to determine the relative amounts of biogenic and thermogenic gases however to achieve this requires separating the individual isotopologues of methane during analysis of the sample such analysis was beyond the scope of this study the δ13c ch4 values observed in the gloucester basin fig 11 were similar to the range in values 90 9 to 29 5 v pdb found during a baseline study of the richmond river catchment nsw atkins et al 2015 their study concluded that a bacterial methane source had been subject to partial oxidation additional biogeochemical effects may be anticipated in the vicinity of rivers where both bacterial production and consumption may occur bigeleisen and wolfsberg 1958 partial methane oxidation in rivers would enrich the remaining methane pool and blur the distinction between thermogenic and biogenic methane coleman et al 1981 nevertheless the combination of the δ13c ch4 and δ2h ch4 values provides some evidence for a thermogenic methane component in the waukivory and avon rivers fig 11 this would be consistent with either deeper groundwater discharge or some process favouring the migration of deeper methane to the surface in addition to discharge via faults a small diffusive flux of methane through the interburden is possible because of the very high concentration gradients between the coal bearing formations and the surface however the significance of this process is unclear for the gloucester basin at present but consistent with the widespread occurrence of methane in the river network the case of the two alluvium samples showing high helium and ch4 concentrations with thermogenic isotopic signature in ch4 gr p11 and gr p1 see results section demonstrates the importance of combined measurement of helium and methane isotopes only the combination of multiple environmental tracers can reveal admixtures of deep groundwater along a fault tritium and 14c in this case demonstrate that the bulk of the alluvial groundwater is young elevated ch4 and 4he concentrations demonstrate the presence of an admixed deeper component while the isotopes of ch4 indicate the source of this deeper component the concentration and isotopic signature of methane however may be altered in the alluvium itself by biogenic methane production resulting in a mixed isotope signature or by anaerobic methane consumption reducing the signal altogether no such biogenic alteration is possible for helium since it is a noble gas the intruding helium from a deeper source in a shallow aquifer can only be diluted by hydrodynamic mixing to below the detection limit since the deeper aquifers as demonstrated in the present study may provide four orders of magnitude higher helium concentrations in the deep groundwater component this requires a significant dilution factor and makes helium the most valuable tracer to detect a deep groundwater component in a shallow aquifer 5 conclusion the potential for enhanced vertical connectivity in a heavily faulted coal bearing sedimentary basin was studied by combining a multi tracer geochemical approach with evidence from near surface geophysical surveys deep seismic analysis and well log data we identified that in the gloucester basin nsw australia 1 there is a noticeable deep groundwater baseflow component in the river network and also in the shallow alluvial aquifer with hotspots in 4he and methane isotopes associated with nearby fault traces 2 using transient electromagnetic surveys some of the deeper faults identified by seismic analysis were shown to extend to the land surface and 3 the discharge hotspots of deep groundwater are associated with fault damage zones that were shown to have high dilatation tendency of fractures with increased permeability this deeper groundwater discharge is a relatively small component of the total groundwater baseflow to the streams as was demonstrated by major ion stable isotope and salinity data all pointing at a mix of discharging groundwaters i e from interburden coal seams and alluvium as was shown here whether or not fault structures exhibit hydraulic connectivity from deeper aquifer systems to near surface environments can be best demonstrated by combining different environmental tracers tritium and 14c for downward flow 4he and ch4 for upward groundwater movement and the isotopes of ch4 as indicator of a thermogenic or biogenic source furthermore the study has shown that it is invaluable to conduct baseline surveys in areas of csg or unconventional gas development using multiple techniques and lines of evidence because in most cases there is insufficient conclusions from one dataset to adequately evaluate anthropogenic and or natural pathways of dissolved gases and the geological controls that are contributing to them in order of priority it is recommended that baseline surveys should include the following workflow where the datasets are available or can be measured 1 local and regional scale mapping of hydraulic heads and basic chemical parameters e g salinity to look for spatial anomalies 2 overly these parameter maps with identified fault lines based on structural geological maps and seismic data 3 where anomalies are identified select areas for surface tem surveys or similar near surface geophysical techniques to verify the subsurface geological structure likely location of fault and damage zones and their potential impact the vertical hydraulic connectivity between the surface water and deeper groundwater system 4 conduct synoptic river sampling surveys that focus on areas where anomalies intersect with surface water features starting with simple parameters like chloride radon helium and methane concentrations 5 based on where there are observed tracer concentration hotspots analyse methane isotopic composition and other hydrocarbons 6 progressively narrow down the area of investigation to those areas where there are a combination of datasets to confirm or reject hypothesis about the source of groundwater and their relative contribution to the overlying surface water system the present study focused on developing a qualitative understanding and conceptualisation of discharge of deep groundwater into the alluvial aquifer and connected stream network a more quantitative analysis of the volume of groundwater discharge would require among others characterising degassing losses and hyporheic exchanges for tracers such as 4he 222rn and ch4 and a numerical analysis that would integrate the various types of data in a solute transport model to explore plausible flow conditions of faults that could provide an adequate description of the observed tracer patterns finally our study contributes to building greater confidence in hydrogeological conceptualisation and impact modelling which is critical to define operational conditions for unconventional gas developments that will minimise groundwater impacts by identifying the locations where one could expect the most likely locations of future fugitive

6181,studies of bedrock aquifers have often treated effective porosity and specific yield as having a similar time invariant value here we apply a series of tests of specific yield and effective porosity at multiple temporal scales to the chalk aquifer of east hampshire england these include analysis of natural water level discharge and water quality variations numerical model calibrations hydrograph recession analysis pumping tests and tracer tests using both injected and environmental tracers values of both effective porosity and specific yield are shown to be transient phenomena that are dependent upon the temporal test scale an effect which results from the dual porosity structure of the aquifer over short time periods aquifer response is dominated by preferential flow through the low storage high permeability fracture network effective porosities on a timescale of hours to days are 0 0001 0 001 over longer time periods aquifer response becomes increasingly dominated by the high storage low permeability matrix with the effective porosity rising to approximate total porosity 0 39 on a timescale of decades specific yield also increases as a function of timescale though there is much less variability than with effective porosity our findings demonstrate that it is critical to use an effective porosity value appropriate to the timescale when making transport calculations preferential flow through fracture networks is common in bedrock aquifers consequently the transient nature of both effective porosity and specific yield that has been demonstrated in the chalk aquifer is likely to be broadly representative of most bedrock aquifers keywords effective porosity specific yield dual porosity preferential flow chalk 1 introduction determination of groundwater travel times is an important component of hydrogeology being needed for assessment of the potential for contamination at water supply sources and for understanding the movement of contaminant plumes a value for effective porosity is needed in calculations of travel times but the determination of a representative value is often not straightforward especially in bedrock aquifers because these often have preferential flow through fracture networks a common concept is that effective porosity varies much less than hydraulic conductivity and has a typical range of 0 01 to 0 3 freeze and cherry 1979 p 61 anderson et al 2015 p 228 consequently it is common for effective porosity to be estimated based on literature values on personal experience or on values of specific yield stephens et al 1998 anderson et al 2015 allen et al 1997 in uniform unconsolidated sediments with only intergranular flow effective porosity may be close to total porosity but bedrock aquifers usually have dual porosity with most of the storage volume being in the matrix and most of the flow being in the fracture network in either case effective porosity can be defined as the open space through which water flows hiscock and bense 2014 p 36 however this definition relates only to the advective movement i e flux of water and in bedrock aquifers is often taken as the fracture porosity alone zuber and motyka 1994 although this is not simple to measure preferential flow path development in bedrock aquifers via dissolutional enlargement of fractures leads to an additional smaller component of porosity through which the majority of saturated flow occurs this effect is most notable in carbonates but also applies to other lithologies worthington et al 2016 total porosity varies substantially between different bedrock lithologies and a compilation of measurements by wolff 1982 gave geometric means of 0 013 for crystalline rocks 0 028 for carbonates 0 097 for shale and 0 12 for both sandstone and volcanic rocks fracture porosity may be high at outcrops due to weathering and dilation but within aquifers it is usually much lower than matrix porosity with values of 0 00001 to 0 01 being common freeze and cherry 1979 p 408 norton and knapp 1977 determined values of 0 00001 to 0 001 in hydrothermal systems and lee and farmer 1993 found that values between 0 0001 and 0 001 were most common in the top 100 m of bedrock with substantial reductions in fracture porosity with depth a practical definition of effective porosity applicable to contaminant transport is the porosity required to achieve agreement with observation in a calculation of travel time zheng and bennett 2002 p 17 however in practice tracer tests are rarely used to determine effective porosity a compilation of studies where effective porosity in carbonate rocks has been calculated from tracer tests shows that effective porosities are most commonly between 0 0001 and 0 001 table 1 all the effective porosity values in table 1 are at least an order of magnitude less than total porosity alongside significant disparity between fracture and matrix porosity a further distinctive aspect of many bedrock aquifers is that matrix diffusion retards the mean advective velocity of solutes freeze and cherry 1979 fracture flow plays a dominant role during short term tracer testing up to a few days but matrix diffusion plays an increasingly important role over longer periods małoszewski and zuber 1985 thus as an increasing proportion of the total porosity involved in tracer transport becomes recruited over time so effective porosity as defined by solute flux rather than water flux is a time dependent parameter water flux is not constrained by matrix diffusion as water molecules diffusing from flowing fissure to stagnant matrix stores are replaced by an equal number of water molecules diffusing in the opposite direction zuber and motyka 1994 specific yield is also a time dependent parameter and increases over time during pumping tests johnson 1967 macdonald and allen 2001 fitts 2013 this is because fracture permeability is usually considerably higher than matrix permeability so a change in head will result in a more rapid change in storage in the fracture network than in the matrix consequently it is important to evaluate the time duration of stresses and measurement periods when evaluating both effective porosity and specific yield the purpose of this study is to use a range of techniques to determine values of specific yield and effective porosity in a well researched bedrock aquifer that has a wide range of monitoring data available namely the cretaceous chalk of southern and eastern england the chalk is the most important aquifer in the uk supplying about 55 of the groundwater used lloyd 1993 in this paper we explore how the dual porosity structure of the chalk aquifer affects measurements of effective porosity and specific yield and how these measurements vary as a function of the technique used we then show that these findings are broadly applicable to many bedrock aquifers 2 methods 2 1 methods to determine specific yield 2 1 1 pumping tests the most common method of determining specific yield is from drawdown measurements during pumping tests pumping tests are routinely carried out during aquifers investigations and data analysis provides values for both hydraulic conductivity and for the storage term specific yield in unconfined aquifers storativity in confined aquifers pumping tests typically have durations up to several days and this may only be long enough to result in drainage of the fractures in unconfined bedrock aquifers especially where the permeability of the matrix is low consequently such short term specific yields can have values similar to fracture porosity 0 00001 0 01 freeze and cherry 1979 2 1 2 water level changes in numerical models an increasingly common way to determine specific yield is as a calibration parameter in distributed numerical models using several years or more of water level data from wells taylor et al 2012 many areas have seasonal variations in water levels that are associated with variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration if there is a simple sine wave pattern of seasonal variation then water levels will fall for a period of six months and there may be substantial drainage of the matrix 2 1 3 rise in water table following rain in dual porosity media with low matrix permeability major recharge events can result in rapid short term rises in water levels headworth 1972 the specific yield sy can be calculated from the rise in the water table 1 sy r δ h where r is recharge and δh is the change in the elevation of the water table assumptions include i that all the recharge contributes to the water table rise so that there is no subsurface stormflow above the water table and ii that the rainfall event is of short duration and results in an instantaneous rise in the water table healy and cook 2002 discuss the uses and limitations of using water level changes to estimate specific yield and groundwater recharge 2 1 4 streamflow recessions stream discharge commonly exhibits an exponential recession where there are extended periods with little precipitation during such periods the specific yield can be calculated from 2 sy v s a δ h where vs is the volume of streamflow over a period of recession a is the groundwater catchment area of the stream and δh is the mean change in the elevation of the water table over the groundwater catchment area headworth 1972 2 1 5 other methods to determine specific yield there are several additional methods that have been used to determine specific yield these include laboratory measurements the ratio of water pumped from a well to the volume of a drawdown cone microgravity and water level decline associated with evapotranspiration maliva 2016 these additional methods were not used in the current study and so will not be further discussed 2 2 methods to determine effective porosity 2 2 1 fracture aperture calculations the relationship between fracture apertures fracture spacing and hydraulic conductivity for a parallel set of constant aperture fractures can be expressed snow 1968 as 3 k ρ g n b 3 12 μ where k is hydraulic conductivity g is the acceleration due to gravity n is the number of fractures per unit distance b is fracture aperture and ρ and μ are the density and viscosity of water respectively a common assumption is that flow takes place through three sets of mutually orthogonal fractures warren and root 1963 in this case fracture porosity nf is given by 4 n f 3 b n fracture porosity can be determined from hydraulic conductivity values from pumping tests and from fracture spacing from flowmeter logs these logs usually have abrupt changes in flow that are shown by televiewer logs to coincide with fractures buckley 2000 schürch and buckley 2002 an analysis of flow data from 96 bedrock wells worthington et al 2016 showed that a good approximation for the distribution of fracture discharge into wells is given by 5 q 100 0 5 n where q is the percentage of flow into a well being pumped that comes from a fracture with rank n this equation results in the three most productive fractures having discharges of 50 25 and 12 5 of the flow respectively thus most flow into bedrock wells usually comes from just a few fractures 2 2 2 fracture flow and injected tracers tracer tests between wells in both carbonate and silicate bedrock aquifers typically demonstrate groundwater velocities that average about 100 m d worthington et al 2016 zuber and motyka 1994 suggested that the effective porosity in fractured aquifers over short time periods can be calculated from 6 n f ki v t which is derived from darcy s law e g zheng and bennett 2002 and where i is hydraulic gradient and vt is the groundwater velocity determined from tracer tests 2 2 3 matrix porosity and environmental tracers matrix diffusion needs to be considered over long time periods and zuber and motyka 1994 suggest that in this case the effective porosity is 7 n m ki v e where nm is matrix porosity and ve is the velocity of an environmental tracer zuber and motyka 1994 showed that travel time for flow through the matrix of a dual porosity aquifer can also be approximated by 8 t v q where t is the mean travel time of a conservative non retarded tracer v is the volume of water in the aquifer and q is the discharge environmental tracers give ages that are usually taken to represent the mean travel time and times of years to decades are common these large values reflect the high porosity of the matrix in many bedrock aquifers 2 2 4 changes in water quality major rain or snowmelt events can result in an infiltration of new water with a distinctive chemical signature such changes occur in particular where there is preferential flow to springs at which parameters such as turbidity electrical conductivity and stable isotopes have shown substantial changes in water quality over periods of hours following major rain events ryan and meiman 1996 winston and criss 2004 3 study area the study area is the chalk aquifer in east hampshire in southern england fig 1 a studies in the area have focussed in particular on the large springs at havant where there are discharge and water quality measurements fig 2 sorensen et al 2018 entec 2007 in wells there have been studies of preferential flow price et al 1982 headworth 1978 headworth et al 1982 nitrate concentrations wellings and bell 1980 sorensen et al 2015 and water level variation lee et al 2006 worthington and soley 2017 in addition there has been tracing with injected and environmental tracers atkinson and smith 1974 barton et al 1996 darling et al 2005 evaluation of the effect of synclines and anticlines on preferential flow giles and lowings 1990 studies of groundwater vulnerability on the basis of aerial imagery and lidar data environmental geology geotechnical consultants 2017a b and regional groundwater modelling entec 2007 the chalk in east hampshire forms a predominantly upland area with undulating topography between 150 and 200 m above sea level asl and little surface drainage fig 1b the groundwater divide is close to the northern updip contact where the chalk overlies the upper greensand and underlying clays consequently most of the aquifer drains to the south and west to rivers and springs these are gauged and together with wells are used as calibration targets for groundwater models calibration has shown that there is a wide range in transmissivity values in the chalk aquifer fig 1c price 1987 estimated that transmissivities of the matrix and of fractures created by physical processes primary fissures are 0 2 m2 d and 20 m2 d respectively and that dissolutional enlargement of fractures secondary fissures accounts for the remainder of the much larger values which are common in the chalk fig 1c the spatial pattern of transmissivity suggests that it is largely a function of dissolution with the highest values being found where there is the greatest flow there are low transmissivities 100 m2 d in most of the confined aquifer and in upgradient parts of the unconfined aquifer close to groundwater divides fig 1c values increase in a downgradient direction with the highest transmissivities occurring where flow is focussed on three synclines to the east of arlesford and at havant where flow is focussed on a group of large springs figs 1c and 2 giles and lowings 1990 the western springs are known as bedhampton springs and the eastern springs as havant springs insights into the nature and spacing of preferential flow horizons in the aquifer has come in particular from optical images combined with packer tests flowmeter profiling and electrical conductivity profiling price et al 1982 schürch and buckley 2002 butler et al 2009 maurice et al 2012 these studies have shown that most flow into wells is from just a few fractures with a spacing of 5 m to 20 m furthermore the fractures are usually clearly enlarged by dissolution resulting in elliptical or circular channels with apertures that may exceed 1 cm the principal changes in water levels and flows are seasonal reflecting seasonal changes in evapotranspiration and concomitant soil moisture deficits that that can exceed 80 mm in late summer jones and robins 1999 these result in diminishing water levels and stream flows in the summer followed by replenishment of soil moisture in the autumn and then substantial increases in water levels in late autumn fig 2 data used in this study included transmissivity and specific yield data from the regional groundwater model of the area entec 2007 this is one of a series of more than twenty regional groundwater models commissioned by the environment agency to model the whole of the chalk aquifer in england whiteman et al 2012 monitoring data provided by the environment agency included water level data with a 15 min interval from wells at idsworth and broadhalfpenny down monitoring data provided by the local water supply company portsmouth water included rainfall at havant and electrical conductivity and turbidity at havant and bedhampton springs with a 15 min interval weekly average discharge from the combined flow from havant and bedhampton springs and weekly measurement of nitrate at these springs in addition the analysis used published data from a number of papers which are cited in the text 4 results 4 1 specific yield 4 1 1 pumping tests an analysis of results from 286 pumping tests in the unconfined chalk found that the median specific yield was 0 008 macdonald and allen 2001 these authors noted that a delayed yield response was common even where chalk was not overlain by another aquifer a six month pumping test found that specific yield increased from 0 008 after 30 to 45 days to 0 03 after 110 to 115 days headworth et al 1982 these results probably reflect rapid drainage occurring in the larger open fractures with slower drainage in narrower fractures and in the limited parts of the matrix that have large pore throats and are able to drain under gravity price 1987 4 1 2 calibration of numerical models in the groundwater model for the east hampshire area figs 1 and 3 there are three stress periods per month and the model is calibrated to data from the period 1965 to 2004 consequently the model is best suited to simulate seasonal changes in water levels and flows fig 2 the specific yield of 0 01 0 02 in the chalk thus largely reflects storage gains in winter and losses in summer in the seasonally saturated zone fig 3 thus the specific yield used in the model can be considered to reflect a storage timescale of six months 4 1 3 water table response to rain the impacts of several rain events are shown in fig 4 in the eleven days starting on 19th december 2012 120 mm of rain fell at havant and the water table at broadhalfpenny down rose by 20 6 m from equation 1 this gives a specific yield of 0 0059 a similar calculation for idsworth well gives a specific yield of 0 020 there is a factor of three difference between the two estimates of specific yield showing that data from a single well does not necessarily provide a good estimate of specific yield however the calculations do show how fracture networks in dual porosity aquifers can result in large and rapid rises in the water table 4 1 4 streamflow recessions correlating streamflow hydrograph recessions during dry periods with the fall in the water table has shown that the volume of water released from the aquifer can give unrealistically large specific yields if the only source is due to the fall in the water table lewis et al 1993 however another potential source is from water draining from the rough surface of fractures within the vadose zone and subsequent experiments confirmed this mechanism price et al 2000 in the east hampshire model a slow but constant rate of downward movement through the vadose zone was implemented to help match the sustained stream flows during drought periods entec 2007 in a chalk model to the north of london taylor et al 2012 added a second storage domain with a storage of 0 05 0 1 to account for this extra water released during multi year droughts with the second storage domain being weakly connected to the main flow and storage domain that has a storage of 0 02 this improved model calibration of river flows during multiyear droughts table 2 gives a summary of the results on specific yield in the chalk aquifer and shows that results vary by a factor of about 3 further details of the calculations are given in the supplementary data 4 2 effective porosity 4 2 1 fracture aperture calculations eqs 3 and 4 are used to plot fracture aperture and fracture spacing in fig 5 as a function of fracture porosity and fracture transmissivity assuming three sets of mutually orthogonal fractures a fluid temperature of 10 c and an effective aquifer thickness of 60 m price et al 1993 a box showing the properties of major open fractures has been added to the figure based on common transmissivity values and a 5 m to 20 m spacing of major open fractures this spacing can be seen in flowmeter tests packer tests and electrical conductivity and temperature profiling price et al 1982 schürch and buckley 2002 butler et al 2009 maurice et al 2012 such measurements have shown that there is substantial preferential flow along select stratigraphic horizons such as the chalk rock melbourn rock and stockbridge rock and this preferential flow may extend for many kilometres soley et al 2012 fig 5 indicates that these major fractures have apertures of 0 5 3 mm and yield a fracture porosity of 0 0001 0 001 4 2 2 calculations using darcy s law and measurements of travel time a second way in which effective porosity may be determined is from travel time calculations using eqs 6 7 or 8 and six determinations of effective porosity are listed in table 3 alongside results from applying eqs 3 and 4 to pumping and flowmeter tests there are a number of dolines and stream sinks close to the boundary between the unconfined and confined portions of the chalk aquifer where paleogene sediments overlie the chalk there have been a number of tracer tests from these depressions to the havant and bedhampton springs fig 1b barton et al 1996 atkinson and smith 1974 water levels at the time of their trace were recorded by atkinson and smith 1974 so eq 6 can be used to determine the porosity table 3 this equation can also be used to determine the effective porosity from rapid changes in electrical conductivity and turbidity at havant springs that occurred following rain giving results that are similar to those from tracer tests with peak values occurring 18 27 h after the time of peak hourly rainfall fig 4 and table 3 weekly measurements of nitrate concentrations at havant and bedhampton springs show that there is substantial seasonal variation with a strong correlation with water levels in the unconfined aquifer at idsworth fig 6 a weekly mean values show that the nitrate maximum lags the water level maximum by three weeks on average fig 6b a similar association has been found at a number of locations in the chalk roy et al 2007 stuart et al 2009 this association means that the lag between the maximum nitrate at a well and the maximum nitrate at a downgradient monitoring location will give the mean travel time from which the effective porosity can be calculated table 3 the short term effective porosity calculations from injected tracers electrical conductivity turbidity and nitrate are all in the same range 0 0001 0 001 as the fracture aperture calculations table 3 and fig 5 consequently they reflect preferential flow through fractures the long term effective porosity can be calculated from environmental tracers darling et al 2005 sampled 22 chalk groundwater sites in east hampshire and adjacent areas in sussex ten of the sites had greater than modern concentrations of either or both of cfc 12 and sf6 as a result of anthropogenic contamination of the remaining sites the three sites with the lowest difference 1 2 years between cfc 12 and sf6 ages also had the oldest ages and so these samples are most likely to represent old matrix water table 3 undertaking the calculations in reverse eqs 7 and 8 provide two means by which to estimate travel times associated with recruitment of long term effective porosity of the chalk from core measurements the mean matrix porosity of the upper chalk in southern england is 0 388 allen et al 1997 and equation 7 yields a mean travel time of 32 years eq 8 yields a mean travel time of 81 years using the mean discharge of 99 ml d at havant and bedhampton springs fig 2 recharge area of 125 km2 and resultant aquifer volume of 2 9 109 m3 table 3 5 discussion 5 1 specific yield and effective porosity as a function of test timescale the results from the tests described in section 3 are plotted in fig 7 as a function of time where the time is the effective length of the testing period for each test power law regression lines are plotted separately for the specific yield and for the effective porosity results at short timescales these regression lines highlight the major differences between specific yield and effective porosity this divergence can be explained by the differences in fracture porosity with depth fig 8 it has been found that there is a substantial decrease in specific yield with depth in the chalk connorton and reed 1978 headworth et al 1982 lewis et al 1993 lloyd 1993 during a pumping test the specific yield will largely reflect the dewatering of the shallow zone close to the water table this zone has high fracture porosity resulting from preferential dissolution at shallow depths fig 8a consequently the specific yield measured during a pumping test at well a in fig 8a at times of hours to days after the start of pumping would be dominated by dewatering of all the enlarged fractures within the drawdown cone insights into the divergence between effective porosities and specific yields at short timescales are also gained by using the cubic law domenico and schwartz 1998 p 50 9 q ρ g b 3 i w 12 μ where w is fracture width fracture velocity may then be calculated by combining eq 9 with the continuity equation 10 q v a in which v is fracture velocity and a is fracture cross sectional area equal to wb substitution and rearrangement then gives 11 v ρ g b 2 i 12 μ discharge in fractures varies with the cube of the aperture eq 9 but velocity varies with the square of the aperture eq 11 this leads to the pattern of tracer or contaminant movement shown in fig 8b which assumes that the fracture distribution is as described by equation 5 accordingly if a tracer is injected into well a then 50 of the tracer will be carried along the largest fracture tracer arrival at downgradient well b will be determined solely by flow along the largest fracture and the breakthrough curve will be dominated by flow through the largest fractures thus the effective porosity determined by tracer tests and changes in water quality is dominated by the porosity of the one or two most open fractures theoretical calculations suggest that this porosity is 0 001 fig 5 major open fractures box and calculation from tracer test velocities usually yield effective porosity values 0 001 fig 7 and table 1 consequently the effective porosity in the chalk at test timescales of hours to days is much less than the specific yield as fig 7 shows at intermediate timescales of weeks to months effective porosity and specific yield begin to converge as in the case of specific yield smaller primary fractures surfaces of larger fractures and larger pores release water until they attain field capacity as pore fracture size is essentially a continuum phenomenon this remains an ongoing process until recharge reverses drainage with regards to effective porosity increasing residence times up to and beyond several weeks permit diffusive transport into interconnected but essentially non kinematic porosity i e without water flux 5 2 diffusion retardation factors the correlations between storage test time and both effective porosity and specific yield fig 7 show that these parameters vary as a function of the test timescale consequently it is important to consider the timescale when using specific yield or effective porosity in any calculations for instance the appropriate effective porosity in a dual porosity aquifer for the arrival of a contaminant spill at a receptor is given by eq 6 on the other hand eq 7 is more relevant for estimating the persistence of a contaminant at a receptor the ratio of the mean velocity from eq 7 to the mean velocity from eq 6 is called the diffusion retardation factor and is approximately equal to the ratio of total porosity to fissure porosity małoszewski and zuber 1985 zuber et al 2011 injected tracers provide a good way to evaluate eq 6 and environmental tracers provide a good way to evaluate eq 7 if an aquifer behaves as a porous medium for transport then the travel times for injected and environmental tracers would be the same and the diffusion retardation factor would be unity however values much greater than unity are found in bedrock aquifers for example the average porosity in permo triassic sandstones in the uk is 0 26 but pumping tests where the aquifer is unconfined usually give specific yields of 0 001 0 01 allen et al 1997 this shows that water level responses are largely in the fracture network with little response in the short term from the matrix and this results in a diffusion retardation factor between 26 and 260 neretnieks 1981 suggested that this ratio in a granite aquifer might range from 10 to 1000 in the present study three tests of matrix travel times gave results of 32 81 years and three tests of fracture travel times gave results of 0 0021 0 055 years giving a geometric mean diffusion retardation factor of 1520 table 3 an analysis of environmental and injected tracer data from 12 carbonate aquifers including the english chalk gave a range from 82 to 4600 for the diffusion retardation factor with a median value of 255 worthington 2015 these results suggest that diffusion retardation factors in bedrock are commonly in the range of tens to hundreds and values 1000 may not be uncommon 5 3 evaluation of aquifers as single porosity or dual porosity media aquifers are routinely evaluated as single porosity media with flow and transport modelled using darcy s law thus treating aquifers as equivalent porous media epms environmental tracers are commonly used to measure groundwater ages kazemi et al 2006 fitts 2013 hiscock and bense 2014 results typically give ages of years to decades for many aquifers as in the chalk aquifer table 3 numerical modelling can take account of advection diffusion and dispersion as well as the decay of radioactive isotopes goode 1996 bethke and johnson 2008 furthermore there have been extensive discussions in the literature on groundwater age based on the single porosity assumption e g ginn et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 however a limitation of the single porosity approach is that permeability is assumed to vary randomly in space freeze 1975 consequently it is assumed that a single mean groundwater age will give a meaningful value that can be used to represent contaminant transport bedrock aquifers often have networks of connected fractures that have much higher hydraulic conductivity than the intervening matrix for instance average hydraulic conductivities for the matrix and for the fracture networks in the chalk are 10 9 to 10 8 m s and 10 5 to 10 3 m s respectively price et al 1993 this means that the assumption that permeability varies randomly in space is violated in this aquifer and that it does not behave as an epm when considering transport pankow et al 1986 instead the aquifer has rapid transport in the fracture network and diffusion of solutes into the matrix which results in the widely different travel times for injected and for environmental tracers section 5 2 such behaviour is common in bedrock aquifers neretnieks 1981 małoszewski and zuber 1985 zuber et al 2011 the current study shows how an aquifer can have both a slow seasonal response to infiltration fig 2 and a rapid response that is measured in hours and days fig 4 this combination of both slow and rapid responses is caused by the dual porosity structure of the aquifer and is associated with large diffusion retardation factors section 5 2 some numerical models of the chalk aquifer have used dual porosity models that have incorporated transient specific yield and effective porosity cook et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 these studies gave model fits to streamflow tracer travel time and contamination concentrations that were better than would be possible with a single porosity model dual porosity models require more data than single porosity models hydraulic properties of a single porosity aquifer can be established by only using pumping tests however additional tests are needed to characterize dual porosity such as i flowmeter and visual logging television or televiewer to determine whether flow is primarily through the pores of the rock or through fractures and in the latter case to determine the spacing of the major flows ii calculations of the likely values for the effective porosity of the fracture network fig 5 and fracture velocities eq 11 and iii injected tracers and environmental tracers to establish how the effective porosity changes with test timescale fig 7 each of the tests in fig 7 contributes to understanding aquifer behaviour with the differing results helping to explain contrasting aspects of aquifer behaviour thus the tests are complementary rather than contradictory which might be concluded if it were assumed that the aquifer behaved as an epm reducing specific yield or effective porosity to a single value is often satisfactory for modelling an aquifer as a porous medium under steady state conditions whereas incorporating transient changes in effective porosity and specific yield can give better results for transient flow and transport cook et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 5 4 are comparable specific yield and effective porosity results found in other lithologies fracture flow is common in most bedrock aquifers so that dual porosity flow is also common if not indeed the norm one indication of this is provided by an analysis of flowmeter logs from all five of the major lithologies which are represented by limestone sandstone shale granite and basalt it was found that fracture flow is dominant in most wells in all five lithologies with most flow coming from just a few fractures worthington et al 2016 evidence also comes from high groundwater velocities determined by tracer tests in both carbonate and silicate aquifers and from the much higher incidence of bacterial contamination in wells in bedrock aquifers than in wells in unconsolidated sediments worthington et al 2016 in addition the high diffusion retardation factors presented in section 5 3 also suggest that dual porosity behaviour is common in bedrock with resultant transient characteristics of both specific yield and effective porosity the large divergence between specific yield and effective porosity at a timescale of days fig 7 is ascribed to the greater porosity at shallow depths fig 8a and to preferential flow of tracers along the larger open fractures fig 8b the scale of this divergence will depend on the degree of the preferential fracture enlargement at shallow depths and on the nature and extent of channelling of flow along fractures with weathering being a major factor in channelling worthington et al 2016 for instance minimal divergence between specific yield and effective porosity over a timescale scale of three days was found at a site in palaeozoic limestones and dolostones where aquifer properties were determined from a pumping test borehole imaging flowmeter testing tracer testing and groundwater modelling worthington et al 2012 substantial differences from the results shown in fig 8 are also expected at the upper end of the timescale due to variations in porosity and permeability for instance the geometric mean total porosity for crystalline rocks is 0 013 which is more than an order of magnitude lower that the 0 39 value for the chalk wolff 1982 however these rocks may have extremely low fracture porosities and so still have large diffusion retardation factors zuber et al 2011 such contrasting properties in different lithologies are unlikely to change the overall pattern of substantial increases in both specific yield and effective porosity in bedrock aquifers as a function of storage test timescale furthermore substantial dual porosity effects may also be found in unconsolidated sediments due to facies variation for instance tracer tests in sand and gravel aquifers suggest that the effective porosity for transport is usually 0 02 0 1 payne et al 2008 these values are much less that typical total porosities of 0 3 0 4 and hence suggest diffusion retardation factors of 3 20 these values are much smaller than the values in bedrock section 5 3 but they do show the ubiquity of preferential flow in aquifers 6 conclusions we investigated storage properties in the chalk aquifer in east hampshire uk hydraulic conductivity determinations from pumping tests and from model calibration together with flowmeter data and visual logs enabled fracture apertures and fracture porosity to be calculated then effective porosity was calculated from tracer tests and from changes in electrical conductivity turbidity and nitrate the effective porosity results between 0 0001 and 0 001 coincided with the fracture porosity calculations showing that aquifer responses to stresses in the short term of hours to days are dominated by the low porosity fracture network this contrasts with results from environmental tracers and from calculated matrix porosity residence times which give groundwater ages of 30 80 years for the matrix porosity of 0 39 table 3 specific yield was determined from pumping tests numerical models changes in water table elevation following rain and from streamflow recessions specific yield was found to vary from 0 01 for pumping tests lasting less than a month to higher values for longer term tests table 2 both effective porosity and specific yield were found to vary as a function of the timescale of the testing method fig 7 the contrasting responses are readily explained by dual porosity behaviour interconnected networks of fractures have high permeability but low porosity and so exhibit rapid responses to hydraulic stresses such as recharge events or pumping tests the matrix has a low permeability but a high porosity and so it responds much more slowly however its large storage capacity can result in persistence of contamination for decades e g cook et al 2012 these contrasting properties together with solute exchange by diffusion between the matrix and the fractures result in the large range of values in effective porosity and specific yield observed in the chalk flowmeter logs measured groundwater velocities from tracers a high incidence of bacterial contamination and high diffusion retardation factors all suggest that a majority of bedrock aquifers in all lithologies have preferential flow through fracture networks consequently the transient nature of both effective porosity and specific yield that has been demonstrated here for the unconfined chalk aquifer is

6181,studies of bedrock aquifers have often treated effective porosity and specific yield as having a similar time invariant value here we apply a series of tests of specific yield and effective porosity at multiple temporal scales to the chalk aquifer of east hampshire england these include analysis of natural water level discharge and water quality variations numerical model calibrations hydrograph recession analysis pumping tests and tracer tests using both injected and environmental tracers values of both effective porosity and specific yield are shown to be transient phenomena that are dependent upon the temporal test scale an effect which results from the dual porosity structure of the aquifer over short time periods aquifer response is dominated by preferential flow through the low storage high permeability fracture network effective porosities on a timescale of hours to days are 0 0001 0 001 over longer time periods aquifer response becomes increasingly dominated by the high storage low permeability matrix with the effective porosity rising to approximate total porosity 0 39 on a timescale of decades specific yield also increases as a function of timescale though there is much less variability than with effective porosity our findings demonstrate that it is critical to use an effective porosity value appropriate to the timescale when making transport calculations preferential flow through fracture networks is common in bedrock aquifers consequently the transient nature of both effective porosity and specific yield that has been demonstrated in the chalk aquifer is likely to be broadly representative of most bedrock aquifers keywords effective porosity specific yield dual porosity preferential flow chalk 1 introduction determination of groundwater travel times is an important component of hydrogeology being needed for assessment of the potential for contamination at water supply sources and for understanding the movement of contaminant plumes a value for effective porosity is needed in calculations of travel times but the determination of a representative value is often not straightforward especially in bedrock aquifers because these often have preferential flow through fracture networks a common concept is that effective porosity varies much less than hydraulic conductivity and has a typical range of 0 01 to 0 3 freeze and cherry 1979 p 61 anderson et al 2015 p 228 consequently it is common for effective porosity to be estimated based on literature values on personal experience or on values of specific yield stephens et al 1998 anderson et al 2015 allen et al 1997 in uniform unconsolidated sediments with only intergranular flow effective porosity may be close to total porosity but bedrock aquifers usually have dual porosity with most of the storage volume being in the matrix and most of the flow being in the fracture network in either case effective porosity can be defined as the open space through which water flows hiscock and bense 2014 p 36 however this definition relates only to the advective movement i e flux of water and in bedrock aquifers is often taken as the fracture porosity alone zuber and motyka 1994 although this is not simple to measure preferential flow path development in bedrock aquifers via dissolutional enlargement of fractures leads to an additional smaller component of porosity through which the majority of saturated flow occurs this effect is most notable in carbonates but also applies to other lithologies worthington et al 2016 total porosity varies substantially between different bedrock lithologies and a compilation of measurements by wolff 1982 gave geometric means of 0 013 for crystalline rocks 0 028 for carbonates 0 097 for shale and 0 12 for both sandstone and volcanic rocks fracture porosity may be high at outcrops due to weathering and dilation but within aquifers it is usually much lower than matrix porosity with values of 0 00001 to 0 01 being common freeze and cherry 1979 p 408 norton and knapp 1977 determined values of 0 00001 to 0 001 in hydrothermal systems and lee and farmer 1993 found that values between 0 0001 and 0 001 were most common in the top 100 m of bedrock with substantial reductions in fracture porosity with depth a practical definition of effective porosity applicable to contaminant transport is the porosity required to achieve agreement with observation in a calculation of travel time zheng and bennett 2002 p 17 however in practice tracer tests are rarely used to determine effective porosity a compilation of studies where effective porosity in carbonate rocks has been calculated from tracer tests shows that effective porosities are most commonly between 0 0001 and 0 001 table 1 all the effective porosity values in table 1 are at least an order of magnitude less than total porosity alongside significant disparity between fracture and matrix porosity a further distinctive aspect of many bedrock aquifers is that matrix diffusion retards the mean advective velocity of solutes freeze and cherry 1979 fracture flow plays a dominant role during short term tracer testing up to a few days but matrix diffusion plays an increasingly important role over longer periods małoszewski and zuber 1985 thus as an increasing proportion of the total porosity involved in tracer transport becomes recruited over time so effective porosity as defined by solute flux rather than water flux is a time dependent parameter water flux is not constrained by matrix diffusion as water molecules diffusing from flowing fissure to stagnant matrix stores are replaced by an equal number of water molecules diffusing in the opposite direction zuber and motyka 1994 specific yield is also a time dependent parameter and increases over time during pumping tests johnson 1967 macdonald and allen 2001 fitts 2013 this is because fracture permeability is usually considerably higher than matrix permeability so a change in head will result in a more rapid change in storage in the fracture network than in the matrix consequently it is important to evaluate the time duration of stresses and measurement periods when evaluating both effective porosity and specific yield the purpose of this study is to use a range of techniques to determine values of specific yield and effective porosity in a well researched bedrock aquifer that has a wide range of monitoring data available namely the cretaceous chalk of southern and eastern england the chalk is the most important aquifer in the uk supplying about 55 of the groundwater used lloyd 1993 in this paper we explore how the dual porosity structure of the chalk aquifer affects measurements of effective porosity and specific yield and how these measurements vary as a function of the technique used we then show that these findings are broadly applicable to many bedrock aquifers 2 methods 2 1 methods to determine specific yield 2 1 1 pumping tests the most common method of determining specific yield is from drawdown measurements during pumping tests pumping tests are routinely carried out during aquifers investigations and data analysis provides values for both hydraulic conductivity and for the storage term specific yield in unconfined aquifers storativity in confined aquifers pumping tests typically have durations up to several days and this may only be long enough to result in drainage of the fractures in unconfined bedrock aquifers especially where the permeability of the matrix is low consequently such short term specific yields can have values similar to fracture porosity 0 00001 0 01 freeze and cherry 1979 2 1 2 water level changes in numerical models an increasingly common way to determine specific yield is as a calibration parameter in distributed numerical models using several years or more of water level data from wells taylor et al 2012 many areas have seasonal variations in water levels that are associated with variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration if there is a simple sine wave pattern of seasonal variation then water levels will fall for a period of six months and there may be substantial drainage of the matrix 2 1 3 rise in water table following rain in dual porosity media with low matrix permeability major recharge events can result in rapid short term rises in water levels headworth 1972 the specific yield sy can be calculated from the rise in the water table 1 sy r δ h where r is recharge and δh is the change in the elevation of the water table assumptions include i that all the recharge contributes to the water table rise so that there is no subsurface stormflow above the water table and ii that the rainfall event is of short duration and results in an instantaneous rise in the water table healy and cook 2002 discuss the uses and limitations of using water level changes to estimate specific yield and groundwater recharge 2 1 4 streamflow recessions stream discharge commonly exhibits an exponential recession where there are extended periods with little precipitation during such periods the specific yield can be calculated from 2 sy v s a δ h where vs is the volume of streamflow over a period of recession a is the groundwater catchment area of the stream and δh is the mean change in the elevation of the water table over the groundwater catchment area headworth 1972 2 1 5 other methods to determine specific yield there are several additional methods that have been used to determine specific yield these include laboratory measurements the ratio of water pumped from a well to the volume of a drawdown cone microgravity and water level decline associated with evapotranspiration maliva 2016 these additional methods were not used in the current study and so will not be further discussed 2 2 methods to determine effective porosity 2 2 1 fracture aperture calculations the relationship between fracture apertures fracture spacing and hydraulic conductivity for a parallel set of constant aperture fractures can be expressed snow 1968 as 3 k ρ g n b 3 12 μ where k is hydraulic conductivity g is the acceleration due to gravity n is the number of fractures per unit distance b is fracture aperture and ρ and μ are the density and viscosity of water respectively a common assumption is that flow takes place through three sets of mutually orthogonal fractures warren and root 1963 in this case fracture porosity nf is given by 4 n f 3 b n fracture porosity can be determined from hydraulic conductivity values from pumping tests and from fracture spacing from flowmeter logs these logs usually have abrupt changes in flow that are shown by televiewer logs to coincide with fractures buckley 2000 schürch and buckley 2002 an analysis of flow data from 96 bedrock wells worthington et al 2016 showed that a good approximation for the distribution of fracture discharge into wells is given by 5 q 100 0 5 n where q is the percentage of flow into a well being pumped that comes from a fracture with rank n this equation results in the three most productive fractures having discharges of 50 25 and 12 5 of the flow respectively thus most flow into bedrock wells usually comes from just a few fractures 2 2 2 fracture flow and injected tracers tracer tests between wells in both carbonate and silicate bedrock aquifers typically demonstrate groundwater velocities that average about 100 m d worthington et al 2016 zuber and motyka 1994 suggested that the effective porosity in fractured aquifers over short time periods can be calculated from 6 n f ki v t which is derived from darcy s law e g zheng and bennett 2002 and where i is hydraulic gradient and vt is the groundwater velocity determined from tracer tests 2 2 3 matrix porosity and environmental tracers matrix diffusion needs to be considered over long time periods and zuber and motyka 1994 suggest that in this case the effective porosity is 7 n m ki v e where nm is matrix porosity and ve is the velocity of an environmental tracer zuber and motyka 1994 showed that travel time for flow through the matrix of a dual porosity aquifer can also be approximated by 8 t v q where t is the mean travel time of a conservative non retarded tracer v is the volume of water in the aquifer and q is the discharge environmental tracers give ages that are usually taken to represent the mean travel time and times of years to decades are common these large values reflect the high porosity of the matrix in many bedrock aquifers 2 2 4 changes in water quality major rain or snowmelt events can result in an infiltration of new water with a distinctive chemical signature such changes occur in particular where there is preferential flow to springs at which parameters such as turbidity electrical conductivity and stable isotopes have shown substantial changes in water quality over periods of hours following major rain events ryan and meiman 1996 winston and criss 2004 3 study area the study area is the chalk aquifer in east hampshire in southern england fig 1 a studies in the area have focussed in particular on the large springs at havant where there are discharge and water quality measurements fig 2 sorensen et al 2018 entec 2007 in wells there have been studies of preferential flow price et al 1982 headworth 1978 headworth et al 1982 nitrate concentrations wellings and bell 1980 sorensen et al 2015 and water level variation lee et al 2006 worthington and soley 2017 in addition there has been tracing with injected and environmental tracers atkinson and smith 1974 barton et al 1996 darling et al 2005 evaluation of the effect of synclines and anticlines on preferential flow giles and lowings 1990 studies of groundwater vulnerability on the basis of aerial imagery and lidar data environmental geology geotechnical consultants 2017a b and regional groundwater modelling entec 2007 the chalk in east hampshire forms a predominantly upland area with undulating topography between 150 and 200 m above sea level asl and little surface drainage fig 1b the groundwater divide is close to the northern updip contact where the chalk overlies the upper greensand and underlying clays consequently most of the aquifer drains to the south and west to rivers and springs these are gauged and together with wells are used as calibration targets for groundwater models calibration has shown that there is a wide range in transmissivity values in the chalk aquifer fig 1c price 1987 estimated that transmissivities of the matrix and of fractures created by physical processes primary fissures are 0 2 m2 d and 20 m2 d respectively and that dissolutional enlargement of fractures secondary fissures accounts for the remainder of the much larger values which are common in the chalk fig 1c the spatial pattern of transmissivity suggests that it is largely a function of dissolution with the highest values being found where there is the greatest flow there are low transmissivities 100 m2 d in most of the confined aquifer and in upgradient parts of the unconfined aquifer close to groundwater divides fig 1c values increase in a downgradient direction with the highest transmissivities occurring where flow is focussed on three synclines to the east of arlesford and at havant where flow is focussed on a group of large springs figs 1c and 2 giles and lowings 1990 the western springs are known as bedhampton springs and the eastern springs as havant springs insights into the nature and spacing of preferential flow horizons in the aquifer has come in particular from optical images combined with packer tests flowmeter profiling and electrical conductivity profiling price et al 1982 schürch and buckley 2002 butler et al 2009 maurice et al 2012 these studies have shown that most flow into wells is from just a few fractures with a spacing of 5 m to 20 m furthermore the fractures are usually clearly enlarged by dissolution resulting in elliptical or circular channels with apertures that may exceed 1 cm the principal changes in water levels and flows are seasonal reflecting seasonal changes in evapotranspiration and concomitant soil moisture deficits that that can exceed 80 mm in late summer jones and robins 1999 these result in diminishing water levels and stream flows in the summer followed by replenishment of soil moisture in the autumn and then substantial increases in water levels in late autumn fig 2 data used in this study included transmissivity and specific yield data from the regional groundwater model of the area entec 2007 this is one of a series of more than twenty regional groundwater models commissioned by the environment agency to model the whole of the chalk aquifer in england whiteman et al 2012 monitoring data provided by the environment agency included water level data with a 15 min interval from wells at idsworth and broadhalfpenny down monitoring data provided by the local water supply company portsmouth water included rainfall at havant and electrical conductivity and turbidity at havant and bedhampton springs with a 15 min interval weekly average discharge from the combined flow from havant and bedhampton springs and weekly measurement of nitrate at these springs in addition the analysis used published data from a number of papers which are cited in the text 4 results 4 1 specific yield 4 1 1 pumping tests an analysis of results from 286 pumping tests in the unconfined chalk found that the median specific yield was 0 008 macdonald and allen 2001 these authors noted that a delayed yield response was common even where chalk was not overlain by another aquifer a six month pumping test found that specific yield increased from 0 008 after 30 to 45 days to 0 03 after 110 to 115 days headworth et al 1982 these results probably reflect rapid drainage occurring in the larger open fractures with slower drainage in narrower fractures and in the limited parts of the matrix that have large pore throats and are able to drain under gravity price 1987 4 1 2 calibration of numerical models in the groundwater model for the east hampshire area figs 1 and 3 there are three stress periods per month and the model is calibrated to data from the period 1965 to 2004 consequently the model is best suited to simulate seasonal changes in water levels and flows fig 2 the specific yield of 0 01 0 02 in the chalk thus largely reflects storage gains in winter and losses in summer in the seasonally saturated zone fig 3 thus the specific yield used in the model can be considered to reflect a storage timescale of six months 4 1 3 water table response to rain the impacts of several rain events are shown in fig 4 in the eleven days starting on 19th december 2012 120 mm of rain fell at havant and the water table at broadhalfpenny down rose by 20 6 m from equation 1 this gives a specific yield of 0 0059 a similar calculation for idsworth well gives a specific yield of 0 020 there is a factor of three difference between the two estimates of specific yield showing that data from a single well does not necessarily provide a good estimate of specific yield however the calculations do show how fracture networks in dual porosity aquifers can result in large and rapid rises in the water table 4 1 4 streamflow recessions correlating streamflow hydrograph recessions during dry periods with the fall in the water table has shown that the volume of water released from the aquifer can give unrealistically large specific yields if the only source is due to the fall in the water table lewis et al 1993 however another potential source is from water draining from the rough surface of fractures within the vadose zone and subsequent experiments confirmed this mechanism price et al 2000 in the east hampshire model a slow but constant rate of downward movement through the vadose zone was implemented to help match the sustained stream flows during drought periods entec 2007 in a chalk model to the north of london taylor et al 2012 added a second storage domain with a storage of 0 05 0 1 to account for this extra water released during multi year droughts with the second storage domain being weakly connected to the main flow and storage domain that has a storage of 0 02 this improved model calibration of river flows during multiyear droughts table 2 gives a summary of the results on specific yield in the chalk aquifer and shows that results vary by a factor of about 3 further details of the calculations are given in the supplementary data 4 2 effective porosity 4 2 1 fracture aperture calculations eqs 3 and 4 are used to plot fracture aperture and fracture spacing in fig 5 as a function of fracture porosity and fracture transmissivity assuming three sets of mutually orthogonal fractures a fluid temperature of 10 c and an effective aquifer thickness of 60 m price et al 1993 a box showing the properties of major open fractures has been added to the figure based on common transmissivity values and a 5 m to 20 m spacing of major open fractures this spacing can be seen in flowmeter tests packer tests and electrical conductivity and temperature profiling price et al 1982 schürch and buckley 2002 butler et al 2009 maurice et al 2012 such measurements have shown that there is substantial preferential flow along select stratigraphic horizons such as the chalk rock melbourn rock and stockbridge rock and this preferential flow may extend for many kilometres soley et al 2012 fig 5 indicates that these major fractures have apertures of 0 5 3 mm and yield a fracture porosity of 0 0001 0 001 4 2 2 calculations using darcy s law and measurements of travel time a second way in which effective porosity may be determined is from travel time calculations using eqs 6 7 or 8 and six determinations of effective porosity are listed in table 3 alongside results from applying eqs 3 and 4 to pumping and flowmeter tests there are a number of dolines and stream sinks close to the boundary between the unconfined and confined portions of the chalk aquifer where paleogene sediments overlie the chalk there have been a number of tracer tests from these depressions to the havant and bedhampton springs fig 1b barton et al 1996 atkinson and smith 1974 water levels at the time of their trace were recorded by atkinson and smith 1974 so eq 6 can be used to determine the porosity table 3 this equation can also be used to determine the effective porosity from rapid changes in electrical conductivity and turbidity at havant springs that occurred following rain giving results that are similar to those from tracer tests with peak values occurring 18 27 h after the time of peak hourly rainfall fig 4 and table 3 weekly measurements of nitrate concentrations at havant and bedhampton springs show that there is substantial seasonal variation with a strong correlation with water levels in the unconfined aquifer at idsworth fig 6 a weekly mean values show that the nitrate maximum lags the water level maximum by three weeks on average fig 6b a similar association has been found at a number of locations in the chalk roy et al 2007 stuart et al 2009 this association means that the lag between the maximum nitrate at a well and the maximum nitrate at a downgradient monitoring location will give the mean travel time from which the effective porosity can be calculated table 3 the short term effective porosity calculations from injected tracers electrical conductivity turbidity and nitrate are all in the same range 0 0001 0 001 as the fracture aperture calculations table 3 and fig 5 consequently they reflect preferential flow through fractures the long term effective porosity can be calculated from environmental tracers darling et al 2005 sampled 22 chalk groundwater sites in east hampshire and adjacent areas in sussex ten of the sites had greater than modern concentrations of either or both of cfc 12 and sf6 as a result of anthropogenic contamination of the remaining sites the three sites with the lowest difference 1 2 years between cfc 12 and sf6 ages also had the oldest ages and so these samples are most likely to represent old matrix water table 3 undertaking the calculations in reverse eqs 7 and 8 provide two means by which to estimate travel times associated with recruitment of long term effective porosity of the chalk from core measurements the mean matrix porosity of the upper chalk in southern england is 0 388 allen et al 1997 and equation 7 yields a mean travel time of 32 years eq 8 yields a mean travel time of 81 years using the mean discharge of 99 ml d at havant and bedhampton springs fig 2 recharge area of 125 km2 and resultant aquifer volume of 2 9 109 m3 table 3 5 discussion 5 1 specific yield and effective porosity as a function of test timescale the results from the tests described in section 3 are plotted in fig 7 as a function of time where the time is the effective length of the testing period for each test power law regression lines are plotted separately for the specific yield and for the effective porosity results at short timescales these regression lines highlight the major differences between specific yield and effective porosity this divergence can be explained by the differences in fracture porosity with depth fig 8 it has been found that there is a substantial decrease in specific yield with depth in the chalk connorton and reed 1978 headworth et al 1982 lewis et al 1993 lloyd 1993 during a pumping test the specific yield will largely reflect the dewatering of the shallow zone close to the water table this zone has high fracture porosity resulting from preferential dissolution at shallow depths fig 8a consequently the specific yield measured during a pumping test at well a in fig 8a at times of hours to days after the start of pumping would be dominated by dewatering of all the enlarged fractures within the drawdown cone insights into the divergence between effective porosities and specific yields at short timescales are also gained by using the cubic law domenico and schwartz 1998 p 50 9 q ρ g b 3 i w 12 μ where w is fracture width fracture velocity may then be calculated by combining eq 9 with the continuity equation 10 q v a in which v is fracture velocity and a is fracture cross sectional area equal to wb substitution and rearrangement then gives 11 v ρ g b 2 i 12 μ discharge in fractures varies with the cube of the aperture eq 9 but velocity varies with the square of the aperture eq 11 this leads to the pattern of tracer or contaminant movement shown in fig 8b which assumes that the fracture distribution is as described by equation 5 accordingly if a tracer is injected into well a then 50 of the tracer will be carried along the largest fracture tracer arrival at downgradient well b will be determined solely by flow along the largest fracture and the breakthrough curve will be dominated by flow through the largest fractures thus the effective porosity determined by tracer tests and changes in water quality is dominated by the porosity of the one or two most open fractures theoretical calculations suggest that this porosity is 0 001 fig 5 major open fractures box and calculation from tracer test velocities usually yield effective porosity values 0 001 fig 7 and table 1 consequently the effective porosity in the chalk at test timescales of hours to days is much less than the specific yield as fig 7 shows at intermediate timescales of weeks to months effective porosity and specific yield begin to converge as in the case of specific yield smaller primary fractures surfaces of larger fractures and larger pores release water until they attain field capacity as pore fracture size is essentially a continuum phenomenon this remains an ongoing process until recharge reverses drainage with regards to effective porosity increasing residence times up to and beyond several weeks permit diffusive transport into interconnected but essentially non kinematic porosity i e without water flux 5 2 diffusion retardation factors the correlations between storage test time and both effective porosity and specific yield fig 7 show that these parameters vary as a function of the test timescale consequently it is important to consider the timescale when using specific yield or effective porosity in any calculations for instance the appropriate effective porosity in a dual porosity aquifer for the arrival of a contaminant spill at a receptor is given by eq 6 on the other hand eq 7 is more relevant for estimating the persistence of a contaminant at a receptor the ratio of the mean velocity from eq 7 to the mean velocity from eq 6 is called the diffusion retardation factor and is approximately equal to the ratio of total porosity to fissure porosity małoszewski and zuber 1985 zuber et al 2011 injected tracers provide a good way to evaluate eq 6 and environmental tracers provide a good way to evaluate eq 7 if an aquifer behaves as a porous medium for transport then the travel times for injected and environmental tracers would be the same and the diffusion retardation factor would be unity however values much greater than unity are found in bedrock aquifers for example the average porosity in permo triassic sandstones in the uk is 0 26 but pumping tests where the aquifer is unconfined usually give specific yields of 0 001 0 01 allen et al 1997 this shows that water level responses are largely in the fracture network with little response in the short term from the matrix and this results in a diffusion retardation factor between 26 and 260 neretnieks 1981 suggested that this ratio in a granite aquifer might range from 10 to 1000 in the present study three tests of matrix travel times gave results of 32 81 years and three tests of fracture travel times gave results of 0 0021 0 055 years giving a geometric mean diffusion retardation factor of 1520 table 3 an analysis of environmental and injected tracer data from 12 carbonate aquifers including the english chalk gave a range from 82 to 4600 for the diffusion retardation factor with a median value of 255 worthington 2015 these results suggest that diffusion retardation factors in bedrock are commonly in the range of tens to hundreds and values 1000 may not be uncommon 5 3 evaluation of aquifers as single porosity or dual porosity media aquifers are routinely evaluated as single porosity media with flow and transport modelled using darcy s law thus treating aquifers as equivalent porous media epms environmental tracers are commonly used to measure groundwater ages kazemi et al 2006 fitts 2013 hiscock and bense 2014 results typically give ages of years to decades for many aquifers as in the chalk aquifer table 3 numerical modelling can take account of advection diffusion and dispersion as well as the decay of radioactive isotopes goode 1996 bethke and johnson 2008 furthermore there have been extensive discussions in the literature on groundwater age based on the single porosity assumption e g ginn et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 however a limitation of the single porosity approach is that permeability is assumed to vary randomly in space freeze 1975 consequently it is assumed that a single mean groundwater age will give a meaningful value that can be used to represent contaminant transport bedrock aquifers often have networks of connected fractures that have much higher hydraulic conductivity than the intervening matrix for instance average hydraulic conductivities for the matrix and for the fracture networks in the chalk are 10 9 to 10 8 m s and 10 5 to 10 3 m s respectively price et al 1993 this means that the assumption that permeability varies randomly in space is violated in this aquifer and that it does not behave as an epm when considering transport pankow et al 1986 instead the aquifer has rapid transport in the fracture network and diffusion of solutes into the matrix which results in the widely different travel times for injected and for environmental tracers section 5 2 such behaviour is common in bedrock aquifers neretnieks 1981 małoszewski and zuber 1985 zuber et al 2011 the current study shows how an aquifer can have both a slow seasonal response to infiltration fig 2 and a rapid response that is measured in hours and days fig 4 this combination of both slow and rapid responses is caused by the dual porosity structure of the aquifer and is associated with large diffusion retardation factors section 5 2 some numerical models of the chalk aquifer have used dual porosity models that have incorporated transient specific yield and effective porosity cook et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 these studies gave model fits to streamflow tracer travel time and contamination concentrations that were better than would be possible with a single porosity model dual porosity models require more data than single porosity models hydraulic properties of a single porosity aquifer can be established by only using pumping tests however additional tests are needed to characterize dual porosity such as i flowmeter and visual logging television or televiewer to determine whether flow is primarily through the pores of the rock or through fractures and in the latter case to determine the spacing of the major flows ii calculations of the likely values for the effective porosity of the fracture network fig 5 and fracture velocities eq 11 and iii injected tracers and environmental tracers to establish how the effective porosity changes with test timescale fig 7 each of the tests in fig 7 contributes to understanding aquifer behaviour with the differing results helping to explain contrasting aspects of aquifer behaviour thus the tests are complementary rather than contradictory which might be concluded if it were assumed that the aquifer behaved as an epm reducing specific yield or effective porosity to a single value is often satisfactory for modelling an aquifer as a porous medium under steady state conditions whereas incorporating transient changes in effective porosity and specific yield can give better results for transient flow and transport cook et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 5 4 are comparable specific yield and effective porosity results found in other lithologies fracture flow is common in most bedrock aquifers so that dual porosity flow is also common if not indeed the norm one indication of this is provided by an analysis of flowmeter logs from all five of the major lithologies which are represented by limestone sandstone shale granite and basalt it was found that fracture flow is dominant in most wells in all five lithologies with most flow coming from just a few fractures worthington et al 2016 evidence also comes from high groundwater velocities determined by tracer tests in both carbonate and silicate aquifers and from the much higher incidence of bacterial contamination in wells in bedrock aquifers than in wells in unconsolidated sediments worthington et al 2016 in addition the high diffusion retardation factors presented in section 5 3 also suggest that dual porosity behaviour is common in bedrock with resultant transient characteristics of both specific yield and effective porosity the large divergence between specific yield and effective porosity at a timescale of days fig 7 is ascribed to the greater porosity at shallow depths fig 8a and to preferential flow of tracers along the larger open fractures fig 8b the scale of this divergence will depend on the degree of the preferential fracture enlargement at shallow depths and on the nature and extent of channelling of flow along fractures with weathering being a major factor in channelling worthington et al 2016 for instance minimal divergence between specific yield and effective porosity over a timescale scale of three days was found at a site in palaeozoic limestones and dolostones where aquifer properties were determined from a pumping test borehole imaging flowmeter testing tracer testing and groundwater modelling worthington et al 2012 substantial differences from the results shown in fig 8 are also expected at the upper end of the timescale due to variations in porosity and permeability for instance the geometric mean total porosity for crystalline rocks is 0 013 which is more than an order of magnitude lower that the 0 39 value for the chalk wolff 1982 however these rocks may have extremely low fracture porosities and so still have large diffusion retardation factors zuber et al 2011 such contrasting properties in different lithologies are unlikely to change the overall pattern of substantial increases in both specific yield and effective porosity in bedrock aquifers as a function of storage test timescale furthermore substantial dual porosity effects may also be found in unconsolidated sediments due to facies variation for instance tracer tests in sand and gravel aquifers suggest that the effective porosity for transport is usually 0 02 0 1 payne et al 2008 these values are much less that typical total porosities of 0 3 0 4 and hence suggest diffusion retardation factors of 3 20 these values are much smaller than the values in bedrock section 5 3 but they do show the ubiquity of preferential flow in aquifers 6 conclusions we investigated storage properties in the chalk aquifer in east hampshire uk hydraulic conductivity determinations from pumping tests and from model calibration together with flowmeter data and visual logs enabled fracture apertures and fracture porosity to be calculated then effective porosity was calculated from tracer tests and from changes in electrical conductivity turbidity and nitrate the effective porosity results between 0 0001 and 0 001 coincided with the fracture porosity calculations showing that aquifer responses to stresses in the short term of hours to days are dominated by the low porosity fracture network this contrasts with results from environmental tracers and from calculated matrix porosity residence times which give groundwater ages of 30 80 years for the matrix porosity of 0 39 table 3 specific yield was determined from pumping tests numerical models changes in water table elevation following rain and from streamflow recessions specific yield was found to vary from 0 01 for pumping tests lasting less than a month to higher values for longer term tests table 2 both effective porosity and specific yield were found to vary as a function of the timescale of the testing method fig 7 the contrasting responses are readily explained by dual porosity behaviour interconnected networks of fractures have high permeability but low porosity and so exhibit rapid responses to hydraulic stresses such as recharge events or pumping tests the matrix has a low permeability but a high porosity and so it responds much more slowly however its large storage capacity can result in persistence of contamination for decades e g cook et al 2012 these contrasting properties together with solute exchange by diffusion between the matrix and the fractures result in the large range of values in effective porosity and specific yield observed in the chalk flowmeter logs measured groundwater velocities from tracers a high incidence of bacterial contamination and high diffusion retardation factors all suggest that a majority of bedrock aquifers in all lithologies have preferential flow through fracture networks consequently the transient nature of both effective porosity and specific yield that has been demonstrated here for the unconfined chalk aquifer is likely to be broadly representative of most unconfined bedrock aquifers credit authorship contribution statement stephen r h worthington conceptualization writing original draft aidan e foley

6182,flash floods are among the most disastrous natural hazards worldwide because of their rapid onset that limits effective emergency response and management understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of flash floods can help emergency managers and stakeholders in devising solutions to mitigate the associated risks and damages in this study a data driven approach is employed to characterize flash flood hazard across the contiguous united states conus the national weather service nws storm events database is utilized and a total of 74 814 flash flood events are assessed during 1996 2017 the frequency duration property damages and fatalities of flash floods are investigated across spatial domains i e county state regional and entire conus and multiple temporal scales i e annual seasonal monthly and diurnal results indicate that flash flood frequency has slightly increased over the conus in the past 22 years and the property damages have substantially raised flash floods are found to be more frequent in summer and less frequent but longer in winter our analyses indicate distinct regional patterns for duration of median versus extreme flash floods in addition the diurnal distribution of flash floods indicate that they are more likely to initiate in the evening and terminate around midnight the average duration of flash floods in the past 22 years has been about 3 5 h yet in some rare cases they persisted for about two days the findings of this study can shed light on flash flood hazard across the conus which can be useful for mitigating flash flood risks keywords flash flood conus hazard damage casualty 1 introduction floods are among major climate related disasters that have caused the largest portion of insured losses among all natural catastrophes in recent decades berghuijs et al 2016 kousky and michel kerjan 2017 slater and villarini 2016 floods are known to be the costliest natural disaster and they affect the most number of people worldwide kousky 2018 miller et al 2008 ashley and ashley 2008 identified floods as the second deadliest of all weather related hazards in the united states according to the u s natural hazard statistics national weather service 2019 flooding caused the highest weather related mortality in 2015 2016 and 2017 187 126 and 136 fatalities respectively the global economic damages of floods between 1980 and 2013 exceeded 1 trillion 2013 value and floods killed over 220 000 people in that period winsemius et al 2016 the cost of floods across the globe was estimated to be more than 50 billion in 2013 alone wasko and sharma 2017 and in 2016 the damages increased to about 60 billion aerts et al 2018 flooding can be classified into three primary categories of flash flooding riverine fluvial flooding and coastal flooding ashley and ashley 2008 flash flood is defined as a sudden flood in a relatively small catchment area usually less than 1000 km2 that happens within 6 h of heavy rainfall onset calianno et al 2013 llasat et al 2016 flash floods are mainly caused by intense rainfall and they can be extremely dangerous to property infrastructure and human lives since they can happen with little or no warning hardy et al 2016 yin et al 2016 the rapid onset of flash floods makes flood risk management a challenge and restricts the opportunity for timely communication and decision making which in turn results in abundant damages and casualties creutin et al 2013 lutoff et al 2016 therefore flash floods are known to be the most dangerous types of flooding gourley et al 2017 schroeder et al 2016 terti et al 2017 notably understanding the spatial and temporal patterns associated with flash flooding is essential from both scientific and operational perspectives despite the advances in flash flood detection forecasting and warning systems the flash flood impacts and damages have increased over the past decades morss et al 2016 several studies have employed advanced data assimilation methods to improve the streamflow forecast skills mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 sinha et al 2014 nevertheless the rising damages of flash floods is a consequence of several factors including increasing exposure i e population growth in flood prone regions urbanization and climate change hinkel et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 koks et al 2015 muis et al 2015 visser et al 2014 the global exposure to floods is estimated to increase by a factor of three by 2050 alfieri et al 2016 jongman et al 2014 in addition multitude of studies have discussed that climate change will aggravate flood risk arnell and gosling 2016 dottori et al 2018 janssen et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2014 milly et al 2002 ward et al 2017 there is overwhelming consensus that climate change has increased and will continue to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2015 prein et al 2017 westra et al 2014 such an increase in extreme precipitation suggests greater likelihood of flash flood occurrence kvočka et al 2016 schroeder et al 2016 in addition global warming will alter snowmelt regimes in cold regions and it will disrupt the hydrological cycle both of which can substantially exacerbate flood risk blöschl et al 2017 coppola et al 2018 jennings et al 2018 previous flash flood studies can be classified into several general categories that have focused on assessing improving flash flood forecasting skill braud et al 2018 douinot et al 2016 edouard et al 2018 investigating the impact of climate or land use change on flash flood hazard jodar abellan et al 2019 kermanshah et al 2017 modeling flash flood vulnerability and or risk aroca jiménez et al 2018 de andrade and szlafsztein 2018 debortoli et al 2017

categories a few studies have proposed methodologic basis and techniques for post flood documentation gaume and borga 2008 marchi et al 2009 and there have been many post event analyses of particular flash flood events borga et al 2019 delrieu et al 2005 gaume et al 2004 segura beltrán et al 2016 the current study focuses on the latter two categories and the overarching goals of this paper are to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of flash flood characteristics across the contiguous united states conus and investigate the regional frequency duration timing and damages i e property damage as well as mortality and morbidity of flash floods a data driven approach is employed and about 75 000 flash flood events during 1996 2017 are analyzed a few studies have investigated flash flood characteristics in the u s saharia et al 2017 smith and smith 2015 most of which focused on one attribute of flash flood e g damage or had limited data and or study period calianno et al 2013 assessed 16 000 flash floods during 2006 2010 and studied processes and physical attributes involved in flash floods with a focus on 2007 oklahoma flooding similarly spitalar et al 2014 assessed 6 years of flash flooding 2007 2012 and solely focused on injuries and fatalities nonetheless a comprehensive analysis of flash floods across the conus that characterizes its attributes has been lacking the current study builds upon the previous analyses and benefits from a large database of observed flash flood events here we provide one of the most comprehensive spatiotemporal assessments of flash flood characteristics across the conus for a relatively long period the findings of this study can characterize regional flash flood hazards that can be useful for mitigating flash flood risks 2 data and methods a few initiatives have developed flash flood datasets at various regions across the globe in order to provide detailed information about flash flood events amponsah et al 2018 gourley et al 2013 a comprehensive flash flood database for the united states is the storm events database developed by the national weather service of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the criteria for categorizing a flood event as flash flooding in the storm events database are as follows a river rising in a few hours and flowing out of its banks threatening lives or property and demanding urgent response rapid runoff causing a person or vehicle sweeping away a short onset flooding that disrupts closes roads due to high water three feet of ponded water threatening life or property six inches of rapid flowing water over a road threatening life or property the storm events database provides detailed description of flash flood events as well as several other natural hazards such as the location start termination date and time property and crop damages injuries fatalities and event narrative for the period of 1996 present flash flood information is acquired from different sources including county state and federal emergency management officials local law enforcement officials damage surveys trained spotters insurance industry and the general public despite the limitations of the database and its biases and epistemic uncertainties the storm event database is yet the most complete dataset of flash floods in the u s which provides many details about the events and it has been utilized in several previous assessments of flash floods ashley and ashley 2008 sharif et al 2015 spitalar et al 2014 here we have employed the storm events database and acquired data for all the flash flood events that happened in the conus between jan 1 1996 to dec 31 2017 the data comprised of 74 814 flash flood events and we investigate different characteristics of flash floods including frequency duration and property damage at county state and regional levels as well as for the entire conus it is noteworthy that an individual storm can cause multiple flash flood events in different cities the database assigns episode id and event id to the flash floods and it also provides a narrative for the event causes for instance an extensive tropical storm or hurricane and its remnants may result in flash flooding in many cities at different times and for various durations with diverse property damages and casualties in this study we focus on flash flood events for the analyses various timescales are considered for different characteristics such as annual seasonal monthly and diurnal hourly the distribution of flash flood characteristics is assessed and the regional patterns are explored for each case in order to have consistent and comparable values for property damage the inflation rates for the past 22 years are considered and all the damage values are adjusted to the 2017 value for assessing the trends of flash flood characteristics the mann kendall trend test kendall 1948 which is a non parametric rank based test and independent of the statistical distribution of data has been used at 0 05 significance level to determine the significance of trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 flash flood damages and casualties fig 1 shows the annual timeseries of property damage a fatalities b and injuries c caused by flash floods across the conus during 1996 2017 the values for hurricane harvey in 2017 are explicitly shown with red color for a more clear visualization among about 75 000 analyzed flash flood events 29 567 events 40 caused property damage 876 event 1 2 caused fatalities and 484 events 0 6 caused injuries the total property damages caused by flash floods excluding the hurricane harvey during the study period is 37 3 billion whereas the flash flood property damages of hurricane harvey alone exceeded a staggering value of 38 3 billion hurricane harvey was an extremely rare event that occurred on august 2017 with total precipitation amounts exceeding 1000 mm during three days in some parts which indicated a return period of 1000 9000 years trenberth et al 2018 van olderborgh et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 it resulted in the most deaths too and it killed 55 people according to the storm events database as shown in fig 1b the mortality rate of hurricane harvey has been reported even higher in some other analyses e g 70 fatalities as reported by jonkman et al 2018 and 89 fatalities as reported by smith et al 2018 which is due to the selection criteria and the data source e g official reports or media sources nevertheless hurricane harvey was one of the most disastrous extreme events in the past decades and similar natural hazards have demonstrated to be devastating e g hurricane florence that made landfall in north carolina in september 2018 led to 53 fatalities and caused 16 40 billion damages paul et al 2019 studies have discussed that climate change will increase the likelihood of such extremely rare and disastrous events and therefore further attention and proactive disaster risk management strategies are required in that regard bouwer 2011 emanuel 2017 knutson et al 2010 considering the long term patterns a substantial increase is detected for the annual property damages associated with flash floods in the conus fig 1a such an increase in the property damage corroborates the findings of previous assessments ashley and ashley 2008 spitalar et al 2014 and it may be attributed to population increase urbanization raising vulnerabilities and or increasing extreme rainfalls hallegatte et al 2013 merz et al 2010 despite the long term significantly increasing trend of property damages p value 0 04 the inter annual climate variability seems to have substantial effect on the occurrence and impacts of flash floods for instance 2012 is found to be the year with minimum flash flood damages 415 million during the past 22 years notably 2012 was a la niña year in which the majority of the u s was severely impacted by widespread drought during may august and it caused about 12 billion damages hoerling et al 2014 paimazumder and done 2016 yan et al 2018 additionally 2012 indicates the lowest flash flood fatalities 14 deaths during 1996 2017 focusing on flash flood fatalities fig 1b a total of 1 399 people have been killed across the conus by flash floods in the past 22 years 64 deaths per year and 2015 is identified with the highest fatalities 148 deaths notwithstanding the advances in flash flood forecast and warning systems the number of fatalities has not decreased in the past decades we extracted the events that caused fatalities during the study period 868 events across the conus and the monthly distribution of fatalities are shown in supplementary fig s1 the figure shows that the fatalities are more frequent in spring and summer months mjjas which can be influenced by the higher frequency of flash floods in these months several studies have investigated flood fatalities and it has been discussed that vehicle related flood mortalities are among the highest causes of death due to flooding ashley and ashley 2008 terti et al 2017 the effectiveness of communication systems especially in rural areas and the perception of people from flood risk and inundated roads are identified as two major factors that require further improvement for mitigating flood fatalities becker et al 2015 shabou et al 2017 flash flood injuries fig 1c however indicate considerable decrease compared to previous decades the highest flash flooding injuries over the conus happened in 1998 shown in yellow in fig 1c the flash flood event was mainly caused by a pair of hurricanes that made landfall in texas on october 1998 i e hurricane madeline and hurricane lester which had extremely high rainfall intensity 18 7 in 475 mm within 24 h and caused the devastating 1998 texas flooding according to the storm events database the 1998 texas flash flood caused 4 320 injuries shown in yellow in fig 1c and 25 deaths the total number of flash flood events injuries and fatalities during 1996 2017 are extracted for each county and each state and the results are shown in fig 2 texas indicates the greatest number of flash flood events 10 785 events within the past 22 years which also had the highest injuries and fatalities overall southwestern u s arizona and southern california southern plains central texas oklahoma arkansas and missouri and parts of northeast new york and pennsylvania show the most frequent flash floods with highest casualties compared to other regions on the contrary flash floods are infrequent with limited impact in north and pacific northwest u s assessing the monthly distribution of flash flood property damages supplementary fig s2 the costliest flash floods generally occur in september and october which are during the atlantic hurricane season and most of the major tropical storms hit the u s in that period wang et al 2017 the pattern is especially more pronounced in the se region the flash floods in winter months indicate lower property damage despite having relatively longer duration in general the property damage caused by a natural hazard is a function of several dynamically intertwined factors and it can be explained to some extent by analyzing the risk as an integration of vulnerability hazard and exposure resiliency disaster management and adaptive capacity adger 2006 chen et al 2016 koks et al 2015 messner and meyer 2006 weinkle et al 2018 understanding these factors require detailed regional assessments and are out of the scope of this study which is primarily focused on flash flood hazard therefore we avoid generalized discussions about flash flood damages and researchers are encouraged to investigate the topic in more details and develop models for simulating and or predicting flash flood damages 3 2 frequency analysis fig 3 presents the number of flash flood events in different regions across the u s during 1996 2017 considering the annual flash flood frequency over the conus the bottom purple plot 3400 flash flood events occur in the conus each year on average the long term changes of flash flood frequency over the conus indicates a slightly increasing trend a non significant p val 0 1 linear trend of 39 events or 1 2 increase per year the w and sw regions indicate the highest significantly increasing trends among all regions 5 3 with p val 0 02 and 5 with p val 0 001 respectively the frequency of flash floods for w and sw regions are exclusively investigated in supplementary fig s3 which denotes that more flash floods have occurred in recent years in these two regions yet the seasonal pattern is somewhat unchanged fig 3 shows that the most and least number of flash flood events in conus occurred in 2015 4987 events and 2012 2521 events respectively and there is a twofold difference between the frequency of flash floods in these two years a fourfold difference in property damage according to fig 1a during 2012 2015 both the central c and south s regions had substantially lower higher frequency compared to their average 298 and 1230 events in c and 477 and 1950 events across s indicating almost a fourfold difference between the frequency of flash floods in these two regions between 2012 and 2015 the s and c regions indicate the highest number of flash floods across the conus an average of about 1000 and 800 events per year respectively the average number of flash flood events per year in each region is shown in the last plot of fig 3 the pnw and s regions have the lowest and highest flash flood frequency with 23 and 1000 events per year respectively apart from the temporal variations of flash flood frequency the regional intra annual patterns can be useful as well thus the number of flash flood events that happened in each month for each region is shown in fig 4 focusing on the conus results the last subplot shown in purple the late spring and summer months mjja indicate the highest frequency whereas the late fall and winter months ndjf show the lowest flash flood frequency the month with the highest number of flash flood events in pnw wnc enc and c is june whereas it is found to be july for the w sw and ne regions unlike the other regions where most flash floods happen in early summer the majority of flash floods in se happen in early fall i e september which is the peak time of the atlantic hurricane season when tropical storms are common to make landfall over the se region at that time klotzbach et al 2018 in addition since many flash floods events are caused by convective precipitation it is not surprising that the majority of flash floods occur in the warm season months the monthly patterns of fig 4 are in consensus with previous analyses of flash floods and mesoscale convective systems maddox et al 1979 schumacher and johnson 2006 fig 4 shows that fewer flash flood events happen in winter for the majority of conus regions for instance almost no flash floods have been observed in november december and january across pnw sw wnc and enc on the contrary a considerable number of flash flood events occurred during january and february in the w region which is quite different from the monthly pattern observed in the s region such a high frequency of cool season flash floods in the w region can be attributed to the seasonal pattern of atmospheric river landfalls which are more common in winter across the southwest u s mundhenk et al 2016 rutz et al 2014 atmospheric rivers ars are major contributors to california s water resources which provide 30 45 of all precipitation in central and north california dettinger et al 2011 gershunov et al 2017 however landfalling ars can cause some of the largest storms in california comparable to the hurricane belt of southeastern u s and they are primary meteorological factor in flood generation of the region guan et al 2016 konrad and dettinger 2017 lamjiri et al 2017 saharia et al 2017 found high frequency for cool season flash floods along the west coast and a bimodal character for arizona flash floods which are in agreement with the results of fig 4 the monthly patterns derived from fig 4 can be useful for flood risk management and disaster preparedness 3 3 duration analysis flash floods have a short onset generally occurring within 6 h after a heavy rainfall happens but not all of them are prolonged borga et al 2011 the protracted flash floods are generally more hazardous and usually impose higher damages schroeder et al 2016 spitalar et al 2014 the storm events database provides the beginning and end time for each flash flood event which are extracted for assessing the duration of flash floods the onset termination times refer to the times that flash flood initiated ended and not the rainfall timing in the case of major extreme flash flood events there might have been more than one peak for a single event and the flash flood duration in the database corresponds to the entire period of flooding the flash flood that occurred on 9 7 2011 in luzerne county pa event id 339708 is an example of such major events with more than one peak in this event the remnants of tropical storm lee moved northward from the appalachians and it interacted with a frontal system across the eastern ohio valley additionally moisture was drawn from hurricane katia which was moving northward off the east coast this complicated process caused 6 12 in of rainfall within two days consequently leading to massive flash floods that caused extensive damages in the region avila and stewart 2013 the distribution of flash flood duration in each month is shown in fig 5 focusing on the results of conus the last plot flash flood duration is found to be lower during summer and higher in winter therefore the monthly patterns of flash flood frequency and duration are almost in contrast to each other meaning that the months with fewer events are associated with prolonged floods and vice a versa it is noteworthy that such a broad brush conclusion is based on the overall patterns and there are numerous outliers in each month that fall outside the aforementioned pattern however the overall pattern which is consistent among all the regions is that flash floods are generally shorter in summer the median and mean flash flood duration of all 74 814 flash flood events in the past 22 years are 2 h and 3 5 h respectively and 90 of flash floods terminated in less than 7 h fig 6 indicates the regional differences of flash flood duration the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf of flash flood duration for each region is plotted in fig 6a and it clearly shows the differences of event durations at various percentiles for instance the lowest and highest values for median 50th percentile probability duration of flash floods are about 1 h in pnw and 3 h in enc respectively none of the regions owns the highest lowest duration at all percentiles and the order of regions is different in various probabilities fig 1b presents the boxplots of flash flood duration in each region which indicates that pnw and enc have the lowest and highest durations respectively such a pattern can be quite different when considering the duration of very rare events as shown in fig 6c for the 95th and 99th percentile flash flood durations in both the 95th and 99th percentile flash floods pnw indicates relatively high duration 12 h and 39 h respectively the lowest extreme duration of flash floods are observed in the sw region 6 h and 15 h for 95th and 99th percentiles respectively whereas both ne and enc indicate prolonged flash floods in the extreme cases fig 6 shows that median flash flood duration is about 2 3 h but flash floods may last for even up to 2 days in the extreme cases an example of a recent prolonged flash flood event happened on 8 13 2016 in wilkinson county ms event id 655992 which was caused by a slow moving low pressure system and brought several rounds of intense rainfall and thunderstorm to the region the two day accumulated rainfall exceeded 10 in in the region surpassing the 0 1 annual exceedance probability in some areas consequently causing widespread flash flooding that considerably damaged buildings public roads and bridges 3 4 seasonal analysis following the monthly patterns detected from frequency and duration analyses they are calculated at seasonal timescale and investigated for any patterns fig 7 shows the average number of flash flood events x axis mean duration of flash floods y axis and mean property damage for each season and across each conus region comparing the results of different seasons distinct patterns are found for summer jja and winter djf the scatter plot is aligned horizontally in summer and vertically in winter in other words summers are generally associated with more frequent flash floods and winters indicate prolonged events the highest mean property damage largest marker size is found for the ne region in fall in all seasons the s region stands at the farther right side of the other regions and it indicates the most frequent flash flooding fig 7 summarizes the findings of previous sections and provides a quick overview of the general characteristics of flash flooding in each region 3 5 diurnal analysis flash flood timing can have crucial effect on its succeeding impacts and consequences studies on flood fatalities have denoted that water inundation at peak hours can result in aggravated impacts especially during the evening that most people are returning home and may be tired and less patient ashley and ashley 2008 sharif et al 2015 terti et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to enhance public understanding and awareness of flood risks and improve preparedness to cope with probable impacts and reduce vulnerability to flash floods bodoque et al 2019 knocke and kolivras 2007 shabou et al 2017 the issue is of higher concern in the regions that flash floods are more likely to happen during rush hours leveraging a fairly large dataset of flash flood events the start and end time of all the flash floods are extracted and the diurnal distribution of flash flood onset and termination are shown in fig 8 in green and brown colors respectively a one hour bin size is utilized to generate histograms in all plots and the y axis range is consistent in all plots except for the pnw to compare contrast various regions in most cases the density of flash floods are higher during the evenings which makes them more likely to start in the evening during 15 00 to 20 00 local time and end at night during 18 00 to 23 00 local time such a pattern is more pronounced in western u s where extreme precipitation events are caused by afternoon destabilization processes whereas it is not much happening in the s and se regions that are affected by nocturnal nature of frontal systems maddox et al 1979 nonetheless there is a consensus among all regions that flash floods are less likely to start around noon besides the diurnal distribution of flash flood frequency the duration of flash floods are also assessed with respect to their start time and the results are shown in fig 9 flash flood duration of all the events are extracted and their diurnal distribution is developed for a 2 hour bin size focusing on the conus results the flash floods that start in the afternoon 14 00 18 00 local time are in general shorter than those that start around midnight 22 00 2 00 local time such a pattern is ubiquitous in most regions with varied ranges and diverse distributions prolonged flash floods can cause many disruptions in people s everyday life and identifying their diurnal frequency and duration can be helpful for implementing desirable adaptive measures considering the diurnal distribution of the property damages caused by flash floods shown in supplementary fig s4 it is found that the midnight floods generally cause higher property damages compared to the ones that happen in the afternoon which can be a result of prolonged duration or a consequent of unpreparedness and oversight 4 limitations and pathways forward this study assessed flash flood characteristics across the conus during the period of 1996 2017 it is noteworthy that we relied on the information of storm events database for the analyses and the conclusions are drawn accordingly although the data may be imperfect and there may be inherent uncertainties that can affect the accuracy of data the storm events database is yet one of the most reliable and comprehensive databases available for the u s and it has been utilized in several previous studies ashley and ashley 2008 calianno et al 2013 saharia et al 2017 spitalar et al 2014 the reported flash flood times in the database are not necessarily precise to the minutes and uncertainties are inevitable in flash flood timing since flooding stage can be different at various flood impacted areas thus assigning a particular time for onset and termination of flash floods will certainly raise uncertainties to restrict the ramifications of the timing uncertainties we mainly focused on the broad brush patterns of flash flood duration from a comparative viewpoint among various regions assuming that the uncertainties in reported durations are somewhat consistent and considering relatively coherent biases in the reported times of flash floods the patterns of flash flood duration and timing were compared for various regions the storm events database provides the flood causes only for the events after 2007 a total of 41 388 happened during the period of 2007 2017 and table 1 provides the number of flash floods in each category more than 99 of conus flash floods were caused by heavy rain either rain on burned area rain on snow tropical storm or general heavy rainfall in addition 111 flash floods were caused by dam levee failures although the ratio of flash floods caused by dam failure is small 0 27 it still causes an average of 10 flash floods per year 111 2017 2006 10 over the conus this can be due to the limitations in rainfall runoff forecast skill epistemic uncertainty management practices or insufficient storage capacity the non stationarities caused by anthropogenic climate and land cover changes may have also exacerbated the situation dams and levees are structures that are supposed to protect the built environment against natural disasters and it is useful to understand the causes and characteristics for such failures and improve upon them a critical characteristic of flood that affects the exposure of affected areas and subsequently the damages is the spatial extent of floods drainage basin and or inundated area which has not been investigated in this study inundation maps of flood events are generally simulated using integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic models or extracted from microwave remote sensing imageries at relatively small domains considering the slope land cover and many other factors which makes it place based and computationally expensive especially for urban flooding nonetheless understanding space time relations in flash floods and identifying the differences among various climate regions can be helpful for better discerning the associated damages and researchers are encouraged to assess the subject in more details the findings of the current study can help better characterize flood hazard which can be useful for simulating the risk and damages considering the severe damages caused by flash floods and their rapid onset it is essential to develop reliable damage prediction models that account for physical attributes as well as social vulnerabilities and management strategies chen et al 2016 due to the uncertain nature of flash floods probabilistic models that provide flood hazard and damages with varied likelihoods will be useful ahmadisharaf et al 2018 jafarzadegan and merwade 2019 terti et al 2019 moreover taking the climate change impacts into account can further improve the reliability of such a model in the non stationary nature of natural hazards liu et al 2014 moftakhari et al 2017 here we provided an overview of flash flood damages and we encourage further investigation of the linkage between flood damages several damage prediction analyses have been conducted for various natural hazards such as hurricanes burton 2010 kim et al 2016 van verseveld et al 2015 and coastal flooding baradaranshoraka et al 2019 de moel et al 2012 hinkel et al 2014 a rigorous modeling of flash flood damages can be helpful for implementing proactive risk management strategies this study highlighted the diurnal distribution of flash floods and the amplified frequency of evening floods especially across the western u s we encourage researchers to account for flood generating mechanisms berghuijs et al 2016 najibi et al 2017 schlef et al 2019 and investigate the nocturnal nature of western flooding in more details application of high resolution spatial and temporal sub daily observed precipitation datasets can be useful for this purpose hayatbini et al 2019 in addition assessing the increasing trend of flash flood frequency in southwestern u s and diagnosing the underlying climatic and atmospheric factors e g najibi and devineni 2018 can be useful for future planning and management the trends in the frequency of flash floods can correspond to a climatic or anthropogenic phenomenon or they may be artifacts due to the characteristics of the database e g evolving flash flood inventory rate or criteria or higher number of or more efficient reported events therefore studying trends of other flash flood characteristics or evaluating the accuracy of the details provided in the storm events database for each flash flood event can be useful too 5 summary and conclusion this study assessed flash flood hazard damages and fatalities across the contiguous united states a data driven approach was employed and about 75 000 flash flood events were investigated during the period of 1996 2017 various timescales of annual seasonal monthly and diurnal were considered in different analyses and the main findings are summarized as follows the number of flash flood events has slightly increased over the conus during the past 22 years about 1 increase in number of flash floods per year the increasing trend is significant in southwestern parts of the us the total property damages caused by flash floods over the conus indicate a significantly positive trend in the past 22 years hurricane harvey caused the highest property damages compared to other flash flood events texas oklahoma and arizona are the top flash flood prone states of the conus with frequent events and abundant casualties 2012 was the year with the lowest flash flood frequency and damages during the past 22 years it was a la niña year that widespread drought severely impacted majority of the u s flash floods are more frequent and shorter in summer jja whereas less frequent and more prolonged in winter djf in general flash flood duration is highest in the east north central enc region whereas lowest across the pacific northwest pnw flash floods are more likely to start in the evening and terminate at night meanwhile the flash floods starting in the afternoon are usually shorter than those

6182,flash floods are among the most disastrous natural hazards worldwide because of their rapid onset that limits effective emergency response and management understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of flash floods can help emergency managers and stakeholders in devising solutions to mitigate the associated risks and damages in this study a data driven approach is employed to characterize flash flood hazard across the contiguous united states conus the national weather service nws storm events database is utilized and a total of 74 814 flash flood events are assessed during 1996 2017 the frequency duration property damages and fatalities of flash floods are investigated across spatial domains i e county state regional and entire conus and multiple temporal scales i e annual seasonal monthly and diurnal results indicate that flash flood frequency has slightly increased over the conus in the past 22 years and the property damages have substantially raised flash floods are found to be more frequent in summer and less frequent but longer in winter our analyses indicate distinct regional patterns for duration of median versus extreme flash floods in addition the diurnal distribution of flash floods indicate that they are more likely to initiate in the evening and terminate around midnight the average duration of flash floods in the past 22 years has been about 3 5 h yet in some rare cases they persisted for about two days the findings of this study can shed light on flash flood hazard across the conus which can be useful for mitigating flash flood risks keywords flash flood conus hazard damage casualty 1 introduction floods are among major climate related disasters that have caused the largest portion of insured losses among all natural catastrophes in recent decades berghuijs et al 2016 kousky and michel kerjan 2017 slater and villarini 2016 floods are known to be the costliest natural disaster and they affect the most number of people worldwide kousky 2018 miller et al 2008 ashley and ashley 2008 identified floods as the second deadliest of all weather related hazards in the united states according to the u s natural hazard statistics national weather service 2019 flooding caused the highest weather related mortality in 2015 2016 and 2017 187 126 and 136 fatalities respectively the global economic damages of floods between 1980 and 2013 exceeded 1 trillion 2013 value and floods killed over 220 000 people in that period winsemius et al 2016 the cost of floods across the globe was estimated to be more than 50 billion in 2013 alone wasko and sharma 2017 and in 2016 the damages increased to about 60 billion aerts et al 2018 flooding can be classified into three primary categories of flash flooding riverine fluvial flooding and coastal flooding ashley and ashley 2008 flash flood is defined as a sudden flood in a relatively small catchment area usually less than 1000 km2 that happens within 6 h of heavy rainfall onset calianno et al 2013 llasat et al 2016 flash floods are mainly caused by intense rainfall and they can be extremely dangerous to property infrastructure and human lives since they can happen with little or no warning hardy et al 2016 yin et al 2016 the rapid onset of flash floods makes flood risk management a challenge and restricts the opportunity for timely communication and decision making which in turn results in abundant damages and casualties creutin et al 2013 lutoff et al 2016 therefore flash floods are known to be the most dangerous types of flooding gourley et al 2017 schroeder et al 2016 terti et al 2017 notably understanding the spatial and temporal patterns associated with flash flooding is essential from both scientific and operational perspectives despite the advances in flash flood detection forecasting and warning systems the flash flood impacts and damages have increased over the past decades morss et al 2016 several studies have employed advanced data assimilation methods to improve the streamflow forecast skills mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 sinha et al 2014 nevertheless the rising damages of flash floods is a consequence of several factors including increasing exposure i e population growth in flood prone regions urbanization and climate change hinkel et al 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 koks et al 2015 muis et al 2015 visser et al 2014 the global exposure to floods is estimated to increase by a factor of three by 2050 alfieri et al 2016 jongman et al 2014 in addition multitude of studies have discussed that climate change will aggravate flood risk arnell and gosling 2016 dottori et al 2018 janssen et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2014 milly et al 2002 ward et al 2017 there is overwhelming consensus that climate change has increased and will continue to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2015 prein et al 2017 westra et al 2014 such an increase in extreme precipitation suggests greater likelihood of flash flood occurrence kvočka et al 2016 schroeder et al 2016 in addition global warming will alter snowmelt regimes in cold regions and it will disrupt the hydrological cycle both of which can substantially exacerbate flood risk blöschl et al 2017 coppola et al 2018 jennings et al 2018 previous flash flood studies can be classified into several general categories that have focused on assessing improving flash flood forecasting skill braud et al 2018 douinot et al 2016 edouard et al 2018 investigating the impact of climate or land use change

categories a few studies have proposed methodologic basis and techniques for post flood documentation gaume and borga 2008 marchi et al 2009 and there have been many post event analyses of particular flash flood events borga et al 2019 delrieu et al 2005 gaume et al 2004 segura beltrán et al 2016 the current study focuses on the latter two categories and the overarching goals of this paper are to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of flash flood characteristics across the contiguous united states conus and investigate the regional frequency duration timing and damages i e property damage as well as mortality and morbidity of flash floods a data driven approach is employed and about 75 000 flash flood events during 1996 2017 are analyzed a few studies have investigated flash flood characteristics in the u s saharia et al 2017 smith and smith 2015 most of which focused on one attribute of flash flood e g damage or had limited data and or study period calianno et al 2013 assessed 16 000 flash floods during 2006 2010 and studied processes and physical attributes involved in flash floods with a focus on 2007 oklahoma flooding similarly spitalar et al 2014 assessed 6 years of flash flooding 2007 2012 and solely focused on injuries and fatalities nonetheless a comprehensive analysis of flash floods across the conus that characterizes its attributes has been lacking the current study builds upon the previous analyses and benefits from a large database of observed flash flood events here we provide one of the most comprehensive spatiotemporal assessments of flash flood characteristics across the conus for a relatively long period the findings of this study can characterize regional flash flood hazards that can be useful for mitigating flash flood risks 2 data and methods a few initiatives have developed flash flood datasets at various regions across the globe in order to provide detailed information about flash flood events amponsah et al 2018 gourley et al 2013 a comprehensive flash flood database for the united states is the storm events database developed by the national weather service of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the criteria for categorizing a flood event as flash flooding in the storm events database are as follows a river rising in a few hours and flowing out of its banks threatening lives or property and demanding urgent response rapid runoff causing a person or vehicle sweeping away a short onset flooding that disrupts closes roads due to high water three feet of ponded water threatening life or property six inches of rapid flowing water over a road threatening life or property the storm events database provides detailed description of flash flood events as well as several other natural hazards such as the location start termination date and time property and crop damages injuries fatalities and event narrative for the period of 1996 present flash flood information is acquired from different sources including county state and federal emergency management officials local law enforcement officials damage surveys trained spotters insurance industry and the general public despite the limitations of the database and its biases and epistemic uncertainties the storm event database is yet the most complete dataset of flash floods in the u s which provides many details about the events and it has been utilized in several previous assessments of flash floods ashley and ashley 2008 sharif et al 2015 spitalar et al 2014 here we have employed the storm events database and acquired data for all the flash flood events that happened in the conus between jan 1 1996 to dec 31 2017 the data comprised of 74 814 flash flood events and we investigate different characteristics of flash floods including frequency duration and property damage at county state and regional levels as well as for the entire conus it is noteworthy that an individual storm can cause multiple flash flood events in different cities the database assigns episode id and event id to the flash floods and it also provides a narrative for the event causes for instance an extensive tropical storm or hurricane and its remnants may result in flash flooding in many cities at different times and for various durations with diverse property damages and casualties in this study we focus on flash flood events for the analyses various timescales are considered for different characteristics such as annual seasonal monthly and diurnal hourly the distribution of flash flood characteristics is assessed and the regional patterns are explored for each case in order to have consistent and comparable values for property damage the inflation rates for the past 22 years are considered and all the damage values are adjusted to the 2017 value for assessing the trends of flash flood characteristics the mann kendall trend test kendall 1948 which is a non parametric rank based test and independent of the statistical distribution of data has been used at 0 05 significance level to determine the significance of trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 flash flood damages and casualties fig 1 shows the annual timeseries of property damage a fatalities b and injuries c caused by flash floods across the conus during 1996 2017 the values for hurricane harvey in 2017 are explicitly shown with red color for a more clear visualization among about 75 000 analyzed flash flood events 29 567 events 40 caused property damage 876 event 1 2 caused fatalities and 484 events 0 6 caused injuries the total property damages caused by flash floods excluding the hurricane harvey during the study period is 37 3 billion whereas the flash flood property damages of hurricane harvey alone exceeded a staggering value of 38 3 billion hurricane harvey was an extremely rare event that occurred on august 2017 with total precipitation amounts exceeding 1000 mm during three days in some parts which indicated a return period of 1000 9000 years trenberth et al 2018 van olderborgh et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 it resulted in the most deaths too and it killed 55 people according to the storm events database as shown in fig 1b the mortality rate of hurricane harvey has been reported even higher in some other analyses e g 70 fatalities as reported by jonkman et al 2018 and 89 fatalities as reported by smith et al 2018 which is due to the selection criteria and the data source e g official reports or media sources nevertheless hurricane harvey was one of the most disastrous extreme events in the past decades and similar natural hazards have demonstrated to be devastating e g hurricane florence that made landfall in north carolina in september 2018 led to 53 fatalities and caused 16 40 billion damages paul et al 2019 studies have discussed that climate change will increase the likelihood of such extremely rare and disastrous events and therefore further attention and proactive disaster risk management strategies are required in that regard bouwer 2011 emanuel 2017 knutson et al 2010 considering the long term patterns a substantial increase is detected for the annual property damages associated with flash floods in the conus fig 1a such an increase in the property damage corroborates the findings of previous assessments ashley and ashley 2008 spitalar et al 2014 and it may be attributed to population increase urbanization raising vulnerabilities and or increasing extreme rainfalls hallegatte et al 2013 merz et al 2010 despite the long term significantly increasing trend of property damages p value 0 04 the inter annual climate variability seems to have substantial effect on the occurrence and impacts of flash floods for instance 2012 is found to be the year with minimum flash flood damages 415 million during the past 22 years notably 2012 was a la niña year in which the majority of the u s was severely impacted by widespread drought during may august and it caused about 12 billion damages hoerling et al 2014 paimazumder and done 2016 yan et al 2018 additionally 2012 indicates the lowest flash flood fatalities 14 deaths during 1996 2017 focusing on flash flood fatalities fig 1b a total of 1 399 people have been killed across the conus by flash floods in the past 22 years 64 deaths per year and 2015 is identified with the highest fatalities 148 deaths notwithstanding the advances in flash flood forecast and warning systems the number of fatalities has not decreased in the past decades we extracted the events that caused fatalities during the study period 868 events across the conus and the monthly distribution of fatalities are shown in supplementary fig s1 the figure shows that the fatalities are more frequent in spring and summer months mjjas which can be influenced by the higher frequency of flash floods in these months several studies have investigated flood fatalities and it has been discussed that vehicle related flood mortalities are among the highest causes of death due to flooding ashley and ashley 2008 terti et al 2017 the effectiveness of communication systems especially in rural areas and the perception of people from flood risk and inundated roads are identified as two major factors that require further improvement for mitigating flood fatalities becker et al 2015 shabou et al 2017 flash flood injuries fig 1c however indicate considerable decrease compared to previous decades the highest flash flooding injuries over the conus happened in 1998 shown in yellow in fig 1c the flash flood event was mainly caused by a pair of hurricanes that made landfall in texas on october 1998 i e hurricane madeline and hurricane lester which had extremely high rainfall intensity 18 7 in 475 mm within 24 h and caused the devastating 1998 texas flooding according to the storm events database the 1998 texas flash flood caused 4 320 injuries shown in yellow in fig 1c and 25 deaths the total number of flash flood events injuries and fatalities during 1996 2017 are extracted for each county and each state and the results are shown in fig 2 texas indicates the greatest number of flash flood events 10 785 events within the past 22 years which also had the highest injuries and fatalities overall southwestern u s arizona and southern california southern plains central texas oklahoma arkansas and missouri and parts of northeast new york and pennsylvania show the most frequent flash floods with highest casualties compared to other regions on the contrary flash floods are infrequent with limited impact in north and pacific northwest u s assessing the monthly distribution of flash flood property damages supplementary fig s2 the costliest flash floods generally occur in september and october which are during the atlantic hurricane season and most of the major tropical storms hit the u s in that period wang et al 2017 the pattern is especially more pronounced in the se region the flash floods in winter months indicate lower property damage despite having relatively longer duration in general the property damage caused by a natural hazard is a function of several dynamically intertwined factors and it can be explained to some extent by analyzing the risk as an integration of vulnerability hazard and exposure resiliency disaster management and adaptive capacity adger 2006 chen et al 2016 koks et al 2015 messner and meyer 2006 weinkle et al 2018 understanding these factors require detailed regional assessments and are out of the scope of this study which is primarily focused on flash flood hazard therefore we avoid generalized discussions about flash flood damages and researchers are encouraged to investigate the topic in more details and develop models for simulating and or predicting flash flood damages 3 2 frequency analysis fig 3 presents the number of flash flood events in different regions across the u s during 1996 2017 considering the annual flash flood frequency over the conus the bottom purple plot 3400 flash flood events occur in the conus each year on average the long term changes of flash flood frequency over the conus indicates a slightly increasing trend a non significant p val 0 1 linear trend of 39 events or 1 2 increase per year the w and sw regions indicate the highest significantly increasing trends among all regions 5 3 with p val 0 02 and 5 with p val 0 001 respectively the frequency of flash floods for w and sw regions are exclusively investigated in supplementary fig s3 which denotes that more flash floods have occurred in recent years in these two regions yet the seasonal pattern is somewhat unchanged fig 3 shows that the most and least number of flash flood events in conus occurred in 2015 4987 events and 2012 2521 events respectively and there is a twofold difference between the frequency of flash floods in these two years a fourfold difference in property damage according to fig 1a during 2012 2015 both the central c and south s regions had substantially lower higher frequency compared to their average 298 and 1230 events in c and 477 and 1950 events across s indicating almost a fourfold difference between the frequency of flash floods in these two regions between 2012 and 2015 the s and c regions indicate the highest number of flash floods across the conus an average of about 1000 and 800 events per year respectively the average number of flash flood events per year in each region is shown in the last plot of fig 3 the pnw and s regions have the lowest and highest flash flood frequency with 23 and 1000 events per year respectively apart from the temporal variations of flash flood frequency the regional intra annual patterns can be useful as well thus the number of flash flood events that happened in each month for each region is shown in fig 4 focusing on the conus results the last subplot shown in purple the late spring and summer months mjja indicate the highest frequency whereas the late fall and winter months ndjf show the lowest flash flood frequency the month with the highest number of flash flood events in pnw wnc enc and c is june whereas it is found to be july for the w sw and ne regions unlike the other regions where most flash floods happen in early summer the majority of flash floods in se happen in early fall i e september which is the peak time of the atlantic hurricane season when tropical storms are common to make landfall over the se region at that time klotzbach et al 2018 in addition since many flash floods events are caused by convective precipitation it is not surprising that the majority of flash floods occur in the warm season months the monthly patterns of fig 4 are in consensus with previous analyses of flash floods and mesoscale convective systems maddox et al 1979 schumacher and johnson 2006 fig 4 shows that fewer flash flood events happen in winter for the majority of conus regions for instance almost no flash floods have been observed in november december and january across pnw sw wnc and enc on the contrary a considerable number of flash flood events occurred during january and february in the w region which is quite different from the monthly pattern observed in the s region such a high frequency of cool season flash floods in the w region can be attributed to the seasonal pattern of atmospheric river landfalls which are more common in winter across the southwest u s mundhenk et al 2016 rutz et al 2014 atmospheric rivers ars are major contributors to california s water resources which provide 30 45 of all precipitation in central and north california dettinger et al 2011 gershunov et al 2017 however landfalling ars can cause some of the largest storms in california comparable to the hurricane belt of southeastern u s and they are primary meteorological factor in flood generation of the region guan et al 2016 konrad and dettinger 2017 lamjiri et al 2017 saharia et al 2017 found high frequency for cool season flash floods along the west coast and a bimodal character for arizona flash floods which are in agreement with the results of fig 4 the monthly patterns derived from fig 4 can be useful for flood risk management and disaster preparedness 3 3 duration analysis flash floods have a short onset generally occurring within 6 h after a heavy rainfall happens but not all of them are prolonged borga et al 2011 the protracted flash floods are generally more hazardous and usually impose higher damages schroeder et al 2016 spitalar et al 2014 the storm events database provides the beginning and end time for each flash flood event which are extracted for assessing the duration of flash floods the onset termination times refer to the times that flash flood initiated ended and not the rainfall timing in the case of major extreme flash flood events there might have been more than one peak for a single event and the flash flood duration in the database corresponds to the entire period of flooding the flash flood that occurred on 9 7 2011 in luzerne county pa event id 339708 is an example of such major events with more than one peak in this event the remnants of tropical storm lee moved northward from the appalachians and it interacted with a frontal system across the eastern ohio valley additionally moisture was drawn from hurricane katia which was moving northward off the east coast this complicated process caused 6 12 in of rainfall within two days consequently leading to massive flash floods that caused extensive damages in the region avila and stewart 2013 the distribution of flash flood duration in each month is shown in fig 5 focusing on the results of conus the last plot flash flood duration is found to be lower during summer and higher in winter therefore the monthly patterns of flash flood frequency and duration are almost in contrast to each other meaning that the months with fewer events are associated with prolonged floods and vice a versa it is noteworthy that such a broad brush conclusion is based on the overall patterns and there are numerous outliers in each month that fall outside the aforementioned pattern however the overall pattern which is consistent among all the regions is that flash floods are generally shorter in summer the median and mean flash flood duration of all 74 814 flash flood events in the past 22 years are 2 h and 3 5 h respectively and 90 of flash floods terminated in less than 7 h fig 6 indicates the regional differences of flash flood duration the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf of flash flood duration for each region is plotted in fig 6a and it clearly shows the differences of event durations at various percentiles for instance the lowest and highest values for median 50th percentile probability duration of flash floods are about 1 h in pnw and 3 h in enc respectively none of the regions owns the highest lowest duration at all percentiles and the order of regions is different in various probabilities fig 1b presents the boxplots of flash flood duration in each region which indicates that pnw and enc have the lowest and highest durations respectively such a pattern can be quite different when considering the duration of very rare events as shown in fig 6c for the 95th and 99th percentile flash flood durations in both the 95th and 99th percentile flash floods pnw indicates relatively high duration 12 h and 39 h respectively the lowest extreme duration of flash floods are observed in the sw region 6 h and 15 h for 95th and 99th percentiles respectively whereas both ne and enc indicate prolonged flash floods in the extreme cases fig 6 shows that median flash flood duration is about 2 3 h but flash floods may last for even up to 2 days in the extreme cases an example of a recent prolonged flash flood event happened on 8 13 2016 in wilkinson county ms event id 655992 which was caused by a slow moving low pressure system and brought several rounds of intense rainfall and thunderstorm to the region the two day accumulated rainfall exceeded 10 in in the region surpassing the 0 1 annual exceedance probability in some areas consequently causing widespread flash flooding that considerably damaged buildings public roads and bridges 3 4 seasonal analysis following the monthly patterns detected from frequency and duration analyses they are calculated at seasonal timescale and investigated for any patterns fig 7 shows the average number of flash flood events x axis mean duration of flash floods y axis and mean property damage for each season and across each conus region comparing the results of different seasons distinct patterns are found for summer jja and winter djf the scatter plot is aligned horizontally in summer and vertically in winter in other words summers are generally associated with more frequent flash floods and winters indicate prolonged events the highest mean property damage largest marker size is found for the ne region in fall in all seasons the s region stands at the farther right side of the other regions and it indicates the most frequent flash flooding fig 7 summarizes the findings of previous sections and provides a quick overview of the general characteristics of flash flooding in each region 3 5 diurnal analysis flash flood timing can have crucial effect on its succeeding impacts and consequences studies on flood fatalities have denoted that water inundation at peak hours can result in aggravated impacts especially during the evening that most people are returning home and may be tired and less patient ashley and ashley 2008 sharif et al 2015 terti et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to enhance public understanding and awareness of flood risks and improve preparedness to cope with probable impacts and reduce vulnerability to flash floods bodoque et al 2019 knocke and kolivras 2007 shabou et al 2017 the issue is of higher concern in the regions that flash floods are more likely to happen during rush hours leveraging a fairly large dataset of flash flood events the start and end time of all the flash floods are extracted and the diurnal distribution of flash flood onset and termination are shown in fig 8 in green and brown colors respectively a one hour bin size is utilized to generate histograms in all plots and the y axis range is consistent in all plots except for the pnw to compare contrast various regions in most cases the density of flash floods are higher during the evenings which makes them more likely to start in the evening during 15 00 to 20 00 local time and end at night during 18 00 to 23 00 local time such a pattern is more pronounced in western u s where extreme precipitation events are caused by afternoon destabilization processes whereas it is not much happening in the s and se regions that are affected by nocturnal nature of frontal systems maddox et al 1979 nonetheless there is a consensus among all regions that flash floods are less likely to start around noon besides the diurnal distribution of flash flood frequency the duration of flash floods are also assessed with respect to their start time and the results are shown in fig 9 flash flood duration of all the events are extracted and their diurnal distribution is developed for a 2 hour bin size focusing on the conus results the flash floods that start in the afternoon 14 00 18 00 local time are in general shorter than those that start around midnight 22 00 2 00 local time such a pattern is ubiquitous in most regions with varied ranges and diverse distributions prolonged flash floods can cause many disruptions in people s everyday life and identifying their diurnal frequency and duration can be helpful for implementing desirable adaptive measures considering the diurnal distribution of the property damages caused by flash floods shown in supplementary fig s4 it is found that the midnight floods generally cause higher property damages compared to the ones that happen in the afternoon which can be a result of prolonged duration or a consequent of unpreparedness and oversight 4 limitations and pathways forward this study assessed flash flood characteristics across the conus during the period of 1996 2017 it is noteworthy that we relied on the information of storm events database for the analyses and the conclusions are drawn accordingly although the data may be imperfect and there may be inherent uncertainties that can affect the accuracy of data the storm events database is yet one of the most reliable and comprehensive databases available for the u s and it has been utilized in several previous studies ashley and ashley 2008 calianno et al 2013 saharia et al 2017 spitalar et al 2014 the reported flash flood times in the database are not necessarily precise to the minutes and uncertainties are inevitable in flash flood timing since flooding stage can be different at various flood impacted areas thus assigning a particular time for onset and termination of flash floods will certainly raise uncertainties to restrict the ramifications of the timing uncertainties we mainly focused on the broad brush patterns of flash flood duration from a comparative viewpoint among various regions assuming that the uncertainties in reported durations are somewhat consistent and considering relatively coherent biases in the reported times of flash floods the patterns of flash flood duration and timing were compared for various regions the storm events database provides the flood causes only for the events after 2007 a total of 41 388 happened during the period of 2007 2017 and table 1 provides the number of flash floods in each category more than 99 of conus flash floods were caused by heavy rain either rain on burned area rain on snow tropical storm or general heavy rainfall in addition 111 flash floods were caused by dam levee failures although the ratio of flash floods caused by dam failure is small 0 27 it still causes an average of 10 flash floods per year 111 2017 2006 10 over the conus this can be due to the limitations in rainfall runoff forecast skill epistemic uncertainty management practices or insufficient storage capacity the non stationarities caused by anthropogenic climate and land cover changes may have also exacerbated the situation dams and levees are structures that are supposed to protect the built environment against natural disasters and it is useful to understand the causes and characteristics for such failures and improve upon them a critical characteristic of flood that affects the exposure of affected areas and subsequently the damages is the spatial extent of floods drainage basin and or inundated area which has not been investigated in this study inundation maps of flood events are generally simulated using integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic models or extracted from microwave remote sensing imageries at relatively small domains considering the slope land cover and many other factors which makes it place based and computationally expensive especially for urban flooding nonetheless understanding space time relations in flash floods and identifying the differences among various climate regions can be helpful for better discerning the associated damages and researchers are encouraged to assess the subject in more details the findings of the current study can help better characterize flood hazard which can be useful for simulating the risk and damages considering the severe damages caused by flash floods and their rapid onset it is essential to develop reliable damage prediction models that account for physical attributes as well as social vulnerabilities and management strategies chen et al 2016 due to the uncertain nature of flash floods probabilistic models that provide flood hazard and damages with varied likelihoods will be useful ahmadisharaf et al 2018 jafarzadegan and merwade 2019 terti et al 2019 moreover taking the climate change impacts into account can further improve the reliability of such a model in the non stationary nature of natural hazards liu et al 2014 moftakhari et al 2017 here we provided an overview of flash flood damages and we encourage further investigation of the linkage between flood damages several damage prediction analyses have been conducted for various natural hazards such as hurricanes burton 2010 kim et al 2016 van verseveld et al 2015 and coastal flooding baradaranshoraka et al 2019 de moel et al 2012 hinkel et al 2014 a rigorous modeling of flash flood damages can be helpful for implementing proactive risk management strategies this study highlighted the diurnal distribution of flash floods and the amplified frequency of evening floods especially across the western u s we encourage researchers to account for flood generating mechanisms berghuijs et al 2016 najibi et al 2017 schlef et al 2019 and investigate the nocturnal nature of western flooding in more details application of high resolution spatial and temporal sub daily observed precipitation datasets can be useful for this purpose hayatbini et al 2019 in addition assessing the increasing trend of flash flood frequency in southwestern u s and diagnosing the underlying climatic and atmospheric factors e g najibi and devineni 2018 can be useful for future planning and management the trends in the frequency of flash floods can correspond to a climatic or anthropogenic phenomenon or they may be artifacts due to the characteristics of the database e g evolving flash flood inventory rate or criteria or higher number of or more efficient reported events therefore studying trends of other flash flood characteristics or evaluating the accuracy of the details provided in the storm events database for each flash flood event can be useful too 5 summary and conclusion this study assessed flash flood hazard damages and fatalities across the contiguous united states a data driven approach was employed and about 75 000 flash flood events were investigated during the period of 1996 2017 various timescales of annual seasonal monthly and diurnal were considered in different analyses and the main findings are summarized as follows the number of flash flood events has slightly increased over the conus during the past 22 years about 1 increase in number of flash floods per year the increasing trend is significant in southwestern parts of the us the total property damages caused by flash floods over the conus indicate a significantly positive trend in the past 22 years hurricane harvey caused the highest property damages compared to other flash flood events texas oklahoma and arizona are the top flash flood prone states of the conus with frequent events and abundant casualties 2012 was the year with the lowest flash flood frequency and damages during the past 22 years it was a la niña year that widespread drought severely impacted majority of the u s flash floods are more frequent and shorter in summer jja whereas less frequent and more prolonged in winter djf in general flash flood duration is highest in the east north central enc region whereas lowest across the pacific northwest pnw flash floods are more likely to start in the evening and terminate at night meanwhile the flash floods starting in the afternoon are usually shorter than those

6183,understanding how much water should be left in rivers is a hot topic around the world here we proposed a decision making framework for ecological base flow of rivers considering the total economic value of economic service functions and ecological service functions of rivers system this framework mainly includes three key steps firstly we analyzed the ecological services functions of rivers system i e water used for the ecological base flow of rivers and economic service functions i e water used for economic sectors and explained their relationship secondly we calculate the economic values of economic service functions and ecological services functions of rivers system respectively finally we determined the recommended ecological base flow of rivers by reaching the maximum value in the change process of the total economic value of the ecological and economic services functions of rivers system we applied this framework to determine the river ecological base flow in the baoji section of weihe river which is the largest tributary of the yellow river northwest china the calculations results revealed that the recommended ecological base flow of rivers is 35 02 of the natural runoff in baoji section of weihe river this work can provide a valuable reference for decision making the ecological base flow of river in the water shortage area of northwest china keywords decision making ecological base flow service functions total economic value baoji section of weihe river water shortage area of northwest china 1 introduction rational allocation of ecological water use and economic water use has become one of the most challenging topics in today s society cheng and li 2018 pang et al 2013 water resources in rivers not only can promote socio economic development but also provide living environment for organic matter and a number of living organisms and maintain river ecological health and improve human living environment xu et al 2016a b c li and yue 2016 however the water resources are limited in the water shortage area of northwest china where demand and supply of water resources are highly contradictory jiang et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 deng et al 2006 due to rapid economic development and population growth and climate change huang et al 2017 the demand for water resources in economic water use departments has increased dramatically especially in the agricultural water use sector cheng and li 2018 nonetheless large amounts of water in the economic water use sector have severely squeezed ecological water use xu et al 2016a b c unbalanced development of ecological water and economic water uses would lead to the loss of basic ecological service functions of river ecosystems and the deterioration of the basic ecological environment of the basin yue et al 2018 cheng and li 2018 therefore rational allocation of ecological water use and economic water use is an important foundation for achieving sustainable development of economic and ecology surrounding the rivers in recent years some methods for estimating river ecological base flow have been developed which can be classified into four categories hydraulics hydrology habitat simulation and holistic tharme 2003 however since ecological base flow cannot bring direct economic benefits to the water resources owners some economic water use would not be used for basin ecological water conservation to maintain the basic ecological health of the river ecosystem pang et al 2013 and water resources owners ignore the ecological services functions of the ecological base flow of rivers these ecological services functions not only can bring direct economic benefits to people but also can improve the human living environment and promote the river healthy development of the basin ecological environment yue et al 2018 costanza et al 1998 first proposed the economic value of global ecosystem services functions which greatly promoted the quantitative research of the economic value of ecosystem services including the economic value of river ecosystem services xie and co workers combined it with the actual situation of china and established the equivalent factor method xie et al 2003 for estimating the economic value of ecosystem services functions in china 2008 in addition in recent years studies have quantitatively evaluated the economic value of ecosystem services generated by rivers system for example wilson and carpenter 1999 summarized the economic value of us freshwater ecosystem services and studied the economic value of the recreational function of the flow ecosystem loomis et al 2000 adopted the conditional value assessment method to assess the total economic value of the us platte river ecosystem services restoration water purification erosion control fishes and wildlife habitat leisure tourism functions elena et al 2014 applied spatial multi criteria analysis method to explore the environmental economic value of ecosystem services in the pellice river basin italy yue et al 2018 combined the definition and implication of river ecological base flow to analyze the ecological services functions of the river ecological base flow of rivers during the flood season and the non flood period and finally calculated the economic value of the ecological base flow in the five sections of the guanzhong section of weihe river although the quantitative studies on the economic value of ecological service function of the river ecological base flow of rivers enable us to understand their economic benefits and importance in our daily lives few evaluated the economic value of the ecological base flow for estimating the river ecological base flow to maintain the ecological service function of the ecological base of rivers and ensure the corresponding ecological and economic value we should consider the process of the dynamic change of the economic value of the ecological base flow of rivers for determining the ecological base flow of rivers based on the analysis of the ecological and economic service functions and its total economic value of rivers ecosystem we naturally propose a conceptual decision making model for the river ecological base flow which considers the total economic value of the ecosystem service functions of rivers by taking the typical water shortage area of northwest china baoji section of weihe river as an example we test the proposed model for decision making of the ecological base flow of rivers system the proposed model can estimate river ecological base flow and can promote ecological and economic development of rivers ecosystems 2 methods a conceptual decision making framework for ecological base flow of rivers which accounts for the economic value of the system service functions of rivers mainly includes three steps firstly we analyze and identify system services functions of rivers and divide the main system services functions of rivers into the economic service functions and ecological service functions secondly we estimate the total economic value of economic services functions and ecological services functions of rivers system respectively finally we determine an optimal ecological base flow which considers the dynamic change processes of the total economic value of ecosystem services functions of rivers in water shortage area of northwest china 2 1 service functions of rivers systems analysis according to the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 rivers ecosystem typically provides a variety of system services functions vermaat et al 2014 auerbach et al 2014 russi et al 2013 such as water supply food production hydro powder generation gas regulation climate change environment purification hydrological regulation soil maintenance replenish soil fertility biodiversity aesthetic landscape and culture gopal 2016 xie et al 2008 mea 2005 costanza et al 1998 water volume in the river directly affects the ecosystems service function of rivers gopal 2016 for instance low flow hinders the interactions between the channel and floodplain which reduces floodplain processes that regulate water quality and biodiversity and affects the recreational and cultural use of the rivers gopal 2016 water resources are scarce in water shortage area of northwest china where the gap between water supply and demand is sharply huge jiang et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 deng et al 2006 large amount of water resources consumed by the economic water use sectors led to rapid decline in residual water resources of rivers cheng and li 2018 lin and li 2013 which influenced the ecosystem services functions of rivers and caused the loss of the ecological services functions of rivers yue et al 2018 in order to prevent rivers from losing their basic ecological functions we should reduce the economic water use to maintain the water requirement of the ecological base flow of rivers and promote the basic functions of the ecological base flow cheng and li 2018 xue et al 2017 xue et al 2016 and in this paper we divide the ecosystem services functions of rivers into economic service functions water used for the economic water use sectors and ecological services functions water used for the ecological base flow of rivers see table 1 nonetheless the contradictory relationship exists between the economic services functions and ecological services functions of rivers gopal 2016 the specific change process as shown in fig 1 2 2 quantitative monetarizationof service functions of rivers systems 2 2 1 the economic value of ecological base flow of rivers based on the result reference method equivalent factor method xie et al 2008 xie et al 2003 we estimate the economic value of the ecological base flow of rivers as a product of the economic value coefficient of ecological base flow of rivers and the surface area of the ecological base flow of rivers given by 1 te v e s v

rivers obtained from xie et al 2008 xie et al 2003 among them the calculation process of water surface area of ecological base flow according to the geometric characteristics of river system we finally divided it into n sub river including n 1 cross section of rivers data are collected on each generalized sub rivers i and combined with the fitting curve of hydraulics relationship between the

relationship between the flow comes from the ith sub river and the water surface width of cross section of ith sub river 2 2 2 economic value of different economic water uses 2 2 2 1 economic value of

other water use expressed by 6 te v s e v i e v a e v o where tevs is the total economic value of different economic service functions of rivers system one hundred million yuan 2 2 3 the total economic value of service functions of rivers ecosystems the total economic value of economic service functions and ecological service functions of rivers system is the sum of the total economic value of economic service functions of rivers and the total economic value of ecological service functions of rivers i e 7 tev t e v e t e v s where tev is the total economic value of economic service functions and ecological service functions of rivers system one hundred million yuan 2 3 a conceptual decision making framework for ecological base flow of rivers recent studies have reported the economic value of the ecological base flow of rivers li and yue 2016 our results indicate that the economic value of the ecological base flow increases with the increase of amount of the ecological base flow of rivers the economic value of the unilateral ecological base flow would decrease with the increase of amount of the ecological base flow of rivers yue et al 2018 xu et al 2016a b c zhao 2015 hence the economic value of river ecological base flow demonstrates a nonlinear change with the increase of the ecological base flow of rivers meanwhile the increase degree would weaken with the increase of the ecological base flow of rivers yue et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 2 in section 2 1 we analyzed the contradictory relationship between the economic services functions and ecological services functions gopal 2016 i e the greater the water requirement of economic service functions water resource used for the economic sectors the smaller the water requirement of the ecological services functions water resources used for the ecological base flow of rivers therefore suppose the inflow of rivers is constant the change in the amount of water in any water use sectors economic water use or ecological water use would lead to the change in the amount of water in another water use sectors which would further cause the change in the total economic value of ecosystem services functions of rivers when the water requirement of economic services functions or ecological services functions of rivers reached a certain value the total economic value produced by ecosystem services functions of rivers would achieve the maximum value indicated by p point in fig 3 at this time the water demand of the ecological service functions of rivers would be the recommended ecological base flow of rivers see fig 3 similarly the change in water volume between the economic services function and ecological service functions of rivers would change the total economic value produced by the river ecosystem and the total economic value produced by river ecosystem also will be influenced by the unilateral economic value of the ecological and economic water use however the difference between the economic value of the unilateral river ecological base flow and the unilateral economic water use is substantial cheng 2017 li and yue 2016 and the economic value of the unilateral economic water used for different economic sectors also varies significantly it is possible to combine the above mentioned the principle of decisions making for river ecological base flow of rivers and the relationship between the unilateral economic water use and the economic value of the unilateral ecological base flow from there we can deduce that if the economic value of unilateral economic water use is always greater than the economic value of the unilateral river ecological base flow the total economic value generated by the rivers system is the economic value generated by all economic water use and the recommended ecological base flow of rivers at this time is 0 m3 s if the economic value of the unilateral economic water is always smaller than the economic value produced by the unilateral ecological base flow of rivers at this time the recommended river ecological base flow is the inflow of rivers indicated by o point in fig 3 the economic value of unilateral ecological base flow also will occur the complex situation the economic value of the unilateral ecological base flow of rivers will larger than and smaller than the the economic value of the unilateral economic water use in the change processes of the amount of the ecological base flow then the total economic value generated by river ecosystem would reach the maximum economic value produced by the river ecosystem when the ecological base flow of rivers reaches a certain value in such complex case the recommended ecological base flow would be the amount of the river ecological base flow indicated by q point in fig 3 3 research areas to determine the recommended ecological base flow that accounts for the total economic value of ecological and economic service functions of rivers system we perform a case study in the baoji section of the weihe river which is the largest tributary of the yellow river in water shortage area of northwest china the baoji section of the weihe river linjiacun weijiabao station is located at the middle and lower reaches of the weihe river and at the center of the shaanxi province see fig 4 the baoji section of the weihe river has a total length of 65 km and is relatively straight and geometrically shaped with a slight trapezoidal shape water resource in this section is primarily used for the agricultural irrigation use mainly diverting water at linjiacun and weijiabao hydrological station and two diversion hubs are present in the baojixia yuanshang irrigation districts and baojixia yuanxia irrigation districts respectively the baojixia yuanshang irrigation district includes a part of baoji and xianyang city see fig 4 this irrigation district covers an irrigation area of 128 thousand hm2 which receives an annual average of 608 million m3 of diverted water from weihe river and some more groundwater for irrigation use the typical crops are winter wheat and summer corn in baojixia yuanshang irrigation district cheng and li 2018 the main irrigation mode implemented in baojixia yuanshang irrigation district is the flood irrigation thus waste of water is relatively serious lin and li 2013 according to the water statistical yearbook of

irrigation area was 1 94 yuan kg by incorporating the actual situation of the baoji section of weihe river we use the modified economic table of ecosystem service also called the equivalent factors method xie et al 2008 to estimate the economic value coefficient of ecological base flow in the baoji section of weihe river refer to table 2 4 1 2 the water surface area of the ecological basic flow of rivers the study area is the baoji section of weihe river linjiacun weijibao hydrological station see fig 4 since this section of the river is relatively straight and has limited data we needed to generalize the baoji section of weihe river into a trapezoidal shape the length of this section is about 65 km xu et al 2016a b c applied the r2cross method to determine the flow and surface width

recommended ecological base flow of rivers we applied eqs 1 and 4 to quantify the economic value of economic service functions and ecological service functions of the baoji section of the weihe river based on eq 7 we estimated the total economic value of ecological service functions and economic services function of rivers and we could achieve the change process of the total economic value with the ratio of the water requirement of the different recommended ecological base flow and the runoff coming from weihe river in the 2010 year see fig 5 fig 5 shows that when the water used for the ecological service function of rivers reaches 35 02 of the natural inflow of baoji section of weihe river in 2010 year and the total economic value generated by the weihe river ecosystem reaches the

6183,understanding how much water should be left in rivers is a hot topic around the world here we proposed a decision making framework for ecological base flow of rivers considering the total economic value of economic service functions and ecological service functions of rivers system this framework mainly includes three key steps firstly we analyzed the ecological services functions of rivers system i e water used for the ecological base flow of rivers and economic service functions i e water used for economic sectors and explained their relationship secondly we calculate the economic values of economic service functions and ecological services functions of rivers system respectively finally we determined the recommended ecological base flow of rivers by reaching the maximum value in the change process of the total economic value of the ecological and economic services functions of rivers system we applied this framework to determine the river ecological base flow in the baoji section of weihe river which is the largest tributary of the yellow river northwest china the calculations results revealed that the recommended ecological base flow of rivers is 35 02 of the natural runoff in baoji section of weihe river this work can provide a valuable reference for decision making the ecological base flow of river in the water shortage area of northwest china keywords decision making ecological base flow service functions total economic value baoji section of weihe river water shortage area of northwest china 1 introduction rational allocation of ecological water use and economic water use has become one of the most challenging topics in today s society cheng and li 2018 pang et al 2013 water resources in rivers not only can promote socio economic development but also provide living environment for organic matter and a number of living organisms and maintain river ecological health and improve human living environment xu et al 2016a b c li and yue 2016 however the water resources are limited in the water shortage area of northwest china where demand and supply of water resources are highly contradictory jiang et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 deng et al 2006 due to rapid economic development and population growth and climate change huang et al 2017 the demand for water resources in economic water use departments has increased dramatically especially in the agricultural water use sector cheng and li 2018 nonetheless large amounts of water in the economic water use sector have severely squeezed ecological water use xu et al 2016a b c unbalanced development of ecological water and economic water uses would lead to the loss of basic ecological service functions of river ecosystems and the deterioration of the basic ecological environment of the basin yue et al 2018 cheng and li 2018 therefore rational allocation of ecological water use and economic water use is an important foundation for achieving sustainable development of economic and ecology surrounding the rivers in recent years some methods for estimating river ecological base flow have been developed which can be classified into four categories hydraulics hydrology habitat simulation and holistic tharme 2003 however since ecological base flow cannot bring direct economic benefits to the water resources owners some economic water use would not be used for basin ecological water conservation to maintain the basic ecological health of the river ecosystem pang et al 2013 and water resources owners ignore the ecological services functions of the ecological base flow of rivers these ecological services functions not only can bring direct economic benefits to people but also can improve the human living environment and promote the river healthy development of the basin ecological environment yue et al 2018 costanza et al 1998 first proposed the economic value of global ecosystem services functions which greatly promoted the quantitative research of the economic value of ecosystem services including the economic value of river ecosystem services xie and co workers combined it with the actual situation of china and established the equivalent factor method xie et al 2003 for estimating the economic value of ecosystem services functions in china 2008 in addition in recent years studies have quantitatively evaluated the economic value of ecosystem services generated by rivers system for example wilson and carpenter 1999 summarized the economic value of us freshwater ecosystem services and studied the economic value of the recreational function of the flow ecosystem loomis et al 2000 adopted the conditional value assessment method to assess the total economic value of the us platte river ecosystem services restoration water purification erosion control fishes and wildlife habitat leisure tourism functions elena et al 2014 applied spatial multi criteria analysis method to explore the environmental economic value of ecosystem services in the pellice river basin italy yue et al 2018 combined the definition and implication of river ecological base flow to analyze the ecological services functions of the river ecological base flow of rivers during the flood season and the non flood period and finally calculated the economic value of the ecological base flow in the five sections of the guanzhong section of weihe river although the quantitative studies on the economic value of ecological service function of the river ecological base flow of rivers enable us to understand their economic benefits and importance in our daily lives few evaluated the economic value of the ecological base flow for estimating the river ecological base flow to maintain the ecological service function of the ecological base of rivers and ensure the corresponding ecological and economic value we should consider the process of the dynamic change of the economic value of the ecological base flow of rivers for determining the ecological base flow of rivers based on the analysis of the ecological and economic service functions and its total economic value of rivers ecosystem we naturally propose a conceptual decision making model for the river ecological base flow which considers the total economic value of the ecosystem service functions of rivers by taking the typical water shortage area of northwest china baoji section of weihe river as an example we test the proposed model for decision making of the ecological base flow of rivers system the proposed model can estimate river ecological base flow and can promote ecological and economic development of rivers ecosystems 2 methods a conceptual decision making framework for ecological base flow of rivers which accounts for the economic value of the system service functions of rivers mainly includes three steps firstly we analyze and identify system services functions of rivers and divide the main system services functions of rivers into the economic service functions and ecological service functions secondly we estimate the total economic value of economic services functions and ecological services functions of rivers system respectively finally we determine an optimal ecological base flow which considers the dynamic change processes of the total economic value of ecosystem services functions of rivers in water shortage area of northwest china 2 1 service functions of rivers systems analysis according to the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 rivers ecosystem typically provides a variety of system services functions vermaat et al 2014 auerbach et al 2014 russi et al 2013 such as water supply food production hydro powder generation gas regulation climate change environment purification hydrological regulation soil maintenance replenish soil fertility biodiversity aesthetic landscape and culture gopal 2016 xie et al 2008 mea 2005 costanza et al 1998 water volume in the river directly affects the ecosystems service function of rivers gopal 2016 for instance low flow hinders the interactions between the channel and floodplain which reduces floodplain processes that regulate water quality and biodiversity and affects the recreational and cultural use of the rivers gopal 2016 water resources are scarce in water shortage area of northwest china where the gap between water supply and demand is sharply huge jiang et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 deng et al 2006 large amount of water resources consumed by the economic water use sectors led to rapid decline in residual water resources of rivers cheng and li 2018 lin and li 2013 which influenced the ecosystem services functions of rivers and caused the loss of the ecological services functions of rivers yue et al 2018 in order to prevent rivers from losing their basic ecological functions we should reduce the economic water use to maintain the water requirement of the ecological base flow of rivers and promote the basic functions of the ecological base flow cheng and li 2018 xue et al 2017 xue et al 2016 and in this paper we divide the ecosystem services functions of rivers into economic service functions water used for the economic water use sectors and ecological services functions water used for the ecological base flow of rivers see table 1 nonetheless the contradictory relationship exists between the economic services functions and ecological services functions of rivers gopal 2016 the specific change process as shown in fig 1 2 2 quantitative monetarizationof service functions of rivers systems 2 2 1 the economic value of ecological base flow of rivers based on the result reference method equivalent factor method xie et al 2008 xie et al 2003 we estimate the economic value

rivers obtained from xie et al 2008 xie et al 2003 among them the calculation process of water surface area of ecological base flow according to the geometric characteristics of river system we finally divided it into n sub river including n 1 cross section of rivers data are collected on each generalized sub rivers i and combined with the fitting curve of hydraulics relationship between the

economic value of the ecological base flow of rivers li and yue 2016 our results indicate that the economic value of the ecological base flow increases with the increase of amount of the ecological base flow of rivers the economic value of the unilateral ecological base flow would decrease with the increase of amount of the ecological base flow of rivers yue et al 2018 xu et al 2016a b c zhao 2015 hence the economic value of river ecological base flow demonstrates a nonlinear change with the increase of the ecological base flow of rivers meanwhile the increase degree would weaken with the increase of the ecological base flow of rivers yue et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 2 in section 2 1 we analyzed the contradictory relationship between the economic services functions and ecological services functions gopal 2016 i e the greater the water requirement of economic service functions water resource used for the economic sectors the smaller the water requirement of the ecological services functions water resources used for the ecological base flow of rivers therefore suppose the inflow of rivers is constant the change in the amount of water in any water use sectors economic water use or ecological water use would lead to the change in the amount of water in another water use sectors which would further cause the change in the total economic value of ecosystem services

large scale changes in the pleistocene and holocene within coastal arctic and subarctic territories person et al 2007 mcintosh et al 2011 stotler et al 2012 aquilina et al 2015 meredith et al 2017 here the effect of multiple alternations of continental glaciations and sea transgressions with an amplitude of fluctuations of the water level in the sea up to 130 m was most actively manifested these changes led to a large variety in the chemical composition of groundwater and the spatial distribution of the changes which should be taken into account when regarding water management and regulation policy for example estimates of the depth of penetration of glacial meltwater are very important for the final design of radioactive waste repositories and their safety after closure no less important is the assessment of the possibility of a stable supply of good quality drinking water to large cities ecologically it is of interest to have a quantitative prediction of the danger of saline drainage waters and brines discharging from exploited mineral deposits to surface watercourses the use of stable isotopes provides substantial support in paleo hydrogeological reconstructions they have been carefully studied in the sedimentary baltic artesian basin bab located south of the fennoscandinavian baltic shield bs in estonia latvia and lithuania edmunds et al 2001 mokrik and mažeika 2002 raidla et al 2009 zuzevicius 2010 saks et al 2012 pärn et al 2016 gerber et al 2017 in bab aquifers three types of water glacial meltwater meteoric water and brine were taken as components of mixing a particularly keen interest has been shown in assessing the degree of participation of glacial melt waters in the formation of the isotopic chemical composition of groundwater and brines during repeated quaternary glaciations glacial meltwater end member δ18o was taken to be 24 to 25 based on the detection in the northern part of the bab and on the southern slope of the bs of the most depleted groundwater with δ18o having values around 22 vaikmäe et al 2001 karro et al 2004 against the background of an average annual rainfall of 10 4 punning et al 1987 based on the chemical concentrations and the dating results it has been found that the brine originates from evaporated paleozoic seawater that has been modified by later water rock interaction in many sedimentary basins in north america evidence of brines originating from remnant evaporated seawater has also been found iampen and rostron 2000 pärn et al 2016 stueber and walter 1991 wilson and long 1993 in the sedimentary northern dvina artesian basin ndab located on the eastern flank of the bs in the mezen syneclise the hydrogeological characteristics and water chemistry have been studied by malov 2004 2018a see tables s1 s2 and fig s4 the specific objectives of the studies was to clarify the sources of recharge and conditions of groundwater formation taking into account the mixing processes on the basis of 14c and 234u 238u dating it has been established that the chemical composition of fresh water evolves in the direction ca mg hco3 na hco3 na cl it is due to successive replacement of the process of calcite dissolution in the recharge area on the watershed by i the process of hydrolysis of sodium aluminosilicates in the transit zone and by ii the processes of mixing fresh water with salt water and brines cation exchange of alkaline earth elements with alkaline elements and dissolution of gypsum near discharge areas at the seashore and in paleovalleys in the brackish and salty waters the na ca ratio is reduced to 1 4 this indicates that in the aquifers there are other sources of ca in addition to the dissolution of gypsum the most probable process is the hydrolysis of ca aluminosilicates which indicates a significant time of water rock interaction the brackish water with tds 5 6 g l 1 is particularly distinguished by the degree of modification due to water rock interaction on the basis of general hydrogeological conditions and analyses of ion ratios it is established that the following basic processes of groundwater mixing occur see fig s5 i mixing pleistocene seawater and brackish1 groundwater with the formation of the saltyvpd water in the upper part of the vendian aquifers ii mixing fresh water and the above mentioned saltyvpd water with brackish2 water formation iii mixing fresh water and brines with the formation of the saltyvmz water in the lower part of the vendian aquifers in general the concentration of uranium in oxidized groundwater is correlated with 14c activity and 14c age which allowed to perform the uranium isotope dating of groundwater stable isotopes in the ndab have not been studied therefore starting from year 2006 more than 100 groundwater and surface water samples were taken on the eastern bs slope the purpose of the present study was to i assess the isotopic composition of various types of fresh brackish and saline waters in the padun and mezen formations of vendian ediacaran aquifers ii assess the degree of participation of melt glacier and meteoric waters in the processes of formation of groundwater composition according to isotope geochemical data and iii employ the use of stable isotopes to clarify previously performed groundwater dating the present study could provide a better understanding of the considerable variability in the spatial scale geometry mutual ratio and origin of fresh water and salt water in coastal aquifers and this knowledge can be applied to water management and regulation policy in comparison with what is already known from previous hydrochemical studies this paper discusses the new quantitative evaluation of mixing processes using 18o this paper discusses the four end members δ18o of mixing in groundwater ndab glacier meltwater interglacial waters seawater and brine uranium and radiocarbon age correction models were used for the groundwater dating stable isotopes are used to refine previously performed groundwater dating 2 overview and hydrogeological structure sampling locations are on the northern dvina basin ndb including its slopes fig 1 ndb represents an onshore continuation of the dvina bay white sea and extends from the dvina estuary in the north west to the pinega river mouth in the south east fig 1 the present day basin is a sea facing depression composed of sequences with different ages namely the middle upper carboniferous carbonate terrigenous c2 3 upper devonian lower carboniferous terrigenous d3 c1 and vendian ediacaran padun vpd mezen vmz and ust pinega vup formations fig 1b the basin at the top is largely filled with clayey sediments from the mikulinian eemian interglacial miiimk boreal sea the clays are underlain by a 10 15 m thick sequence of loams from the moskovian late saalian moraine giims the underlying vendian terrigenous sequence 600 700 m is composed of alternating sandstones siltstones and mudstones the mikulinian clays are overlain by a 10 15 m thick sequence of valdaian weichselian glaciation giiivd sediments which are largely represented by moraine boulder loams with localities of fluvioglacial and glaciolacustrine sands the valley of the northern dvina river is filled with upper pleistocene and holocene qiii iv sandy clayey sediments the upper part of the vendian aquifers in the central part of the basin is characterized by inverse hydrochemical zonality and decreasing groundwater total dissolved solids tds from 28 to 5 g l 1 fig 1d this pattern is primarily caused by the freshening of groundwater due to the long term existence of terrestrial conditions in the mesozoic and cenozoic the desalination of groundwater significantly reduced after the mikulino sea transgression 130 ka ago lisitsyn 2010 subsequently the upper part of the vendian aquifers began to receive saline interstitial water which was squeezed out under the load of the valdai glacier from mikulinian interglacial marine clays after the formation of the northern dvina river valley due to an erosional activity of water that flowed from a melting glacier herman et al 2011 the valley cut the mikulinian clayey sequence almost up to its base saline water from the aquifer sediments of the terrigenous padun formation began to flow into the river valley and was replaced partially by freshwater from the recharge area on the lateral part of the northern dvina valley fig 1d therefore the chemical composition of groundwater can now be explained as the mixing of saline seawater with fresh meteoric water enriched with dissolved matter of the aquifer sediments the lower part of the vendian aquifers is characterized by increasing groundwater tds from 5 g l 1 at a depth of 150 200 m to 50 170 g l 1 at a depth of 250 800 m fig 1b table s1 brines are localized mainly in the tamitsa layers vtm of the vendian ust pinega formation the thickness of the tamitsa layers is 30 m the tamitsa layers includes varigrained and poorly sorted sandstones composed of k feldspar partly kaolinitized quartz and subordinate mica the gritstone content in the sequence can be up to 30 kaolinite predominates in the composition of clay minerals the cement is ferruginous clayey and more rarely carbonate the weakly cemented sandstones contain sand at some intervals up to 40 of the total thickness hydraulic conductivity of the tamitsa layers aquifer is 1 m day 1 the discharge points of the paleozoic brines at locations near the seashore have been identified gatal sky 1954 korotkov 1983 see fig 1b so that their participation in the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater is also possible hydraulic conductivity of the vendian ust pinega formation above the tamitsa layers aquifer is on average 10 4 to 10 3 m day 1 however it cannot be considered as a clearly expressed aquiclude in view of the chaotic heterogeneity of its lithologic composition and the widespread buried paleovalleys of pliocene age with a depth of up to 250 300 m goretsky 1964 kashtanov 1954 see fig 1b 3 materials and methods forty three water samples were collected in the period of 2011 2014 and ten samples were collected in 2006 from 53 sites over an area of 60 000 km2 fig 1 samples t1 tiii were collected in the subpolar urals from geothermal sources malov et al 2015 these samples are of interest in the context of further discussion regarding the degree of participation of sea waters and brines in the formation of brackish water composition sample k2 was collected from a cold spring brackish waters of the samples kw and k2 are enclosed in a layer of sandy gravel deposits of the last glacial period lying on clayey deposits of the mikulinian sea and overlapped by morainic loams ac and ae samples were taken from fresh groundwater contained in the explosion pipe which broke through vendian sediments and formed the common aquifer complexes within them the remaining samples consist of groundwater obtained from boreholes in the padun and mezen formations of vendian aquifers tables 1 the drainage boreholes on the exploited diamond deposit 4d 6d 10d 21d 22d 26d 28d 36d are constructed with 273 mm internal diameter with perforated screens wire winding and gravel cover with a thickness of 160 mm water supply wells il le mk is kw mm b1 b2 la6 la5 no1 i5 are constructed

constructed with a 127 mm internal diameter and with a polymer filter and a sand backfill of 30 mm thickness groundwater samples were collected using vodomet submersible pumps with a capacity of 115 l min 1 before taking samples from the monitoring wells the water was pumped out within 2 3 h all of the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane in the field measurement of δ2h and δ18o was carried out in the resource centre for geo environmental research and modelling geomodel of the research park of saint petersburg state university russia on a picarro l2120 i infrared laser spectrometer the results are given in the form of δ2h and δ18o in per mille relative to the vienna standard of mean ocean water vsmow internal lab standards which were calibrated by the vsmow2 gisp and slap standards of the international atomic energy agency iaea and by the usgs45 and usgs46 standards of the united states geological survey were used for the calculation of 2h and 18o in the samples accuracy was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h four samples were collected in 2016 and analyzed in the iaea the degree of participation of glacial meltwater and fresh water in the groundwater formation was estimated in accordance with our adopting and extending of the mixing model proposed by raidla et al 2009 and gerber et al 2017 proportions of end members in the groundwater were estimated according to mass balance in a three end member system c l glacial x c l interglacial y c l brine s e a 1 x y c l mix 18 o glacial x 18 o interglacial y 18 o brine s e a 1 x y 18 o mix where c l mix mg l 1 in the water sample according to table s1 18 o mix in the water sample according to table 1 the remaining values of cl and 18o glacial interglacial brine and sea according to table 2 4 results table 1 and fig 2 provide information on the composition of stable isotopes 18o and 2h in groundwater data on the chemical composition of groundwater and brines are given in table s1 of the supplementary information table s2 also shows the values of δ13c and 14c pmc as well as radiocarbon 14c and uranium isotopic 234u 238u dating of groundwater according to malov 2018a 4 1 fresh water in the padun formation of vendian aquifers and brackish water in the quaternary aquifer the maximum values of 13 and 94 of δ18o and δ2h respectively are characteristic of groundwater in the kimberlite pipes of the explosion the average values of δ18o and δ2h for the remaining 22 samples are 13 8 and 100 varying from 13 2 to 14 4 and from 97 to 105 respectively all of them are located on global meteoric water line gmwl y 8x 10 that is they deviate somewhat to the left of local meteoric water line lmwl arkhangelsk y 7 9653x 6 2264 fig s1 residence times of this groundwater in aquifers are up to 11 8 1 6 ka holocene see table s2 precipitation weighted averages 18o and δ2h are 13 2 and 98 9 for arkhangelsk global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip station iaea wmo 2016 figs s1 and s2 due to the deep freezing of the soil in sub arctic regions in winter groundwater is recharged by snowmelt and summer precipitation in the warmer seasons pourrier et al 2014 dragon et al 2015 evapotranspiration may remove a portion of the summer rainwater when the average daily temperature is higher than 5 c therefore the isotopic composition of groundwater is lighter in 2h and 18o than the annual weighted mean for atmospheric precipitation gibson et al 2015 depletion of groundwater by 2h and 18o could be also due to the influence of the cold climate precipitations kortelainen and karhu 2004 glacial melting water recharge and thawing of permafrost in the past this influence is traced for two thirds of the samples of the fresh water in vendian aquifers fig s3 for the remaining samples deviations from the trend are characteristic of six samples of the youngest waters depletion as well as one sample of the oldest waters and two samples of water taken in a kimberlite aquifer enrichment 4 2 slightly brackish and brackish waters the average values of δ18o and δ2h for 8 samples of the slightly brackish thermal waters sampled in the subpolar urals are 15 5 and 113 9 varying from 15 3 to 15 8 and from 113 to 115 respectively all of them are located on gmwl below the points characterizing the groundwater of the eastern slope of the bs since the precipitation weighted averages δ18o and δ2h are 14 8 and 107 8 respectively for pechora and salekhard gnip stations iaea wmo 2016 residence times of this groundwater in aquifers are 6 78 0 78 to 7 33 0 31 ka holocene table s2 slightly brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifers brackish1 are relict waters with a 14c age 32 96 2 3 ka late pleistocene table s2 the samples i5 i4 mi characterizing the brackish1 with tds 5 6 g l 1 are particularly distinguished by the degree of modification due to water rock interaction the most probable process is the hydrolysis of ca aluminosilicates this process follows the mechanism of diffusion kinetics which indicates a significant residence time of this water in the aquifer moskovian late saalian glacial melting waters middle pleistocene could also participate in their formation based on the general hydrogeological history of the region malov 2018a the points characterizing the isotopic composition of these waters are located between brackish thermal waters and fresh water and deviate to the right from gmwl and lmwl fig 2 brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifers brackish2 have a 14c and 234u 238u age from about 25 1 0 7 to 39 2 6 3 ka table s2 according to hydrochemical data they are a mixture of the late pleistocene freshwater and seawater end members malov 2018a it is also possible that there was participation of the fresh waters of the holocene in their formation therefore they are located on the lmwl slightly above the freshwater field fig 2 two samples no1 are shifted to the right of this line 4 3 strongly brackish and salty waters according to hydrochemical data strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd is salty interstitial water which was squeezed out under the load of the valdai weichselian glacier from mikulinian eemian interglacial marine clays to the upper part of the vendian aquifers there it mixed with slightly brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifer brackish1 therefore across the dataset the δ18o and δ2h values in the water ranged from 5 2 to 10 1 and from 38 to 72 respectively samples with high values are deviated to the right of gmwl and lmwl as the isotopic composition is alleviated the samples go to lmwl and gmwl according to the hydrochemical data strongly brackish and salty waters in the mezen formation of vendian aquifers salty vmz was formed as a result of mixing middle pleistocene holocene freshwater of melting glaciers end member and brine end member 234u 238u age was determined at 422 ka table s2 the points characterizing the δ18o and δ2h are scattered over a wide range from 11 3 to 13 4 and from 89 to 102 respectively they are shifted from the lmwl to the right 4 4 groundwater and brines collected from the cambrian aquifer system of the baltic artesian basin gerber et al 2017 brines collected from the cambrian aquifer system of the bab fall into the field of the most heavy isotopic composition of the strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd they are also deviate from the lmwl arkhangelsk to the right the isotope composition of the slightly brackish water from the cambrian aquifer system of the bab sample 2bab is identical to the composition of the sample mi brackish1 the isotopic composition of the strongly brackish water from the cambrian aquifer system of the bab sample 1bab is similar in composition to the samples brackish2 and salty vmz however the chemical compositions are closest in samples 1bab and salty vmz 4 5 proportions of the interglacial water glacial meltwater seawater and brine end members in the groundwater of the vend aquifers in the ndab on the western slope of the bs in the present study the brine and seawater components are assumed to be end members the brine end member is 90 000 mg l 1 of cl and 0 of δ18o see wells up nen and lom table s1 figs 1b 3 gerber et al 2017 the brine is of paleozoic age gatal sky 1954 korotkov 1983 the seawater end member standard mean ocean water smow is 19 354 mg l 1 of cl and 0 of δ18o riley and skirrow 1965 table 2 for the glacial meltwater end member a middle pleistocene holocene origin is plausible gerber et al 2017 malov 2018a the δ18o of the glacial end member is assumed at 24 according to the lowest isotopic values measured in the cambran vendian aquifer raidla et al 2009 the fourth component fresh water could participate in the formation of groundwater composition also in middle pleistocene holocene so it is thus called interglacial water the δ18o of the fourth component is 13 2 which is taken according to the weighted value for arkhangelsk gnip station see section 4 1 mixing proportions of the four end members calculated from cl and δ18o for each groundwater type are given in table 3 5 discussion 5 1 detection of the marine component in strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd a large number of the previous works were devoted to reconstruction of geological history and paleoclimate of the baltic white sea region in the pleistocene and holocene marine sediments of the eemian sea 115 130 ka were accumulated in some warmer climate conditions in comparison with modern climate conditions kaspar et al 2005 a valley of the northern dvina was an estuary of the eemian sea during this interglacial fig 4 brandefelt and näslund 2014 generally the geography and climate conditions of the northwestern part of eurasia were similar to the contemporaneity that allows using a direct analogy for the interpretation hence our data on the stable isotope together with the aforementioned paleoreconstructions make it possible to perform a genetic analysis of the conditions for the formation of the marine component of strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd the baltic sea water near offshore germany poland and the kaliningrad region russia has now on average δ2h 48 and δ18o 6 1 and salinity of about s 4 10 g l 1 fröhlich et al 1988 in the finland gulf we measured δ2h 55 and δ18o 6 8 and a salinity of about s 2 4 g l 1 this isotope depletion and desalinization of seawater is a result of the neva river influence which has on average δ18o 10 1 0 4 and s 60 90 mg l 1 according to experimental data for the period of 2014 2017 rumyantsev et al 2017 in the northern dvina river above the tidal range the isotope composition of oxygen is now on average δ18o 15 5 and salinity is in the range of 75 110 mg l 1 during the high spring discharge to 330 445 mg l 1 in winter the white sea water near mouth of the northern dvina river has δ18o 3 8 and s 25 g l 1 and the fitting equation is δ18o 0 362 s 13 zaiko 2004 nikolaev and nikolaev 1987 also we measured δ18o from 1 9 to 4 7 and s 22 31 g l 1 in the kandalaksha bay and for the bottom layer of water in the open sea we measured δ18o 1 2 and tds 33 g l 1 porewater of the mikulinian marine clay in the northern dvina valley fig 1 has salinity s 20 25 g l 1 taking this into account the oxygen isotope composition of seawater could be estimated as δ18o from 4 to 6 for the paleo estuary of the northern dvina during the eemian interstadial this calculation is in good agreement with the measured isotope composition of the iodine water δ18o from 5 2 to 7 9 and salinity of about 25 g l 1 during the weichselian stadial the ice sheets and permafrost were repeatedly rising and reached the maximums in 85 60 и 18 ka ago fig 5 brandefelt and näslund 2014 the thickness of ice cover is estimated to be 0 5 1 0 km for the northern dvina valley lokrantz and sohlenius 2006 and with a depth of permafrost that could be about 75 200 m brandefelt and näslund 2014 the ice of permafrost should be fresher than initial porewater especially taking into account multiple freezing episodes of soil sediments and rocks in contrast residual water cryopegs which was squeezed into the deep part of the geological strata should be more salty then initial porewater fig 5 thawed water could be a reason for the forming of the subglacial stream flow and for groundwater circulation conceptual and mathematical including computer code models of subglacial hydrology are intensively discussed and also physical techniques are used for its verification bueler and van pelt 2015 flowers 2015 grundl et al 2013 hook and le 1977 key and siegfried 2017 kyrke smith et al 2014 fresh meltwater from the thawed glacier base could have penetrated into the hydraulically permeable layers and partially replaced both initial porewater and water which was metamorphosed under cryogenic process it seems that the distribution of the porewater salinity and partial abundance of the chemical components in the mikulinian clays and in the layers below is consistent with the conceptual model of subglacial hydraulics the iodine concentration increases from the earth s surface to the bottom of the mikulinian clays and then decreases in accordance with other chemical components in the groundwater of the padun formation of the vend aquifers figs 6 and 7 the hydraulic conductivity of the mikulinian clay is very low less than 10 4 m day 1 and the initial iodine distribution in clays should be uniform freezing of water bearing sediments during the ice age and the load of the valdai glacier caused the pore pressure to increase therefore we assume that the growth of the iodine concentration with depth in the mikulinian clays is the result of the squeezing down of the initial porewater with a chemical composition that is supposedly similar to the marine type the concentration maximums in the graphs are noted in the depth interval of approximately 60 100 m and probably points to a permafrost base position in the geological section salinity of water and the concentration of major components have their minimum at the depth of about 100 160 m in the padun formation it could be explained as a zone of the glacial meltwater penetration during the ice age and also the modern recharge of groundwater in the padun formation from the lateral part of the northern dvina valley the recharge area is located about 30 km to northeast 5 2 assessment of the degree of participation of melt glacial and meteoric waters in the processes of formation of groundwater composition and correction of their dating fresh waters in the padun formation of the vendian aquifers and in the kimberlite aquifers were formed due to the infiltration of precipitation in the recharge areas at the watersheds see fig 1c d as part of the oldest freshwaters a melt water of the last glacial period is present near the river valleys they increased their salinity by mixing with the relict waters of the mikulinian transgression mixing proportions table 3 are up to 2 of seawater up to 16 of glacial water and 84 98 of the interglacial water the 14c и 234u 238u age of this water ranges from modern to 11 8 1 6 ka holocene table s2 the waters from the mikulinian sea do not contain radiocarbon and the uranium content in the reducing conditions of the pore waters is extremely low n 10 2 μg l 1 however their influence on freshwater dating is insignificant up to about 2 due to the small share of sea water in the total mixture and therefore it can be ignored slightly brackish water in the quaternary aquifer is formed in a similar way these waters are enclosed in a layer of sandy gravel deposits of the last glacial period lying on clayey deposits of the mikulinian sea and are overlain by moraine boulder loams they are a mixture 5 7 seawater 8 15 glacial water and 78 87 interglacial water the 14c age of this water ranges from 7 53 0 18 to 16 2 0 26 ka holocene late pleistocene table s2 given the dilution of fresh water glacial and interglacial by very old seawaters that do not contain radiocarbon the 14c age of the slightly brackish water in the quaternary aquifers will be less by about 5 7 slightly brackish thermal waters sampled in the subpolar urals were formed by fresh water flowing through the deep parts of the aquifer system where it mixed with brine followed by discharge mixing proportions table 3 correspond to those obtained from hydrochemical data 1 brine and 99 fresh water malov et al 2015 however according to the isotope data fresh water is formed by mixing of 74 meteoric interglacial water and 25 glacial water associated with melting permafrost malov 2018b the 14c age cal bp of the thermal water determined according to the method of han and plummer 2013 ranges from 5 44 0 48 to 6 97 0 9 ka malov et al 2015 table s2 slightly brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifer brackish1 malov 2018a shows that according to hydrochemical data the sea waters of the mikulinian interglacial were mixed with brackish1 forming saline waters salty vpd consequently before this mixing brackish1 could not be salinized by seawater and their mineralization was increased apparently due to the brines discharging from underlying aquifers fig 1d overall brackish1 contains 3 of brines 8 19 glacial water and 78 89 interglacial water table 3 approximately the same composition is typical for the water from the 2bab well gerber et al 2017 which is similar in salinity and isotopic composition see table 1 figs 2 and 3 the contents of radiocarbon in brackish1 and in water from the 2bab well are also close 1 70 0 26 pmc and 2 8 0 1 pmc respectively gerber et al 2017 the age of the freshwater component in brackish1 is defined previously see table s2 26 2 3 9 to 32 96 2 3 ka while its age in the 2bab well determined by 81kr is much higher 407 27 ka gerber et al 2017 below we return to the discussion of this discrepancy salty water salty vmz is formed by diluting the brines discharging from underlying aquifers with fresh water fig 1 d malov 2018a their composition is formed by mixing 10 17 brine 3 13 glacial water and 77 87 interglacial water it is similar to the composition of water from the 1bab well gerber et al 2017 in terms of salinity and isotopic composition see table 1 figs 2 and 3 234u 238u age of the fresh component of the salty vmz can be up to 307 115 ka which is close to dating the meteoric component of water in the 1bab well 541 28 ka gerber et al 2017 table s2 that is the composition of the salty vmz was formed during that period which may include the holocene lp and mp it is noteworthy that malov 2018a notes the chlorine content of 31 230 mg l 1 table s1 in the brine end member which was taken from the analysis of a water sample from the se well see fig 1b therefore 25 50 of brines and 75 50 of fresh water were present in the calculated mixture in the present paper we take the chlorine content in the brine end member to be 90 000 mg l table 2 due to the lack of data on the isotopic composition of diluted brines in the se well therefore 10 17 of brines and 90 83 of fresh water are present in the calculated mixture the maximum proportion of glacial water is characteristic of salty vpd 19 51 in this case the meteor component is absent in most samples the share of sea water is 49 76 an exception are the wells i3 and vo2013 in which the proportion of interglacial water is large table 3 shows data on the water proportions in the vo well immediately after its drilling 2006 sample vo2006 and after seven years of artesian discharge of waters to the surface 2013 sample vo2013 it can be seen that during this period the share of sea water decreased by 16 due to their replacement by modern meteoric waters that is there was a breakthrough of the fresh water tongue to the well vo this tongue may have been formed in the holocene and it could be coming from the recharge area located on the watershed see fig 1d an apparently similar situation is observed for the i3 well further it is noteworthy that if salty water salty vpd is a mixture of mikulino seawater and brackish1 then the absence of the meteoric component in salty vpd indicates that this component was also absent in brackish1 and the glacial component was 97 that is the age of these glacial brackish1 waters was older than that shown in table s2 as the age of the interglacial brackish1 water 30 ka late pleistocene the glacial brackish1 water age was probably also older than that of the mikulino seawater 130 ka that is if the period between the last glacial maximum lgm and moskovian late saalian glacial was assumed to be completely interglacial the most likely possibility was glacial brackish1 water formation in the middle pleistocene see section 4 2 which corresponds to the dating of water from the well 2bab 407 27 ka gerber et al 2017 in this case the chemical composition of both types of brackish1 water glacial brackish1 and interglacial brackish1 should have been similar brackish water brackish2 is a mixture of salty vpd and fresh water at a ratio of 1 2 1 4 4 according to hydrochemical data malov 2018a therefore their composition contains a mixture of 11 21 seawater 8 26 glacial water and 53 78 interglacial water table 3 the age of formation of the observed present day composition of these waters is 25 1 0 7 to 39 2 6 3 ka table s2 lp for the vendian rocks located in the western part of the mezen syneclise interval from 100 to 600 m a zone with brackish and salt water with a tds content of less than 35 g l 1 has been established fig 8 i e this zone is characterized by the penetration of fresh infiltration waters and the dilution of marine sedimentogenic waters and brines malov 2004 there is reason to believe that this zone was formed by the intrusion of glacial meltwater and interglacial freshwater into the mezen syneclise and contains a mixture of fresh water with brines type salty vmz in tables s1 and s2 6 conclusion the isotopic composition of groundwater of various chemical types was studied on the eastern slope of the baltic shield arkhangelsk region nw russia where repeated continental glaciations and marine transgressions in pleistocene and holocene have impacted on groundwater systems this means that there was an intensive and rapid recharge of aquifers after the glacial periods calculations of mixing assuming δ18o and cl abundance in four end member is known are used to quantify fractions of brine seawater glacial meltwater and interglacial meteoric water in the composition of various types of groundwater the obtained results reflect the evolution of groundwater on the way from the middle pleistocene to the present day during the middle pleistocene due to thawing ice sheets the glacial meltwater penetrated to a depth of 600 m in the western part of the mezen syneclise at this time brines in the lower part of the vendian aquifer mezen suite were diluted by fresh water and glacial meltwater dominated in the upper part of the vendians aquifer padun suite the eemian sea transgression 115 130 ka occurred immediately after this the porewater of eemian marine clays and upper part of vendian sediments under clays now contains the salty water s 25 g l 1 with maximal enrichment by heavy isotopes δ18o 7 7 and δ2h 98 9 on average this groundwater is a mixture of 19 51 glacial meltwater and 49 81 seawater the meltwater of the last glacial period is visible in fresh and slightly brackish water of the vendian and quaternary aquifers isotope composition of the fresh water is close to the annual mean of modern precipitations fresh water is a mixture of 2 seawater up to 16 glacial water and 84 100 holocene water the age of this water is in the range from the present day to 11 8 1 6 ka the majority of uncertainties are related to the uranium isotope dating of groundwater in uranium reduction conditions the analysis of the evolution of the chemical and isotope composition of groundwater the analysis of the geological and hydrogeological history of the region the hydraulic estimates of groundwater flow rates in the aquifers the hydrodynamic and balance justifications of the groundwater formation and the analysis of the composition of stable isotopes confirms in our opinion provide reliability in dating the most important milestones in the context of this article nevertheless in the future it would be advisable to study the distribution of the contents of sr isotopes and noble gases in groundwater in order to clarify the proportions of brines and seawater in their composition and to specify the timing of their mixing with glacial and meteoric waters future studies should also be continued to assess the retardation factor and recoil loss factor in order to improve the uranium isotope method of dating groundwater in uranium oxidizing conditions declaration of competing

6184,repeated continental glaciations and marine transgressions had a strong influence on the geochemical evolution of groundwater systems of the eastern slope of the baltic shield arkhangelsk region russia the spectrum from modern fresh waters to very old brines is distributed from the surface to a depth of 1 km in quaternary and vendian ediacaran sediments the purpose of this study was to i assess the isotopic composition of various types of groundwater ii assess the degree of participation of glacial melt and meteoric waters in the processes of dilution of seawater and brines according to isotope geochemical data and iii employ the use of stable isotopes to clarify previously performed groundwater dating it has been established that the salty water in the upper part of the vendian aquifer near the modern sea coast has maximum enrichment by heavy isotopes δ18o 7 7 and δ2h 98 9 on average it is a mixture of 19 51 glacial meltwater and 49 81 seawater the age of the marine component is 115 130 ka and the age of the glacial water is similar to that of the middle pleistocene the relict brackish water in the middle part of the vendian aquifer has the most depleted isotope composition δ18o 14 1 and δ2h 106 7 on average it is a mixture of 3 brine 8 19 glacial and 78 89 interglacial water and was formed in the range of 35 3 22 3 ka late pleistocene the maximum brine content 10 17 is characteristic of salt water in the lower part of the vendian aquifer the isotope composition of the fresh water is close to the weighted annual composition of modern precipitations δ18o 13 2 and δ2h 98 9 fresh water is a mixture of about 2 seawater up to 16 glacial water and 84 100 holocene water the age of this water is in the range from the present day to 11 8 1 6 ka the maximum depth of penetration of melt glacial waters of the middle pleistocene is assumed to be 600 m keywords groundwater stable isotopes glacial meltwater seawater mixing dating 1 introduction large scale climatic and geographical changes occurred on the earth regularly often they had disastrous consequences for terrestrial inhabitants currently the prospect of possible global warming is also of some concern therefore climatic and geographical paleoreconstructions are actively developed by researchers from various scientific fields hydrogeologists for example are especially interested in large scale changes in the pleistocene and holocene within coastal arctic and subarctic territories person et al 2007 mcintosh et al 2011 stotler et al 2012 aquilina et al 2015 meredith et al 2017 here the effect of multiple alternations of continental glaciations and sea transgressions with an amplitude of fluctuations of the water level in the sea up to 130 m was most actively manifested these changes led to a large variety in the chemical composition of groundwater and the spatial distribution of the changes which should be taken into account when regarding water management and regulation policy for example estimates of the depth of penetration of glacial meltwater are very important for the final design of radioactive waste repositories and their safety after closure no less important is the assessment of the possibility of a stable supply of good quality drinking water to large cities ecologically it is of interest to have a quantitative prediction of the danger of saline drainage waters and brines discharging from exploited mineral deposits to surface watercourses the use of stable isotopes provides substantial support in paleo hydrogeological reconstructions they have been carefully studied in the sedimentary baltic artesian basin bab located south of the fennoscandinavian baltic shield bs in estonia latvia and lithuania edmunds et al 2001 mokrik and mažeika 2002 raidla et al 2009 zuzevicius 2010 saks et al 2012 pärn et al 2016 gerber et al 2017 in bab aquifers three types of water glacial meltwater meteoric water and brine were taken as components of mixing a particularly keen interest has been shown in assessing the degree of participation of glacial melt waters in the formation of the isotopic chemical composition of groundwater and brines during repeated quaternary glaciations glacial meltwater end member δ18o was taken to be 24 to 25 based on the detection in the northern part of the bab and on the southern slope of the bs of the most depleted groundwater with δ18o having values around 22 vaikmäe et al 2001 karro et al 2004 against the background of an average annual rainfall of 10 4 punning et al 1987 based on the chemical concentrations and the dating results it has been found that the brine originates from evaporated paleozoic seawater that has been modified by later water rock interaction in many sedimentary basins in north america evidence of brines originating from remnant evaporated seawater has also been found iampen and rostron 2000 pärn et al 2016 stueber and walter 1991 wilson and long 1993 in the sedimentary northern dvina artesian basin ndab located on the eastern flank of the bs in the mezen syneclise the hydrogeological characteristics and water chemistry have been studied by malov 2004 2018a see tables s1 s2 and fig s4 the specific objectives of the studies was to clarify the sources of recharge and conditions of groundwater formation taking into account the mixing processes on the basis of 14c and 234u 238u dating it has been established that the chemical composition of fresh water evolves in the direction ca mg hco3 na hco3 na cl it is due to successive replacement of the process of calcite dissolution in the recharge area on the watershed by i the process of hydrolysis of sodium aluminosilicates in the transit zone and by ii the processes of mixing fresh water with salt water and brines cation exchange of alkaline earth elements with alkaline elements and dissolution of gypsum near discharge areas at the seashore and in paleovalleys in the brackish and salty waters the na ca ratio is reduced to 1 4 this indicates that in the aquifers there are other sources of ca in addition to the dissolution of gypsum the most probable process is the hydrolysis of ca aluminosilicates which indicates a significant time of water rock interaction the brackish water with tds 5 6 g l 1 is particularly distinguished by the degree of modification due to water rock interaction on the basis of general hydrogeological conditions and analyses of ion ratios it is established that the following basic processes of groundwater mixing occur see fig s5 i mixing pleistocene seawater and brackish1 groundwater with the formation of the saltyvpd water in the upper part of the vendian aquifers ii mixing fresh water and the above mentioned saltyvpd water with brackish2 water formation iii mixing fresh water and brines with the formation of the saltyvmz water in the lower part of the vendian aquifers in general the concentration of uranium in oxidized groundwater is correlated with 14c activity and 14c age which allowed to perform the uranium isotope dating of groundwater stable isotopes in the ndab have not been studied therefore starting from year 2006 more than 100 groundwater and surface water samples were taken on the eastern bs slope the purpose of the present study was to i assess the isotopic composition of various types of fresh brackish and saline waters in the padun and mezen formations of vendian ediacaran aquifers ii assess the degree of participation of melt glacier and meteoric waters in the processes of formation of groundwater composition according to isotope geochemical data and iii employ the use of stable isotopes to clarify previously performed groundwater dating the present study could provide a better understanding of the considerable variability in the spatial scale geometry mutual ratio and origin of fresh water and salt water in coastal aquifers and this knowledge can be applied to water management and regulation policy in comparison with what is already known from previous hydrochemical studies this paper discusses the new quantitative evaluation of mixing processes using 18o this paper discusses the four end members δ18o of mixing in groundwater ndab glacier meltwater interglacial waters seawater and brine uranium and radiocarbon age correction models were used for the groundwater dating stable isotopes are used to refine previously performed groundwater dating 2 overview and hydrogeological structure sampling locations are on the northern dvina basin ndb including its slopes fig 1 ndb represents an onshore continuation of the dvina bay white sea and extends from the dvina estuary in the north west to the pinega river mouth in the south east fig 1 the present day basin is a sea facing depression composed of sequences with different ages namely the middle upper carboniferous carbonate terrigenous c2 3 upper devonian lower carboniferous terrigenous d3 c1 and vendian ediacaran padun vpd mezen vmz and ust pinega vup formations fig 1b the basin at the top is largely filled with clayey sediments from the mikulinian eemian interglacial miiimk boreal sea the clays are underlain by a 10 15 m thick sequence of loams from the moskovian late saalian moraine giims the underlying vendian terrigenous sequence 600 700 m is composed of alternating sandstones siltstones and mudstones the mikulinian clays are overlain by a 10 15 m thick sequence of valdaian weichselian glaciation giiivd sediments which are largely represented by moraine boulder loams with localities of fluvioglacial and glaciolacustrine sands the valley of the northern dvina river is filled with upper pleistocene and holocene qiii iv sandy clayey sediments the upper part of the vendian aquifers in the central part of the basin is characterized by inverse hydrochemical zonality and decreasing groundwater total dissolved solids tds from 28 to 5 g l 1 fig 1d this pattern is primarily caused by the freshening of groundwater due to the long term existence of terrestrial conditions in the mesozoic and cenozoic the desalination of groundwater significantly reduced after the mikulino sea transgression 130 ka ago lisitsyn 2010 subsequently the upper part of the vendian aquifers began to receive saline interstitial water which was squeezed out under the load of the valdai glacier from mikulinian interglacial marine clays after the formation of the northern dvina river valley due to an erosional activity of water that flowed from a melting glacier herman et al 2011 the valley cut the mikulinian clayey sequence almost up to its base saline water from the aquifer sediments of the terrigenous padun formation began to flow into the river valley and was replaced partially by freshwater from the recharge area on the lateral part of the northern dvina valley fig 1d therefore the chemical composition of groundwater can now be explained as the mixing of saline seawater with fresh meteoric water enriched with dissolved matter of the aquifer sediments the lower part of the vendian aquifers is characterized by increasing groundwater tds from 5 g l 1 at a depth of 150 200 m to 50 170 g l 1 at a depth of 250 800 m fig 1b table s1 brines are localized mainly in the tamitsa layers vtm of the vendian ust pinega formation the thickness of the tamitsa layers is 30 m the tamitsa layers includes varigrained and poorly sorted sandstones composed of k feldspar partly kaolinitized quartz and subordinate mica the gritstone content in the sequence can be up to 30 kaolinite predominates in the composition of clay minerals the cement is ferruginous clayey and more rarely carbonate the weakly cemented sandstones contain sand at some intervals up to 40 of the total thickness hydraulic conductivity of the tamitsa layers aquifer is 1 m day 1 the discharge points of the paleozoic brines at locations near the seashore have been identified gatal sky 1954 korotkov 1983 see fig 1b so that their participation in the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater is also possible hydraulic conductivity of the vendian ust pinega formation above the tamitsa layers aquifer is on average 10 4 to 10 3 m day 1 however it cannot be considered as a clearly expressed aquiclude in view of the chaotic heterogeneity of its lithologic composition and the widespread buried paleovalleys of pliocene age with a depth of up to 250 300 m goretsky 1964 kashtanov 1954 see fig 1b 3 materials and methods forty three water samples were collected in the period of 2011 2014 and ten samples were collected in 2006 from 53 sites over an area of 60 000 km2 fig 1 samples t1 tiii were collected in the subpolar urals from geothermal sources malov et al 2015 these samples are of interest in the context of further discussion regarding the degree of participation of sea waters and brines in the formation of brackish water composition sample k2 was collected from a cold spring brackish waters of the samples kw and k2 are enclosed in a layer of sandy gravel deposits of the last glacial period lying on clayey deposits of the mikulinian sea and overlapped by morainic loams ac and ae samples were taken from fresh groundwater contained in the explosion pipe which broke through vendian sediments and formed the common aquifer complexes within them the remaining samples consist of groundwater obtained from boreholes in the padun and mezen formations of vendian aquifers tables 1 the drainage boreholes on the exploited diamond deposit 4d 6d 10d 21d 22d 26d 28d 36d are constructed with 273 mm internal diameter with perforated screens wire winding and gravel cover with a thickness of 160 mm water supply wells il le mk is kw mm b1 b2 la6 la5 no1 i5 are constructed

were collected using submersible pumps ecs 10 120 100 ecs 8 120 100 ecs 6 120 100 the rest of the samples were collected using monitoring wells located on the exploited diamond deposit they were constructed with a 127 mm internal diameter and with a polymer filter and a sand backfill of 30 mm thickness groundwater samples were collected using vodomet submersible pumps with a capacity of 115 l min 1 before taking samples from the monitoring wells the water was pumped out within 2 3 h all of the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membrane in the field measurement of δ2h and δ18o was carried out in the resource centre for geo environmental research and modelling geomodel of the research park of saint petersburg state university russia on a picarro l2120 i infrared laser spectrometer the results are given in the form of δ2h and δ18o in per mille relative to the vienna standard of mean ocean water vsmow internal lab standards which were calibrated by the vsmow2 gisp and slap standards of the international atomic energy agency iaea and by the usgs45 and usgs46 standards of the united states geological survey were used for the calculation of 2h and 18o in the samples accuracy was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h four samples were collected in 2016 and analyzed in the iaea the degree of participation of glacial meltwater and fresh water in the groundwater formation was estimated in accordance with our adopting and extending of the mixing model proposed by raidla et al 2009 and gerber et al 2017 proportions of end members in the groundwater were

results table 1 and fig 2 provide information on the composition of stable isotopes 18o and 2h in groundwater data on the chemical composition of groundwater and brines are given in table s1 of the supplementary information table s2 also shows the values of δ13c and 14c pmc as well as radiocarbon 14c and uranium isotopic 234u 238u dating of groundwater according to malov 2018a 4 1 fresh water in the padun formation of vendian aquifers and brackish water in the quaternary aquifer the maximum values of 13 and 94 of δ18o and δ2h respectively are characteristic of groundwater in the kimberlite pipes of the explosion the average values of δ18o and δ2h for the remaining 22 samples are 13 8 and 100 varying from 13 2 to 14 4 and from 97 to 105 respectively all of them are located on global meteoric water line gmwl y 8x 10 that is they deviate somewhat to the left of local meteoric water line lmwl arkhangelsk y 7 9653x 6 2264 fig s1 residence times of this groundwater in aquifers are up to 11 8 1 6 ka holocene see table s2 precipitation weighted averages 18o and δ2h are 13 2 and 98 9 for arkhangelsk global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip station iaea wmo 2016 figs s1 and s2 due to the deep freezing of the soil in sub arctic regions in winter groundwater is recharged by snowmelt and summer precipitation in the warmer seasons pourrier et al 2014 dragon et al 2015 evapotranspiration may remove a portion of the summer rainwater when the average daily temperature is higher than 5 c therefore the isotopic composition of groundwater is lighter in 2h and 18o than the annual weighted mean for atmospheric precipitation gibson et al 2015 depletion of groundwater by 2h and 18o could be also due to the influence of the cold climate precipitations kortelainen and karhu 2004 glacial melting water recharge and thawing of permafrost in the past this influence is traced for two thirds of the samples of the fresh water in vendian aquifers fig s3 for the remaining samples deviations from the trend are characteristic of six samples of the youngest waters depletion as well as one sample of the oldest waters and two samples of water taken in a kimberlite aquifer enrichment 4 2 slightly brackish and brackish waters the average values of δ18o and δ2h for 8 samples of the slightly brackish thermal waters sampled in the subpolar urals are 15 5 and 113 9 varying from 15 3 to 15 8 and from 113 to 115 respectively all of them are located on gmwl below the points characterizing the groundwater of the eastern slope of the bs since the precipitation weighted averages δ18o and δ2h are 14 8 and 107 8 respectively for pechora and salekhard gnip stations iaea wmo 2016 residence times of this groundwater in aquifers are 6 78 0 78 to 7 33 0 31 ka holocene table s2 slightly brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifers brackish1 are relict waters with a 14c age 32 96 2 3 ka late pleistocene table s2 the samples i5 i4 mi characterizing the brackish1 with tds 5 6 g l 1 are particularly distinguished by the degree of modification due to water rock interaction the most probable process is the hydrolysis of ca aluminosilicates this process follows the mechanism of diffusion kinetics which indicates a significant residence time of this water in the aquifer moskovian late saalian glacial melting waters middle pleistocene could also participate in their formation based on the general hydrogeological history of the region malov 2018a the points characterizing the isotopic composition of these waters are located between brackish thermal waters and fresh water and deviate to the right from gmwl and lmwl fig 2 brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifers brackish2 have a 14c and 234u 238u age from about 25 1 0 7 to 39 2 6 3 ka table s2 according to hydrochemical data they are a mixture of the late pleistocene freshwater and seawater end members malov 2018a it is also possible that there was participation of the fresh waters of the holocene in their formation therefore they are located on the lmwl slightly above the freshwater field fig 2 two samples no1 are shifted to the right of this line 4 3 strongly brackish and salty waters according to hydrochemical data strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd is salty interstitial water which was squeezed out under the load of the valdai weichselian glacier from mikulinian eemian interglacial marine clays to the upper part of the vendian aquifers there it mixed with slightly brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifer brackish1 therefore across the dataset the δ18o and δ2h values in the water ranged from 5 2 to 10 1 and from 38 to 72 respectively samples with high values are deviated to the right of gmwl and lmwl as the isotopic composition is alleviated the samples go to lmwl and gmwl according to the hydrochemical data strongly brackish and salty waters in the mezen formation of vendian aquifers salty vmz was formed as a result of mixing middle pleistocene holocene freshwater of melting glaciers end member and brine end member 234u 238u age was determined at 422 ka table s2 the points characterizing the δ18o and δ2h are scattered over a wide range from 11 3 to 13 4 and from 89 to 102 respectively they are shifted from the lmwl to the right 4 4 groundwater and brines collected from the cambrian aquifer system of the baltic artesian basin gerber et al 2017 brines collected from the cambrian aquifer system of the bab fall into the field of the most heavy isotopic composition of the strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd they are also deviate from the lmwl arkhangelsk to the right the isotope composition of the slightly brackish water from the cambrian aquifer system of the bab sample 2bab is identical to the composition of the sample mi brackish1 the isotopic composition of the strongly brackish water from the cambrian aquifer system of the bab sample 1bab is similar in composition to the samples brackish2 and salty vmz however the chemical compositions are closest in samples 1bab and salty vmz 4 5 proportions of the interglacial water glacial meltwater seawater and brine end members in the groundwater of the vend aquifers in the ndab on the western slope of the bs in the present study the brine and seawater components are assumed to be end members the brine end member is 90 000 mg l 1 of cl and 0 of δ18o see wells up nen and lom table s1 figs 1b 3 gerber et al 2017 the brine is of paleozoic age gatal sky 1954 korotkov 1983 the seawater end member standard mean ocean water smow is 19 354 mg l 1 of cl and 0 of δ18o riley and skirrow 1965 table 2 for the glacial meltwater end member a middle pleistocene holocene origin is plausible gerber et al 2017 malov 2018a the δ18o of the glacial end member is assumed at 24 according to the lowest isotopic values measured in the cambran vendian aquifer raidla et al 2009 the fourth component fresh water could participate in the formation of groundwater composition also in middle pleistocene holocene so it is thus called interglacial water the δ18o of the fourth component is 13 2 which is taken according to the weighted value for arkhangelsk gnip station see section 4 1 mixing proportions of the four end members calculated from cl and δ18o for each groundwater type are given in table 3 5 discussion 5 1 detection of the marine component in strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd a large number of the previous works were devoted to reconstruction of geological history and paleoclimate of the baltic white sea region in the pleistocene and holocene marine sediments of the eemian sea 115 130 ka were accumulated in some warmer climate conditions in comparison with modern climate conditions kaspar et al 2005 a valley of the northern dvina was an estuary of the eemian sea during this interglacial fig 4 brandefelt and näslund 2014 generally the geography and climate conditions of the northwestern part of eurasia were similar to the contemporaneity that allows using a direct analogy for the interpretation hence our data on the stable isotope together with the aforementioned paleoreconstructions make it possible to perform a genetic analysis of the conditions for the formation of the marine component of strongly brackish and salty waters in the padun formation of vendian aquifers salty vpd the baltic sea water near offshore germany poland and the kaliningrad region russia has now on average δ2h 48 and δ18o 6 1 and salinity of about s 4 10 g l 1 fröhlich et al 1988 in the finland gulf we measured δ2h 55 and δ18o 6 8 and a salinity of about s 2 4 g l 1 this isotope depletion and desalinization of seawater is a result of the neva river influence which has on average δ18o 10 1 0 4 and s 60 90 mg l 1 according to experimental data for the period of 2014 2017 rumyantsev et al 2017 in the northern dvina river above the tidal range the isotope composition of oxygen is now on average δ18o 15 5 and salinity is in the range of 75 110 mg l 1 during the high spring discharge to 330 445 mg l 1 in winter the white sea water near mouth of the northern dvina river has δ18o 3 8 and s 25 g l 1 and the fitting equation is δ18o 0 362 s 13 zaiko 2004 nikolaev and nikolaev 1987 also we measured δ18o from 1 9 to 4 7 and s 22 31 g l 1 in the kandalaksha bay and for the bottom layer of water in the open sea we measured δ18o 1 2 and tds 33 g l 1 porewater of the mikulinian marine clay in the northern dvina valley fig 1 has salinity s 20 25 g l 1 taking this into account the oxygen isotope composition of seawater could be estimated as δ18o from 4 to 6 for the paleo estuary of the northern dvina during the eemian interstadial this calculation is in good agreement with the measured isotope composition of the iodine water δ18o from 5 2 to 7 9 and salinity of about 25 g l 1 during the weichselian stadial the ice sheets and permafrost were repeatedly rising and reached the maximums in 85 60 и 18 ka ago fig 5 brandefelt and näslund 2014 the thickness of ice cover is estimated to be 0 5 1 0 km for the northern dvina valley lokrantz and sohlenius 2006 and with a depth of permafrost that could be about 75 200 m brandefelt and näslund 2014 the ice of permafrost should be fresher than initial porewater especially taking into account multiple freezing episodes of soil sediments and rocks in contrast residual water cryopegs which was squeezed into the deep part of the geological strata should be more salty then initial porewater fig 5 thawed water could be a reason for the forming of the subglacial stream flow and for groundwater circulation conceptual and mathematical including computer code models of subglacial hydrology are intensively discussed and also physical techniques are used for its verification bueler and van pelt 2015 flowers 2015 grundl et al 2013 hook and le 1977 key and siegfried 2017 kyrke smith et al 2014 fresh meltwater from the thawed glacier base could have penetrated into the hydraulically permeable layers and partially replaced both initial porewater and water which was metamorphosed under cryogenic process it seems that the distribution of the porewater salinity and partial abundance of the chemical components in the mikulinian clays and in the layers below is consistent with the conceptual model of subglacial hydraulics the iodine concentration increases from the earth s surface to the bottom of the mikulinian clays and then decreases in accordance with other chemical components in the groundwater of the padun formation of the vend aquifers figs 6 and 7 the hydraulic conductivity of the mikulinian clay is very low less than 10 4 m day 1 and the initial iodine distribution in clays should be uniform freezing of water bearing sediments during the ice age and the load of the valdai glacier caused the pore pressure to increase therefore we assume that the growth of the iodine concentration with depth in the mikulinian clays is the result of the squeezing down of the initial porewater with a chemical composition that is supposedly similar to the marine type the concentration maximums in the graphs are noted in the depth interval of approximately 60 100 m and probably points to a permafrost base position in the geological section salinity of water and the concentration of major components have their minimum at the depth of about 100 160 m in the padun formation it could be explained as a zone of the glacial meltwater penetration during the ice age and also the modern recharge of groundwater in the padun formation from the lateral part of the northern dvina valley the recharge area is located about 30 km to northeast 5 2 assessment of the degree of participation of melt glacial and meteoric waters in the processes of formation of groundwater composition and correction of their dating fresh waters in the padun formation of the vendian aquifers and in the kimberlite aquifers were formed due to the infiltration of precipitation in the recharge areas at the watersheds see fig 1c d as part of the oldest freshwaters a melt water of the last glacial period is present near the river valleys they increased their salinity by mixing with the relict waters of the mikulinian transgression mixing proportions table 3 are up to 2 of seawater up to 16 of glacial water and 84 98 of the interglacial water the 14c и 234u 238u age of this water ranges from modern to 11 8 1 6 ka holocene table s2 the waters from the mikulinian sea do not contain radiocarbon and the uranium content in the reducing conditions of the pore waters is extremely low n 10 2 μg l 1 however their influence on freshwater dating is insignificant up to about 2 due to the small share of sea water in the total mixture and therefore it can be ignored slightly brackish water in the quaternary aquifer is formed in a similar way these waters are enclosed in a layer of sandy gravel deposits of the last glacial period lying on clayey deposits of the mikulinian sea and are overlain by moraine boulder loams they are a mixture 5 7 seawater 8 15 glacial water and 78 87 interglacial water the 14c age of this water ranges from 7 53 0 18 to 16 2 0 26 ka holocene late pleistocene table s2 given the dilution of fresh water glacial and interglacial by very old seawaters that do not contain radiocarbon the 14c age of the slightly brackish water in the quaternary aquifers will be less by about 5 7 slightly brackish thermal waters sampled in the subpolar urals were formed by fresh water flowing through the deep parts of the aquifer system where it mixed with brine followed by discharge mixing proportions table 3 correspond to those obtained from hydrochemical data 1 brine and 99 fresh water malov et al 2015 however according to the isotope data fresh water is formed by mixing of 74 meteoric interglacial water and 25 glacial water associated with melting permafrost malov 2018b the 14c age cal bp of the thermal water determined according to the method of han and plummer 2013 ranges from 5 44 0 48 to 6 97 0 9 ka malov et al 2015 table s2 slightly brackish water in the padun formation of vendian aquifer brackish1 malov 2018a shows that according to hydrochemical data the sea waters of the mikulinian interglacial were mixed with brackish1 forming saline waters salty vpd consequently before this mixing brackish1 could not be salinized by seawater and their mineralization was increased apparently due to the brines discharging from underlying aquifers fig 1d overall brackish1 contains 3 of brines 8 19 glacial water and 78 89 interglacial water table 3 approximately the same composition is typical for the water from the 2bab well gerber et al 2017 which is similar in salinity and isotopic composition see table 1 figs 2 and 3 the contents of radiocarbon in brackish1 and in water from the 2bab well are also close 1 70 0 26 pmc and 2 8 0 1 pmc respectively gerber et al 2017 the age of the freshwater component in brackish1 is defined previously see table s2 26 2 3 9 to 32 96 2 3 ka while its age in the 2bab well determined by 81kr is much higher 407 27 ka gerber et al 2017 below we return to the discussion of this discrepancy salty water salty vmz is formed by diluting the brines discharging from underlying aquifers with fresh water fig 1 d malov 2018a their composition is formed by mixing 10 17 brine 3 13 glacial water and 77 87 interglacial water it is similar to the composition of water from the 1bab well gerber et al 2017 in terms of salinity and isotopic composition see table 1 figs 2 and 3 234u 238u age of the fresh component of the salty vmz can be up to 307 115 ka which is close to dating the meteoric component of water in the 1bab well 541 28 ka gerber et al 2017 table s2 that is the composition of the salty vmz was formed during that period which may include the holocene lp and mp it is noteworthy that malov 2018a notes the chlorine content of 31 230 mg l 1 table s1 in the brine end member which was taken from the analysis of a water sample from the se well see fig 1b therefore 25 50 of brines and 75 50 of fresh water were present in the calculated mixture in the present paper we take the chlorine content in the brine end member to be 90 000 mg l table 2 due to the lack of data on the isotopic composition of diluted brines in the se well therefore 10 17 of brines and 90 83 of fresh water are present in the calculated mixture the maximum proportion of glacial water is characteristic of salty vpd 19 51 in this case the meteor component is absent in most samples the share of sea water is 49 76 an exception are the wells i3 and vo2013 in which the proportion of interglacial water is large table 3 shows data on the water proportions in the vo well immediately after its drilling 2006 sample vo2006 and after seven years of artesian discharge of waters to the surface 2013 sample vo2013 it can be seen that during this period the share of sea water decreased by 16 due to their replacement by modern meteoric waters that is there was a breakthrough of the fresh water tongue to the well vo this tongue may have been formed in the holocene and it could be coming from the recharge area located on the watershed see fig 1d an apparently similar situation is observed for the i3 well further it is noteworthy that if salty water salty vpd is a mixture of mikulino seawater and brackish1 then the absence of the meteoric component in salty vpd indicates that this component was also absent in brackish1 and the glacial component was 97 that is the age of these glacial brackish1 waters was older than that shown in table s2 as the age of the interglacial brackish1 water 30 ka late pleistocene the glacial brackish1 water age was probably also older than that of the mikulino seawater 130 ka that is if the period between the last glacial maximum lgm and moskovian late saalian glacial was assumed to be completely interglacial the most likely possibility was glacial brackish1 water formation in the middle pleistocene see section 4 2 which corresponds to the dating of water from the well 2bab 407 27 ka gerber et al 2017 in this case the chemical composition of both types of brackish1 water glacial brackish1 and interglacial brackish1 should have been similar brackish water brackish2 is a mixture of salty vpd and fresh water at a ratio of 1 2 1 4 4 according to hydrochemical data malov 2018a therefore their composition contains a mixture of 11 21 seawater 8 26 glacial water and 53 78 interglacial water table 3 the age of formation of the observed present day composition of these waters is 25 1 0 7 to 39 2 6 3 ka table s2 lp for the vendian rocks located in the western part of the mezen syneclise interval from 100 to 600 m a zone with brackish and salt water with a tds content of less than 35 g l 1 has been established fig 8 i e this zone is characterized by the penetration of fresh infiltration waters and the dilution of marine sedimentogenic waters and brines malov 2004 there is reason to believe that this zone was formed by the intrusion of glacial meltwater and interglacial freshwater into the mezen syneclise and contains a mixture of fresh water with brines type salty vmz in tables s1 and s2 6 conclusion the isotopic composition of groundwater of various chemical types was studied on the eastern slope of the baltic shield arkhangelsk region nw russia where repeated continental glaciations and marine transgressions in pleistocene and holocene have impacted on groundwater systems this means that there was an intensive and rapid recharge of aquifers after the glacial periods calculations of mixing assuming δ18o and cl abundance in four end member is known are used to quantify fractions of brine seawater glacial meltwater and interglacial meteoric water in the composition of various types of groundwater the obtained results reflect the evolution of groundwater on the way from the middle pleistocene to the present day during the middle pleistocene due to thawing ice sheets the glacial meltwater penetrated to a depth of 600 m in the western part of the mezen syneclise at this time brines in the lower part of the vendian aquifer mezen suite were diluted by fresh water and glacial meltwater dominated in the upper part of the vendians aquifer padun suite the eemian sea transgression 115 130 ka occurred immediately after this the porewater of eemian marine clays and upper part of vendian sediments under clays now contains the salty water s 25 g l 1 with maximal enrichment by heavy isotopes δ18o 7 7 and δ2h 98 9 on average this groundwater is a mixture of 19 51 glacial meltwater and 49 81 seawater the meltwater of the last glacial period is visible in fresh and slightly brackish water of the vendian and quaternary aquifers isotope composition of the fresh water is close to the annual mean of modern precipitations fresh water is a mixture of 2 seawater up to 16 glacial water and 84 100 holocene water the age of this water is in the range from the present day to 11 8 1 6 ka the majority of uncertainties are related to the uranium isotope dating of groundwater in uranium reduction conditions the analysis of the evolution of the chemical and isotope composition of groundwater the analysis of the geological and hydrogeological history of the region the hydraulic estimates of groundwater flow rates in the aquifers the hydrodynamic and balance justifications of the groundwater formation and the analysis of the composition of stable isotopes confirms in our opinion provide reliability in dating the most important milestones in the context of this article nevertheless in the future it would be advisable to study the distribution of the contents of sr isotopes and noble gases in groundwater in order to clarify the proportions of brines and seawater in their composition and to specify the timing of their mixing with glacial and meteoric waters future studies should also be continued to assess the retardation factor and recoil loss factor in order to improve the uranium isotope method of dating groundwater in uranium oxidizing conditions declaration of competing
