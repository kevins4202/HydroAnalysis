4955,how plants thrive in a cloud immersed environment where leaves are intermittently wet and the environmental conditions that drive transpiration and growth are limited raises a relevant question in fog affected ecosystems in order to provide insight into how cloud immersion and fog interception may affect macaronesian laurisilva forests micrometeorological variables artificial fog water collection throughfall soil water content and the altitude of the trade wind inversion layer together with the hourly sap flow q t of a dominant tree species myrica faya were measured at an exposed site of the anaga massif rural park biosphere reserve tenerife canary islands over a period of one year foggy conditions led to a 45 1 reduction in global radiation and a more than a 10 fold decrease in sap flow throughout all day hours m faya showed a weak control of the transpiration rate and a profligate water use strategy such that a substantial night time sap flow q tn was observed under high nocturnal atmospheric evaporative demand representing 23 3 of the total daily q t even though fog was more frequent at night fog water interception resulted in canopy wetting and dripping for at least 55 0 of the time and an associated downward xylematic sap transport in the most apical branches i e in foliar water uptake this represented 4 0 of the upward sap flow and was observed in 26 7 of the hourly q t records nocturnal transpiration was also enhanced by the entry of previous foliar moisture this general plant and climatic phenomenology was related at the mesoscale with the trade wind inversion height in the subtropical macaronesia area keywords canary islands climate change fog laurisilva nocturnal fluxes radial sap flow profile stratocumulus cloud layer subtropical forest transpiration 1 introduction in high altitude islands across the macaronesian region and associated to a quasi stable stratocumulus layer develops a unique cloud forest known as laurisilva this fog immersed environment is originated by the orographic adiabatic cooling of wet air driven by the trade winds that stops its ascension due to the presence of a thermal inversion at 1200 1600 m a s l font tullot 1956 the latter is a consequence derived from the vertical structure of the troposphere at these subtropical latitudes and the subsidence associated with the descending branch of the general circulation northern hadley cell carrillo et al 2016 changes in the stratocumulus base altitude would thus be expected to have a large repercussion in cloud forests distribution sperling et al 2004 van beusekom et al 2017 ritter et al 2019 the presence of this type of vegetation in the macaronesian region dates back to the quaternary ice age when as a consequence of the climate change that took place laurel forests sought refuge in more favourable climatic conditions of the north atlantic archipelagos in canaries azores and madeira axelrod 1975 gioda et al 1995 therefore the current macaronesian laurisilva ecosystem comprises a humic endemic vegetation reminiscent of the laurophyllous forests originally spread along the mediterranean basin and northwestern african coast during the neogene era rodríguez sánchez and arroyo 2008 kondraskov et al 2015 these forests are frequently immersed in low clouds or fog and despite the rather low pluviometry of the area especially in summer some of their tree species have been denoted as non conservative in their water use strategy lösch 1993 due to poor stomatal control gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002 this may have not been a limitation during the neogene period when precipitations were concentrated in the warm season fernández palacios et al 2011 but raises questions as to how the vegetation currently survives under the contemporary dryer conditions with such a profligate water use behavior typical of plants subjected to only mild or short duration drought periods noticeably such a weak stomatal control has been also reported in other cloud associated ecosystems as it is the case of the redwood forests distributed along the californian and oregon coastline burgess and dawson 2004 or the taiwanese yellow cypress montane cloud forests chu et al 2014 as a consequence of such frequent fog occurrence an assumption has persisted to this day and this is that fog water interception may extensively supplement the reduced soil water inputs by rainwater in these macaronesian laurel forests despite a lack of experimental support ritter and regalado 2013 in fact this possibility was early discarded by the pioneering work of kämmer 1974 in the anaga cloud forests of tenerife canary islands and subsequent studies in la gomera canary islands have also minimized its contribution ritter et al 2008 katata et al 2009 regalado and ritter 2013b thus alternative hypotheses have been postulated for the role of the presence of fog in these forests such as the possibility of intercepted water droplets being incorporated through leaves this has not yet been confirmed in any of the numerous laurel forest tree species but foliar water uptake has been earlier reported in other cloud forest species such as sequoia sempervirens simonin et al 2009 and drimys brasiliensis eller et al 2013 in common amazonian tree genera binks et al 2019 and in phanerophyte species of a brazilian rupestrian field boanares et al 2019 being considered a widespread phenomenon across different plants berry et al 2019 nevertheless given the expected small volumes of deposited fog water and the presumable limited extent of the downward transport foliar water uptake may be restricted to locally improving the water status of leaves and tip branches thus preventing xylem cavitation therefore its relative contribution to the overall hydration of adult trees under natural conditions remains to be evaluated since leaf wetting has manifold associated effects dawson and goldsmith 2018 for instance the presence of a foliar water film may reduce transpiration by cooling the leaves and modifying their boundary layer conductance schuepp 1993 gerlein safdi et al 2018 it would also affect co2 diffusivity and thus photosynthesis although this may depend on leaf hydrophobicity stomata anatomy and location either adaxially or abaxially aparecido et al 2017 pariyar et al 2017 laurel trees have glossy pointed hypostomatic leaves borgesen 1924 marrero and nogales 2005 and this may be an adaptation of intermittently wetted vegetation in dealing with the otherwise presumable associated reduction in photosynthesis additionally fog water interception by the canopy is strongly affected by exposure and wind shading landsberg and powell 1973 giambelluca et al 2011 leading to the coexistence of wet and dry areas within the canopy shuttleworth 1977 katata et al 2008 lhomme and montes 2014 nevertheless that such coexistence of wet and dry parts of the vegetation has been observed with cut leaves saplings or potted plants artificially wetted under controlled conditions does not necessarily imply that canopy wetting may be relevant in well developed trees in their natural environment this is so because the timing day or night seasonality frequency amount source mist fog dew or rain or the mechanisms that lead to canopy wetting interception of droplets gravitational deposition condensation are decisive in this respect berry et al 2014 in this regard a methodological limitation stems from the fact that determining the degree and dynamics of canopy wetting in the field is difficult since commercial artificial wetness sensors do not accurately mimic the actual leaves nor provide representative quantitative information burgess and dawson 2004 reinhardt and smith 2008 chu et al 2014 alternatively measuring throughfall with a series of gauges placed below the canopy either at fixed positions or randomly relocated zimmermann et al 2010 ritter and regalado 2010 may provide information about canopy wetting if free throughfall is not significant otherwise concomitant meteorological variables during fog events such as visibility cloud covering vapour pressure deficit vpd or artificial fog water collection may be used as an indicator of vegetation wetting by assuming that the appropriate environmental conditions will lead to water saturation of the canopy up to some extent merriam 1973 joslin et al 1990 chang et al 2006 pryet et al 2012 domínguez et al 2017 regalado and ritter 2019 while the consequences of fog interception by the vegetation remain elusive on the contrary a process that has been well recognised from continuous field measurements with sap flow sensors inserted in different laurel tree species is that fog events considerably lessen plant water loses due to transpiration by diminishing the incoming solar radiation ambient temperature and vapour pressure deficit ritter et al 2009 2019 a foggy environment may thus permit carbon assimilation without significant dehydration in laurel trees which are well adapted to umbrophilous conditions already exhibiting maximal stomatal conductance under low radiation gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002 ritter and regalado 2017 plant water relations may be interpreted as a trade off between such carbon assimilation via photosynthesis and the water losses due to transpiration however the benefits of having the stomata opened during darkness cannot be explained in such terms and thus alternative roles for night time transpiration have been proposed zeppel et al 2014 in some instances it has even been assumed that it is a non adaptive consequence of the aforementioned weak stomatal control and thus of the leaky stomata pores and their inability to close seibt et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 other studies however indicate that night time conductance is genetically determined and therefore subjected to natural selection christman et al 2008 rémy et al 2014 resco de dios et al 2016 nocturnal sap flow though is not only indicative of night time soil water depletion since water movement may also take place from the discharge of internal reservoirs zeppel et al 2010 oliva carrasco et al 2014 there has been some debate about whether sap movement during the night is partly controlled by circadian rhythms barbour et al 2005 or by abiotic drivers such as soil water content ambient temperature vpd or wind benyon 1999 feild and holbrook 2000 howard and donovan 2007 phillips et al 2010 rosado et al 2012 alvarado barrientos et al 2015 karpul and west 2016 kupper et al 2018 the response of stomatal conductance to changes in ambient humidity and temperature in darkness has been shown to be indistinguishable from that during daylight mott and peak 2010 so is the case of soil water content and vpd zeppel et al 2011 furthermore night time sap flow is not simply a proportion of diurnal transpiration zeppel et al 2012 although some authors have suggested that species with inherently high diurnal stomatal conductance also exhibit increased nocturnal conductance and transpiration snyder et al 2003 with regard to the techniques used to detect nocturnal transpiration thermometric methods have been extensively employed for sap flow monitoring and have made it possible to identify the existence of night time xylematic water transport across a wide range of plant species caird et al 2007 detection of night time sap flow depends on correctly establishing a true zero flow setting it is also crucial to use a sap flow system that can reliably detect low flow rates both conditions are also required to accurately quantify the aforementioned reverse transport of water incorporation through the leaves forster 2014 this is not a trivial issue since negative flows may be attributed to an erroneous up shifted zero baseline burgess and dawson 2004 conversely nighty flows may be falsified if the null reference value is obtained from dark hours readings feild and holbrook 2000 regalado and ritter 2007 parameter uncertainty is not taken into account cf fig 11 in ritter and regalado 2017 or probes are misaligned ren et al 2017 the objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of diurnal and night time sap flow in a tree species of the evergreen macaronesian laurel forests the consequences of the frequent immersion of the vegetation into the cloud and the associated fog phenomena leading to wetting of the canopy are aimed in order to explain the role that these may have on the survival of this relict ecosystem the lack of previous experimental results providing sufficient evidence that interception of fog droplets by the laurisilva canopy represents a significant water input to the soil has motivated this work in order to understand how a vegetation prodigal in its use of water may benefit from a foggy environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the anaga massif rural park biosphere reserve tenerife

2014 until 31st august 2015 hrm30 sap flow sensors ict international pty ltd armidale australia based on the heat ratio method hrm were inserted in different branches of m faya from the most apical down to secondary branches and in the main trunk at breast height each hrm30 system consists of three 35 mm long needles two of them are temperature probes with thermocouples situated at 7 5 mm referred hereon as i and where denotes the branch diameter in millimeters and 22 5 mm e from the needle tip the first 5 mm of the needle are considered inactive the hrm30 thus permits estimates of low zero and bidirectional sap flow at two xylematic depths aided with silicon grease needles were radially inserted in predrilled holes opened using a guide to facilitate alignment equidistantly from the centered heating probe at x 6 mm up and down stream in those branches smaller than the total length of the sap flow needles 35 mm the air exposed portion was protected with polyurethane foam in any case each needle triplet was shielded with an enveloping solar deflector to minimize possible external effects on the readings by ambient temperature fluctuations wetting or heating by direct insolation the hrm estimates the heat pulse velocity v h cm h 1 from the ratio in temperature rise at the downstream t d and upstream t u probes as a consequence of a point source discrete heat pulse

99 7 during the frequent fog and low cloud periods and lower during days when no fog was collected 34 9 74 3 clouds are driven by the ne trade winds and this may explain why average wind speeds were higher during days with fwc events foggy days i e 4 8 vs 3 5 m s 1 table 1 total cumulative rainfall was 1827 mm being november the rainiest period with 560 mm while september 2014 and april july 2015 were the driest months with a total cumulative precipitation of only 261 mm this may be considered a wet year period due to the large contribution of an atypical rainy november with 56 19 mm month 1 and 1130 281 mm year 1 being the average precipitation in november and annually respectively at the site ritter et al 2019 throughfall was 1219 mm representing 66 7 of the rainfall registered during the period 3 2 fog frequency characterization fwc occurred with a frequency of 81 i e fog water collection was observed in 294 out of the 365 days during those foggy days fwc distributed such that 2 h was the most frequent class interval 31 8 of the days with bins 2 h being rather homogeneously distributed between 5 7 and 9 6 up to 18 h days with 22 foggy hours were only 0 27 of the total fig 1 fog water collection was more frequent during the morning and in the afternoon until night no much variability in fwc frequency was observed across foggy hours i e hourly periods with accounted fwc events ranging between 3 and 5 fwc frequency was reduced during mid day down to 2 9 at 14 00 h fig 2 a cumulative fwc for the whole period followed the hourly distribution across the day shown in fig 2b exhibiting large differences in fwc between valley mid day hours and peak night hours comparison of these two figures indicates that not only fog water collection events were less frequent around noon but also that during those central hours the liquid water content lwc may be lower such a characteristic v shape fog occurrence frequency hourly pattern has been also reported in previous studies eugster et al 2006 obregon et al 2011 regalado and ritter 2017 ritter and regalado 2017 higher temperatures during mid day may lead to evaporation of fog droplets and cloud thinning reducing the lwc and thus the probability of fog water collection 3 3 fog incidence and cloud immersion the trade wind inversion was higher at 12utc than during night cf fig 3 a b this leads to less frequent cloud immersion of the site during midday and consequently the occurrence of fwc will decrease fig 2 the monthly cumulative fog water collected across the period started with lower fwc values of 48 6 l m 2 in september 2014 reaching higher peak totals during summer 2015 with an absolute maximum of 646 l m 2 in july total annual fwc was 3304 l m 2 the frequency of fog occurrence followed a similar trend increasing from 12 5 at the beginning of the period up to 44 8 in august 2015 fig 3c such a fwc distribution across the studied period may be explained in terms of the monthly variation in the median altitude of the trade wind inversion this is coincidental with the study site throughout summer during which it is situated at a lower altitude fig 3a b a period of high subsidence strengthening of the inversion over the sub tropical north atlantic region carrillo et al 2016 the nocturnal variability in the altitude of the trade wind inversion bottom layer may partly explain the rather large fwc values registered in november 230 l m 2 34 1 fig 3a the presence of low clouds or cloud immersion is a prerequisite for fog water collection i e number of foggy hours but the lwc and wind velocity are relevant variables that will affect fwc regalado and ritter 2019 and thus will define the actual fog water monthly distribution observed during the studied period for instance higher wind speeds were registered in july results not shown and this would reinforce fwc during that month cf fig 3c a seasonal trend confirmed by a recent long term study 1948 2014 which showed a strengthening of the trade winds in late spring summer and a weakening in winter spring autumn below the inversion layer azorin molina et al 2018 large vpd 1 kpa values were associated with the trade wind inversion being located below the experimental site height at 1015 m a s l fig 4 this is expected as the atmosphere above the top of the trade wind inversion comprises an area with low moisture carrillo et al 2016 this has consequences at the mesoscale on the canopy transpiration especially at night as discussed in the next section 3 4 fog affected sap flow figs 5 7 show some examples of the v s course during selected periods further examples are included in the supplementary material sap velocity was affected by fog such that fwc was concomitant with a significant decrease in v s meaningful fog events were detected not only at the fog gauge fig 5c 7c but also as throughfall fig 5d 7d a lower bound of fog water dripping occurrence estimated as the number of hours when water was detected on the ground gauges in the absence of rainfall for the whole period of study yielded a frequency of 55 0 this is indicative that the vegetation often intercepts fog water droplets that after coalescing fall below despite this fog water dripping volumes were small amounting to only 195 5 mm year 1 representing 16 0 of the total throughfall mean global solar radiation rg was decreased proportionally to about half 54 9 during foggy events across all day hours for the whole annual period fig 8 a this rg decline together with a reduction in vpd fig 5e 7e would be responsible for the lower sap flow rates observed during diurnal foggy events fig 5g 7g consequently mass sap flow qt was reduced by about an order of magnitude at every hour of the day both in total fig 8b and mean terms fig 8c during foggy conditions for the whole period investigated 3 5 nocturnal and downward sap flow sap flow was also observed during night time coincidental with an increase in vpd 1 kpa and the absence of fog figs 5 7 show some instances when nocturnal sap velocity v sn values were meaningful during consecutive nights of high vpd reaching at some point during the hours of darkness up to 40 of the maximum v s detected during the day thus far from being testimonial night time sap flow was a relevant and frequent phenomenon if the appropriate environmental conditions were given for the annual period investigated the nocturnal sap flow q tn represented on average 23 3 of the total daily q t the median value was 17 1 and the 25th and 75th percentiles were 8 7 and 29 7 respectively in general v sn was proportional and followed the course of vpd however some exceptions to such a response were observed for instance during the period doy 295 299 v sn values on the first night were higher than the nights that follow it despite the fact that vpd was lower at doy 295 fig 5 a similar trend occurred during the nocturnal period doy 455 458 fig 6 and doy 495 499 fig 7 we propose the following hypothesis for explaining this in all cases the preceding nights before doy 294 doy 454 and doy 494 water was registered either at the raingauge or the fog water gauge thus presumably the vegetation remained wet for some period afterwards as a consequence of rain fog droplet interception part of that deposited water may have been incorporated through leaves and this would lead to a higher water content of the canopy increasing leaf water potential and hence enhancing transpiration during those first dryer nights doy 295 doy 455 and doy 495 if this was the case downward sap flow may take place in the most apical branches during the foggy periods consistently negative v s values were registered during doy 295 doy 455 and doy 495 by the sensor inserted in a upper small 17 mm apical twig situated at 3 m from the ground these remained unnoticed by the sensors placed at branches below i e 32 and 48 hence this suggests that the downstream flow remained localized on the tree top fig 5g 7g compared to the upward sap flow measured in the apical 17 mm branch for the whole annual period of the study the downward sap flow q t 0 represented 4 0 and was observed in 26 7 of the hourly records 3 6 water storage dynamics the difference between the normalized sap flow at the crown and at the base of the stem i e δ q t q t c r o w n q t b a s e provides an indication of the course of either stem water refilling or stem water losses due to transpiration along the day most of the nights with significant sap flow corresponded to nocturnal periods of dehydration when water was presumably withdrawn from internal reservoirs i e δ q t 0 in fig 5f 7f 3 7 radial distribution of sap flow daily sap flow density qs kg cm 2 day 1 varied between the outer part of the xylem with respect to the more internal conduits i e at 12 5 mm and 27 5 mm sapwood depth median daily q s values varied from 0 073 kg cm 2 day 1 48e and 0 102 kg cm 2 day 1 79e down to 0 057 kg cm 2 day 1 48i and 0 043 kg cm 2 day 1 79i fig 9 the in out ratios of the median q s during morning 7 00 12 00 noon 12 00 16 00 and late afternoon 16 00 20 00 under fog free conditions n 71 varied little i e 79i 79e 34 36 and 48i 48e 70 77 and were similar to those at night q sn 79i 79e 38 and 48i 48e 81 thus we may consider that the radial sap flow profile remained almost invariable across the day for the annual period investigated changes in the radial sap flow distribution have been previously related to the different evaporative demand radiation and vpd that occurs across the day nadezhdina et al 2002 ford et al 2004b fiora and cescatti 2006 and have been shown both in cut stems and on living trees to be more pronounced as the sap flow density increases steppe et al 2010 this is why we selected only fog free conditions i e negligible fwc detected for the above comparison because as shown in fig 2 fog was more frequent in the morning and late afternoon and thus concurrent effects could mask presumable diel variations of the radial sap flow trend 3 8 soil water content soil water availability has also been suggested to affect the radial profile of sap flow phillips et al 2002 ford et al 2004a yi et al 2017 the hourly volumetric swc θ at our site reflected the rainfall distribution fig 10 a increased with soil depth median θ in the top layers was 0 412 θ median 0 436 m3 m 3 vs 0 497 θ median 0 535

conditions during the summer minimum swc measured was θ min 0 321 m3 m 3 however no consistent changes of the in out q s ratios were obtained with variations in θ on a daily basis or as maxima and median q s of wet and dry months 4 discussion 4 1 the high nocturnal transpiration of m faya evidences weak stomatal control cloud forests such as the laurisilva present in the macaronesian biogeographic region are affected by fog but it has not yet been resolved whether this environment represents a limitation for carbon assimilation and growth and or if it facilitates water interception and reduces water losses in trees the current study reinforces previous evidence about laurel tree species having poor stomatal control in particular substantial night time sap flow has been reported here for m faya the nocturnal rate of transpiration was shown to be affected by the environmental conditions such that during nights of elevated evaporative demand and absence of fog the plant exhibited high levels of sap flow furthermore nocturnal sap flow q tn was enhanced during nights preceded by rain or fog even though vpd was lower as it has been also reported in a tmcf in central veracruz mexico alvarado barrientos et al 2015 similarly stomatal conductance was increased when preceded by canopy wetting intervals in a taiwanese yellow cypress montane cloud forests chu et al 2014 our results suggest that the preceding downward sap flow may be responsible for the subsequent increased q tn due to plant hydration for the annual period investigated q tn represented 23 3 of the total daily q t in our case thus this is within the upper range of the average q tn q t percentage of 12 03 reported for almost one hundred other plant species being closer to tropical and equatorial than to mediterranean biomes forster 2014 i e to ecosystems no subjected to prolonged dry periods noticeably large q tn q t ratios were reported for some plant species in a costa rican elfin cloud forest feild and holbrook 2000 and in a mexican tmcf alvarado barrientos et al 2015 previous field gas exchange measurements in leaves of m faya have confirmed this is more alike to humid tropical forests than mediterranean evergreen tree species in their response to environmental conditions 4 2 a stable radial distribution of sap flow is compatible with the anisohydric behaviour sap flow density qs decreased radially being higher in the external vascular conduits this is consistent with previous results showing a sigmodial like radial distribution of sap flow in different laurel species including m faya characterized by an active external vascular system and a less conductive tissue inside jiménez et al 2000 see also ritter and regalado 2017 however the results of jiménez et al 2000 were restricted to a short field campaign during a few days in late february 1998 and thus no information was available on whether or not this radial pattern would change with time or the environmental conditions the outer xylem in laurel tree species has been suggested to be connected to exposed parts of the crown with higher transpiration rates while inner sapwood layers would be associated with shaded canopy areas jiménez et al 2000 shifting of the in out radial qs distribution would require high water potential gradients i e increased transpiration conditions in order to pull water from inner conduits with greater hydraulic resistance ford et al 2004b several hypotheses have been proposed for such shifting in the radial sap flow distribution ford et al 2004b dragoni et al 2009 but a definitive consensus has not yet been reached however the radial qs distribution remained stable over time in m faya regardless of changes in the meteorological conditions associated with fog and despite seasonal variations in the soil water content this was also the case in some previous studies where either no distinction was observed in some trees or the alleged inner outer differences were supported by scattered data cf fig 6 in ford et al 2004a however some authors have reported changes in the radial distribution of sap flow in other species phillips et al 2002 ford et al 2004a 2004b dragoni et al 2009 nevertheless our observations may be in agreement with those of yi et al 2017 who showed that when drought and non drought conditions were compared large differences in the inner vs outer xylematic transport were observed in isohydric trees but not so in anisohydric oak species in line with the profligate water use strategy and weak stomatal control to vpd of laurel tree species 4 3 the drawbacks of the anisohydric behaviour are compensated by the foggy environment the anisohydric behaviour permits maintenance of the carbon assimilation rate and sustained growth at the cost of a higher risk of hydraulic failure due to cavitation however such a possibility would be minimized in the cloud immersed environment where laurel forests develop on the one hand vpd remained low most of the time especially at night and radiation was reduced during fog events thus decreasing the driving energy available for transpiration on the other hand fog water interception would cool leaves modify the boundary layer conductance and the stomatal gas exchange may be reduced due to the presence of a canopy water film the latter however may be compensated by the subsequent evaporation of the intercepted water this may promote leaf conductance by increasing the relative humidity of the air around the surface of the leaves thus alleviating the stress level within the canopy and consequently enhancing carbon assimilation rate chu et al 2014 katata 2014 all this constrained by stomata distribution leaf morphology and wettability hypostomatic glossy lauroid in this case 4 4 fog water interception does not represent a significant soil water input the foggy conditions led not only to fog water interception that resulted in wetting and dripping of the canopy but also to a significant reduction in global radiation of 45 1 see fig 8a inset as previously reported in this regalado and ritter 2017 ritter et al 2008 2019 and other cloud forests eugster et al 2006 obregon et al 2011 bittencourt et al 2019 light attenuation though does not represent a severe limitation in laurel forest tree species already exhibiting maximal conductance at low irradiance around 20 μmol photons m2 s 1 gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002 ritter and regalado 2017 fog water interception was frequent 55 0 of the time but cumulative volumes were small 195 5 mm year 1 representing only 16 0 of the total throughfall and thus this did not affect the soil moisture content significantly whose increments were due to throughfall from rainfall previous studies in two heavily fog affected windy exposed sites of the anaga laurel forest registered 186 279 mm year 1 of fog water precipitation below the canopy kämmer 1974 and regalado and ritter 2013a reported that fog was 11 of the throughfall under a laurel forest in la gomera island thus our fog water throughfall values are close to those earlier ones relative to the gross incident precipitation throughfall represented in our case 66 7 which is in agreement with the 65 3 ratio earlier reported in a laurel forest in la gomera island ritter and regalado 2010 and it is also in consonance with other evergreen broad leaved forests masukata et al 1990 by contrast stemflow contribution to soil water content is expected to be negligible because such flux is small in this type of forest aboal et al 1999 4 5 intercepted fog water may be incorporated through leaves fog water interception and dripping were associated with a downward flow of sap in the most apical branches and therefore a presumed incorporation of intercepted water through the upper leaves this downward sap flow represented 4 0 and was observed in 26 7 of the time comparatively e g foliar water uptake was reported to represent 4 16 of all water transpired and took place 23 43 of the time in an oak species quercus lanceifolia dominating a tropical montane cloud forest tmcf in mexico gotsch et al 2014 in our case such downstream flow did not advance further down the crown in contrast in a series of experiments using sap flow gauges and labelled water it was previously suggested that foliar absorbed fog water by d brasiliensis travelled along the xylem from the leaves downward and reached the rhizosphere through roots eller et al 2013 however the difficulty in establishing a true zero for sap gauge measurements can lead to fictitious negative downward flows the fact that intercepted leaf water may arrive to the ground through the xylem was also suggested in araucaria angustifolia using deuterium enriched artificial mist cassana et al 2016 soil contamination with root fragments as recognized by these authors cf eller et al 2013 cassana et al 2016 and the fact that a bidirectional exchange of water isotopes can occur between leaves and the atmosphere goldsmith et al 2017 question these results berry et al 2019 in m faya the percentage of negative q t represented only 4 0 of the upward sap flow measured during the annual period monitored despite such small amounts this has been suggested as one of the roles of the leaf water uptake reported in e g d brasiliensis and s sempervirens cloud forests that is the improvement of the canopy water status and the refilling of embolized conduits dawson and goldsmith 2018 thus providing a safety mechanism for cavitation risks associated with the anisohydric behavior this would be relevant in our case since fog was more frequent during the summer when the possibility of a collapse of the xylematic water column would be greater due to the decrease in the soil water content and the greater evaporative demand at noon 4 6 mechanisms of leaf water intake the fact that the stomata remained opened at night and the weak stomatal control of laurel trees shared with other forest species affected by fog such as the californian redwood burgess and dawson 2004 the taiwanese yellow cypress montane cloud forests chu et al 2014 or members of the winteraceae family in the costa rican elfin forest feild and holbrook 2000 may be a consequence of incomplete closure of stomata due to asymmetrical guard cells noss 2000 or occluding stomatal wax deposits feild and holbrook 2000 seibt et al 2007 intercepted fog water may thus enter through the stomatal pores burkhardt et al 2012 the cuticle fernández et al 2017 or trichomes pina et al 2016 such as the glandular hairs present in m faya leaves marrero and nogales 2005 noticeably it was previously shown that fog droplets preferentially deposited on the epicuticular waxes occluding the epistomatal chamber of conifer needles jagels 1991 and so were aerosol particles burkhardt and eiden 1994 whose dissolution may promote the hydraulic connection between the deposited water film and the interior of the leaf through the stomata burkhardt et al 2012 the hydration of the leaves can also occur through the absorption of water vapor if the stomata remain open and the relative humidity is 100 vesala et al 2017 as would be the case during foggy periods the leaf distribution and large leaf area index of laurel forests morales et al 1996b and the inability to close stomata at night would facilitate such a water vapor intake the leaves of the laurel forests are mainly concentrated in the upper crown below which the green biomass is negligible morales et al 1996a such that this would maximize the foliar area exposed to fog and the intake of the intercepted water 4 7 fog dynamics is not only local but is related to the thermal inversion at the mesoscale the cloud immersion environment is not only local but has been shown to affect at the mesoscale level due to variations in the height of the thermal inversion at this subtropical latitude both during night day cycles and throughout the year this has been also observed at the luquillo cloud forest in puerto rico van beusekom et al 2017 and in the volcanic hawaiian archipelago which is located at a similar latitude to the canary islands and it is also affected by a persistent subsidence inversion mendonca and iwaoka 1969 grindinger 1992 cao et al 2007 thus the conclusions obtained here are expected to be applicable throughout the macaronesia and elsewhere with climate models that predict a downward shift in the altitude of the cloud base sperling et al 2004 and with the warmer conditions presently experienced in this area martín et al 2012 the current results have implications in such an scenario of climate change dryer and hotter conditions would imply larger transpiration rates during night and day but also less fog water interception and leaf water uptake 5 conclusions we found that despite being a small amount 195 5 mm year 1 which represents only 16 0 of the total throughfall fog water interception by a laurel forest was frequent and occurred at least half the time 55 0 associated with these fog events global solar radiation was reduced by almost half 54 9 concomitantly with a reduction of the mass sap flow qt in m faya by approximately one order of magnitude it was also observed that the intercepted water was ostensibly incorporated through the leaves leading to a downward flow of sap in the apical branches this negative flow did not progress further down the crown and although it occurred rather frequently 26 7 of the hourly q t records it only represented 4 0 of the upward qt such leaf water intake promoted tree transpiration an observation that is consistent with the hypothesis that intercepted cloud water uptake improves the canopy water status and prevents the potential risk of cavitation associated with a profligate water use strategy it was shown that m faya exhibited features compatible with such an anisohydric behavior and weak stomatal control such that vpd was observed to be the main driver of tree transpiration during the day while a significant night time sap flow q tn was detected under high nocturnal evaporative demand q tn represented up to 23 3 of the daily total q t despite the fact that foggy conditions and therefore a water vapor saturated environment were more frequent at night than at midday the conclusion here therefore is that the persistent fog at the site and the interception of droplets by the vegetation compensate for the non conservative water use followed by m faya despite a limited supply of rainwater in the area especially in summer this is achieved in two ways that is by reducing the frequency of environmental conditions that lead to high evaporative demand and by improving the water status at the leaf level as a counterpart the anisohydric behaviour would allow maintaining the rate of carbon assimilation and sustained growth this conclusion moves the focus of the role of fog interception in this and possibly other cloud forests from being a significant water input to the soil which we showed was not the case towards a mechanism that promotes growth it was shown that the dynamics of fog and fog water interception is associated with the mesoscale variations of the trade wind inversion height and therefore the conclusions obtained here may be applicable to other islands in the macaronesia region the associated consequences of climate change on the frequency and altitude shifting of this persistent cloud layer would thus be expected to affect the survival of these relict cloud forests additional material

4955,how plants thrive in a cloud immersed environment where leaves are intermittently wet and the environmental conditions that drive transpiration and growth are limited raises a relevant question in fog affected ecosystems in order to provide insight into how cloud immersion and fog interception may affect macaronesian laurisilva forests micrometeorological variables artificial fog water collection throughfall soil water content and the altitude of the trade wind inversion layer together with the hourly sap flow q t of a dominant tree species myrica faya were measured at an exposed site of the anaga massif rural park biosphere reserve tenerife canary islands over a period of one year foggy conditions led to a 45 1 reduction in global radiation and a more than a 10 fold decrease in sap flow throughout all day hours m faya showed a weak control of the transpiration rate and a profligate water use strategy such that a substantial night time sap flow q tn was observed under high nocturnal atmospheric evaporative demand representing 23 3 of the total daily q t even though fog was more frequent at night fog water interception resulted in canopy wetting and dripping for at least 55 0 of the time and an associated downward xylematic sap transport in the most apical branches i e in foliar water uptake this represented 4 0 of the upward sap flow and was observed in 26 7 of the hourly q t records nocturnal transpiration was also enhanced by the entry of previous foliar moisture this general plant and climatic phenomenology was related at the mesoscale with the trade wind inversion height in the subtropical macaronesia area keywords canary islands climate change fog laurisilva nocturnal fluxes radial sap flow profile stratocumulus cloud layer subtropical forest transpiration 1 introduction in high altitude islands across the macaronesian region and associated to a quasi stable stratocumulus layer develops a unique cloud forest known as laurisilva this fog immersed environment is originated by the orographic adiabatic cooling of wet air driven by the trade winds that stops its ascension due to the presence of a thermal inversion at 1200 1600 m a s l font tullot 1956 the latter is a consequence derived from the vertical structure of the troposphere at these subtropical latitudes and the subsidence associated with the descending branch of the general circulation northern hadley cell carrillo et al 2016 changes in the stratocumulus base altitude would thus be expected to have a large repercussion in cloud forests distribution sperling et al 2004 van beusekom et al 2017 ritter et al 2019 the presence of this type of vegetation in the macaronesian region dates back to the quaternary ice age when as a consequence of the climate change that took place laurel forests sought refuge in more favourable climatic conditions of the north atlantic archipelagos in canaries azores and madeira axelrod 1975 gioda et al 1995 therefore the current macaronesian laurisilva ecosystem comprises a humic endemic vegetation reminiscent of the laurophyllous forests originally spread along the mediterranean basin and northwestern african coast during the neogene era rodríguez sánchez and arroyo 2008 kondraskov et al 2015 these forests are frequently immersed in low clouds or fog and despite the rather low pluviometry of the area especially in summer some of their tree species have been denoted as non conservative in their water use strategy lösch 1993 due to poor stomatal control gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002 this may have not been a limitation during the neogene period when precipitations were concentrated in the warm season fernández palacios et al 2011 but raises questions as to how the vegetation currently survives under the contemporary dryer conditions with such a profligate water use behavior typical of plants subjected to only mild or short duration drought periods noticeably such a weak stomatal control has been also reported in other cloud associated ecosystems as it is the case of the redwood forests distributed along the californian and oregon coastline burgess and dawson 2004 or the taiwanese yellow cypress montane cloud forests chu et al 2014 as a consequence of such frequent fog occurrence an assumption has persisted to this day and this is that fog water interception may extensively supplement the reduced soil water inputs by rainwater in these macaronesian laurel forests despite a lack of experimental support ritter and regalado 2013 in fact this possibility was early discarded by the pioneering work of kämmer 1974 in the anaga cloud forests of tenerife canary islands and subsequent studies in la gomera canary islands have also minimized its contribution ritter et al 2008 katata et al 2009 regalado and ritter 2013b thus alternative hypotheses have been postulated for the role of the presence of fog in these forests such as the possibility of intercepted water droplets being incorporated through leaves this has not yet been confirmed in any of the numerous laurel forest tree species but foliar water uptake has been earlier reported in other cloud forest species such as sequoia sempervirens simonin et al 2009 and drimys brasiliensis eller et al 2013 in common amazonian tree genera binks et al 2019 and in phanerophyte species of a brazilian rupestrian field boanares et al 2019 being considered a widespread phenomenon across different plants berry et al 2019 nevertheless given the expected small volumes of deposited fog water and the presumable limited extent of the downward transport foliar water uptake may be restricted to locally improving the water status of leaves and tip branches thus preventing xylem cavitation therefore its relative contribution to the overall hydration of adult trees under natural conditions remains to be evaluated since leaf wetting has manifold associated effects dawson and goldsmith 2018 for instance the presence of a foliar water film may reduce transpiration by cooling the leaves and modifying their boundary layer conductance schuepp 1993 gerlein safdi et al 2018 it would also affect co2 diffusivity and thus photosynthesis although this may depend on leaf hydrophobicity stomata anatomy and location either adaxially or abaxially aparecido et al 2017 pariyar et al 2017 laurel trees have glossy pointed hypostomatic leaves borgesen 1924 marrero and nogales 2005 and this may be an adaptation of intermittently wetted vegetation in dealing with the otherwise presumable associated reduction in photosynthesis additionally fog water interception by the canopy is strongly affected by exposure and wind shading landsberg and powell 1973 giambelluca et al 2011 leading to the coexistence of wet and dry areas within the canopy shuttleworth 1977 katata et al 2008 lhomme and montes 2014 nevertheless that such coexistence of wet and dry parts of the vegetation has been observed with cut leaves saplings or potted plants artificially wetted under controlled conditions does not necessarily imply that canopy wetting may be relevant in well developed trees in their natural environment this is so because the timing day or night seasonality frequency amount source mist fog dew or rain or the mechanisms that lead to canopy wetting interception of droplets gravitational deposition condensation are decisive in this respect berry et al 2014 in this regard a methodological limitation stems from the fact that determining the degree and dynamics of canopy wetting in the field is difficult since commercial artificial wetness sensors do not accurately mimic the actual leaves nor provide representative quantitative information burgess and dawson 2004 reinhardt and smith 2008 chu et al 2014 alternatively measuring throughfall with a series of gauges placed below the canopy either at fixed positions or randomly relocated zimmermann et al 2010 ritter and regalado 2010 may provide information about canopy wetting if free throughfall is not significant otherwise concomitant meteorological variables during fog events such as visibility cloud covering vapour pressure deficit vpd or artificial fog water collection may be used as an indicator of vegetation wetting by assuming that the appropriate environmental conditions will lead to water saturation of the canopy up to some extent merriam 1973 joslin et al 1990 chang et al 2006 pryet et al 2012 domínguez et al 2017 regalado and ritter 2019 while the consequences of fog interception by the vegetation remain elusive on the contrary a process that has been well recognised from continuous field measurements with sap flow sensors inserted in different laurel tree species is that fog events considerably lessen plant water loses due to transpiration by diminishing the incoming solar radiation ambient temperature and vapour pressure deficit ritter et al 2009 2019 a foggy environment may thus permit carbon assimilation without significant dehydration in laurel trees which are well adapted to umbrophilous conditions already exhibiting maximal stomatal conductance under low radiation gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002 ritter and regalado 2017 plant water relations may be interpreted as a trade off between such carbon assimilation via photosynthesis and the water losses due to transpiration however the benefits of having the stomata opened during darkness cannot be explained in such terms and thus alternative roles for night time transpiration have been proposed zeppel et al 2014 in some instances it has even been assumed that it is a non adaptive consequence of the aforementioned weak stomatal control and thus of the leaky stomata pores and their inability to close seibt et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 other studies however indicate that night time conductance is genetically determined and therefore subjected to natural selection christman et al 2008 rémy et al 2014 resco de dios et al 2016 nocturnal sap flow though is not only indicative of night time soil water depletion since water movement may also take place from the discharge of internal reservoirs zeppel et al 2010 oliva carrasco et al 2014 there has been some debate about whether sap movement during the night is partly controlled by circadian rhythms barbour et al 2005 or by abiotic drivers such as soil water content ambient temperature vpd or wind benyon 1999 feild and holbrook 2000 howard and donovan 2007 phillips et al 2010 rosado et al 2012 alvarado barrientos et al 2015 karpul and west 2016 kupper et al 2018 the response of stomatal conductance to changes in ambient humidity and temperature in darkness has been shown to be indistinguishable from that during daylight mott and peak 2010 so is the case of soil water content and vpd zeppel et al 2011 furthermore night time sap flow is not simply a proportion of diurnal transpiration zeppel et al 2012 although some authors have suggested that species with inherently high diurnal stomatal conductance also exhibit increased nocturnal conductance and transpiration snyder et al 2003 with regard to the techniques used to detect nocturnal transpiration thermometric methods have been extensively employed for sap flow monitoring and have made it possible to identify the existence of night time xylematic water transport across a wide range of plant species caird et al 2007 detection of night time sap flow depends on correctly establishing a true zero flow setting it is also crucial to use a sap flow system that can reliably detect low flow rates both conditions are also required to accurately quantify the aforementioned reverse transport of water incorporation through the leaves forster 2014 this is not a trivial issue since negative flows may be attributed to an erroneous up shifted zero baseline burgess and dawson 2004 conversely nighty flows may be falsified if the null reference value is obtained from dark hours readings feild and holbrook 2000 regalado and ritter 2007 parameter uncertainty is not taken into account cf fig 11 in ritter and regalado 2017 or probes are misaligned ren et al 2017 the objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of diurnal and night time sap flow in a tree species of the evergreen macaronesian laurel forests the consequences of the frequent immersion of the vegetation into the cloud and the associated fog phenomena leading to wetting of the canopy are aimed in order to explain the role that these may have on the survival of this relict ecosystem the lack of previous experimental results providing sufficient evidence that interception of fog droplets by the laurisilva canopy represents a significant water input to the soil has motivated this work in order to understand how a vegetation prodigal in its use of water may benefit from a foggy environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the anaga massif rural park biosphere reserve tenerife

99 7 during the frequent fog and low cloud periods and lower during days when no fog was collected 34 9 74 3 clouds are driven by the ne trade winds and this may explain why average wind speeds were higher during days with fwc events foggy days i e 4 8 vs 3 5 m s 1 table 1 total cumulative rainfall was 1827 mm being november the rainiest period with 560 mm while september 2014 and april july 2015 were the driest months with a total cumulative precipitation of only 261 mm this may be considered a wet year period due to the large contribution of an atypical rainy november with 56 19 mm month 1 and 1130 281 mm year 1 being the average precipitation in november and annually respectively at the site ritter et al 2019 throughfall was 1219 mm representing 66 7 of the rainfall registered during the period 3 2 fog frequency characterization fwc occurred with a frequency of 81 i e fog water collection was observed in 294 out of the 365 days during those foggy days fwc distributed such that 2 h was the most frequent class interval 31 8 of the days with bins 2 h being rather homogeneously distributed between 5 7 and 9 6 up to 18 h days with 22 foggy hours were only 0 27 of the total fig 1 fog water collection was more frequent during the morning and in the afternoon until night no much variability in fwc frequency was observed across foggy hours i e hourly periods with accounted fwc events ranging between 3 and 5 fwc frequency was reduced during mid day down to 2 9 at 14 00 h fig 2 a cumulative fwc for the whole period followed the hourly distribution across the day shown in fig 2b exhibiting large differences in fwc between valley mid day hours and peak night hours comparison of these two figures indicates that not only fog water collection events were less frequent around noon but also that during those central hours the liquid water content lwc may be lower such a characteristic v shape fog occurrence frequency hourly pattern has been also reported in previous studies eugster et al 2006 obregon et al 2011 regalado and ritter 2017 ritter and regalado 2017 higher temperatures during mid day may lead to evaporation of fog droplets and cloud thinning reducing the lwc and thus the probability of fog water collection 3 3 fog incidence and cloud immersion the trade wind inversion was higher at 12utc than during night cf fig 3 a b this leads to less frequent cloud immersion of the site during midday and consequently the occurrence of fwc will decrease fig 2 the monthly cumulative fog water collected across the period started with lower fwc values of 48 6 l m 2 in september 2014 reaching higher peak totals during summer 2015 with an absolute maximum of 646 l m 2 in july total annual fwc was 3304 l m 2 the frequency of fog occurrence followed a similar trend increasing from 12 5 at the beginning of the period up to 44 8 in august 2015 fig 3c such a fwc distribution across the studied period may be explained in terms of the monthly variation in the median altitude of the trade wind inversion this is coincidental with the study site throughout summer during which it is situated at a lower altitude fig 3a b a period of high subsidence strengthening of the inversion over the sub tropical north atlantic region carrillo et al 2016 the nocturnal variability in the altitude of the trade wind inversion bottom layer may partly explain the rather large fwc values registered in november 230 l m 2 34 1 fig 3a the presence of low clouds or cloud immersion is a prerequisite for fog water collection i e number of foggy hours but the lwc and wind velocity are relevant variables that will affect fwc regalado and ritter 2019 and thus will define the actual fog water monthly distribution observed during the studied period for instance higher wind speeds were registered in july results not shown and this would reinforce fwc during that month cf fig 3c a seasonal trend confirmed by a recent long term study 1948 2014 which showed a strengthening of the trade winds in late spring summer and a weakening in winter spring autumn below the inversion layer azorin molina et al 2018 large vpd 1 kpa values were associated with the trade wind inversion being located below the experimental site height at 1015 m a s l fig 4 this is expected as the atmosphere above the top of the trade wind inversion comprises an area with low moisture carrillo et al 2016 this has consequences at the mesoscale on the canopy transpiration especially at night as discussed in the next section 3 4 fog affected sap flow figs 5 7 show some examples of the v s course during selected periods further examples are included in the supplementary material sap velocity was affected by fog such that fwc was concomitant with a significant decrease in v s meaningful fog events were detected not only at the fog gauge fig 5c 7c but also as throughfall fig 5d 7d a lower bound of fog water dripping occurrence estimated as the number of hours when water was detected on the ground gauges in the absence of rainfall for the whole period of study yielded a frequency of 55 0 this is indicative that the vegetation often intercepts fog water droplets that after coalescing fall below despite this fog water dripping volumes were small amounting to only 195 5 mm year 1 representing 16 0 of the total throughfall mean global solar radiation rg was decreased proportionally to about half 54 9 during foggy events across all day hours for the whole annual period fig 8 a this rg decline together with a reduction in vpd fig 5e 7e would be responsible for the lower sap flow rates observed during diurnal foggy events fig 5g 7g consequently mass sap flow qt was reduced by about an order of magnitude at every hour of the day both in total fig 8b and mean terms fig 8c during foggy conditions for the whole period investigated 3 5 nocturnal and downward sap flow sap flow was also observed during night time coincidental with an increase in vpd 1 kpa and the absence of fog figs 5 7 show some instances when nocturnal sap velocity v sn values were meaningful during consecutive nights of high vpd reaching at some point during the hours of darkness up to 40 of the maximum v s detected during the day thus far from being testimonial night time sap flow was a relevant and frequent phenomenon if the appropriate environmental conditions were given for the annual period investigated the nocturnal sap flow q tn represented on average 23 3 of the total daily q t the median value was 17 1 and the 25th and 75th percentiles were 8 7 and 29 7 respectively in general v sn was proportional and followed the course of vpd however some exceptions to such a response were observed for instance during the period doy 295 299 v sn values on the first night were higher than the nights that follow it despite the fact that vpd was lower at doy 295 fig 5 a similar trend occurred during the nocturnal period doy 455 458 fig 6 and doy 495 499 fig 7 we propose the following hypothesis for explaining this in all cases the preceding nights before doy 294 doy 454 and doy 494 water was registered either at the raingauge or the fog water gauge thus presumably the vegetation remained wet for some period afterwards as a consequence of rain fog droplet interception part of that deposited water may have been incorporated through leaves and this would lead to a higher water content of the canopy increasing leaf water potential and hence enhancing transpiration during those first dryer nights doy 295 doy 455 and doy 495 if this was the case downward sap flow may take place in the most apical branches during the foggy periods consistently negative v s values were registered during doy 295 doy 455 and doy 495 by the sensor inserted in a upper small 17 mm apical twig situated at 3 m from the ground these remained unnoticed by the sensors placed at branches below i e 32 and 48 hence this suggests that the downstream flow remained localized on the tree top fig 5g 7g compared to the upward sap flow measured in the apical 17 mm branch for the whole annual period of the study the downward sap flow q t 0 represented 4 0 and was observed in 26 7 of the hourly records 3 6 water storage dynamics the difference between the normalized sap flow at the crown and at the base of the stem i e δ q t q t c r o w n q t b a s e provides an indication of the course of either stem water refilling or stem water losses due to transpiration along the day most of the nights with significant sap flow corresponded to nocturnal periods of dehydration when water was presumably withdrawn from internal reservoirs i e δ q t 0 in fig 5f 7f 3 7 radial distribution of sap flow daily sap flow density qs kg cm 2 day 1 varied between the outer part of the xylem with respect to the more internal conduits i e at 12 5 mm and 27 5 mm sapwood depth median daily q s values varied from 0 073 kg cm 2 day 1 48e and 0 102 kg cm 2 day 1 79e down to 0 057 kg cm 2 day 1 48i and 0 043 kg cm 2 day 1 79i fig 9 the in out ratios of the median q s during morning 7 00 12 00 noon 12 00 16 00 and late afternoon 16 00 20 00 under fog free conditions n 71 varied little i e 79i 79e 34 36 and 48i 48e 70 77 and were similar to those at night q sn 79i 79e 38 and 48i 48e 81 thus we may consider that the radial sap flow profile remained almost invariable across the day for the annual period investigated changes in the radial sap flow distribution have been previously related to the different evaporative demand radiation and vpd that occurs across the day nadezhdina et al 2002 ford et al 2004b fiora and cescatti 2006 and have been shown both in cut stems and on living trees to be more pronounced as the sap flow density increases steppe et al 2010 this is why we selected only fog free conditions i e negligible fwc detected for the above comparison because as shown in fig 2 fog was more frequent in the morning and late afternoon and thus concurrent effects could mask presumable diel variations of the radial sap flow trend 3 8 soil water content soil water availability has also been suggested to affect the radial profile of sap flow phillips et al 2002 ford et al 2004a yi et al 2017 the hourly volumetric swc θ at our site reflected the rainfall distribution fig 10 a increased with soil depth median θ in the top layers was 0 412 θ median 0 436 m3 m 3 vs 0 497 θ median 0 535 m3 m 3 in the lower horizons fig 10b c varied across seasons being higher from november 2014 until march 2015 0 503 θ median 0 537 m3 m 3 and decreasing afterwards to minimum values during july 2015 θ median 0 347 m3 m 3 due to the lower rainfall fig 10d the soil reached saturation maximum swc measured was θ max 0 699 m3 m 3 with large rain events drying down to near wilting point moisture conditions during the summer minimum swc measured was θ min 0 321 m3 m 3 however no consistent changes of the in out q s ratios were obtained with variations in θ on a daily basis or as maxima and median q s of wet and dry months 4 discussion 4 1 the high nocturnal transpiration of m faya evidences weak stomatal control cloud forests such as the laurisilva present in the macaronesian biogeographic region are affected by fog but it has not yet been resolved whether this environment represents a limitation for carbon assimilation and growth and or if it facilitates water interception and reduces water losses in trees the current study reinforces previous evidence about laurel tree species having poor stomatal control in particular substantial night time sap flow has been reported here for m faya the nocturnal rate of transpiration was shown to be affected by the environmental conditions such that during nights of elevated evaporative demand and absence of fog the plant exhibited high levels of sap flow furthermore nocturnal sap flow q tn was enhanced during nights preceded by rain or fog even though vpd was lower as it has been also reported in a tmcf in central veracruz mexico alvarado barrientos et al 2015 similarly stomatal conductance was increased when preceded by canopy wetting intervals in a taiwanese yellow cypress montane cloud forests chu et al 2014 our results suggest that the preceding downward sap flow may be responsible for the subsequent increased q tn due to plant hydration for the annual period investigated q tn represented 23 3 of the total daily q t in our case thus this is within the upper range of the average q tn q t percentage of 12 03 reported for almost one hundred other plant species being closer to tropical and equatorial than to mediterranean biomes forster 2014 i e to ecosystems no subjected to prolonged dry periods noticeably large q tn q t ratios were reported for some plant species in a costa rican elfin cloud forest feild and holbrook 2000 and in a mexican tmcf alvarado barrientos et al 2015 previous field gas exchange measurements in leaves of m faya have confirmed this is more alike to humid tropical forests than mediterranean evergreen tree species in their response to environmental conditions 4 2 a stable radial distribution of sap flow is compatible with the anisohydric behaviour sap flow density qs decreased radially being higher in the external vascular conduits this is consistent with previous results showing a sigmodial like radial distribution of sap flow in different laurel species including m faya characterized by an active external vascular system and a less conductive tissue inside jiménez et al 2000 see also ritter and regalado 2017 however the results of jiménez et al 2000 were restricted to a short field campaign during a few days in late february 1998 and thus no information was available on whether or not this radial pattern would change with time or the environmental conditions the outer xylem in laurel tree species has been suggested to be connected to exposed parts of the crown with higher transpiration rates while inner sapwood layers would be associated with shaded canopy areas jiménez et al 2000 shifting of the in out radial qs distribution would require high water potential gradients i e increased transpiration conditions in order to pull water from inner conduits with greater hydraulic resistance ford et al 2004b several hypotheses have been proposed for such shifting in the radial sap flow distribution ford et al 2004b dragoni et al 2009 but a definitive consensus has not yet been reached however the radial qs distribution remained stable over time in m faya regardless of changes in the meteorological conditions associated with fog and despite seasonal variations in the soil water content this was also the case in some previous studies where either no distinction was observed in some trees or the alleged inner outer differences were supported by scattered data cf fig 6 in ford et al 2004a however some authors have reported changes in the radial distribution of sap flow in other species phillips et al 2002 ford et al 2004a 2004b dragoni et al 2009 nevertheless our observations may be in agreement with those of yi et al 2017 who showed that when drought and non drought conditions were compared large differences in the inner vs outer xylematic transport were observed in isohydric trees but not so in anisohydric oak species in line with the profligate water use strategy and weak stomatal control to vpd of laurel tree species 4 3 the drawbacks of the anisohydric behaviour are compensated by the foggy environment the anisohydric behaviour permits maintenance of the carbon assimilation rate and sustained growth at the cost of a higher risk of hydraulic failure due to cavitation however such a possibility would be minimized in the cloud immersed environment where laurel forests develop on the one hand vpd remained low most of the time especially at night and radiation was reduced during fog events thus decreasing the driving energy available for transpiration on the other hand fog water interception would cool leaves modify the boundary layer conductance and the stomatal gas exchange may be reduced due to the presence of a canopy water film the latter however may be compensated by the subsequent evaporation of the intercepted water this may promote leaf conductance by increasing the relative humidity of the air around the surface of the leaves thus alleviating the stress level within the canopy and consequently enhancing carbon assimilation rate chu et al 2014 katata 2014 all this constrained by stomata distribution leaf morphology and wettability hypostomatic glossy lauroid in this case 4 4 fog water interception does not represent a significant soil water input the foggy conditions led not only to fog water interception that resulted in wetting and dripping of the canopy but also to a significant reduction in global radiation of 45 1 see fig 8a inset as previously reported in this regalado and ritter 2017 ritter et al 2008 2019 and other cloud forests eugster et al 2006 obregon et al 2011 bittencourt et al 2019 light attenuation though does not represent a severe limitation in laurel forest tree species already exhibiting maximal conductance at low irradiance around 20 μmol photons m2 s 1 gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002 ritter and regalado 2017 fog water interception was frequent 55 0 of the time but cumulative volumes were small 195 5 mm year 1 representing only 16 0 of the total throughfall and thus this did not affect the soil moisture content significantly whose increments were due to throughfall from rainfall previous studies in two heavily fog affected windy exposed sites of the anaga laurel forest registered 186 279 mm year 1 of fog water precipitation below the canopy kämmer 1974 and regalado and ritter 2013a reported that fog was 11 of the throughfall under a laurel forest in la gomera island thus our fog water throughfall values are close to those earlier ones relative to the gross incident precipitation throughfall represented in our case 66 7 which is in agreement with the 65 3 ratio earlier reported in a laurel forest in la gomera island ritter and regalado 2010 and it is also in consonance with other evergreen broad leaved forests masukata et al 1990 by contrast stemflow contribution to soil water content is expected to be negligible because such flux is small in this type of forest aboal et al 1999 4 5 intercepted fog water may be incorporated through leaves fog water interception and dripping were associated with a downward flow of sap in the most apical branches and therefore a presumed incorporation of intercepted water through the upper leaves this downward sap flow represented 4 0 and was observed in 26 7 of the time comparatively e g foliar water uptake was reported to represent 4 16 of all water transpired and took place 23 43 of the time in an oak species quercus lanceifolia dominating a tropical montane cloud forest tmcf in mexico gotsch et al 2014 in our case such downstream flow did not advance further down the crown in contrast in a series of experiments using sap flow gauges and labelled water it was previously suggested that foliar absorbed fog water by d brasiliensis travelled along the xylem from the leaves downward and reached the rhizosphere through roots eller et al 2013 however the difficulty in establishing a true zero for sap gauge measurements can lead to fictitious negative downward flows the fact that intercepted leaf water may arrive to the ground through the xylem was also suggested in araucaria angustifolia using deuterium enriched artificial mist cassana et al 2016 soil contamination with root fragments as recognized by these authors cf eller et al 2013 cassana et al 2016 and the fact that a bidirectional exchange of water isotopes can occur between leaves and the atmosphere goldsmith et al 2017 question these results berry et al 2019 in m faya the percentage of negative q t represented only 4 0 of the upward sap flow measured during the annual period monitored despite such small amounts this has been suggested as one of the roles of the leaf water uptake reported in e g d brasiliensis and s sempervirens cloud forests that is the improvement of the canopy water status and the refilling of embolized conduits dawson and goldsmith 2018 thus providing a safety mechanism for cavitation risks associated with the anisohydric behavior this would be relevant in our case since fog was more frequent during the summer when the possibility of a collapse of the xylematic water column would be greater due to the decrease in the soil water content and the greater evaporative demand at noon 4 6 mechanisms of leaf water intake the fact that the stomata remained opened at night and the weak stomatal control of laurel trees shared with other forest species affected by fog such as the californian redwood burgess and dawson 2004 the taiwanese yellow cypress montane cloud forests chu et al 2014 or members of the winteraceae family in the costa rican elfin forest feild and holbrook 2000 may be a consequence of incomplete closure of stomata due to asymmetrical guard cells noss 2000 or occluding stomatal wax deposits feild and holbrook 2000 seibt et al 2007 intercepted fog water may thus enter through the stomatal pores burkhardt et al 2012 the cuticle fernández et al 2017 or trichomes pina et al 2016 such as the glandular hairs present in m faya leaves marrero and nogales 2005 noticeably it was previously shown that fog droplets preferentially deposited on the epicuticular waxes occluding the epistomatal chamber of conifer needles jagels 1991 and so were aerosol particles burkhardt and eiden 1994 whose dissolution may promote the hydraulic connection between the deposited water film and the interior of the leaf through the stomata burkhardt et al 2012 the hydration of the leaves can also occur through the absorption of water vapor if the stomata remain open and the relative humidity is 100 vesala et al 2017 as would be the case during foggy periods the leaf distribution and large leaf area index of laurel forests morales et al 1996b and the inability to close stomata at night would facilitate such a water vapor intake the leaves of the laurel forests are mainly concentrated in the upper crown below which the green biomass is negligible morales et al 1996a such that this would maximize the foliar area exposed to fog and the intake of the intercepted water 4 7 fog dynamics is not only local but is related to the thermal inversion at the mesoscale the cloud immersion environment is not only local but has been shown to affect at the mesoscale level due to variations in the height of the thermal inversion at this subtropical latitude both during night day cycles and throughout the year this has been also observed at the luquillo cloud forest in puerto rico van beusekom et al 2017 and in the volcanic hawaiian archipelago which is located at a similar latitude to the canary islands and it is also affected by a persistent subsidence inversion mendonca and iwaoka 1969 grindinger 1992 cao et al 2007 thus the conclusions obtained here are expected to be applicable throughout the macaronesia and elsewhere with climate models that predict a downward shift in the altitude of the cloud base sperling et al 2004 and with the warmer conditions presently experienced in this area martín et al 2012 the current results have implications in such an scenario of climate change dryer and hotter conditions would imply larger transpiration rates during night and day but also less fog water interception and leaf water uptake 5 conclusions we found that despite being a small amount 195 5 mm year 1 which represents only 16 0 of the total throughfall fog water interception by a laurel forest was frequent and occurred at least half the time 55 0 associated with these fog events global solar radiation was reduced by almost half 54 9 concomitantly with a reduction of the mass sap flow qt in m faya by approximately one order of magnitude it was also observed that the intercepted water was ostensibly incorporated through the leaves leading to a downward flow of sap in the apical branches this negative flow did not progress further down the crown and although it occurred rather frequently 26 7 of the hourly q t records it only represented 4 0 of the upward qt such leaf water intake promoted tree transpiration an observation that is consistent with the hypothesis that intercepted cloud water uptake improves the canopy water status and prevents the potential risk of cavitation associated with a profligate water use strategy it was shown that m faya exhibited features compatible with such an anisohydric behavior and weak stomatal control such that vpd was observed to be the main driver of tree transpiration during the day while a significant night time sap flow q tn was detected under high nocturnal evaporative demand q tn represented up to 23 3 of the daily total q t despite the fact that foggy conditions and therefore a water vapor saturated environment were more frequent at night than at midday the conclusion here therefore is that the persistent fog at the site and the interception of droplets by the vegetation compensate for the non conservative water use followed by m faya despite a limited supply of rainwater in the area especially in summer this is achieved in two ways that is by reducing the frequency of environmental conditions that lead to high evaporative demand and by improving the water status at the leaf level as a counterpart the anisohydric behaviour would allow maintaining the rate of carbon assimilation and sustained growth this conclusion moves the focus of the role of fog interception in this and possibly other cloud forests from being a significant water input to the soil which we showed was not the case towards a mechanism that promotes growth it was shown that the dynamics of fog and fog water interception is associated with the mesoscale variations of the trade wind inversion height and therefore the conclusions obtained here may be applicable to other islands in the macaronesia region the associated consequences of climate change on the frequency and altitude shifting of this persistent cloud layer would thus be expected to affect the survival of these relict cloud forests additional material

4956,large scale water conservancy projects are constructed worldwide to mitigate water shortage problems in lakes and or to improve water quality however it is unclear how a lake s ecosystem responds to the joint operations of multiple projects in this study we take a first step towards investigating the influence of joint operations involving water transfer and lake sluice projects on current patterns and water quality of lake chaohu in china a coupled 3 d hydrodynamic and biochemical model referred to as an ecolake was configured and validated multiple operation scenarios from the eastern and western routines of the yangtze river to the lake chaohu water transfer project ycwtp and the chaohu sluice cs were generated based on real water quality and hydrological processes during a water transfer experiment carried out from 15 july to 8 august 2017 the ecolake model successfully captured the current patterns at most monitoring sites numerical experiment results suggest that the operations of ycwtp led to an acceleration of up to 0 90 cm s in the lake wide current speed the joint operations of ycwtp and cs tend to decrease the nearshore current speed and increase the offshore current speed the effects of the different operation strategies vary considerably among water quality parameters and lake basins the effects are more evident for the central and eastern basins in terms of both current speed and water quality ycwtp potentially help decrease the chlorophyll a chla concentration during the water transfer processing but the benefits diminish gradually in the following two months in contrast when the ycwtp and cs are operated jointly chla concentrations tend to increase during the first five to six days in the central and eastern basins then decrease continuously until mid august from then on the chla concentrations remain at stable levels throughout the rest of the simulation this study provides important guidance for optimal operations of water conservancy projects in lake chaohu keywords water transfer project lake sluice joint operation lake current water quality 1 introduction large freshwater lakes are essential resources for rural and urban water supplies agriculture irrigation recreation flood regulation and the overall functioning of ecosystems haghighi and kløve 2017 jørgensen 2010 in recent years due to rapid socio economic development and an increasing human population water supply demand is growing to the point of overextending available resources in many regions of the world this poses considerable pressure on the water conservation requirements of lakes that are managed by water supply commissions zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however the complex distribution of water resources is uneven on both spatial and temporal scales these situations are further exacerbated by ongoing global climate change which may affect the precipitation distribution as well as the magnitude and frequency of extreme meteorological events baracchini et al 2020 munar et al 2018 karlsson et al 2015 additionally due to both point and non point pollution from industrial agriculture and municipal sources a large proportion of lakes in the world are suffering from water quality deterioration and ecosystem degradation vinçon leite and casenave 2019 huang et al 2016 both increasing water demand and deteriorating water quality increase the risk that water at the required amount and quality will not be available at the time and place it is needed shumilova et al 2018 to mitigate the shortage of water resources and or to control water quality deterioration large scale projects to store redistribute and treat water resources have been built are under construction or are in the planning stages worldwide yan et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 for lake systems mitigation includes water transfer projects large dams or sluice gates water treatment plants and ecosystem restoration projects shumilova et al 2018 in recent years large scale water transfer projects have received close scrutiny due to their huge construction costs and vast impacts on land use human settlement and regional climate e g feng et al 2018 dai et al 2016 in china several notable and highly publicized projects in recent years include the south to north water transfer project guo et al 2020 the yangzte river to lake taihu water transfer project li et al 2013 hu et al 2008 and the yangtze river to lake chaohu water transfer project ycwtp lakes always serve as receiving or important transition systems for these water transfer projects however lake ecosystems are particularly sensitive to changes in influent nutrients and energy from these water transfer projects due to a smaller capacity to store water mass and energy compared to their land or ocean counterparts kamal et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 therefore knowing the effects of water transfer projects will help water conservation representatives cope with the challenges lake ecosystems are facing and support appropriate and alternative strategies for managing water resources and ecosystem processes under rapidly changing conditions shumilova et al 2018 significant efforts have been undertaken over the last two decades to improve the understanding of water transfer project operations effect on the physical and biochemical properties of both the donor and receiving lake ecosystems however these attempts always yield mixed results and scientific debates on this issue remain contentious even though water transfer projects are suggested to help reduce nutrient loads and improve water quality wang et al 2020 feng et al 2018 hu et al 2010 2008 decrease the average water age li et al 2013 change phytoplankton community composition and alleviate phytoplankton aggregation in lakes zeng et al 2017 huang et al 2015 increasing concerns must be addressed regarding the negative influence of water transfer projects on receiving lake ecosystems for example several studies stress that water transfer projects may increase nutrient concentration due to inputs from nutrient rich basins wang et al 2016 fornarelli and antenucci 2011 increase heavy metal contents in lake sediment through silt and clay migration in the transferred water liu et al 2017a and decrease fish abundance and biomass due to water quality changes guo et al 2020 because water transfer projects are expensive to construct operate and maintain a better understanding of water transfer project effects and the best operation methods to ensure their success is essential lake sluices that regulate water release from a lake to downstream regions are another important type of water conservancy projects and are constructed extensively worldwide liu et al 2017b in many cases lake sluices are constructed to accompany water transfer projects to enhance the project efficiency in china for example large lake sluices have been constructed for three out of the five largest freshwater lakes including the sanhe and erhe sluices constructed for lake hongze the taipu sluice constructed for lake taihu and the chaohu sluice cs constructed for lake chaohu while these lake sluices are widely recognized as playing important roles in flood control water conservation and water level regulation zhang et al 2017 knowledge about how they affect the water quality of lakes is still limited most importantly to our knowledge investigations on the effects of joint water transfer projects and sluices on lake current patterns and water quality have not been attempted up to now lake chaohu is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china it is located within the lower yangtze river basin and is one of the most valuable lakes in china in addition to being a unique drinking water source to more than 10 million people in surrounding urban and rural regions lake chaohu provides important ecosystem functions such as flood regulation water transport fisheries tourism and recreation in recent years lake chaohu has received significant attention due to its exceptional importance and eutrophication problem shi et al 2020 tong et al 2019 in addition large areas of the lake have detrimental algal blooms in the summer which poses a severe threat to its water supply security and ecosystem stability to ease the water supply pressure and to promote the restoration of lake chaohu s ecosystem the cs was constructed in 1962 and was later upgraded in 2002 the large scale ycwtp has been under construction since 2017 and will be fully completed in 2022 the objective of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in lake currents and the water quality parameters associated with different operation strategies of ycwtp and cs we address the following questions 1 how will lake current and water quality parameters change under different ycwtp operation strategies 2 how will the water quality change when the cs is involved in the operations 3 what are the sequential effects on water quality in the two months after ycwtp and or cs operations to answer these questions we designed two groups of operation scenarios based on the observations of hydrological and water quality processes during a water transfer experiment carried out during july and august 2017 the first group of scenarios was designed to explore only the effects of the ycwtp operations on lake current and water quality where outflows from the cs were set to zeros in the second group of scenarios the cs was involved into the operations to mimic inflows and maintain water balance of the lake a hydrodynamic and biochemical model referred to as ecolake hu et al 1998 2006 2011 hu and qin 2002 was used to simulate the responses of current patterns and five water quality parameters to different operation strategies the ecolake model was originally developed in the 1990 s it was developed based on the ecosystem characteristic of the shallow lakes in the middle lower yangtze river basin this model has been validated by long term field data and has been used widely in several important lakes in china including lake taihu lake yangchenghu and lake chaohu hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 han et al 2015 wang et al 2018 peng and hu 2019a in a recent study by peng et al 2019b the ecolake model was configured for lake chaohu to setup a real time water quality forecasting framework

is east of the capital of anhui province hefei city and has an area of about 780 km2 it is a shallow lake with an average depth of around 2 69 m and average elevation of 8 37 m above sea level the lake chaohu catchment has a total area of 13 486 km2 there are 13 major tributaries draining directly into lake chaohu most of them are concentrated in the western part of the lake the hangbu river and nanfei river located southwest and northwest of the lake contribute about 68 of the total inflows yuxi river on the eastern end of the lake is the only outflowing river and the outflow from the lake is controlled manually by the cs at the river s outlet the cs was initially constructed in 1962 to retain water for storage and to regulate flood in 2002 the sluice was reconstructed to meet the water transport demand and to improve the flood prevention standard after the completion of cs reconstruction from 2003 to 2019 lake chaohu s average water level increased to 8 99 m the cs has a length of 123 5 m and a width of 10 m its maximum release capacity is 1400 m3 s the control area of the cs is 9 153 km2 accounting for 67 9 of the total area of the lake chaohu catchment lake chaohu and the cs s locations are shown in fig 1 more complete and detail information on lake chaohu and its catchment can be found in peng and hu 2019a for scientific and management purposes local managers of lake chaohu divided the lake into western and eastern lake basins based on the significant differences in water quality conditions between the two basins peng and hu 2019a in this study however we further divided the eastern basin into the central basin and eastern basin for a better explanation of the modeling results the division of the subbasins is shown in fig 1 2 1 2 the yangtze river to lake chaohu water transfer project ycwtp has two different routes fig 1 the east route er has a total length of 74 45 km it draws water from the yangtze river at the fenghuangjing pumping station river water flows through the xihe river and zhaohe river and enters lake chaohu from the zhaohe sluice the west route wr starts from the outlet of lake caizi which is connected to the yangtze river by the chang river water flows into lake chaohu through the zhaohe river the total length of the wr is 113 18 km both routes share the same designed water transfer capacity of 150 m3 s the construction of the wr is ongoing and is scheduled for completion in 2022 from june to mid july 2017 the lake chaohu catchment experienced an unexpectedly long term drought as the water level had decreased to 8 24 m on 29 june 2017 which was 0 75 mm lower than the average water level of 8 99 m for the last 18 years to meet the water supply and water transport demands of lake chaohu emergent water transfers were carried out through the er of ycwtp during a 24 day period from 15 july to 8 august 2017 instantaneous inflow rates and water quality at the inflowing section of the ycwtp and lake chaohu were monitored continuously during this water transfer period daily inflow rates ranged between 90 m3 s to 140 m3 s and a total volume of 2 43 108 m3 water was transferred from the yangtze river to lake chaohu the ranges of ammonium nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and dissolved oxygen do concentrations of the transferred water and three lake basins are shown in fig 2 2 2 data sources for this study the hydrological meteorological and water quality data of lake chaohu were collected for the period from 2017 to 2019 monthly water quality data of lake chaohu and tributaries were provided by the lake chaohu administration bureau in anhui province lcab fourteen monitoring variables are available for 12 sampling sites in the lake and the 13 main tributaries including water temperatures do nh3 n tp tn and chlorophyll a chla list of abbreviations used in this study is provided in table a1 three meteorological buoys were installed in the western central and eastern lake basins to provide observations of solar radiation incoming shortwave radiation surface air and water temperatures wind speed and direction atmospheric pressure and relative humidity the 10 min averaged atmospheric variables were measured approximately 4 m above the lake surface locations of these sampling sites and meteorological buoys can be found in peng et al 2019b daily releases from the cs and water levels at the four stations were provided by the hefei bureau of hydrology hbh continuous records of vertical profiles for 3 d currents were obtained at 12 monitoring stations for the period from 12 november to 31 december 2019 using nortek aquadopp current profilers adcp the 10 min average velocity profiles were obtained with 5 cm bins the accuracy of velocity measurements is on the order of 1 0 we used the current observations to validate the hydrodynamic model locations of current monitoring stations can be found in fig 4 the experiment s physical setup and data sources for this study can be found in table 1 2 3 lake ecosystem modeling 2 3 1 model description for this study we used a three dimensional hydrodynamic and biochemical model referred to as ecolake hu et al 1998 2006 2011 hu and qin 2002 to simulate the variations of lake current and water quality under different operation strategies of the ycwtp and cs ecolake as a fully coupled model can be used to simulate and forecast the evolution of a lake s ecosystem variables under different environmental conditions the ecolake model consists of a hydrodynamic model a food chain network model and a material transformation and transport model the ecolake model configured for lake chaohu has a uniform horizontal grid cell of 250 250 m and a time step of 10 secs the model adopts a free surface and terrain following vertical coordinate system scaled on the water column depth and has five vertical sigma layers the ecolake model is forced by a range of meteorological hydrological and nutrient concentration functions with two temporal resolutions daily forcing functions include lake surface rainfall and evaporation air temperature inflows and outflows as well as nutrient concentrations of tributaries hourly forcing functions include wind field and solar radiation the hourly or daily meteorological forcing functions were generated using the 10 min data obtained from the meteorological buoys by simple summing or averaging daily nutrient concentrations of tributaries were calculated using monthly data through linear interpolation discharge from the feed in tributaries is regarded as an important variable influencing the hydrodynamic and biochemical evolutions in lake ecosystems kamal et al 2020 however most of the tributaries of lake chaohu are ungauged and inflow data are not available to bridge this gap we developed a two stage runoff coefficient estimation and scaling rces approach for reconstructing daily inflows of lake chaohu in an earlier paper peng et al 2019c validation results suggest that the inflow time series reconstructed from the rces approach is consistent and agrees with corresponding observations the mean deterministic coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency values are 0 69 and 0 60 respectively we used the rces approach to generate daily inflows from the 13 tributaries for the period from 2016 to 2019 full details of the rces implementation are provided in peng et al 2019c 2 3 2 validation of hydrodynamic model the ecolake model parameters were calibrated using monthly observations of water quality parameters obtained in 2016 the model fit was evaluated using a uniformly weighted average of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient and a symmetric measure of bias peng et al 2019b to evaluate the accuracy of the ecolake model in simulating lake currents we followed studies by beletsky et al 2006 and huang et al 2010 to calculate the misfit between the modeled and observed currents represented by 1 f n 1 t t 1 t v sim v obs 2 1 t t 1 t v obs 2 where fn is a normalized fourier norm and can also be regarded as the relative percentage of variance in the observed currents that are unexplained by the model solutions v sim and v obs are simulated and observed currents at the time step t t 1 2 t respectively fn ranges from 0 to when an fn value of 0 indicates that perfect simulations have been achieved 2 4 scenario designs and numerical experiments 2 4 1 scenario designs we designed two groups of scenarios to simulate the influence of the ycwtp and cs operations on the current circulation and water quality of lake chaohu each group consists of four operation scenarios scenario designs were based on daily observations of inflow rates m3 s during the water transfer experiment carried out from 15 july to 8 agust 20178 8 for both groups of scenarios daily concentrations of the ycwtp water quality parameters were set to the observed values during this water transfer period in addition a baseline scenario was generated by setting both the inflows from ycwtp and the outflows from cs to zero a detailed depiction of scenario designs can be found in table 2 the first group of scenarios were designed to solely evaluate the effects of the ycwtp operations in this regard the outflows from the cs were set to zero which agreed with the observations during the 2017 water transfer period for scenario a1 the inflows of both ycwtp routines were set to the observed values during the 2017 water transfer period thus this scenario can be deemed as an evaluation of the effects based on the 2017 water transfer experiments scenario a2 switches the water transfer processes from east route er to the west route wr of the ycwtp in other words the er inflows were set to zero and the wr inflows were set to the corresponding values observed for the er during the 2017 water transfer period for scenario a3 water transfer inflows from both routines were set to the daily observations of the er scenario a4 was designed to evaluate the maximum influence of ycwtp by setting inflows from both routines to their full water transfer capabilities at an inflow rate of 150 m3 s the second group of scenarios were designed to simulate the effects of ycwtp and cs joint operations on lake current patterns and the water quality of lake chaohu scenarios in this group followed the same protocol for this ycwtp as the first group however we decided to operate the cs concurrently with the ycwtp by setting releases from the cs to the same inflow rates as the ycwtp in other words daily water budgets of the lake for scenarios in the second group were same as the baseline scenario 2 4 2 numerical experiments we fed the above mentioned nine scenarios and other observed hydrometeorological and water quality forcing functions into the ecolake model to simulate the evolution of lake current and water quality variables under different operation strategies of the ycwtp and cs all models ran continuously for 3 month periods from 1 july to 30 september fig 3 shows the meteorological conditions during the simulation period cumulative rainfall during this period was 418 2 mm wind speeds ranged between 0 m s and 7 8 m s and the water level of lake chaohu ranged between 8 27 m and 9 11 m with an average value of 8 75 m the model initial conditions such as water level water temperature permanganate index nitrate nitrogen nitrite nitrogen nh3 n do tp and tn were interpolated over each of the grid cells covering the lake through the inverse distance weighting method using monitoring data on 1 july 2017 the period from 1 july to 14 july was used to spin up the hydrodynamic model to stabilize the state variables the effect of the initial conditions on the long term model simulation should be negligible after the model has ran for a couple of weeks huang et al 2010 model results for from 15 july to 8 august and from 9 august to 30 september were compared to the baseline scenario to evaluate the effects of ycwtp during the water transfer period and the cs operations effects on the lake ecosystem after water transfer 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results of the ecolake model we begin by examining the performance of the ecolake model in simulating the current structure of lake chaohu subplots in fig 4 compare the simulated and observed currents for the 12 monitoring stations averaged from 12 november to 31 december 2019 and throughout the entire water column the central subplot depicts the lake wide current patterns derived from the ecolake model and the colors indicate the average water depth within this period model results suggest that large scale currents exhibited considerable spatial variability during the validation period a broad west to east offshore current occurred in the central region of the lake three small scale anticyclonic circulations developed in the northern parts of the western central and eastern basins and one cyclonic circulation developed along the southern regions of the western to central basins in the lake chaohu catchment wind is generally from the northwest during the winter months therefore the west to east current in the open lake is mainly driven by wind however small scale structures such as gyres can develop in certain basins such as lake bays or in nearshore regions with complex bathymetry bennington et al 2010 fig 4 shows the simulated currents derived from the hydrodynamic module of the ecolake model to be in good agreement with observed current speeds and directions for most monitoring stations normalized fourier norms ranged between 0 23 at station 1 and 1 28 at station 2 with an average mean value of 0 63 for all the monitoring stations however considerable differences occurred between simulations and observations in both current direction and speed at stations 2 3 and 4 note that these monitoring stations are located near the estuaries of three important lake chaohu tributaries one possible explanation of the bad model performance for these stations is that shallow lakes such as lake chaohu typically have smaller water storage compared to their reservoir or ocean counterparts therefore the gravity current in the estuary zones of such shallow lakes can be highly sensitive to inflow rates shi et al 2019 azevedo et al 2010 due to the absence of inflow observations the inaccurate estimation of daily inflows using the rces method by peng et al 2019c may cause considerable errors for the hydrodynamic models in simulating lake current patterns in the estuary regions of large tributaries in an earlier paper by peng et al 2019b we validated the ecolake model accuracy in simulating water quality parameters including tn tp do and nh3 n using observations obtained from 2016 for lake chaohu only a brief account of the validation results for the water quality parameters are provided here results suggested that the rmse values of the ecolake model for different water quality variables ranged from 0 06 to 1 28 and the mae values ranged from 0 04 to 0 98 the relative error statistics ranged between 0 10 and 0 39 indicating that the accuracy of the water quality model meets the general guidance criteria published in usepa 1990 we also validated the model accuracy in simulating chla and the results not shown suggest that the relative error ranged from 0 19 to 0 52 for different sampling sites with a mean value of 0 37 3 2 influence of ycwtp operations on current structure fig 5 shows model results for the depth averaged current patterns from 15 july to 8 agust 2017 under the four ycwtp operation scenarios colors denote the relative changes in current speeds compared to the baseline scenario when no water was transferred to the lake we first note that the currents are generally from west to east in the offshore regions of lake chaohu even though there is a notable difference in some regions under different scenarios this current pattern is mainly driven by inflows since most of the tributaries are concentrated in the western part of the lake fast alongshore currents exist along both the southern and northern coastlines of the lake which generally flow in a direction opposite to the offshore currents weak anticyclonic currents can be found in the northern and central regions of the lake model results suggest that ycwtp operations lead to an overall acceleration in current speed averaged over the whole lake accelerations in current speeds for the four operation scenarios are 0 28 cm s 0 39 cm s 0 64 cm s and 0 90 cm s respectively the operation scenario a1 tends to have a negative influence on current speed in the central region of the western lake basin and has an overall positive effect on the eastern basin but the magnitude of the change in speed is relatively small generally ranging between 1 and 1 cm s since scenario a1 uses the same wind field as the baseline scenario to force the hydrodynamic model the overall acceleration in current speed can be attributed to the increasing inflow rate caused by the water transferring which leads to the acceleration of the gravity current in the broad eastern basin when the water transfer pathway is switched from the er to the wr scenario a2 a remarkable current acceleration is induced in the central region of the middle to eastern basin at the same time the speed of the nearshore current in the central basin exhibits a decreasing trend doubling the water transfer flow rate by operating the dual routines of ycwtp concurrently scenario a3 potentially exhibits a similar influence on current speed in the western basin as scenario a2 but both the area and magnitude of the deceleration in the current speed are more evident similar results are achieved when the wr and er of the ycwtp are operated concurrently at full capacities scenario a4 but the magnitude of the current acceleration in lake basins east of the er estuary is enhanced slightly compared to scenario a3 fig 6 further depicts the u and v current components of the five vertical layers for grid cells along the west east central section as shown in fig 1 during the summer winds are primarily from the southeast over the lake chaohu catchment as is supported by the u zonal velocity i e the component of the horizontal eastward winds and v the meridional velocity i e the component of the northward horizontal wind in fig 3 dominated by wind the current direction of the surface layer was mostly northwestward during the water transfer period in 2017 as is supposed by the negative values of the u components and positive values of the v components both the u and v components of currents in the near surface layer tend to be the lowest among the five layers and exhibit obvious spatial transitions in their direction directions of both u and v components in the central near bottom and bottom layers are opposite to the surface layer on the other hand fig 6 clearly shows that the operations of the ycwtp have an apparent influence on both the u and v current components for all five of the vertical layers general patterns reveal that speeds of both components increase at all layers 3 3 effects of ycwtp and cs joint operations on current structure the numerical experiment results suggest that the spatial variations of changes in current speed and direction are more evident when the ycwtp and cs are operated jointly compared to the model results for scenarios where only the ycwtp is in operation as shown in fig 7 current speed changes in lake basins on the west of the ycwtp estuaries become slighter when the ycwtp and cs are operated jointly on the contrary current speeds in a broad lake basin to the east of the ycwtp are altered significantly overall speeds of alongshore currents tend to be decelerated generally with magnitudes ranging between 0 and 2 cm s on the other hand water current speeds in the central to eastern basins exhibit an obviously accelerated trend particularly in the outflowing region of the cs moreover the magnitude of the accelerations or decelerations in water current speeds increase with the growing inflow and outflow rates fig 8 further elucidates the influence of both groups of scenarios on the depth averaged u and v components of currents in different lake basins solid and dashed curves show the speed variations under scenarios in group a and group b respectively the mid gray shades show the water transfer period the curves are extended to 30 september 2017 to illustrate the follow up effects after water transfer we first note that the differences in both u and v current components in the eastern basin are the biggest under different scenarios followed by the central basin and western basin focusing on the u components of the eastern basin at a temporal scale the differences among the different scenarios enlarge rapidly from the first day of the joint ycwtp and cs operations comparing to scenarios in group a when no water is released from the cs the effects of the ycwtp and cs joint operations are much more significant during the water transfer period but the effects diminish rapidly and the current speeds get closer to the baseline scenario after about one day or so on the other hand although the effects of operation scenarios in group a are much smaller during the water transfer period the follow up effects remain remarkable until the end of the simulation period the follow up effects of scenarios in group a could be explained by the rising water levels of the lake induced by water transfer especially since the lake had no outflows during this period the water depth of a lake is regarded as an important variable that affects the hydrodynamics of lakes in shallow lakes such as lake chaohu the baroclinic effects caused by the winds inflows and outflows are a major mechanism affecting current patterns changes in water level can alter the baroclinic structure at different water depth thereby alter the current speed and direction bennington et al 2010 similar results were reported by karamigolbaghi et al 2019 who found that even a 2 cm difference in the water level can create a 63 cm s difference in current speed in sodus bay of lake ontario which is relatively large compared with normal velocities in the bay 3 4 effects of ycwtp operations on water quality we next assess the effects of ycwtp operations on the water quality of lake chaohu fig 9 shows the relative changes in vertical averaged concentrations of the five water quality parameters during the water transfer period under different ycwtp operation strategies compared to the baseline scenario one striking feature is that the effects of different operation scenarios vary considerably across lake basins and water parameters summer algal blooms are one of the most important ecosystem problems of lake chaohu chla concentration is commonly used as a proxy variable of total phytoplankton biomass kelly et al 2020 wen et al 2019 it is pleasing to see that the ycwtp may help reducing the chla concentration of lake chaohu as shown in fig 9 chla concentration tends to decrease over the whole lake except with the exception of estuary regions of the ycwtp although the magnitude of the decrease is generally slight with maximal values of 9 4 and 13 6 attained for the scenarios a3 and a4 respectively the relative percentage of changes in chla concentration over the whole lake under the four operation scenarios are 2 05 1 93 3 79 and 5 38 respectively water temperature and illumination conditions underwater are two important variables that govern the photosynthetic activities of algae soontiens et al 2019 the water transfer led to a maximum rise of 0 32 m in the lake level which potentially reduces the vertical averaged underwater illumination and water temperature this has a negative impact on the photosynthetic rate and growth of algae which may partly explain the decrease of lake wide chla concentration the daily averaged chla concentration of the ycwtp was slightly higher than the estuary regions of the ycwtp which may explain the increase of chla concentration in the estuary regions of the ycwtp another obvious feature in fig 9 is that the ycwtp operations led to a remarkable increase of nh3 n concentration in most of the lake with the exception of the ycwtp estuary zones this can be attributed to the decreasing of chla concentration as algae growth will consume a portion of nh3 n for tn and tp general change patterns include the tendency of concentrations in the central lake basin to decrease while moderate areas in the western and eastern lake basins suffered from increased concentrations compared to the baseline scenario lake wide averaged changes in tn concentration for the four operation scenarios a1 a2 a3 and a4 were 1 18 0 55 1 61 and 2 12 respectively for tp averaged concentration changes are 2 21 0 39 2 30 and 3 03 respectively the spatial variation pattern of tn and tp concentrations can be linked to the alteration of hydrodynamic conditions during the operational period of the ycwtp pollutants in the central basin can be flushed to the eastern and western basins thus the tn and tp concentrations in the central basin are expected to decrease while the eastern and western basins will exhibit converse patterns the spatial distribution of changes in the do concentration exhibited many differences to tn and tp an increasing trend was found along the north west and northwest nearshore regions of the lake while a broad offshore region generally suffers from decreasing do concentration for the four operation scenarios the changes in do concentration averaged over the whole lake range between 5 13 4 41 2 45 4 4 4 54 6 97 and 5 33 8 33 with mean values of 0 52 0 29 0 85 and 1 14 respectively due to the photosynthetic activities algae produces a portion of oxygen in water e g saber et al 2020 the decrease of chla concentration may partly explain the reduced do concentration in most regions of the lake 3 5 influence of ycwtp and cs joint operations on water quality fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of relative changes in the concentrations of the five water quality parameters when ycwtp and cs are operated jointly scenarios b1 b2 b3 and b4 over the period of 15 july to 8 august 2017 the concentration changes vary with water parameters and lake basins a clear pattern shows the concentration of the five water quality parameters exhibiting an overall increasing trend in the eastern part of the lake in contrast a general decrease in concentrations was found in the central western lake basins the variation patterns of the water quality parameters can be mainly attributed to the current change patterns the accelerated current speed in the central to eastern basin will promote the transport of pollutants from the central basin to the eastern basin however there are some differences for specific regions among different scenarios as well for example compared to the baseline scenario scenario b1 leads to an overall decrease of tp concentration in the central part of the lake however when water transfer through the wr was carried out scenarios b2 b3 and b4 an increasing trend in tp concentration was found in the lake basin between the wr and er estuaries similar patterns can also be found for chla fig 11 summarizes the proportion of lake area where the concentrations of water quality parameters change at different magnitudes for each of the eight scenarios a1 a4 and b1 b4 the blue bars indicate that concentrations of the water quality parameters are dropping and the red bars indicate that the concentrations are increasing compared to the baseline scenario where no water is transferred through ycwtp and released from cs proportions of the lake area where concentrations of water quality parameters decrease are larger than the parameters showing a water quality increase for most operation scenarios with the exception of the nh3 n for all four scenarios in group a and tn for the a1 scenario results clearly demonstrate that an overall improvement of water quality was achieved by operating the ycwtp the joint ycwtp and cs operations had larger proportions of lake areas with decreasing concentrations of nh3 n and tn than the ycwtp operation solely thus the benefit of joint operations was more apparent for these two parameters however compared to the scenarios when only the ycwtp is operated smaller proportions of lake areas with decreasing concentration of chla were observed when the two projects operated jointly this was caused by the accelerated current in the broad central and eastern basins which tend to flush algae in the western basin to the eastern basin 3 6 the follow up effects of ycwtp and cs operations on water quality our final analysis focuses on the temporal changes in water quality for different lake basins during both the water transfer period and the follow up period lasting several months fig 12 shows the relative changes in daily concentrations of each of the five water quality parameters and for each of the eight operation scenarios in three lake basins solid curves denote group a scenarios and dashed curves denote group b scenarios the gray shaded columns indicate the water transfer period in 2017 fig 12 clearly demonstrates that for all operation strategies the effects on the water quality of lake chaohu are retained to the end of the simulation period but the effects also exhibited considerable variations both spatially and temporally for both operation scenario groups the smallest effects were noted in the western lake basin during the water transfer period the effects on the central basin increased rapidly and tended to decrease gradually after the joint ycwtp and cs operations ended the response of water quality parameters in the eastern basin to the joint ycwtp and cs operations was substantially delayed compared to the central basin but the effects on this basin were much more profound during the two month follow up period the ycwtp operation effects on the nh3 n concentration of the western lake were not obvious during the first six or seven day of water transfer which can be attributed to the delayed response of the nh3 n concentration to the relative biochemical variables such as water temperature algae and do concentrations however nh3 n concentration increased rapidly afterwards particularly for scenarios a2 to a4 when water transfer through the wr was carried out for all three lake basins the nh3 n concentration increased gradually with small fluctuations and reached their peaks toward the end of august as previously mentioned the joint ycwtp and cs operations exhibited a limited effect on the nh3 n concentration of the western lake but may help decrease the nh3 n concentration for the central and eastern lake basins for all operation scenarios tn concentration tended to decrease continuously in both western and central basins during the water transfer period from 15 july to 8 august 2017 but the variation gradient in the central basin was much higher than the western basin particularly for the group b scenarios tn concentration rebounded quickly after the water transfer period and several scenarios surpassed the baseline scenario tp temporal concentration variations show a pattern very similar to that of tn the chla concentration variations generally show a bowl shape for all three basins when the ycwtp is operated when the cs is paired with the ycwtp operation chla concentration tended to increase during the first five to six days in the central and eastern basins then it decreased continuously until mid august from that point on the chla concentration remained at stable levels until the end of the simulation 4 limitations and future work one of the most important purposes of the ycwtp is to improve water quality and to alleviate summer algal bloom of lake chaohu by transferring clearer water from the yangtze river to dilute the polluted lake water or to flush the pollutants out of the lake wang et al 2018 thus the effectiveness of water transfer in improving water quality of lake chaohu depends heavily on the water quality of the yangtze river however the yangtze river is located in the most populated and developed region of china the intense anthropogenic activities such as urbanization and industrialization together with variations in hydrological regime caused by operations of the three gorges dam and extreme flood or drought events strongly affect the timing and magnitude of nutrient loading of the river and cause considerable spatial and temporal fluctuations in water quality wang et al 2020 moreover anthropogenic activities along the open canals of the ycwtp would also lead to additional uncertainties to the water quality of the ycwtp e g yang et al 2020 due to the limited availability of the water quality data of the ycwtp our numerical experiments were conducted under certain water quality conditions during a 24 day water transfer period in 2017 future works may focus on evaluating the effect and risk of the inter seasonal and inter annual water quality variations of the ycwtp and sudden water pollution incidents caused by storm runoff or other reasons on lake chaohu ecosystem in our design of joint operation scenarios we simply assumed that the inflows from ycwtp were equal to outflows from the cs in this way water storages under all joint operation schemes were kept consistent with the baseline scenario where both inflows from the ycwtp and outflows from the cs were set to zeros this enabled us to inter compare the sequential consequences of different operation schemes during the following two months under uniform hydrometeorological conditions as stated in the introduction lake chaohu provides multiple ecosystem services such as rural and urban water supplies flood regulation and water transport this means that the practical operations of these large projects can be far more complicated than is currently assumed evaluating management decisions should not be confined to consideration of hydrodynamic condition and water quality of a lake but its effects on the broad suite of important ecosystem services provided by lake what s more important the catchment scale environmental societal and economic consequences should be evaluated comprehensively for instance decreases of outflow from the cs will impact ecological conditions and threaten water supplies downstream but increases can increase flood risks downstream these outcomes and trade offs are likely to be differentially sensitive to changes in the different components of the lake water budget drivers as well as to the overall water balance thompson et al 2017 due to the limited availability of observational data during the water transfer period our numerical experiments for the joint operations of both projects were conducted only for a relatively low lake level period theoretically the joint operation of both projects could occur during low level period if severe water pollution or algal bloom events happen however the occurrence probability of joint operations during low level period is likely to be low or inflows from the ycwtp could be much higher than outflows from the cs to maintain lake level for water supply and water transport purposes the changes in inflow and outflow conditions as well as changes in of the joint operation durations may yield great difference in modelling outcomes oliveira et al 2020 understanding the effects of large water conservation projects on lake ecosystems can be complicated and challenging not only because a lack of baseline observations but also due to both the internal nonlinear and high dimensional processes among ecosystem variables in lakes and the complex interactions between lake variables and external landscape variables such as land use and atmospheric deposition ward et al 2020 scully 2016 a well calibrated hydrodynamic and biochemical model provides insights into the time space evolution of lake ecosystem variables on a small horizontal scale thereby enabling us to tease apart the individual effects of water conservation projects from other external drivers however modern hydrodynamic and biochemical models are still far from perfect due to measurement errors of initial conditions boundary conditions and the forcing functions as well as imperfect model structure and parameterization there is considerable uncertainty associated with outputs from these processes based numerical models novic et al 2018 there is increasing concern that the use of deterministic model outputs may lead to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient management strategies tscheikner gratl et al 2019 thus future work in this area could include quantifying the uncertainty associated with model outputs used to support decision making of water conservation project operations 5 summary and conclusions large scale water conservation projects are continuously being constructed worldwide for large freshwater lakes to ease the water supply pressure and or to control pollution understanding the effects related to water transfer projects and lake sluices on circulation patterns and the water quality of large lakes is essential to effective water resource management this paper presents results from a 3 d hydrodynamic and biochemical model which was used to investigate the effects of different operation strategies of water transfer and lake sluice projects on current structures and the water quality of a large shallow lake the ecolake model proved highly capable of capturing the current pattern at most of the 12 monitoring sites with a mean normalized fourier norm value of 0 63 increases of inflows due to water transfer lead to an overall acceleration in current speed averaged over the whole lake accelerations in current speed for the four operation scenarios of ycwtp are 0 28 cm s 0 39 cm s 0 64 cm s and 0 90 cm s respectively ycwtp operations tend to decrease lake wide chla concentration as well as tn and tp concentrations in the central lake however there is an obvious lake wide increase in nh3 n concentration except for the inflowing regions of the ycwtp compared to scenarios in which only the ycwtp is in operation the joint operations of ycwtp and a lake sluice like cs tend to decrease the nearshore current speed at magnitudes of 0 to 2 cm s and tend to increase the offshore current speed for water quality parameters the joint operations typically have larger lake areas with decreasing concentrations of nh3 n and tn than when operating the ycwtp solely however they also have smaller area where chla concentration is decreasing at the temporal scale although ycwtp can help decrease chla concentration during the water transfer period the effect diminishes gradually in the following two months in contrast when ycwtp and cs are operated jointly chla concentration tend to decrease continuously and then remain at low levels results of this study can support optimal

4956,large scale water conservancy projects are constructed worldwide to mitigate water shortage problems in lakes and or to improve water quality however it is unclear how a lake s ecosystem responds to the joint operations of multiple projects in this study we take a first step towards investigating the influence of joint operations involving water transfer and lake sluice projects on current patterns and water quality of lake chaohu in china a coupled 3 d hydrodynamic and biochemical model referred to as an ecolake was configured and validated multiple operation scenarios from the eastern and western routines of the yangtze river to the lake chaohu water transfer project ycwtp and the chaohu sluice cs were generated based on real water quality and hydrological processes during a water transfer experiment carried out from 15 july to 8 august 2017 the ecolake model successfully captured the current patterns at most monitoring sites numerical experiment results suggest that the operations of ycwtp led to an acceleration of up to 0 90 cm s in the lake wide current speed the joint operations of ycwtp and cs tend to decrease the nearshore current speed and increase the offshore current speed the effects of the different operation strategies vary considerably among water quality parameters and lake basins the effects are more evident for the central and eastern basins in terms of both current speed and water quality ycwtp potentially help decrease the chlorophyll a chla concentration during the water transfer processing but the benefits diminish gradually in the following two months in contrast when the ycwtp and cs are operated jointly chla concentrations tend to increase during the first five to six days in the central and eastern basins then decrease continuously until mid august from then on the chla concentrations remain at stable levels throughout the rest of the simulation this study provides important guidance for optimal operations of water conservancy projects in lake chaohu keywords water transfer project lake sluice joint operation lake current water quality 1 introduction large freshwater lakes are essential resources for rural and urban water supplies agriculture irrigation recreation flood regulation and the overall functioning of ecosystems haghighi and kløve 2017 jørgensen 2010 in recent years due to rapid socio economic development and an increasing human population water supply demand is growing to the point of overextending available resources in many regions of the world this poses considerable pressure on the water conservation requirements of lakes that are managed by water supply commissions zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however the complex distribution of water resources is uneven on both spatial and temporal scales these situations are further exacerbated by ongoing global climate change which may affect the precipitation distribution as well as the magnitude and frequency of extreme meteorological events baracchini et al 2020 munar et al 2018 karlsson et al 2015 additionally due to both point and non point pollution from industrial agriculture and municipal sources a large proportion of lakes in the world are suffering from water quality deterioration and ecosystem degradation vinçon leite and casenave 2019 huang et al 2016 both increasing water demand and deteriorating water quality increase the risk that water at the required amount and quality will not be available at the time and place it is needed shumilova et al 2018 to mitigate the shortage of water resources and or to control water quality deterioration large scale projects to store redistribute and treat water resources have been built are under construction or are in the planning stages worldwide yan et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 for lake systems mitigation includes water transfer projects large dams or sluice gates water treatment plants and ecosystem restoration projects shumilova et al 2018 in recent years large scale water transfer projects have received close scrutiny due to their huge construction costs and vast impacts on land use human settlement and regional climate e g feng et al 2018 dai et al 2016 in china several notable and highly publicized projects in recent years include the south to north water transfer project guo et al 2020 the yangzte river to lake taihu water transfer project li et al 2013 hu et al 2008 and the yangtze river to lake chaohu water transfer project ycwtp lakes always serve as receiving or important transition systems for these water transfer projects however lake ecosystems are particularly sensitive to changes in influent nutrients and energy from these water transfer projects due to a smaller capacity to store water mass and energy compared to their land or ocean counterparts kamal et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 therefore knowing the effects of water transfer projects will help water conservation representatives cope with the challenges lake ecosystems are facing and support appropriate and alternative strategies for managing water resources and ecosystem processes under rapidly changing conditions shumilova et al 2018 significant efforts have been undertaken over the last two decades to improve the understanding of water transfer project operations effect on the physical and biochemical properties of both the donor and receiving lake ecosystems however these attempts always yield mixed results and scientific debates on this issue remain contentious even though water transfer projects are suggested to help reduce nutrient loads and improve water quality wang et al 2020 feng et al 2018 hu et al 2010 2008 decrease the average water age li et al 2013 change phytoplankton community composition and alleviate phytoplankton aggregation in lakes zeng et al 2017 huang et al 2015 increasing concerns must be addressed regarding the negative influence of water transfer projects on receiving lake ecosystems for example several studies stress that water transfer projects may increase nutrient concentration due to inputs from nutrient rich basins wang et al 2016 fornarelli and antenucci 2011 increase heavy metal contents in lake sediment through silt and clay migration in the transferred water liu et al 2017a and decrease fish abundance and biomass due to water quality changes guo et al 2020 because water transfer projects are expensive to construct operate and maintain a better understanding of water transfer project effects and the best operation methods to ensure their success is essential lake sluices that regulate water release from a lake to downstream regions are another important type of water conservancy projects and are constructed extensively worldwide liu et al 2017b in many cases lake sluices are constructed to accompany water transfer projects to enhance the project efficiency in china for example large lake sluices have been constructed for three out of the five largest freshwater lakes including the sanhe and erhe sluices constructed for lake hongze the taipu sluice constructed for lake taihu and the chaohu sluice cs constructed for lake chaohu while these lake sluices are widely recognized as playing important roles in flood control water conservation and water level regulation zhang et al 2017 knowledge about how they affect the water quality of lakes is still limited most importantly to our knowledge investigations on the effects of joint water transfer projects and sluices on lake current patterns and water quality have not been attempted up to now lake chaohu is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china it is located within the lower yangtze river basin and is one of the most valuable lakes in china in addition to being a unique drinking water source to more than 10 million people in surrounding urban and rural regions lake chaohu provides important ecosystem functions such as flood regulation water transport fisheries tourism and recreation in recent years lake chaohu has received significant attention due to its exceptional importance and eutrophication problem shi et al 2020 tong et al 2019 in addition large areas of the lake have detrimental algal blooms in the summer which poses a severe threat to its water supply security and ecosystem stability to ease the water supply pressure and to promote the restoration of lake chaohu s ecosystem the cs was constructed in 1962 and was later upgraded in 2002 the large scale ycwtp has been under construction since 2017 and will be fully completed in 2022 the objective of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in lake currents and the water quality parameters associated with different operation strategies of ycwtp and cs we address the following questions 1 how will lake current and water quality parameters change under different ycwtp operation strategies 2 how will the water quality change when the cs is involved in the operations 3 what are the sequential effects on water quality in the two months after ycwtp and or cs operations to answer these questions we designed two groups of operation scenarios based on the observations of hydrological and water quality processes during a water transfer experiment carried out during july and august 2017 the first group of scenarios was designed to explore only the effects of the ycwtp operations on lake current and water quality where outflows from the cs were set to zeros in the second group of scenarios the cs was involved into the operations to mimic inflows and maintain water balance of the lake a hydrodynamic and biochemical model referred to as ecolake hu et al 1998 2006 2011 hu and qin 2002 was used to simulate the responses of current patterns and five water quality parameters to different operation strategies the ecolake model was originally developed in the 1990 s it was developed based on the ecosystem characteristic of the shallow lakes in the middle lower yangtze river basin this model has been validated by long term field data and has been used widely in several important lakes in china including lake taihu lake yangchenghu and lake chaohu hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 han et al 2015 wang et al 2018 peng and hu 2019a in a recent study by peng et al 2019b the ecolake model was configured for lake chaohu to setup a real time water quality forecasting framework the paper is organized as follows section 2 of this paper describes the study area data collection modeling methodologies and operation scenario generation it also gives the metrics used to evaluate model performance section 3 provides results and a discussion of the influence of different operation scenarios on lake chaohu s current circulation and water quality section 4 further discusses the limitations of this study and future works section 5 provides a summary and conclusions 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas 2 1 1 lake chaohu and catchment lake chaohu 30 25 31 43 n 117 17 117 51 e is east of the capital of anhui province hefei city and has an area of about 780 km2 it is a shallow lake with an average depth of around 2 69 m and average elevation of 8 37 m above sea level the lake chaohu catchment has a total area of 13 486 km2 there are 13 major tributaries draining directly into lake chaohu most of them are concentrated in the western part of the lake the hangbu river and nanfei river located southwest and northwest of the lake contribute about 68 of the total inflows yuxi river on the eastern end of the lake is the only outflowing river and the outflow from the lake is controlled manually by the cs at the river s outlet the cs was initially constructed in 1962 to retain water for storage and to regulate flood in 2002 the sluice was reconstructed to meet the water transport demand and to improve the flood prevention standard after the completion of cs reconstruction from 2003 to 2019 lake chaohu s average water level increased to 8 99 m the cs has a length of 123 5 m and a width of 10 m its maximum release capacity is 1400 m3 s the control area of the cs is 9 153 km2 accounting for 67 9 of the total area of the lake chaohu catchment lake chaohu and the cs s locations are shown in fig 1 more complete and detail information on lake chaohu and its catchment can be found in peng and hu 2019a for scientific and management purposes local managers of lake chaohu divided the lake into western and eastern lake basins based on the significant differences in water quality conditions between the two basins peng and hu 2019a in this study however we further divided the eastern basin into the central basin and eastern basin for a better explanation of the modeling results the division of the subbasins is shown in fig 1 2 1 2 the yangtze river to lake chaohu water transfer project ycwtp has two different routes fig 1 the east route er has a total length of 74 45 km it draws water from the yangtze river at the fenghuangjing pumping station river water flows through the xihe river and zhaohe river and enters lake chaohu from the zhaohe sluice the west route wr starts from the outlet of lake caizi which is connected to the yangtze river by the chang river water flows into lake chaohu through the zhaohe river the total length of the wr is 113 18 km both routes share the same designed water transfer capacity of 150 m3 s the construction of the wr is ongoing and is scheduled for completion in 2022 from june to mid july 2017 the lake chaohu catchment experienced an unexpectedly long term drought as the water level had decreased to 8 24 m on 29 june 2017 which was 0 75 mm lower than the average water level of 8 99 m for the last 18 years to meet the water supply and water transport demands of lake chaohu emergent water transfers were carried out through the er of ycwtp during a 24 day period from 15 july to 8 august 2017 instantaneous inflow rates and water quality at the inflowing section of the ycwtp and lake chaohu were monitored continuously during this water transfer period daily inflow rates ranged between 90 m3 s to 140 m3 s and a total volume of 2 43 108 m3 water was transferred from the yangtze river to lake chaohu the ranges of ammonium nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and dissolved oxygen do concentrations of the transferred water and three lake basins are shown in fig 2 2 2 data sources for this study the hydrological meteorological and water quality data of lake chaohu were collected for the period from 2017 to 2019 monthly water quality data of lake chaohu and tributaries were provided by the lake chaohu administration bureau in anhui province lcab fourteen monitoring variables are available for 12 sampling sites in the lake and the 13 main tributaries including water temperatures do nh3 n tp tn and chlorophyll a chla list of abbreviations used in this study is provided in table a1 three meteorological buoys were installed in the western central and eastern lake basins to provide observations of solar radiation incoming shortwave radiation surface air and water temperatures wind speed and direction atmospheric pressure and relative humidity the 10 min averaged atmospheric variables were measured approximately 4 m above the lake surface locations of these sampling sites and meteorological buoys can be found in peng et al 2019b daily releases from the cs and water levels at the four stations were provided by the hefei bureau of hydrology hbh continuous records of vertical profiles for 3 d currents were obtained at 12 monitoring stations for the period from 12 november to 31 december 2019 using nortek aquadopp current profilers adcp the 10 min average velocity profiles were obtained with 5 cm bins the accuracy of velocity measurements is on the order of 1 0 we used the current observations to validate the hydrodynamic model locations of current monitoring stations can be found in fig 4 the experiment s physical setup and data sources for this study can be found in table 1 2 3 lake ecosystem modeling 2 3 1 model description for this study we used a three dimensional hydrodynamic and biochemical model referred to as ecolake hu et al 1998 2006 2011 hu and qin 2002 to simulate the variations of lake current and water quality under different operation strategies of the ycwtp and cs ecolake as a fully coupled model can be used to simulate and forecast the evolution of a lake s ecosystem variables under different environmental conditions the ecolake model consists of a hydrodynamic model a food chain network model and a material transformation and transport model the ecolake model configured for lake chaohu has a uniform horizontal grid cell of 250 250 m and a time step of 10 secs the model adopts a free surface and terrain following vertical coordinate system scaled on the water column depth and has five vertical sigma layers the ecolake model is forced by a range of meteorological hydrological and nutrient concentration functions with two temporal resolutions daily forcing functions include lake surface rainfall and evaporation air temperature inflows and outflows as well as nutrient concentrations of tributaries hourly forcing functions include wind field and solar radiation the hourly or daily meteorological forcing functions were generated using the 10 min data obtained from the meteorological buoys by simple summing or averaging daily nutrient concentrations of tributaries were calculated using monthly data through linear interpolation discharge from the feed in tributaries is regarded as an important variable influencing the hydrodynamic and biochemical evolutions in lake ecosystems kamal et al 2020 however most of the tributaries of lake chaohu are ungauged and inflow data are not available to bridge this gap we developed a two stage runoff coefficient estimation and scaling rces approach for reconstructing daily inflows of lake chaohu in an earlier paper peng et al 2019c validation results suggest that the inflow time series reconstructed from the rces approach is consistent and agrees with corresponding observations the mean deterministic coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency values are 0 69 and 0 60 respectively we used the rces approach to generate daily inflows from the 13 tributaries for the period from 2016 to 2019 full details of the rces implementation are provided in peng et al 2019c 2 3 2 validation of hydrodynamic model the ecolake model parameters were calibrated using monthly observations of water quality parameters obtained in 2016 the model fit was evaluated using a uniformly weighted average of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient and a symmetric measure of bias peng et al 2019b to evaluate the accuracy of the ecolake model in simulating lake currents we followed studies by beletsky et al 2006 and huang et al 2010 to calculate the misfit between the modeled and observed currents represented by 1 f n 1 t t 1 t v sim v obs 2 1 t t 1 t v obs 2 where fn is a normalized fourier norm and can also be regarded as the relative percentage of variance in the observed currents that are unexplained by the model solutions v sim and v obs are simulated and observed currents at the time step t t 1 2 t respectively fn ranges from 0 to when an fn value of 0 indicates that perfect simulations have been achieved 2 4 scenario designs and numerical experiments 2 4 1 scenario designs we designed two groups of scenarios to simulate the influence of the ycwtp and cs operations on the current circulation and water quality of lake chaohu each group consists of four operation scenarios scenario designs were based on daily observations of inflow rates m3 s during the water transfer experiment carried out from 15 july to 8 agust 20178 8 for both groups of scenarios daily concentrations of the ycwtp water quality parameters were set to the observed values during this water transfer period in addition a baseline scenario was generated by setting both the inflows from ycwtp and the outflows from cs to zero a detailed depiction of scenario designs can be found in table 2 the first group of scenarios were designed to solely evaluate the effects of the ycwtp operations in this regard the outflows from the cs were set to zero which agreed with the observations during the 2017 water transfer period for scenario a1 the inflows of both ycwtp routines were set to the observed values during the 2017 water transfer period thus this scenario can be deemed as an evaluation of the effects based on the 2017 water transfer experiments scenario a2 switches the water transfer processes from east route er to the west route wr of the ycwtp in other words the er inflows were set to zero and the wr inflows were set to the corresponding values observed for the er during the 2017 water transfer period for scenario a3 water transfer inflows from both routines were set to the daily observations of the er scenario a4 was designed to evaluate the maximum influence of ycwtp by setting inflows from both routines to their full water transfer capabilities at an inflow rate of 150 m3 s the second group of scenarios were designed to simulate the effects of ycwtp and cs joint operations on lake current patterns and the water quality of lake chaohu scenarios in this group followed the same protocol for this ycwtp as the first group however we decided to operate the cs concurrently with the ycwtp by setting releases from the cs to the same inflow rates as the ycwtp in other words daily water budgets of the lake for scenarios in the second group were same as the baseline scenario 2 4 2 numerical experiments we fed the above mentioned nine scenarios and other observed hydrometeorological and water quality forcing functions into the ecolake model to simulate the evolution of lake current and water quality variables under different operation strategies of the ycwtp and cs all models ran continuously for 3 month periods from 1 july to 30 september fig 3 shows the meteorological conditions during the simulation period cumulative rainfall during this period was 418 2 mm wind speeds ranged between 0 m s and 7 8 m s and the water level of lake chaohu ranged between 8 27 m and 9 11 m with an average value of 8 75 m the model initial conditions such as water level water temperature permanganate index nitrate nitrogen nitrite nitrogen nh3 n do tp and tn were interpolated over each of the grid cells covering the lake through the inverse distance weighting method using monitoring data on 1 july 2017 the period from 1 july to 14 july was used to spin up the hydrodynamic model to stabilize the state variables the effect of the initial conditions on the long term model simulation should be negligible after the model has ran for a couple of weeks huang et al 2010 model results for from 15 july to 8 august and from 9 august to 30 september were compared to the baseline scenario to evaluate the effects of ycwtp during the water transfer period and the cs operations effects on the lake ecosystem after water transfer 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results of the ecolake model we begin by examining the performance of the ecolake model in simulating the current structure of lake chaohu subplots in fig 4 compare the simulated and observed currents for the 12 monitoring stations averaged from 12 november to 31 december 2019 and throughout the entire water column the central subplot depicts the lake wide current patterns derived from the ecolake model and the colors indicate the average water depth within this period model results suggest that large scale currents exhibited considerable spatial variability during the validation period a broad west to east offshore current occurred in the central region of the lake three small scale anticyclonic circulations developed in the northern parts of the western central and eastern basins and one cyclonic circulation developed along the southern regions of the western to central basins in the lake chaohu catchment wind is generally from the northwest during the winter months therefore the west to east current in the open lake is mainly driven by wind however small scale structures such as gyres can develop in certain basins such as lake bays or in nearshore regions with complex bathymetry bennington et al 2010 fig 4 shows the simulated currents derived from the hydrodynamic module of the ecolake model to be in good agreement with observed current speeds and directions for most monitoring stations normalized fourier norms ranged between 0 23 at station 1 and 1 28 at station 2 with an average mean value of 0 63 for all the monitoring stations however considerable differences occurred between simulations and observations in both current direction and speed at stations 2 3 and 4 note that these monitoring stations are located near the estuaries of three important lake chaohu tributaries one possible explanation of the bad model performance for these stations is that shallow lakes such as lake chaohu typically have smaller water storage compared to their reservoir or ocean counterparts therefore the gravity current in the estuary zones of such shallow lakes can be highly sensitive to inflow rates shi et al 2019 azevedo et al 2010 due to the absence of inflow observations the inaccurate estimation of daily inflows using the rces method by peng et al 2019c may cause considerable errors for the hydrodynamic models in simulating lake current patterns in the estuary regions of large tributaries in an earlier paper by peng et al 2019b we validated the ecolake model accuracy in simulating water quality parameters including tn tp do and nh3 n using observations obtained from 2016 for lake chaohu only a brief account of the validation results for the water quality parameters are provided here results suggested that the rmse values of the ecolake model for different water quality variables ranged from 0 06 to 1 28 and the mae values ranged from 0 04 to 0 98 the relative error statistics ranged between 0 10 and 0 39 indicating that the accuracy of the water quality model meets the general guidance criteria published in usepa 1990 we also validated the model accuracy in simulating chla and the results not shown suggest that the relative error ranged from 0 19 to 0 52 for different sampling sites with a mean value of 0 37 3 2 influence of ycwtp operations on current structure fig 5 shows model results for the depth averaged current patterns from 15 july to 8 agust 2017 under the four ycwtp operation scenarios colors denote the relative changes in current speeds compared to the baseline scenario when no water was transferred to the lake we first note that the currents are generally from west to east in the offshore regions of lake chaohu even though there is a notable difference in some regions under different scenarios this current pattern is mainly driven by inflows since most of the tributaries are concentrated in the western part of the lake fast alongshore currents exist along both the southern and northern coastlines of the lake which generally flow in a direction opposite to the offshore currents weak anticyclonic currents can be found in the northern and central regions of the lake model results suggest that ycwtp operations lead to an overall acceleration in current speed averaged over the whole lake accelerations in current speeds for the four operation scenarios are 0 28 cm s 0 39 cm s 0 64 cm s and 0 90 cm s respectively the operation scenario a1 tends to have a negative influence on current speed in the central region of the western lake basin and has an overall positive effect on the eastern basin but the magnitude of the change in speed is relatively small generally ranging between 1 and 1 cm s since scenario a1 uses the same wind field as the baseline scenario to force the hydrodynamic model the overall acceleration in current speed can be attributed to the increasing inflow rate caused by the water transferring which leads to the acceleration of the gravity current in the broad eastern basin when the water transfer pathway is switched from the er to the wr scenario a2 a remarkable current acceleration is induced in the central region of the middle to eastern basin at the same time the speed of the nearshore current in the central basin exhibits a decreasing trend doubling the water transfer flow rate by operating the dual routines of ycwtp concurrently scenario a3 potentially exhibits a similar influence on current speed in the western basin as scenario a2 but both the area and magnitude of the deceleration in the current speed are more evident similar results are achieved when the wr and er of the ycwtp are operated concurrently at full capacities scenario a4 but the magnitude of the current acceleration in lake basins east of the er estuary is enhanced slightly compared to scenario a3 fig 6 further depicts the u and v current components of the five vertical layers for grid cells along the west east central section as shown in fig 1 during the summer winds are primarily from the southeast over the lake chaohu catchment as is supported by the u zonal velocity i e the component of the horizontal eastward winds and v the meridional velocity i e the component of the northward horizontal wind in fig 3 dominated by wind the current direction of the surface layer was mostly northwestward during the water transfer period in 2017 as is supposed by the negative values of the u components and positive values of the v components both the u and v components of currents in the near surface layer tend to be the lowest among the five layers and exhibit obvious spatial transitions in their direction directions of both u and v components in the central near bottom and bottom layers are opposite to the surface layer on the other hand fig 6 clearly shows that the operations of the ycwtp have an apparent influence on both the u and v current components for all five of the vertical layers general patterns reveal that speeds of both components increase at all layers 3 3 effects of ycwtp and cs joint operations on current structure the numerical experiment results suggest that the spatial variations of changes in current speed and direction are more evident when the ycwtp and cs are operated jointly compared to the model results for scenarios where only the ycwtp is in operation as shown in fig 7 current speed changes in lake basins on the west of the ycwtp estuaries become slighter when the ycwtp and cs are operated jointly on the contrary current speeds in a broad lake basin to the east of the ycwtp are altered significantly overall speeds of alongshore currents tend to be decelerated generally with magnitudes ranging between 0 and 2 cm s on the other hand water current speeds in the central to eastern basins exhibit an obviously accelerated trend particularly in the outflowing region of the cs moreover the magnitude of the accelerations or decelerations in water current speeds increase with the growing inflow and outflow rates fig 8 further elucidates the influence of both groups of scenarios on the depth averaged u and v components of currents in different lake basins solid and dashed curves show the speed variations under scenarios in group a and group b respectively the mid gray shades show the water transfer period the curves are extended to 30 september 2017 to illustrate the follow up effects after water transfer we first note that the differences in both u and v current components in the eastern basin are the biggest under different scenarios followed by the central basin and western basin focusing on the u components of the eastern basin at a temporal scale the differences among the different scenarios enlarge rapidly from the first day of the joint ycwtp and cs operations comparing to scenarios in group a when no water is released from the cs the effects of the ycwtp and cs joint operations are much more significant during the water transfer period but the effects diminish rapidly and the current speeds get closer to the baseline scenario after about one day or so on the other hand although the effects of operation scenarios in group a are much smaller during the water transfer period the follow up effects remain remarkable until the end of the simulation period the follow up effects of scenarios in group a could be explained by the rising water levels of the lake induced by water transfer especially since the lake had no outflows during this period the water depth of a lake is regarded as an important variable that affects the hydrodynamics of lakes in shallow lakes such as lake chaohu the baroclinic effects caused by the winds inflows and outflows are a major mechanism affecting current patterns changes in water level can alter the baroclinic structure at different water depth thereby alter the current speed and direction bennington et al 2010 similar results were reported by karamigolbaghi et al 2019 who found that even a 2 cm difference in the water level can create a 63 cm s difference in current speed in sodus bay of lake ontario which is relatively large compared with normal velocities in the bay 3 4 effects of ycwtp operations on water quality we next assess the effects of ycwtp operations on the water quality of lake chaohu fig 9 shows the relative changes in vertical averaged concentrations of the five water quality parameters during the water transfer period under different ycwtp operation strategies compared to the baseline scenario one striking feature is that the effects of different operation scenarios vary considerably across lake basins and water parameters summer algal blooms are one of the most important ecosystem problems of lake chaohu chla concentration is commonly used as a proxy variable of total phytoplankton biomass kelly et al 2020 wen et al 2019 it is pleasing to see that the ycwtp may help reducing the chla concentration of lake chaohu as shown in fig 9 chla concentration tends to decrease over the whole lake except with the exception of estuary regions of the ycwtp although the magnitude of the decrease is generally slight with maximal values of 9 4 and 13 6 attained for the scenarios a3 and a4 respectively the relative percentage of changes in chla concentration over the whole lake under the four operation scenarios are 2 05 1 93 3 79 and 5 38 respectively water temperature and illumination conditions underwater are two important variables that govern the photosynthetic activities of algae soontiens et al 2019 the water transfer led to a maximum rise of 0 32 m in the lake level which potentially reduces the vertical averaged underwater illumination and water temperature this has a negative impact on the photosynthetic rate and growth of algae which may partly explain the decrease of lake wide chla concentration the daily averaged chla concentration of the ycwtp was slightly higher than the estuary regions of the ycwtp which may explain the increase of chla concentration in the estuary regions of the ycwtp another obvious feature in fig 9 is that the ycwtp operations led to a remarkable increase of nh3 n concentration in most of the lake with the exception of the ycwtp estuary zones this can be attributed to the decreasing of chla concentration as algae growth will consume a portion of nh3 n for tn and tp general change patterns include the tendency of concentrations in the central lake basin to decrease while moderate areas in the western and eastern lake basins suffered from increased concentrations compared to the baseline scenario lake wide averaged changes in tn concentration for the four operation scenarios a1 a2 a3 and a4 were 1 18 0 55 1 61 and 2 12 respectively for tp averaged concentration changes are 2 21 0 39 2 30 and 3 03 respectively the spatial variation pattern of tn and tp concentrations can be linked to the alteration of hydrodynamic conditions during the operational period of the ycwtp pollutants in the central basin can be flushed to the eastern and western basins thus the tn and tp concentrations in the central basin are expected to decrease while the eastern and western basins will exhibit converse patterns the spatial distribution of changes in the do concentration exhibited many differences to tn and tp an increasing trend was found along the north west and northwest nearshore regions of the lake while a broad offshore region generally suffers from decreasing do concentration for the four operation scenarios the changes in do concentration averaged over the whole lake range between 5 13 4 41 2 45 4 4 4 54 6 97 and 5 33 8 33 with mean values of 0 52 0 29 0 85 and 1 14 respectively due to the photosynthetic activities algae produces a portion of oxygen in water e g saber et al 2020 the decrease of chla concentration may partly explain the reduced do concentration in most regions of the lake 3 5 influence of ycwtp and cs joint operations on water quality fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of relative changes in the concentrations of the five water quality parameters when ycwtp and cs are operated jointly scenarios b1 b2 b3 and b4 over the period of 15 july to 8 august 2017 the concentration changes vary with water parameters and lake basins a clear pattern shows the concentration of the five water quality parameters exhibiting an overall increasing trend in the eastern part of the lake in contrast a general decrease in concentrations was found in the central western lake basins the variation patterns of the water quality parameters can be mainly attributed to the current change patterns the accelerated current speed in the central to eastern basin will promote the transport of pollutants from the central basin to the eastern basin however there are some differences for specific regions among different scenarios as well for example compared to the baseline scenario scenario b1 leads to an overall decrease of tp concentration in the central part of the lake however when water transfer through the wr was carried out scenarios b2 b3 and b4 an increasing trend in tp concentration was found in the lake basin between the wr and er estuaries similar patterns can also be found for chla fig 11 summarizes the proportion of lake area where the concentrations of water quality parameters change at different magnitudes for each of the eight scenarios a1 a4 and b1 b4 the blue bars indicate that concentrations of the water quality parameters are dropping and the red bars indicate that the concentrations are increasing compared to the baseline scenario where no water is transferred through ycwtp and released from cs proportions of the lake area where concentrations of water quality parameters decrease are larger than the parameters showing a water quality increase for most operation scenarios with the exception of the nh3 n for all four scenarios in group a and tn for the a1 scenario results clearly demonstrate that an overall improvement of water quality was achieved by operating the ycwtp the joint ycwtp and cs operations had larger proportions of lake areas with decreasing concentrations of nh3 n and tn than the ycwtp operation solely thus the benefit of joint operations was more apparent for these two parameters however compared to the scenarios when only the ycwtp is operated smaller proportions of lake areas with decreasing concentration of chla were observed when the two projects operated jointly this was caused by the accelerated current in the broad central and eastern basins which tend to flush algae in the western basin to the eastern basin 3 6 the follow up effects of ycwtp and cs operations on water quality our final analysis focuses on the temporal changes in water quality for different lake basins during both the water transfer period and the follow up period lasting several months fig 12 shows the relative changes in daily concentrations of each of the five water quality parameters and for each of the eight operation scenarios in three lake basins solid curves denote group a scenarios and dashed curves denote group b scenarios the gray shaded columns indicate the water transfer period in 2017 fig 12 clearly demonstrates that for all operation strategies the effects on the water quality of lake chaohu are retained to the end of the simulation period but the effects also exhibited considerable variations both spatially and temporally for both operation scenario groups the smallest effects were noted in the western lake basin during the water transfer period the effects on the central basin increased rapidly and tended to decrease gradually after the joint ycwtp and cs operations ended the response of water quality parameters in the eastern basin to the joint ycwtp and cs operations was substantially delayed compared to the central basin but the effects on this basin were much more profound during the two month follow up period the ycwtp operation effects on the nh3 n concentration of the western lake were not obvious during the first six or seven day of water transfer which can be attributed to the delayed response of the nh3 n concentration to the relative biochemical variables such as water temperature algae and do concentrations however nh3 n concentration increased rapidly afterwards particularly for scenarios a2 to a4 when water transfer through the wr was carried out for all three lake basins the nh3 n concentration increased gradually with small fluctuations and reached their peaks toward the end of august as previously mentioned the joint ycwtp and cs operations exhibited a limited effect on the nh3 n concentration of the western lake but may help decrease the nh3 n concentration for the central and eastern lake basins for all operation scenarios tn concentration tended to decrease continuously in both western and central basins during the water transfer period from 15 july to 8 august 2017 but the variation gradient in the central basin was much higher than the western basin particularly for the group b scenarios tn concentration rebounded quickly after the water transfer period and several scenarios surpassed the baseline scenario tp temporal concentration variations show a pattern very similar to that of tn the chla concentration variations generally show a bowl shape for all three basins when the ycwtp is operated when the cs is paired with the ycwtp operation chla concentration tended to increase during the first five to six days in the central and eastern basins then it decreased continuously until mid august from that point on the chla concentration remained at stable levels until the end of the simulation 4 limitations and future work one of the most important purposes of the ycwtp is to improve water quality and to alleviate summer algal bloom of lake chaohu by transferring clearer water from the yangtze river to dilute the polluted lake water or to flush the pollutants out of the lake wang et al 2018 thus the effectiveness of water transfer in improving water quality of lake chaohu depends heavily on the water quality of the yangtze river however the yangtze river is located in the most populated and developed region of china the intense anthropogenic activities such as urbanization and industrialization together with variations in hydrological regime caused by operations of the three gorges dam and extreme flood or drought events strongly affect the timing and magnitude of nutrient loading of the river and cause considerable spatial and temporal fluctuations in water quality wang et al 2020 moreover anthropogenic activities along the open canals of the ycwtp would also lead to additional uncertainties to the water quality of the ycwtp e g yang et al 2020 due to the limited availability of the water quality data of the ycwtp our numerical experiments were conducted under certain water quality conditions during a 24 day water transfer period in 2017 future works may focus on evaluating the effect and risk of the inter seasonal and inter annual water quality variations of the ycwtp and sudden water pollution incidents caused by storm runoff or other reasons on lake chaohu ecosystem in our design of joint operation scenarios we simply assumed that the inflows from ycwtp were equal to outflows from the cs in this way water storages under all joint operation schemes were kept consistent with the baseline scenario where both inflows from the ycwtp and outflows from the cs were set to zeros this enabled us to inter compare the sequential consequences of different operation schemes during the following two months under uniform hydrometeorological conditions as stated in the introduction lake chaohu provides multiple ecosystem services such as rural and urban water supplies flood regulation and water transport this means that the practical operations of these large projects can be far more complicated than is currently assumed evaluating management decisions should not be confined to consideration of hydrodynamic condition and water quality of a lake but its effects on the broad suite of important ecosystem services provided by lake what s more important the catchment scale environmental societal and economic consequences should be evaluated comprehensively for instance decreases of outflow from the cs will impact ecological conditions and threaten water supplies downstream but increases can increase flood risks downstream these outcomes and trade offs are likely to be differentially sensitive to changes in the different components of the lake water budget drivers as well as to the overall water balance thompson et al 2017 due to the limited availability of observational data during the water transfer period our numerical experiments for the joint operations of both projects were conducted only for a relatively low lake level period theoretically the joint operation of both projects could occur during low level period if severe water pollution or algal bloom events happen however the occurrence probability of joint operations during low level period is likely to be low or inflows from the ycwtp could be much higher than outflows from the cs to maintain lake level for water supply and water transport purposes the changes in inflow and outflow conditions as well as changes in of the joint operation durations may yield great difference in modelling outcomes oliveira et al 2020 understanding the effects of large water conservation projects on lake ecosystems can be complicated and challenging not only because a lack of baseline observations but also due to both the internal nonlinear and high dimensional processes among ecosystem variables in lakes and the complex interactions between lake variables and external landscape variables such as land use and atmospheric deposition ward et al 2020 scully 2016 a well calibrated hydrodynamic and biochemical model provides insights into the time space evolution of lake ecosystem variables on a small horizontal scale thereby enabling us to tease apart the individual effects of water conservation projects from other external drivers however modern hydrodynamic and biochemical models are still far from perfect due to measurement errors of initial conditions boundary conditions and the forcing functions as well as imperfect model structure and parameterization there is considerable uncertainty associated with outputs from these processes based numerical models novic et al 2018 there is increasing concern that the use of deterministic model outputs may lead to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient management strategies tscheikner gratl et al 2019 thus future work in this area could include quantifying the uncertainty associated with model outputs used to support decision making of water conservation project operations 5 summary and conclusions large scale water conservation projects are continuously being constructed worldwide for large freshwater lakes to ease the water supply pressure and or to control pollution understanding the effects related to water transfer projects and lake sluices on circulation patterns and the water quality of large lakes is essential to effective water resource management this paper presents results from a 3 d hydrodynamic and biochemical model which was used to investigate the effects of different operation strategies of water transfer and lake sluice projects on current structures and the water quality of a large shallow lake the ecolake model proved highly capable of capturing the current pattern at most of the 12 monitoring sites with a mean normalized fourier norm value of 0 63 increases of inflows due to water transfer lead to an overall acceleration in current speed averaged over the whole lake accelerations in current speed for the four operation scenarios of ycwtp are 0 28 cm s 0 39 cm s 0 64 cm s and 0 90 cm s respectively ycwtp operations tend to decrease lake wide chla concentration as well as tn and tp concentrations in the central lake however there is an obvious lake wide increase in nh3 n concentration except for the inflowing regions of the ycwtp compared to scenarios in which only the ycwtp is in operation the joint operations of ycwtp and a lake sluice like cs tend to decrease the nearshore current speed at magnitudes of 0 to 2 cm s and tend to increase the offshore current speed for water quality parameters the joint operations typically have larger lake areas with decreasing concentrations of nh3 n and tn than when operating the ycwtp solely however they also have smaller area where chla concentration is decreasing at the temporal scale although ycwtp can help decrease chla concentration during the water transfer period the effect diminishes gradually in the following two months in contrast when ycwtp and cs are operated jointly chla concentration tend to decrease continuously and then remain at low levels results of this study can support optimal

4957,understanding of turbidity an indicator of water quality is of great importance in cities and can have significant implications for human society many users are interested in mapping turbidity using remote sensing tools for long term and large scale monitoring this study aims to derive turbidity maps in an urbanizing city and to identify the driving factors for better decision making and water quality management taking wuhan the most rapidly urbanizing metropolis in central china as an instance the water turbidity is monitored using landsat observations from 1987 to 2019 and the relationships of turbidity and climatic human factors are examined climatic factors are represented by meteorological conditions rainfall wind speed temperature and water vapor pressure and human factors are characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and impervious surface area isa the results demonstrated that 1 the seasonal mean turbidity increased from spring to summer 34 28 ntu to 36 27 ntu decreased in autumn 25 04 ntu and increased again in winter 37 20 ntu and the variations were related to changes in rainfall and 2 the annual mean turbidity was fluctuatingly stable during 1987 2004 and decreased by 1 ntu yr since 2005 the decline of water turbidity was highly correlated to the increase of ndvi and isa with p values 0 01 the study indicates that meteorological conditions affect seasonal variations in turbidity while human factors have long term impacts a cautious approach to human activities during urbanization is needed to achieve a balance between water quality protection and the city s developments keywords water turbidity landsat observations long term urbanization remote sensing 1 introduction city waters are very important for their close connection to human society and highly valuable for human health and social activities mouw et al 2015 their water quality is affected by human activities directly and or indirectly cao et al 2017 which are directly affected by dredging activities wu et al 2007 or indirectly influenced by human induced land use changes fraterrigo and downing 2008 also acting as a sentinel of climate change water quality is significantly influenced by natural factors such as temperature bryant 2009 wind speed shi et al 2015 and rainfall onyutha et al 2016 the degradation of water quality may affect its environmental functions and trigger severe social problems accurate monitoring and understanding of city water quality are vital for scientists engineers and policy makers for efficient decision making and appropriate engineering interventions jayson quashigah et al 2019 satellite remote sensing has been increasingly applied for the monitoring of inland water quality at large scales and long periods li et al 2017 toming et al 2016 for water quality monitoring turbidity is usually an essential parameter to be retrieved nechad et al 2010 thus it is crucial to map city water turbidity as accurately as possible using satellite remote sensing dogliotti et al 2015 urbanization results in population agglomeration and land use changes which cause the decline of ecosystem values manes et al 2016 the city s urbanization may have negative effects on aquatic ecosystems especially for water rich cities du et al 2010 people s concern about water quality is rising around the world dietrich et al 2014 and requires the protection of the environment the political management of urban growth has been implemented since the 19th century to improve the environmental conditions in the city peterson 2018 it is therefore important to monitor the turbidity in a developing city for government decision making for better aquatic ecosystems wuhan is the most quickly developing metropolis in central china and has experienced rapid urbanization during the last four decades since the open and reform policy in 1978 shen et al 2016 due to its importance as a location of modern industrialization in china wuhan shares a series of national preferential development policies du et al 2010 stimulated by national and local investments wuhan is undergoing unprecedented urbanization with a population of over 10 million and a land area over 8500 km2 luo et al 2018 the impervious surface area isa increased at approximately 30 km2 yr from 1987 to 2004 and 135 km2 yr since 2005 and was up to 2400 km2 in 2019 shao et al 2019 besides wuhan has two of the largest city lakes in china and a nickname of water city with more than 100 lakes which indicates that wuhan is rich in water resources due to rapid socio economic development water pollution in wuhan has become serious allmann et al 2013 wei et al 2019 rapid urbanization has also caused a huge reduction in lake areas and has become a key issue impacting residents wu et al 2020 since 2000 the wuhan government has enacted lake protection regulations to maintain the quality and functions of lakes du et al 2010 in the wuhan master plan of 2005 ecology aspects are considered for long term city development thus it is of interest and importance to monitor the water turbidity in wuhan during its rapid development and to provide guidance to maintain the balance between the city s development and environmental protection du et al 2010 however to the best of our knowledge water turbidity in wuhan is rarely studied not to mention the long term and large scale monitoring of this key water quality parameter many previous studies have suggested that turbidity variations are both climate and human induced cao et al 2017 to better manage and protect water ecosystems for their ecological and economic values it is necessary to distinguish the impacts of climatic conditions and human activities on water turbidity previous researches suggest that wind temperature and rainfall are the main factors that affect the temporal and spatial variations in suspended particulate matter bryant 2009 cao et al 2018 feng et al 2014 onyutha et al 2016 shi et al 2015 which is highly related to water turbidity dogliotti et al 2015 meteorological parameters related to these factors are very likely to affect the variations of water turbidity in addition human activities lead to land use land cover change which also affects the variations in water turbidity fraterrigo and downing 2008 singh et al 2020 key influencing factors of turbidity including meteorological conditions and human activities should be identified to better understand and manage the aquatic environments cao et al 2017 the turbidity of city waters is typically inhomogeneous spatially and temporally making it extremely difficult to monitor using traditional field sampling methods zhou et al 2018 satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient and commonly used methods to monitor water turbidity at large spatial scales and long temporal periods through frequent and synoptic observations dogliotti et al 2015 generally water turbidity is monitored using dedicated wide swath ocean color satellite sensors e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis cao et al 2017 however these sensors are typically too coarse for monitoring small inland waters in wuhan fortunately imagery from higher resolution sensors such as landsat has been successfully used to monitor inland water quality vanhellemont and ruddick 2014 landsat sensors have already observed the earth for over five decades and their products are well maintained and consistent wulder et al 2019 therefore images from landsat sensors 30 m 16 days including the thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli provide great opportunities to derive the water turbidity in wuhan various turbidity models are geographically or regionally specific and require specific adaptation or calibration for varied regions and sensors dogliotti et al 2015 most proposed algorithms are derived from the regression analysis of turbidity against reflectance from different satellite wavelength bands zhou et al 2020 a good correlation can be easily found between turbidity and reflectance at red and or near infrared nir bands dogliotti et al 2015 semi analytical approaches have also been developed to retrieve turbidity nechad et al 2010 both semi analytical and empirical models can be used to derive water turbidity gohin et al 2005 and have been implemented by many optical sensors over multiple regions nechad et al 2009 thus a turbidity model suitable for wuhan waters can be built this study has two main objectives 1 to quantify the seasonal and annual variability and long term trends of water turbidity in wuhan between 1987 and 2019 using landsat images this analysis will provide valuable information for water quality in wuhan and give guidance to the government in decision making and 2 to determine the impacts of climatic and human factors on variations in turbidity which can deepen our understanding of water turbidity in a rapidly developing city 2 study area located in central china wuhan 30 35 n and 114 17 e fig 1 landsat tile path 123 and row 39 is rapidly growing and rich in water resources there are over 2 200 km2 of inland waters accounting for approximately 25 of the total area huang and wang 2019 wuhan has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with annual average precipitation of 1140 1265 mm du et al 2010 and a temperature of 288 95 290 65 k shen et al 2016 additionally wuhan suffers from extremely hot and humid summers peel et al 2007 the seasonality of climate results in uneven precipitation throughout the year in wuhan approximately 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season from april to october du et al 2010 which might further affect water turbidity five lakes in different districts in wuhan are selected to present the typical waters in rural and urban areas for studying turbidity variations in wuhan specifically the wu xiaozha and liangzi lakes are in rural areas from northern to southern wuhan while the dong and tangxun lakes are in the city center fig 1 b wuhan is undergoing unprecedented rapid urbanization over the past few decades the city central area increased by 16 34 from 2009 to 2014 and will reach 1030 km2 by 2020 luo et al 2018 wuhan has witnessed significant land use changes during urban expansion since the 1990s and its water bodies have been significantly affected during this period du et al 2010 the wuhan master plan of 1996 established the ecologically friendly framework for the city s developments however due to the lack of systematic consideration public awareness and political will the practice was not implemented until the 2005 wuhan master plan du et al 2010 the policies affect human activities during the urbanization process which might influence the environmental conditions for example several aspects are emphasized resources and bureau 2010 1 afforestation and forest reservation are promoted to establish an ecological network by greening the wetland forest and farmland regions 2 any land use activities harmful to ecosystems are strictly prohibited to gradually restore ecological functions 3 environmental protection projects such as energy saving and emission reducing projects and the construction of sewage treatment plants are supported to build an environmental friendly society 4 projects for soil pollution treatment and restoration focusing on heavy metal and pesticide contamination are proposed to improve soil quality 5 agricultural pollutions are prevented by regulating the number of livestock and poultry farms near reservoirs lakes and rivers for the protection of drinking water resources 6 soil erosion treatment is strengthened and policies for soil and water conservation are enforced to reduce human induced destruction of land covers 3 datasets and methods the primary data used in this study consist of in situ turbidity measurements cloud free landsat tm etm oli images and meteorological data turbidity was derived from satellite images with an empirical model calibrated against in situ turbidity measurements the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and isa derived from the landsat images were used as indicators of the city s land use change in environmental and urbanizing aspects respectively chen and cihlar 1996 liu et al 2018 shao et al 2019 meteorological data including rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure were used to analyze the influencing climatic factors of the turbidity variations these datasets and methods are described in the following sections in detail 3 1 in situ turbidity measurements six field stations at lakes and four at rivers in wuhan fig 1 and table 1 provided the in situ turbidity dataset for this study which was measured using an lfwcs 2008 water quality analyzer lihero technology limited company hunan china based on the light scattering method matsuzaki et al 2000 the sites at both lakes and rivers could represent the general water characteristics in wuhan however the river waters originate from multiple sources and might be affected by upstream flows thus the field measurements at rivers are only used to build the turbidity model and the rivers are excluded in the analysis of turbidity variations in wuhan field turbidity measurements were obtained once per hour or once every four hours during three periods june 07 2018 september 27 2019 october 07 23 2019 and january 17 february 09 2020 table 1 generally values of turbidity are in the range of 1 100 ntu but they can be much higher and surpass 1000 ntu in some cases the turbidity values in rivers sites 7 10 are normally larger than those in lakes except site 6 indicating that lake waters are usually clearer than river waters in wuhan site 6 is near the liangzi ecotourism resort whose management has planned to protect lake waters during the measurement periods which might explain why turbidity at site 6 is higher than that of other sites at lakes and even at some river sites 3 2 satellite images and preprocessing 3 2 1 the tm etm and oli images the continuity of landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli is supported by the 1992 us land remote sensing act wulder et al 2019 the tm archive obtained by landsat 5 spans the period from 1984 to 2013 landsat 7 was launched in april 1999 and has been providing data until now and carries the etm since june 2003 due to the scan line corrector slc failure the etm has captured data containing a gap accounting for approximately 22 of the data arvidson et al 2006 the oli onboard landsat 8 added to the previous spectral bands and has provided observations since 2013 wulder et al 2019 the high quality of landsat data has sparked numerous time series analyses for monitoring of water quality kuhn et al 2019 ren et al 2018 zheng et al 2016 the tm etm and oli data with a high spatial resolution of 30 m and a long period allow for the monitoring of water turbidity in wuhan over multi annual periods the surface reflectance sr products covering the study area were downloaded from the google earth engine gee https earthengine google com platform gorelick et al 2017 after filtering the images with cloud coverage 40 during 1987 2019 145 tm scenes 102 etm scenes and 42 oli scenes were visually selected to avoid the influence of clouds aerosols and sun glint shi et al 2015 in addition the fmask algorithm was applied to determine clear water pixels and to avoid clouds and cloud shadows zhu et al 2015 the temporal distribution of the valid images is plotted in fig 2 the landsat sr products are atmospherically corrected based on the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum 6sv model vermote et al 1997 specifically landsat 5 tm and landsat 7 etm sr products are processed by the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps masek et al 2006 while landsat 8 oli sr products are generated by the landsat surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 the oli onboard landsat 8 has improved capabilities a higher signal to noise ratio snr and an additional band for water monitoring relative to the previous landsat sensors and has been shown adequately for studying aquatic systems wulder et al 2019 the full landsat heritage has been also widely used to monitor turbidity and is reliable especially if based on a single band feng et al 2013 kuhn et al 2019 wei et al 2018 wulder et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that the sr products can be successfully used to retrieve water quality parameters over complex inland waters gomes et al 2020 griffin et al 2018 kuhn et al 2019 thus the sr products downloaded by gee can be safely used to derive water turbidity in wuhan 3 2 2 image preprocessing the landsat sr products downloaded from the gee were atmospherically corrected based on the 6sv model which could not correct tm etm and oli images perfectly because atmospheric parameters e g water vapor and visibility should be optimized lobo et al 2015 therefore the radiometric discrepancy of these atmospherically corrected data should be corrected which is normally achieved using very steady spectra as reference lobo et al 2015 the steadiest area a large white building 10 pixels 10 pixels in wuhan corresponding to the lowest coefficient of variation cv of all oli images from 2013 to 2019 was selected as the invariant spectra in this study specifically we calculated the mean and standard deviation std values of oli surface reflectance of each pixel and then determined the pixels with the smallest cv cv std mean 100 during 2013 2019 after selecting the invariant area the average atmospherically corrected reflectance of each tm etm and oli image in this region was calculated fig 3 shows the mean surface reflectance of the stable area from tm etm and oli data which displays the stability of the selected site based on the atmospherically corrected reflectance from the invariant area a radiometric band adjustment factor rbaf to minimize the radiometric discrepancy is defined as 1 r b a f m e a n ρ a c r e f m e a n ρ a c t a r where ρ a c r e f and ρ a c t a r represent atmospherically corrected reflectance of reference and target sensors respectively chronologically the period of etm images can be combined with the periods of tm and oli data to form a complete time series thus etm was used as a reference sensor and the other two sensors were considered as target sensors only the rbafs of tm and oli at red and nir bands are calculated and listed in table 2 because the turbidity model in this paper is based on red and nir bands more details can be found in section 3 4 due to different band settings each sensor responds to the water reflectance signal in a unique way therefore another difference between tm etm and oli sensors is associated with the discrepancy in the relative spectral response rsr function different rsrs affect how the earth s surface is seen by the sensors and thus result in varied observations while imaging the same target chander et al 2013 the discrepancy in rsrs can be reduced using a spectral band adjustment factor sbaf for water bodies the sbaf is defined as chander et al 2013 2 s b a f ρ w r s r r e f d λ r s r r e f d λ ρ w r s r t a r d λ r s r t a r d λ where ρ w is the field measured water reflectance λ means wavelength and r s r r e f and r s r t a r denote rsrs of reference and target sensors respectively based on the in situ water reflectance measurements 9 samples during a field trip in wuhan in 2011 which was measured using an svc field portable spectroradiometer spectra vista corp inc new york ny usa 350 to 900 nm at 1 6 nm increments following nasa s ocean color measurement protocol and under clear sky conditions between 10 a m and 2p m local time li et al 2019 the sbafs of tm and oli were calculated and listed in table 2 in addition the gaps of slc off etm images were filled using the single file gap fill triangulation method embedded in the environment for visualizing images envi plugin the rbafs were then applied to tm and oli data to convert them into etm like reflectance and eliminate radiometric differences and sbafs were used to reduce spectral discrepancies 3 3 ancillary datasets the urbanization induced land use change associated with greenspace was characterized by the ndvi ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d chen and cihlar 1996 after the waters were excluded using the normalized difference built up index ndbi ρ m i r ρ n i r ρ m i r ρ n i r zha et al 2003 and modified normalized difference water index mndwi ρ g r e e n ρ m i r ρ g r e e n ρ m i r xu 2006 the annual mean ndvi of wuhan was calculated note that the negative values of ndbi and mndwi indicate water pixels roy et al 2020 only ndvi in the city core with a buffer of 25 km was obtained to exclude areas far from the city s urbanization the urbanization induced land use change associated with built up areas was represented by isa which is obtained from shao et al 2019 the isa covering wuhan was derived from the landsat data using gee and the random forest algorithm breiman 2001 more details about the isa used in this study can be found in shao et al 2019 the monthly mean meteorological data including rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure from 1987 to 2019 were acquired from the meteorological station in wuhan see fig 1 which were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn 3 4 turbidity algorithm turbidity products from ocean color sensors e g modis are generally based on water reflectance in red and or nir bands and in situ data which are typically region based cao et al 2017 dogliotti et al 2015 feng et al 2014 a global single band turbidity model proposed by dogliotti et al 2015 performs well in low to high turbidity waters with a switching strategy of red and nir band models a linear weighting function ε from 0 to 1 is used to assure a smooth transition between red and nir models shen et al 2010 the water quality can be related to water reflectance ρ w dogliotti et al 2015 by 3 t u r b i d i t y 1 ε a t r e d ρ w r e d 1 ρ w r e d c r e d ε a t n i r ρ w n i r 1 ρ w n i r c n i r where a t and c are calibration coefficients and the superscripts denote wavelength the parameters a t and c ideally would be calibrated with inherent optical properties iops including particulate absorption non particulate absorption and backscattering coefficients dogliotti et al 2015 unfortunately the iops were not measured during the field data collection making it difficult to determine these model parameters fortunately a power relation between water reflectance and turbidity values is suggested in many waters robert et al 2016 thus an empirical power law turbidity model was adopted robert et al 2016 the model was modified as 4 t u r b i d i t y 1 ε k r e d ρ w r e d p r e d ε k n i r ρ w n i r p n i r where k and p are empirical coefficients that can be calibrated using match ups between the field turbidity measurements and water reflectance derived from satellite sensors the ε parameter changes linearly from 0 to 1 based on two thresholds t 1 and t 2 for ρ w n i r and is calculated as ε ρ w n i r t 1 t 2 t 1 field turbidity measurements were used to derive the model parameters based on regression analysis generally several quality control criteria should be applied to generate reliable matching pairs feng et al 2012 1 a 3 h time window between satellite images and field data should be used to assure concurrent observations because the field turbidity measurements are high frequency see table 1 this requirement was modified to select the closest temporal matching pairs 2 h 2 a 3 3 pixel box is needed to perform a homogeneity test to avoid potential influence of water patchiness and the variance in a 3 3 pixel box should be 10 3 5 statistics of turbidity during the preprocessing of landsat images only valid water pixels are kept based on the fmask zhu et al 2015 to calculate mean and std values of seasonal or annual water turbidity all the valid pixels during the counting period a season or a year are used in addition r2 and p value are two statistic parameters to evaluate the relationships between water turbidity and its potential drivers based on regression analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 turbidity model using these strictly controlled match ups a total of 10 valid landsat images were matched with field measurements containing data from sites 1 to 10 at lakes and rivers based on the match ups for water samples from both lakes and rivers an empirical turbidity model was given as 5 t u r b i d i t y 1 ε 21170 ρ w r e d 2 4880 ε 24354 ρ w n i r 2 5673 where ε ρ w n i r 0 028 0 005 to ensure ε changes between 0 and 1 we set ε 1 to 1 and ε 0 to 0 the turbidity model performed relatively well with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 72 a root mean square error rmse of 3 61 ntu and a mean absolute error mae of 0 06 ntu see fig 4 the turbidity values are equally distributed around the 1 1 line indicating that the model could obtain a satisfactory accuracy for water turbidity estimation in wuhan 4 2 long term variations in turbidity 4 2 1 consistency of landsat based turbidity merging data from three landsat instruments tm etm and oli can provide better temporal coverage but this approach requires consistent sensor specific products morel et al 2007 although discrepancies due to varied radiometric and spectral responses were corrected it is still necessary to examine the consistency of turbidity products to avoid unreliable analysis of turbidity variations the annual mean and std turbidity values in wuhan are shown in fig 5 the annual mean turbidity values of tm etm and oli have the same magnitude and range between 20 ntu and 55 ntu specifically from 2014 to 2019 the derived annual mean turbidity of etm and oli is very close with a mean bias of 7 6 and has similar variations and trends notably in 2013 there was no valid etm observation in wuhan after the careful visual selections the etm turbidity values agree well with those of tm between 2003 and 2011 with a mean bias of 3 9 however during 2000 2002 the mean bias between tm and etm turbidity is 30 this discrepancy can be attributed to the image acquisition time of tm observations which were mainly collected between july and october in 2000 2002 see fig 2 while etm data were almost evenly distributed in a year due to the seasonal effects the turbidity values are lowest during july and october which is discussed in section 4 2 2 indicating that merging multiple satellite instruments to obtain better temporal coverage is crucial for long term water turbidity monitoring based on landsat sensors after correction for radiometric and spectral discrepancies the turbidity derived from tm etm and oli can be considered consistent and used for long term analysis when at least one valid scene is acquired for each season during a year 4 2 2 intra annual variability for each climatological month fig 6 shows the monthly mean values of the derived turbidity maps in wuhan using the proposed model for the 33 years the turbidity shows strong seasonal variability the monthly average turbidity maps in wuhan for 1987 2019 indicate that the turbidity values are highest in the summer june to august and lower in the spring march to may and winter december to february and lowest in the autumn september to november the seasonal divisions are the same as those of shi et al shi et al 2015 the average turbidity is highest in june 37 33 10 83 ntu and lowest in october 18 89 10 65 ntu the highest average turbidity is approximately twice the lowest value indicating significant intra annual variability the spatial variations in turbidity maps during each climatological month are consistent the lake center turbidity is generally smaller than the nearshore turbidity additionally the turbidity of northern wuhan water bodies is higher than that of southern wuhan water bodies which might be because the southern water bodies are larger than those in the north and less affected by urban development the mean and std turbidity values of january to december are plotted in fig 7 a and b the spatial variations in the mean turbidity map agree well with the variations in monthly mean turbidity values see fig 6 showing that the central parts of a lake are generally clearer than the nearshore parts because most commercial activities take place at the center of wuhan the std turbidity map of three regions the north center and south is shown in fig 7 b from the std turbidity map it is clear that the std turbidity values of the northern part are larger than those of the middle and southern parts fig 7 b to better illustrate this the monthly mean and std turbidity values of each month are plotted in fig 7 c the turbidity mean value is the highest in northern wuhan and lowest in southern wuhan the variations in turbidity std value are the smallest in central wuhan the turbidity in southern wuhan is the lowest and relatively steady because of the large water bodies while the turbidity of small water bodies in northern wuhan varies the most in addition the turbidity is steady from january to june decreases from june to october and increases during the following months the variation trends in turbidity derived from landsat sensors over a year demonstrate clear seasonality 4 2 3 inter annual variability in addition to the significant seasonality the inter annual variability can better illustrate human impacts on water turbidity cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 the annual mean values of the landsat derived turbidity maps in wuhan are plotted in fig 8 illustrating inter annual variations in turbidity from 1987 to 2019 the lowest annual mean turbidity value is 21 84 2 64 ntu in 2017 and the highest is 45 89 2 08 ntu in 1992 the 33 year mean turbidity value is 30 70 2 95 ntu and the mean turbidity variation is 4 88 0 30 ntu the abnormal turbidity values in 1992 are approximately 1 5 times the 33 year mean turbidity value which is because the images in 1992 we acquired are mainly in spring and winter when the turbidity is relatively high illustrated by figs 2 and 5 the distributions of valid landsat observations in a year affect the annual mean turbidity due to its seasonality thus merging the tm etm and oli data are necessary and the annual mean turbidity values in 1989 1992 1993 and 1999 are less reliable since the valid observations are not available in four seasons in the other years the annual mean turbidity is more reasonable and thus can still illustrate the long term trend of water turbidity in wuhan the annual mean and std turbidity values of the selected five lakes are plotted in fig 9 a and b abnormal values in 1992 and 1999 from fig 8 are excluded these inter annual variations are clearly illustrated in the 33 year turbidity values in fig 9 a the mean turbidity values of the five lakes display the same variations which are relatively stable from 1987 to 2004 and decrease after 2005 although there is an increase between 2011 and 2013 the turbidity in northern wuhan wu lake is generally the highest among the five lakes while the smallest is in the south liangzi lake the urban waters dong and tangxun lakes show little difference from rural waters xiaozha lake because the three lakes are all in central wuhan see fig 7 b in addition the std turbidity values are relatively smaller during 1987 2004 than those after 2005 the std turbidity values of rural waters wu xiaozha and liangzi lakes are smaller than those of urban waters dong and tangxun lakes since 2005 the annual mean and std turbidity values indicate that the annual mean values of water turbidity are not affected by the location of water bodies while their variations are related to whether the water bodies are in the city center overall the inter annual variability in the mean water turbidity of different lakes in wuhan is relatively consistent 4 3 factors relating to the variations in turbidity the turbidity in wuhan shows significant annual and seasonal variations that could be explained by meteorological and or human indicators cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 by dividing wuhan into 10 sections by latitude we found that the mean turbidity value of the entire area of wuhan is consistent with those of each section see fig 10 a thus the variations in mean turbidity values can be used to represent waters throughout wuhan from 1987 to 2004 variations and fluctuations in turbidity remained relatively stable slope of y1 is small in fig 10 b and r2 is close to zero since 2005 however the turbidity has gradually and steadily decreased slope of y2 is minus one in fig 10 b and r2 is 0 7 generally the meteorological factors such as rainfall wind speed and temperature significantly affect turbidity values bryant 2009 cao et al 2017 shi et al 2015 but given that no distinct changes in annual mean meteorological factors have occurred see fig 10 c these cannot explain the steady decline in turbidity to better display the parameters they are normalized by dividing by the maximum to eliminate the units the normalized annual mean turbidity and meteorological factors including rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure as well as their determinant coefficients versus turbidity are shown in fig 10 c the r2 s are smaller than 0 2 indicating that there is no significant relationship between the annual mean meteorological factors and annual mean turbidity values as the annual mean meteorological factors in each year were relatively stable since the chinese open and reform policy in 1978 wuhan has experienced rapid urbanization shen et al 2016 to balance rapid urbanization and ecological sustainability an ecological framework was proposed in 1996 and decreed in 2005 and provided more emphasis on environmental values du et al 2010 since urban growth destroys the integrity of water bodies and connectivity of lakes the wuhan master plan in 2005 effectively protects and improves water quality which encouraged strategies for planning urban development to build and maintain an environmentally friendly society for instance several disconnected water bodies were interconnected by artificial ditches after 2005 lv et al 2011 the annual mean ndvi values display a clear increasing trend after 2005 with a p value 0 01 and an r2 of 0 66 see fig 11 a y2 while a stable trend between 1987 and 2004 see fig 11 a y1 there is no significant correlation between annual mean turbidity and ndvi before 2005 see fig 11 b y5 r2 0 17 however the annual mean ndvi values are highly related to annual mean turbidity values since 2005 with a p value 0 01 and an r2 of 0 68 see fig 11 b y6 the annual mean isa increases at 30 km2 yr between 1987 and 2004 see fig 11 a y3 r 2 0 99 but at a higher rate of 135 km2 yr after 2005 see fig 11 a y4 r 2 0 95 no significant correlation is discovered between annual mean turbidity and isa before 2005 see fig 11 c y7 r 2 0 06 while the isa values are highly related to annual mean turbidity values since 2005 with a p value 0 01 and an r2 of 0 57 see fig 11 c y8 both annual mean ndvi and isa are strongly correlated to the annual mean turbidity since 2005 after the wuhan master plan in 2005 had been in effect for nearly ten years the ndvi values in 2015 returned to the previous level see fig 11 a meanwhile the turbidity values also decreased to the previous level in 2015 see fig 9 a the environmentally friendly wuhan master plan in 2005 e g artificial afforestation is promoted and green space is constructed and protected has greatly improved the environment in wuhan at least in terms of ndvi which might be at least parts of the reason why the annual mean turbidity values in wuhan have steadily decreased since 2005 although there is a more rapid increase of isa after 2005 fig 11 c the annual mean turbidity decreases suggesting that the rapid urbanization has no dramatic negative influence on water turbidity the wuhan master plan in 2005 accelerated the city s developments and restored the environmental conditions in the meantime these results suggest that is possible to maintain a balance between urbanization and sustainability with wisely formulated regulations like the wuhan master plan in 2005 aside from the long term trends the turbidity also shows seasonality cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 the meteorological factors display no obvious impacts on annual mean turbidity values which might induce the seasonal variations of turbidity the monthly mean normalized turbidity values and meteorological factors between 1987 and 2019 are shown in fig 12 c the r2 values for monthly mean turbidity and its standard deviation versus rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure are plotted in fig 12 a and b respectively the changes in monthly mean turbidity are not highly related to the four factors r2 0 2 in fig 12 a while the changes in monthly std turbidity are tightly related to the rainfall temperature and vapor pressure r2 0 7 in fig 12 b indicating that these three factors might affect the variations in monthly mean turbidity the rainfall temperature and vapor pressure increase from january to july and decreased in the next five months and the monthly mean std turbidity also displayed a similar trend because the temperature and vapor pressure during 1987 and 2019 are highly related using an exponential function with an r2 0 98 the two factors can be considered as one and only the temperature is analyzed hereafter both rainfall and temperature are closely related to monthly mean turbidity variations although it remains a question of which one is the main factor because wuhan has a humid subtropical monsoon climate the rainfall and temperature display similar trends in a year however rainfall and temperature in the same season but different years might change differently thus mean turbidity values rainfall and temperature in four seasons within a five year interval are shown in fig 13 the rainfall of four seasons shows different trends see fig 13 b while the temperature of four seasons demonstrates similar change patterns from 1991 to 2016 the rainfall in spring and autumn agrees well with mean turbidity values r2 0 70 however in four seasons the temperature has no clear relationship with turbidity r2 0 25 indicating that it is rainfall rather than temperature that influences the monthly turbidity variations because of wuhan s climatic condition the rainfall shows a significant increase from winter to summer and a decreasing trend in summer to winter in summer due to the influence of the rainy season there is concentrated rainfall which makes it difficult to capture the impacts on water turbidity using the 16 day landsat sensors because of the cloud coverage in winter rainfall is the least during a year these might explain why rainfall has no obvious impacts on turbidity variations in summer and winter 5 summary and conclusion the long term availability of relatively high spatial resolution landsat series images since the 1980s provides a unique resource to enhance our understanding of the turbidity variations in small inland water bodies under city urbanization and climate change conditions however using multi sensor observations to retrieve quantitative turbidity maps requires consistency in turbidity products lobo et al 2015 after radiometric normalization and spectral correction of atmospherically corrected reflectance an empirical turbidity model was developed to estimate the turbidity in wuhan with a red nir band switching strategy from analyzing the long term landsat derived turbidity maps during the rapid urbanization of wuhan several conclusions can be made first after radiometric and spectral adjustment of atmospherically corrected reflectance of landsat tm etm and oli the turbidity retrievals derived from multiple sensors agree well with each other the consistent turbidity products can be used to analyze intra and inter annual variations in turbidity for 1987 2019 examined with the meteorological ndvi and isa data we found that 1 the annual mean turbidity values are more likely to be affected by the ecologically friendly wuhan master plan in 2005 characterized by ndvi and isa there is a stable increase in ndvi and isa and decline in water turbidity after 2005 and 2 rainfall may influence the seasonal turbidity variations in spring and autumn while it has less influence in summer and winter indicating the impacts of meteorological factors on water turbidity vary seasonally second the acquisition time of valid satellite observations affects the annual mean turbidity values because of the seasonality of turbidity variations it is necessary to include multiple satellite observations to obtain higher frequency time series to monitor dynamic inland waters arabi et al 2020 güttler et al 2013 morel et al 2007 the seasonality in turbidity may affect the analysis of long term inter annual variability since seasonal meteorological factors such as wind and precipitation du et al 2020 have impacts on water turbidity the distribution of landsat data in a year inevitably affects the annual mean value of water turbidity many studies have successfully applied landsat time series to study events that might have a strong seasonal component such as vegetation change zhang et al 2017 semi arid wetland surface water dynamics halabisky et al 2016 and water salinity ferdous and rahman 2020 by merging data from three landsat instruments tm etm and oli to obtain better temporal coverage almost every season in every year especially after 2000 has at least one observation the impacts of seasonality are reduced and the long term trends can be considered reasonable however even if the tm etm and oli images are merged to derive water turbidity in wuhan there are still no valid scenes in some seasons in several years if the observations are available in each season during a year the annual mean turbidity is more reliable the landsat data might be adequate for monitoring water quality at an annual scale wang et al 2018 however to monitor the turbidity at a higher frequency landsat data might be insufficient third both climatic conditions and human activities can induce variations in water turbidity cao et al 2017 meteorological parameters such as rainfall wind and temperature are relatively stable over different years thus climate induced turbidity variations are relatively regular and predictable however human activities can change the turbidity in a much shorter time and have long term impacts the wuhan master plan in 2005 accelerated urbanization with isa increasing more quickly after 2005 and led to the improvement of environmental conditions with steadily increased ndvi the urbanization process after 2005 did not induce an increase in water turbidity indicating that with consideration for environmental systems it is possible to maintain a balance between urban construction and ecological sustainability after approximately 10 years of the wuhan master plan the turbidity and ndvi returned to previous levels suggesting that it takes time to restore the natural conditions and a cautious approach is needed to reconcile human activities and environmental impacts to our knowledge this is the first time that long term turbidity variations have been documented and analyzed in wuhan concerning the city s urbanization the results provide necessary information to evaluate the impacts of the city master plan on water quality for governmental decision making and environmental protection planning in general the multi sensor based approach demonstrates significant potential for monitoring and understanding the water environment in an urbanizing metropolis and could be easily applied in other

4957,understanding of turbidity an indicator of water quality is of great importance in cities and can have significant implications for human society many users are interested in mapping turbidity using remote sensing tools for long term and large scale monitoring this study aims to derive turbidity maps in an urbanizing city and to identify the driving factors for better decision making and water quality management taking wuhan the most rapidly urbanizing metropolis in central china as an instance the water turbidity is monitored using landsat observations from 1987 to 2019 and the relationships of turbidity and climatic human factors are examined climatic factors are represented by meteorological conditions rainfall wind speed temperature and water vapor pressure and human factors are characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and impervious surface area isa the results demonstrated that 1 the seasonal mean turbidity increased from spring to summer 34 28 ntu to 36 27 ntu decreased in autumn 25 04 ntu and increased again in winter 37 20 ntu and the variations were related to changes in rainfall and 2 the annual mean turbidity was fluctuatingly stable during 1987 2004 and decreased by 1 ntu yr since 2005 the decline of water turbidity was highly correlated to the increase of ndvi and isa with p values 0 01 the study indicates that meteorological conditions affect seasonal variations in turbidity while human factors have long term impacts a cautious approach to human activities during urbanization is needed to achieve a balance between water quality protection and the city s developments keywords water turbidity landsat observations long term urbanization remote sensing 1 introduction city waters are very important for their close connection to human society and highly valuable for human health and social activities mouw et al 2015 their water quality is affected by human activities directly and or indirectly cao et al 2017 which are directly affected by dredging activities wu et al 2007 or indirectly influenced by human induced land use changes fraterrigo and downing 2008 also acting as a sentinel of climate change water quality is significantly influenced by natural factors such as temperature bryant 2009 wind speed shi et al 2015 and rainfall onyutha et al 2016 the degradation of water quality may affect its environmental functions and trigger severe social problems accurate monitoring and understanding of city water quality are vital for scientists engineers and policy makers for efficient decision making and appropriate engineering interventions jayson quashigah et al 2019 satellite remote sensing has been increasingly applied for the monitoring of inland water quality at large scales and long periods li et al 2017 toming et al 2016 for water quality monitoring turbidity is usually an essential parameter to be retrieved nechad et al 2010 thus it is crucial to map city water turbidity as accurately as possible using satellite remote sensing dogliotti et al 2015 urbanization results in population agglomeration and land use changes which cause the decline of ecosystem values manes et al 2016 the city s urbanization may have negative effects on aquatic ecosystems especially for water rich cities du et al 2010 people s concern about water quality is rising around the world dietrich et al 2014 and requires the protection of the environment the political management of urban growth has been implemented since the 19th century to improve the environmental conditions in the city peterson 2018 it is therefore important to monitor the turbidity in a developing city for government decision making for better aquatic ecosystems wuhan is the most quickly developing metropolis in central china and has experienced rapid urbanization during the last four decades since the open and reform policy in 1978 shen et al 2016 due to its importance as a location of modern industrialization in china wuhan shares a series of national preferential development policies du et al 2010 stimulated by national and local investments wuhan is undergoing unprecedented urbanization with a population of over 10 million and a land area over 8500 km2 luo et al 2018 the impervious surface area isa increased at approximately 30 km2 yr from 1987 to 2004 and 135 km2 yr since 2005 and was up to 2400 km2 in 2019 shao et al 2019 besides wuhan has two of the largest city lakes in china and a nickname of water city with more than 100 lakes which indicates that wuhan is rich in water resources due to rapid socio economic development water pollution in wuhan has become serious allmann et al 2013 wei et al 2019 rapid urbanization has also caused a huge reduction in lake areas and has become a key issue impacting residents wu et al 2020 since 2000 the wuhan government has enacted lake protection regulations to maintain the quality and functions of lakes du et al 2010 in the wuhan master plan of 2005 ecology aspects are considered for long term city development thus it is of interest and importance to monitor the water turbidity in wuhan during its rapid development and to provide guidance to maintain the balance between the city s development and environmental protection du et al 2010 however to the best of our knowledge water turbidity in wuhan is rarely studied not to mention the long term and large scale monitoring of this key water quality parameter many previous studies have suggested that turbidity variations are both climate and human induced cao et al 2017 to better manage and protect water ecosystems for their ecological and economic values it is necessary to distinguish the impacts of climatic conditions and human activities on water turbidity previous researches suggest that wind temperature and rainfall are the main factors that affect the temporal and spatial variations in suspended particulate matter bryant 2009 cao et al 2018 feng et al 2014 onyutha et al 2016 shi et al 2015 which is highly related to water turbidity dogliotti et al 2015 meteorological parameters related to these factors are very likely to affect the variations of water turbidity in addition human activities lead to land use land cover change which also affects the variations in water turbidity fraterrigo and downing 2008 singh et al 2020 key influencing factors of turbidity including meteorological conditions and human activities should be identified to better understand and manage the aquatic environments cao et al 2017 the turbidity of city waters is typically inhomogeneous spatially and temporally making it extremely difficult to monitor using traditional field sampling methods zhou et al 2018 satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient and commonly used methods to monitor water turbidity at large spatial scales and long temporal periods through frequent and synoptic observations dogliotti et al 2015 generally water turbidity is monitored using dedicated wide swath ocean color satellite sensors e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis cao et al 2017 however these sensors are typically too coarse for monitoring small inland waters in wuhan fortunately imagery from higher resolution sensors such as landsat has been successfully used to monitor inland water quality vanhellemont and ruddick 2014 landsat sensors have already observed the earth for over five decades and their products are well maintained and consistent wulder et al 2019 therefore images from landsat sensors 30 m 16 days including the thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli provide great opportunities to derive the water turbidity in wuhan various turbidity models are geographically or regionally specific and require specific adaptation or calibration for varied regions and sensors dogliotti et al 2015 most proposed algorithms are derived from the regression analysis of turbidity against reflectance from different satellite wavelength bands zhou et al 2020 a good correlation can be easily found between turbidity and reflectance at red and or near infrared nir bands dogliotti et al 2015 semi analytical approaches have also been developed to retrieve turbidity nechad et al 2010 both semi analytical and empirical models can be used to derive water turbidity gohin et al 2005 and have been implemented by many optical sensors over multiple regions nechad et al 2009 thus a turbidity model suitable for wuhan waters can be built this study has two main objectives 1 to quantify the seasonal and annual variability and long term trends of water turbidity in wuhan between 1987 and 2019 using landsat images this analysis will provide valuable information for water quality in wuhan and give guidance to the government in decision making and 2 to determine the impacts of climatic and human factors on variations in turbidity which can deepen our understanding of water turbidity in a rapidly developing city 2 study area located in central china wuhan 30 35 n and 114 17 e fig 1 landsat tile path 123 and row 39 is rapidly growing and rich in water resources there are over 2 200 km2 of inland waters accounting for approximately 25 of the total area huang and wang 2019 wuhan has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with annual average precipitation of 1140 1265 mm du et al 2010 and a temperature of 288 95 290 65 k shen et al 2016 additionally wuhan suffers from extremely hot and humid summers peel et al 2007 the seasonality of climate results in uneven precipitation throughout the year in wuhan approximately 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season from april to october du et al 2010 which might further affect water turbidity five lakes in different districts in wuhan are selected to present the typical waters in rural and urban areas for studying turbidity variations in wuhan specifically the wu xiaozha and liangzi lakes are in rural areas from northern to southern wuhan while the dong and tangxun lakes are in the city center fig 1 b wuhan is undergoing unprecedented rapid urbanization over the past few decades the city central area increased by 16 34 from 2009 to 2014 and will reach 1030 km2 by 2020 luo et al 2018 wuhan has witnessed significant land use changes during urban expansion since the 1990s and its water bodies have been significantly affected during this period du et al 2010 the wuhan master plan of 1996 established the ecologically friendly framework for the city s developments however due to the lack of systematic consideration public awareness and political will the practice was not implemented until the 2005 wuhan master plan du et al 2010 the policies affect human activities during the urbanization process which might influence the environmental conditions for example several aspects are emphasized resources and bureau 2010 1 afforestation and forest reservation are promoted to establish an ecological network by greening the wetland forest and farmland regions 2 any land use activities harmful to ecosystems are strictly prohibited to gradually restore ecological functions 3 environmental protection projects such as energy saving and emission reducing projects and the construction of sewage treatment plants are supported to build an environmental friendly society 4 projects for soil pollution treatment and restoration focusing on heavy metal and pesticide contamination are proposed to improve soil quality 5 agricultural pollutions are prevented by regulating the number of livestock and poultry farms near reservoirs lakes and rivers for the protection of drinking water resources 6 soil erosion treatment is strengthened and policies for soil and water conservation are enforced to reduce human induced destruction of land covers 3 datasets and methods the primary data used in this study consist of in situ turbidity measurements cloud free landsat tm etm oli images and meteorological data turbidity was derived from satellite images with an empirical model calibrated against in situ turbidity measurements the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and isa derived from the landsat images were used as indicators of the city s land use change in environmental and urbanizing aspects respectively chen and cihlar 1996 liu et al 2018 shao et al 2019 meteorological data including rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure were used to analyze the influencing climatic factors of the turbidity variations these datasets and methods are described in the following sections in detail 3 1 in situ turbidity measurements six field stations at lakes and four at rivers in wuhan fig 1 and table 1 provided the in situ turbidity dataset for this study which was measured using an lfwcs 2008 water quality analyzer lihero technology limited company hunan china based on the light scattering method matsuzaki et al 2000 the sites at both lakes and rivers could represent the general water characteristics in wuhan however the river waters originate from multiple sources and might be affected by upstream flows thus the field measurements at rivers are only used to build the turbidity model and the rivers are excluded in the analysis of turbidity variations in wuhan field turbidity measurements were obtained once per hour or once every four hours during three periods june 07 2018 september 27 2019 october 07 23 2019 and january 17 february 09 2020 table 1 generally values of turbidity are in the range of 1 100 ntu but they can be much higher and surpass 1000 ntu in some cases the turbidity values in rivers sites 7 10 are normally larger than those in lakes except site 6 indicating that lake waters are usually clearer than river waters in wuhan site 6 is near the liangzi ecotourism resort whose management has planned to protect lake waters during the measurement periods which might explain why turbidity at site 6 is higher than that of other sites at lakes and even at some river sites 3 2 satellite images and preprocessing 3 2 1 the tm etm and oli images the continuity of landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli is supported by the 1992 us land remote sensing act wulder et al 2019 the tm archive obtained by landsat 5 spans the period from 1984 to 2013 landsat 7 was launched in april 1999 and has been providing data until now and carries the etm since june 2003 due to the scan line corrector slc failure the etm has captured data containing a gap accounting for approximately 22 of the data arvidson et al 2006 the oli onboard landsat 8 added to the previous spectral bands and has provided observations since 2013 wulder et al 2019 the high quality of landsat data has sparked numerous time series analyses for monitoring of water quality kuhn et al 2019 ren et al 2018 zheng et al 2016 the tm etm and oli data with a high spatial resolution of 30 m and a long period allow for the monitoring of water turbidity in wuhan over multi annual periods the surface reflectance sr products covering the study area were downloaded from the google earth engine gee https earthengine google com platform gorelick et al 2017 after filtering the images with cloud coverage 40 during 1987 2019 145 tm scenes 102 etm scenes and 42 oli scenes were visually selected to avoid the influence of clouds aerosols and sun glint shi et al 2015 in addition the fmask algorithm was applied to determine clear water pixels and to avoid clouds and cloud shadows zhu et al 2015 the temporal distribution of the valid images is plotted in fig 2 the landsat sr products are atmospherically corrected based on the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum 6sv model vermote et al 1997 specifically landsat 5 tm and landsat 7 etm sr products are processed by the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps masek et al 2006 while landsat 8 oli sr products are generated by the landsat surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 the oli onboard landsat 8 has improved capabilities a higher signal to noise ratio snr and an additional band for water monitoring relative to the previous landsat sensors and has been shown adequately for studying aquatic systems wulder et al 2019 the full landsat heritage has been also widely used to monitor turbidity and is reliable especially if based on a single band feng et al 2013 kuhn et al 2019 wei et al 2018 wulder et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that the sr products can be successfully used to retrieve water quality parameters over complex inland waters gomes et al 2020 griffin et al 2018 kuhn et al 2019 thus the sr products downloaded by gee can be safely used to derive water turbidity in wuhan 3 2 2 image preprocessing the landsat sr products downloaded from the gee were atmospherically corrected based on the 6sv model which could not correct tm etm and oli images perfectly because atmospheric parameters e g water vapor and visibility should be optimized lobo et al 2015 therefore the radiometric discrepancy of these atmospherically corrected data should be corrected which is normally achieved using very steady spectra as reference lobo et al 2015 the steadiest area a large white building 10 pixels 10 pixels in wuhan corresponding to the lowest coefficient of variation cv of all oli images from 2013 to 2019 was selected as the invariant spectra in this study specifically we calculated the mean and standard deviation std values of oli surface reflectance of each pixel and then determined the pixels with the smallest cv cv std mean 100 during 2013 2019 after selecting the invariant area the average atmospherically corrected reflectance of each tm etm and oli image in this region was calculated fig 3 shows the mean surface reflectance of the stable area from tm etm and oli data which displays the stability of the selected site based on the atmospherically corrected reflectance from the invariant area a radiometric band adjustment factor rbaf to minimize the radiometric discrepancy is defined as 1 r b a f m e a n ρ a c r e f m e a n ρ a c t a r where ρ a c r e f and ρ a c t a r represent atmospherically corrected reflectance of reference and target sensors respectively chronologically the period of etm images can be combined with the periods of tm and oli data to form a complete time series thus etm was used as a reference sensor and the other two sensors were considered as target sensors only the rbafs of tm and oli at red and nir bands are calculated and listed in table 2 because the turbidity model in this paper is based on red and nir bands more details can be found in section 3 4 due to different band settings each sensor responds to the water reflectance signal in a unique way therefore another difference between tm etm and oli sensors is associated with the discrepancy in the relative spectral response rsr function different rsrs affect how the earth s surface is seen by the sensors and thus result in varied observations while imaging the same target chander et al 2013 the discrepancy in rsrs can be reduced using a spectral band adjustment factor sbaf for water bodies the sbaf is defined as chander et al 2013 2 s b a f ρ w r s r r e f d λ r s r r e f d λ ρ w r s r t a r d λ r s r t a r d λ where ρ w is the field measured water reflectance λ means wavelength and r s r r e f and r s r t a r denote rsrs of reference and target sensors respectively based on the in situ water reflectance measurements 9 samples during a field trip in wuhan in 2011 which was measured using an svc field portable spectroradiometer spectra vista corp inc new york ny usa 350 to 900 nm at 1 6 nm increments following nasa s ocean color measurement protocol and under clear sky conditions between 10 a m and 2p m local time li et al 2019 the sbafs of tm and oli were calculated and listed in table 2 in addition the gaps of slc off etm images were filled using the single file gap fill triangulation method embedded in the environment for visualizing images envi plugin the rbafs were then applied to tm and oli data to convert them into etm like reflectance and eliminate radiometric differences and sbafs were used to reduce spectral discrepancies 3 3 ancillary datasets the urbanization induced land use change associated with greenspace was characterized by the ndvi ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ r e d chen and cihlar 1996 after the waters were excluded using the normalized difference built up index ndbi ρ m i r ρ n i r ρ m i r ρ n i r zha et al 2003 and modified normalized difference water index mndwi ρ g r e e n ρ m i r ρ g r e e n ρ m i r xu 2006 the annual mean ndvi of wuhan was calculated note that the negative values of ndbi and mndwi indicate water pixels roy et al 2020 only ndvi in the city core with a buffer of 25 km was obtained to exclude areas far from the city s urbanization the urbanization induced land use change associated with built up areas was represented by isa which is obtained from shao et al 2019 the isa covering wuhan was derived from the landsat data using gee and the random forest algorithm breiman 2001 more details about the isa used in this study can be found in shao et al 2019 the monthly mean meteorological data including rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure from 1987 to 2019 were acquired from the meteorological station in wuhan see fig 1 which were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn 3 4 turbidity algorithm turbidity products from ocean color sensors e g modis are generally based on water reflectance in red and or nir bands and in situ data which are typically region based cao et al 2017 dogliotti et al 2015 feng et al 2014 a global single band turbidity model proposed by dogliotti et al 2015 performs well in low to high turbidity waters with a switching strategy of red and nir band models a linear weighting function ε from 0 to 1 is used to assure a smooth transition between red and nir models shen et al 2010 the water quality can be related to water reflectance ρ w dogliotti et al 2015 by 3 t u r b i d i t y 1 ε a t r e d ρ w r e d 1 ρ w r e d c r e d ε a t n i r ρ w n i r 1 ρ w n i r c n i r where a t and c are calibration coefficients and the superscripts denote wavelength the parameters a t and c ideally would be calibrated with inherent optical properties iops including particulate absorption non particulate absorption and backscattering coefficients dogliotti et al 2015 unfortunately the iops were not measured during the field data collection making it difficult to determine these model parameters fortunately a power relation between water reflectance and turbidity values is suggested in many waters robert et al 2016 thus an empirical power law turbidity model was adopted robert et al 2016 the model was modified as 4 t u r b i d i t y 1 ε k r e d ρ w r e d p r e d ε k n i r ρ w n i r p n i r where k and p are empirical coefficients that can be calibrated using match ups between the field turbidity measurements and water reflectance derived from satellite sensors the ε parameter changes linearly from 0 to 1 based on two thresholds t 1 and t 2 for ρ w n i r and is calculated as ε ρ w n i r t 1 t 2 t 1 field turbidity measurements were used to derive the model parameters based on regression analysis generally several quality control criteria should be applied to generate reliable matching pairs feng et al 2012 1 a 3 h time window between satellite images and field data should be used to assure concurrent observations because the field turbidity measurements are high frequency see table 1 this requirement was modified to select the closest temporal matching pairs 2 h 2 a 3 3 pixel box is needed to perform a homogeneity test to avoid potential influence of water patchiness and the variance in a 3 3 pixel box should be 10 3 5 statistics of turbidity during the preprocessing of landsat images only valid water pixels are kept based on the fmask zhu et al 2015 to calculate mean and std values of seasonal or annual water turbidity all the valid pixels during the counting period a season or a year are used in addition r2 and p value are two statistic parameters to evaluate the relationships between water turbidity and its potential drivers based on regression analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 turbidity model using these strictly controlled match ups a total of 10 valid landsat images were matched with field measurements containing data from sites 1 to 10 at lakes and rivers based on the match ups for water samples from both lakes and rivers an empirical turbidity model was given as 5 t u r b i d i t y 1 ε 21170 ρ w r e d 2 4880 ε 24354 ρ w n i r 2 5673 where ε ρ w n i r 0 028 0 005 to ensure ε changes between 0 and 1 we set ε 1 to 1 and ε 0 to 0 the turbidity model performed relatively well with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 72 a root mean square error rmse of 3 61 ntu and a mean absolute error mae of 0 06 ntu see fig 4 the turbidity values are equally distributed around the 1 1 line indicating that the model could obtain a satisfactory accuracy for water turbidity estimation in wuhan 4 2 long term variations in turbidity 4 2 1 consistency of landsat based turbidity merging data from three landsat instruments tm etm and oli can provide better temporal coverage but this approach requires consistent sensor specific products morel et al 2007 although discrepancies due to varied radiometric and spectral responses were corrected it is still necessary to examine the consistency of turbidity products to avoid unreliable analysis of turbidity variations the annual mean and std turbidity values in wuhan are shown in fig 5 the annual mean turbidity values of tm etm and oli have the same magnitude and range between 20 ntu and 55 ntu specifically from 2014 to 2019 the derived annual mean turbidity of etm and oli is very close with a mean bias of 7 6 and has similar variations and trends notably in 2013 there was no valid etm observation in wuhan after the careful visual selections the etm turbidity values agree well with those of tm between 2003 and 2011 with a mean bias of 3 9 however during 2000 2002 the mean bias between tm and etm turbidity is 30 this discrepancy can be attributed to the image acquisition time of tm observations which were mainly collected between july and october in 2000 2002 see fig 2 while etm data were almost evenly distributed in a year due to the seasonal effects the turbidity values are lowest during july and october which is discussed in section 4 2 2 indicating that merging multiple satellite instruments to obtain better temporal coverage is crucial for long term water turbidity monitoring based on landsat sensors after correction for radiometric and spectral discrepancies the turbidity derived from tm etm and oli can be considered consistent and used for long term analysis when at least one valid scene is acquired for each season during a year 4 2 2 intra annual variability for each climatological month fig 6 shows the monthly mean values of the derived turbidity maps in wuhan using the proposed model for the 33 years the turbidity shows strong seasonal variability the monthly average turbidity maps in wuhan for 1987 2019 indicate that the turbidity values are highest in the summer june to august and lower in the spring march to may and winter december to february and lowest in the autumn september to november the seasonal divisions are the same as those of shi et al shi et al 2015 the average turbidity is highest in june 37 33 10 83 ntu and lowest in october 18 89 10 65 ntu the highest average turbidity is approximately twice the lowest value indicating significant intra annual variability the spatial variations in turbidity maps during each climatological month are consistent the lake center turbidity is generally smaller than the nearshore turbidity additionally the turbidity of northern wuhan water bodies is higher than that of southern wuhan water bodies which might be because the southern water bodies are larger than those in the north and less affected by urban development the mean and std turbidity values of january to december are plotted in fig 7 a and b the spatial variations in the mean turbidity map agree well with the variations in monthly mean turbidity values see fig 6 showing that the central parts of a lake are generally clearer than the nearshore parts because most commercial activities take place at the center of wuhan the std turbidity map of three regions the north center and south is shown in fig 7 b from the std turbidity map it is clear that the std turbidity values of the northern part are larger than those of the middle and southern parts fig 7 b to better illustrate this the monthly mean and std turbidity values of each month are plotted in fig 7 c the turbidity mean value is the highest in northern wuhan and lowest in southern wuhan the variations in turbidity std value are the smallest in central wuhan the turbidity in southern wuhan is the lowest and relatively steady because of the large water bodies while the turbidity of small water bodies in northern wuhan varies the most in addition the turbidity is steady from january to june decreases from june to october and increases during the following months the variation trends in turbidity derived from landsat sensors over a year demonstrate clear seasonality 4 2 3 inter annual variability in addition to the significant seasonality the inter annual variability can better illustrate human impacts on water turbidity cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 the annual mean values of the landsat derived turbidity maps in wuhan are plotted in fig 8 illustrating inter annual variations in turbidity from 1987 to 2019 the lowest annual mean turbidity value is 21 84 2 64 ntu in 2017 and the highest is 45 89 2 08 ntu in 1992 the 33 year mean turbidity value is 30 70 2 95 ntu and the mean turbidity variation is 4 88 0 30 ntu the abnormal turbidity values in 1992 are approximately 1 5 times the 33 year mean turbidity value which is because the images in 1992 we acquired are mainly in spring and winter when the turbidity is relatively high illustrated by figs 2 and 5 the distributions of valid landsat observations in a year affect the annual mean turbidity due to its seasonality thus merging the tm etm and oli data are necessary and the annual mean turbidity values in 1989 1992 1993 and 1999 are less reliable since the valid observations are not available in four seasons in the other years the annual mean turbidity is more reasonable and thus can still illustrate the long term trend of water turbidity in wuhan the annual mean and std turbidity values of the selected five lakes are plotted in fig 9 a and b abnormal values in 1992 and 1999 from fig 8 are excluded these inter annual variations are clearly illustrated in the 33 year turbidity values in fig 9 a the mean turbidity values of the five lakes display the same variations which are relatively stable from 1987 to 2004 and decrease after 2005 although there is an increase between 2011 and 2013 the turbidity in northern wuhan wu lake is generally the highest among the five lakes while the smallest is in the south liangzi lake the urban waters dong and tangxun lakes show little difference from rural waters xiaozha lake because the three lakes are all in central wuhan see fig 7 b in addition the std turbidity values are relatively smaller during 1987 2004 than those after 2005 the std turbidity values of rural waters wu xiaozha and liangzi lakes are smaller than those of urban waters dong and tangxun lakes since 2005 the annual mean and std turbidity values indicate that the annual mean values of water turbidity are not affected by the location of water bodies while their variations are related to whether the water bodies are in the city center overall the inter annual variability in the mean water turbidity of different lakes in wuhan is relatively consistent 4 3 factors relating to the variations in turbidity the turbidity in wuhan shows significant annual and seasonal variations that could be explained by meteorological and or human indicators cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 by dividing wuhan into 10 sections by latitude we found that the mean turbidity value of the entire area of wuhan is consistent with those of each section see fig 10 a thus the variations in mean turbidity values can be used to represent waters throughout wuhan from 1987 to 2004 variations and fluctuations in turbidity remained relatively stable slope of y1 is small in fig 10 b and r2 is close to zero since 2005 however the turbidity has gradually and steadily decreased slope of y2 is minus one in fig 10 b and r2 is 0 7 generally the meteorological factors such as rainfall wind speed and temperature significantly affect turbidity values bryant 2009 cao et al 2017 shi et al 2015 but given that no distinct changes in annual mean meteorological factors have occurred see fig 10 c these cannot explain the steady decline in turbidity to better display the parameters they are normalized by dividing by the maximum to eliminate the units the normalized annual mean turbidity and meteorological factors including rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure as well as their determinant coefficients versus turbidity are shown in fig 10 c the r2 s are smaller than 0 2 indicating that there is no significant relationship between the annual mean meteorological factors and annual mean turbidity values as the annual mean meteorological factors in each year were relatively stable since the chinese open and reform policy in 1978 wuhan has experienced rapid urbanization shen et al 2016 to balance rapid urbanization and ecological sustainability an ecological framework was proposed in 1996 and decreed in 2005 and provided more emphasis on environmental values du et al 2010 since urban growth destroys the integrity of water bodies and connectivity of lakes the wuhan master plan in 2005 effectively protects and improves water quality which encouraged strategies for planning urban development to build and maintain an environmentally friendly society for instance several disconnected water bodies were interconnected by artificial ditches after 2005 lv et al 2011 the annual mean ndvi values display a clear increasing trend after 2005 with a p value 0 01 and an r2 of 0 66 see fig 11 a y2 while a stable trend between 1987 and 2004 see fig 11 a y1 there is no significant correlation between annual mean turbidity and ndvi before 2005 see fig 11 b y5 r2 0 17 however the annual mean ndvi values are highly related to annual mean turbidity values since 2005 with a p value 0 01 and an r2 of 0 68 see fig 11 b y6 the annual mean isa increases at 30 km2 yr between 1987 and 2004 see fig 11 a y3 r 2 0 99 but at a higher rate of 135 km2 yr after 2005 see fig 11 a y4 r 2 0 95 no significant correlation is discovered between annual mean turbidity and isa before 2005 see fig 11 c y7 r 2 0 06 while the isa values are highly related to annual mean turbidity values since 2005 with a p value 0 01 and an r2 of 0 57 see fig 11 c y8 both annual mean ndvi and isa are strongly correlated to the annual mean turbidity since 2005 after the wuhan master plan in 2005 had been in effect for nearly ten years the ndvi values in 2015 returned to the previous level see fig 11 a meanwhile the turbidity values also decreased to the previous level in 2015 see fig 9 a the environmentally friendly wuhan master plan in 2005 e g artificial afforestation is promoted and green space is constructed and protected has greatly improved the environment in wuhan at least in terms of ndvi which might be at least parts of the reason why the annual mean turbidity values in wuhan have steadily decreased since 2005 although there is a more rapid increase of isa after 2005 fig 11 c the annual mean turbidity decreases suggesting that the rapid urbanization has no dramatic negative influence on water turbidity the wuhan master plan in 2005 accelerated the city s developments and restored the environmental conditions in the meantime these results suggest that is possible to maintain a balance between urbanization and sustainability with wisely formulated regulations like the wuhan master plan in 2005 aside from the long term trends the turbidity also shows seasonality cao et al 2017 feng et al 2012 the meteorological factors display no obvious impacts on annual mean turbidity values which might induce the seasonal variations of turbidity the monthly mean normalized turbidity values and meteorological factors between 1987 and 2019 are shown in fig 12 c the r2 values for monthly mean turbidity and its standard deviation versus rainfall wind speed temperature and vapor pressure are plotted in fig 12 a and b respectively the changes in monthly mean turbidity are not highly related to the four factors r2 0 2 in fig 12 a while the changes in monthly std turbidity are tightly related to the rainfall temperature and vapor pressure r2 0 7 in fig 12 b indicating that these three factors might affect the variations in monthly mean turbidity the rainfall temperature and vapor pressure increase from january to july and decreased in the next five months and the monthly mean std turbidity also displayed a similar trend because the temperature and vapor pressure during 1987 and 2019 are highly related using an exponential function with an r2 0 98 the two factors can be considered as one and only the temperature is analyzed hereafter both rainfall and temperature are closely related to monthly mean turbidity variations although it remains a question of which one is the main factor because wuhan has a humid subtropical monsoon climate the rainfall and temperature display similar trends in a year however rainfall and temperature in the same season but different years might change differently thus mean turbidity values rainfall and temperature in four seasons within a five year interval are shown in fig 13 the rainfall of four seasons shows different trends see fig 13 b while the temperature of four seasons demonstrates similar change patterns from 1991 to 2016 the rainfall in spring and autumn agrees well with mean turbidity values r2 0 70 however in four seasons the temperature has no clear relationship with turbidity r2 0 25 indicating that it is rainfall rather than temperature that influences the monthly turbidity variations because of wuhan s climatic condition the rainfall shows a significant increase from winter to summer and a decreasing trend in summer to winter in summer due to the influence of the rainy season there is concentrated rainfall which makes it difficult to capture the impacts on water turbidity using the 16 day landsat sensors because of the cloud coverage in winter rainfall is the least during a year these might explain why rainfall has no obvious impacts on turbidity variations in summer and winter 5 summary and conclusion the long term availability of relatively high spatial resolution landsat series images since the 1980s provides a unique resource to enhance our understanding of the turbidity variations in small inland water bodies under city urbanization and climate change conditions however using multi sensor observations to retrieve quantitative turbidity maps requires consistency in turbidity products lobo et al 2015 after radiometric normalization and spectral correction of atmospherically corrected reflectance an empirical turbidity model was developed to estimate the turbidity in wuhan with a red nir band switching strategy from analyzing the long term landsat derived turbidity maps during the rapid urbanization of wuhan several conclusions can be made first after radiometric and spectral adjustment of atmospherically corrected reflectance of landsat tm etm and oli the turbidity retrievals derived from multiple sensors agree well with each other the consistent turbidity products can be used to analyze intra and inter annual variations in turbidity for 1987 2019 examined with the meteorological ndvi and isa data we found that 1 the annual mean turbidity values are more likely to be affected by the ecologically friendly wuhan master plan in 2005 characterized by ndvi and isa there is a stable increase in ndvi and isa and decline in water turbidity after 2005 and 2 rainfall may influence the seasonal turbidity variations in spring and autumn while it has less influence in summer and winter indicating the impacts of meteorological factors on water turbidity vary seasonally second the acquisition time of valid satellite observations affects the annual mean turbidity values because of the seasonality of turbidity variations it is necessary to include multiple satellite observations to obtain higher frequency time series to monitor dynamic inland waters arabi et al 2020 güttler et al 2013 morel et al 2007 the seasonality in turbidity may affect the analysis of long term inter annual variability since seasonal meteorological factors such as wind and precipitation du et al 2020 have impacts on water turbidity the distribution of landsat data in a year inevitably affects the annual mean value of water turbidity many studies have successfully applied landsat time series to study events that might have a strong seasonal component such as vegetation change zhang et al 2017 semi arid wetland surface water dynamics halabisky et al 2016 and water salinity ferdous and rahman 2020 by merging data from three landsat instruments tm etm and oli to obtain better temporal coverage almost every season in every year especially after 2000 has at least one observation the impacts of seasonality are reduced and the long term trends can be considered reasonable however even if the tm etm and oli images are merged to derive water turbidity in wuhan there are still no valid scenes in some seasons in several years if the observations are available in each season during a year the annual mean turbidity is more reliable the landsat data might be adequate for monitoring water quality at an annual scale wang et al 2018 however to monitor the turbidity at a higher frequency landsat data might be insufficient third both climatic conditions and human activities can induce variations in water turbidity cao et al 2017 meteorological parameters such as rainfall wind and temperature are relatively stable over different years thus climate induced turbidity variations are relatively regular and predictable however human activities can change the turbidity in a much shorter time and have long term impacts the wuhan master plan in 2005 accelerated urbanization with isa increasing more quickly after 2005 and led to the improvement of environmental conditions with steadily increased ndvi the urbanization process after 2005 did not induce an increase in water turbidity indicating that with consideration for environmental systems it is possible to maintain a balance between urban construction and ecological sustainability after approximately 10 years of the wuhan master plan the turbidity and ndvi returned to previous levels suggesting that it takes time to restore the natural conditions and a cautious approach is needed to reconcile human activities and environmental impacts to our knowledge this is the first time that long term turbidity variations have been documented and analyzed in wuhan concerning the city s urbanization the results provide necessary information to evaluate the impacts of the city master plan on water quality for governmental decision making and environmental protection planning in general the multi sensor based approach demonstrates significant potential for monitoring and understanding the water environment in an urbanizing metropolis and could be easily applied in other

4958,climate change and urbanization are jointly impacting on the open surface water area of the irtysh river in the arctic circle this will affect the economic development and ecology of the countries in the irtysh river basin and the hydrological cycle of the arctic circle however the long term changes of open surface water bodies in the irtysh river basin have not been well quantified to address this 89 000 landsat 4 5 7 and 8 images from 1990 to 2019 were used to extract the surface water body area of the irtysh river basin and integrated the assessment of open surface water area dynamics the geographical detector model was used to quantify the factors that affect the area of open surface water bodies the results show that the total open surface water area of the irtysh river basin is an increasing trend over the past 30 years with a total increase of 88 790 km2 of which the permanent water body area decreased by 20 800 km2 and the seasonal water body area increased by 109 590 km2 in addition the factors that contributed the most to the dynamics of the surface water area in the irtysh river basin were evapotranspiration precipitation and snow water equivalent whose contribution rates could reach 72 66 and 61 respectively with important interactions between factors this suggests that monitoring dynamics in surface water area requires comprehensive consideration of all factors results obtained from this study offer the latest information for fully understanding the spatio temporal variation of surface water body area and its driving factors in this basin which could be used to effectively manage water resources for possibly reducing international water disputes and protecting the fragile ecology in the arctic keywords surface water body area dynamics irtysh river basin google earth engine times series landsat image driving force 1 introduction the irtysh river is an international river flowing through china kazakhstan and russia it is an important water resource for agricultural and industrial production in the three countries karatayev et al 2017a 2017b yang et al 2019 at the same time the irtysh river basin irb plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining biodiversity by protecting endangered species and migrating waterfowl zheng et al 2018 which is closely related to human well being increasing pressure from human activities ullrich et al 2007 yang and hu 2019 fang et al 2020 and climate change have driven significant fluctuation in the irb runoff over the past few decades posing a threat to the regional ecology and international relations with notable impacts on water quality habitat reduction and tensions between upstream and downstream countries seidakhmetov et al 2014 in view of the severe negative impact of the decrease in water resources of the irtysh river rim countries in the region monitoring dynamics of the open surface water bodies of the irb are essential for managing the future development of the river s water resources and international relations existing researches show that the temperature in the arctic has increased at twice the global average rate in the recent decades bekryaev et al 2010 yamanouchi and takata 2020 which has greatly affected the arctic ecosystem and hydrological processes as global warming intensifies in the arctic changes in runoff may have a major impact on arctic rivers and coastal areas in addition the arctic rivers discharge 3299 km3 of fresh water into the arctic ocean each year accounting for about 11 of global river discharge bring et al 2017 as one of the three largest rivers in the arctic circle the ob river escoube et al 2015 has an annual discharge of 8 of the total arctic freshwater agafonov et al 2016 the irtysh river is the largest tributary of the ob river so the dynamics in its surface water body area will affect the hydrological cycle process in the arctic and even the ecological environment of the arctic ocean water conflict in transboundary river basins is one of the most important water resource problems in the world especially in central asia bernauer and siegfried 2012 previous studies have shown de stefano et al 2017 that the relatively large number of new dams in the irb has increased the pressure on regional water resources and the intensification of climate change led to water shortage and increasing conflicts as an important international transboundary river the dynamics of the open surface water body area swa of the irtysh river will not only exacerbate the conflicts of transboundary water resources in central asia but will also intensify water disputes between upstream midstream and downstream countries of china kazakhstan and russia respectively rapid development of remote sensing technology rokni et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 not only has made satellite based water mapping the main method for monitoring swa but also has made large scale water monitoring possible especially in remote mountainous areas crétaux et al 2011 song et al 2014 2013 among all satellite sensors the landsat series has the longest satellite surveillance capability and medium spatial resolution chander et al 2009 hansen and loveland 2012 although a series of studies have been conducted on surface water regime maps feyisa et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 zou et al 2018 there are few long term series analyses of regions and countries that are heavily influenced by political factors especially in high latitude areas where the ecological environment is fragile and data is scarce most of the previous studies on the irb focused on ecology and community characteristics chemagin 2020 leskovskaya and mikhaylova 2019 liu et al 2019a 2019b xi et al 2016 and only a few studies focused on irb water resources these studies mainly use hydrological station data to analyze interannual changes of runoff and the distribution characteristics huang et al 2012 2014a 2014b however runoff and climate in the irb vary dramatically interannual owing to higher latitudinal location requiring long time series data for the study there were few previous studies on the irb but hardly any study on the entire basin system however the irb shows important spatial heterogeneity wang et al 2016 therefore a part of the basin cannot represent the characteristics of the entire basin making it necessary to consider the overall geographical area and divide the basin into sub regions according to the characteristics of the study area for detail analysis considering the above issues this study analyzes the dynamics of the swa in the irb and its driving factors from several perspectives first continuous long term river swa monitoring is carried out during the interannual period annual swa dynamics were detected in previous studies with yearly and monthly global water body maps at 30 m resolution from 1984 to 2015 produced by the joint research center jrc of the european commission pekel et al 2016 and the annual water body maps for the united states from 1984 to 2016 zou et al 2018 second compared with the research based on the hydrological stations the long term continuous monitoring of rivers by remote sensing satellites can better reflect the detailed information of swa for example zou et al 2017 conducted the driver analyses of annual water body dynamics in the contiguous united states and found that precipitation had a statistically positive effects on water body area while temperature and surface water withdrawals for public water supply and agricultural irrigation had negative effects third the irb was divided into eight sub basins for detailed analysis so that the characteristics of the sub basin could be understood as well as the characteristics of the entire irb in this context the main objectives of this study were to 1 map the surface water frequencies wf distribution in the irb from 1990 to 2019 2 study the driving factors of water dynamics in the irb based on the geographic detector model and 3 comprehensively evaluate the surface water dynamics in the irb during 1990 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the irtysh river fig 1 a is the largest tributary of the ob river with a total length of 4248 km and a drainage area of 160 104 km2 huang et al 2012 it originates in the altai mountains in xinjiang china continuing to flow northwest after flowing out of china the upstream is in china with an area of 45 300 km2 and a length of 633 km the area of middle reaches is 498 700 km2 and the river length is 1637 km the lower reaches cover an area of 109 900 km2 and the length is 1978 km in the past few decades the irb has experienced rapid warming yang et al 2019 specifically in the northwest region of xinjiang of china s mountainous region with desert plain landform and retreat of glaciers have been noticed yang et al 2019 the northeast region of kazakhstan has a dry climate and widespread deserts wu et al 2019 the lower reaches are in the western siberian plain with a high proportion of grasslands and cultivated land gusarov et al 2018 therefore from upstream to downstream the ecological environment of the irb shows significant differences the political systems and socioeconomic development conditions of the three countries are also very different medvedev 2016 akhanova et al 2020 xia et al 2020 xinjiang is dominated by animal husbandry northeast kazakhstan is dominated by agriculture and russia is dominated by industry which leads to different land use patterns according to the sub basin information provided by hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org the irb was divided into eight sub basins based on level 4 sub basin data fig 1b these are the ob river basin obb the lower reaches of the ob river basin lobb the konda river basin krb the tobol river basin trb the vagay river basin trb the ishim river basin isrb the middle reaches of the irtysh river basin mirb and the gor koye lake basin glb 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat images in this study all swa information was obtained by google earth engine gee which is known as a cloud computing platform gorelick et al 2017 patel et al 2015 zurqani et al 2018 for planetary geospatial analysis gorelick et al 2017 all landsat 4 5 7 and 8 tier 1 surface reflectance data in the irb are covered within 89 000 images fig 2 a specifically there were differences in the data quality of the eight sub basins fig 2b in order to demonstrate that the data quality will not affect the analyses of temporal change of surface waterbody occurrence we have plotted the spatial distribution of high quality images for each of the past 30 years as shown in fig s1 the three sub basins of mirb glb and obb lacked landsat images before 2000 while the images of other five sub basins were complete therefore the parts of the three sub basins before 2000 were not included in this study a total of 274 tiles fig 2c cover the entire study area for each image the cloud cloud shadow and snow pixels were removed using a cloud masking method called cfmask which is suitable for preparing landsat data for swa detection yan et al 2020 zhu and woodcock 2014 terrain shadows were removed using the solar azimuth and zenith angles from landsat images and the digital elevation model from shuttle radar topography mission zou et al 2018 2 2 2 climate data the era5 reanalysis data https www ecmwf int is the latest reanalysis product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and compared with the era interim dee et al 2011 the era5 has been significantly improved the temporal resolution was improved to 1 h the horizontal resolution was increased to 0 25 0 25 and the vertical direction was divided into 137 levels urraca et al 2018 four natural factors figs s2a 2d of temperature precipitation snowfall is not included snow water equivalent and evapotranspiration in the dataset were selected as independent variables that affect the swa in the irb figure s2 shows that all climate factors have significant spatial heterogeneity over the past 30 years the detailed information is shown in text s1 2 2 3 vegetation coverage vegetation coverage vc is an important parameter that affects the exchange of water between the atmosphere and the surface the size of ndvi depends on factors such as vc and leaf area index so ndvi can be used to remotely estimate vc vc can be measured by the following formula 1 vc ndvi ndvi soil ndvi veg ndvi soil where vc is the vegetation coverage ndvi soil is the ndvi value of bare land ndvi veg is the ndvi value of the land completely covered with vegetation the values of the above two indicators are determined by an approximate alternative method first the ndvi value is obtained through remote sensing images next to remove outliers the cumulative frequencies of ndvi in each time series image were calculated then the ndvi value with the cumulative frequency of 1 was selected as the ndvi soil value and the ndvi value with a cumulative frequency of 99 was selected as the ndvi veg value in different time series images the ndvi soil and ndvi veg values were different based on this method to minimize distractions li 2003 for ndvi selection we used two datasets to reduce the uncertainties caused by a single data source ndvi3g data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and ndvi values derived from modis the global inventory monitoring and modeling studies gimms ndvi version 3 dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 12 and a half month interval and a 34 year time span 1981 2015 liu et al 2019a 2019b the modis mod13a2 ndvi version 6 product provides vegetation index values with a spatial resolution of 1 km per pixel and the time period is from 2000 to present to obtain a consistent and long time series vc we used the artificial neural network ann to construct 1990 2019 ndvi time series data from gimms and modis we constructed a new ndvi with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the time series from 1990 to 1999 named as expanded ndvi the specific method was shown in the appendix text s2 according to expanded ndvi and modis ndvi we calculated the average monthly vc and annual mean vc distribution map of irb during 1990 2019 fig s2e as shown in fig s2e as the latitude increases the value gradually increases with significant spatial stratification heterogeneity at the same time we calculated trends of the vc and the results are shown in fig s3 we found that the vc in the middle reaches of the irb experienced a significant decrease during 1990 to 2019 while it increased significantly in the upstream areas 2 2 4 urbanization urbanization is the main trend of the global population zhao et al 2016 by 2030 urban land cover will increase by 1 2 million km2 almost three times seto et al 2012 the global urban land area in 2000 the rapid expansion of the impervious surface is not only a sign of the urbanization process it can also change the hydrological status of the city hibbs and sharp 2012 and have a negative impact on swa and downstream areas zhou et al 2013 therefore monitoring the time varying trend of the impervious surface of the irb is crucial for understanding the impact of urbanization on the swa here we used the annual global artificial impervious area gaia draw by gong et al 2020 as urbanization indicator to quantitatively analyze the contribution of urbanization to the dynamics of swa in the irb the cumulative annual impervious surface area of each sub basin of the irb was calculated in this study km2 the expansion process of the impervious surface of the irb from 1990 to 2019 are shown in fig s2f although the impervious surface area has increased by almost 17 times over the past 30 years its annual growth rate is relatively low therefore the impervious surface area in 2019 was replaced by that in 2018 2 2 5 terrestrial water storage in order to investigate the relationship between surface water area swa and terrestrial water storage tws the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data was used to obtain terrestrial water storage information in this study the latest tws product grctellus jpl mascons rl06m mscnv02 released by nasa jet propulsion laboratory he et al 2020 was selected to calculate the tws the grctellus jpl mascons provides user friendly monthly time scale and 0 5 spatial resolution data with most geophysical corrections applied which is helpful to analyze dynamics in the mass of the earth s hydrologic parameters to reduce leakage errors for hydrology applications we had applied the gain factor to the jpl mascons data wiese et al 2016 the jpl mascons rl06m data and corresponding gain factor can be found on the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov the data has been widely used in the research of ocean ice and hydrology amin et al 2020 boergens et al 2020 dobslaw et al 2017 due to the large amount of missing data in 2017 and 2018 the total annual tws from 2002 to 2016 was used to explore the relationship between swa and tws of the irb 2 3 method 2 3 1 trend analysis methods the trend analysis methods used in this study are mann kendall test güçlü 2020 kendall 1975 mann 1945 and sen slope sen 1968 sen slope as a non parametric method chauluka et al 2020 malik et al 2020 can be used to discover trends in univariate time series in this study the surface water area was a univariate so this method can be used to analyze its trend changes additionally this method has the advantages of being insensitive to outliers and has been used widely to detect temporal trends in hydrological and meteorological data gocic and trajkovic 2013 hamed 2009 panda and sahu 2019 winslow et al 2015 yang et al 2020a 2020b 2 3 2 geographical detector model the geographical detector model gdm was used in this study to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities and their interactions on the water bodies area of the irb the q statistic is a spatial variance analysis model used to evaluate the pattern of spatial stratification heterogeneity and the factors that cause risk wang et al 2016 2010 the core of the model s basic assumption is that if x explanatory variables lead to y response variables then their spatial distribution is consistent compared with traditional linear methods gdm has the advantage of studying spatial stratification heterogeneity and categorical variables the spatial relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y can be quantified by the q statistic 2 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 where σ 2 is the variance of the independent variable y n is the number of samples in y the superposition of x and y variables forms the l layer in y and is represented by h 1 2 l n h and σ 2 represent the scale change of the h layer q represents the interpretation of degree of x for y ranging from 0 to 1 0 means there is no correlation between the two and 1 means that y is completely dependent on x gdm includes four detectors namely factor detector interaction detector ecological detector and risk detector the complete description of the gdm can be found in the article by wang and hu 2012 in this study the above four detectors were all used to quantitatively evaluate the driving factors in this study six factors were selected to detect the driving force of the water body dynamics in the irb including climate indicators temperature temp precipitation prec snow water equivalent swe evapotranspiration evap vegetation coverage vege and human activity indicators urbanization urba here the discretization based on the principle of maximum q value was used as the classification method which can reveal more relevant information between environmental factors and geographical phenomena wang et al 2010 according to this method the six drivers were divided into six classifications 2 3 3 water body detection and validation the relationship between water and vegetation index was used to detect swa in this study wang et al 2020 in previous research chen et al 2017 there are many cases of water body dynamic analysis based on time series landsat images and water body mapping algorithms based on indicators and thresholds the water and vegetation index and the modified normalized difference water index mndwi the enhanced vegetation index evi and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are used to map the water body in irb these water and vegetation indices are calculated using the following formula zhou et al 2019 3 mndwi ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir 4 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 5 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ re d 1 0 ρ nir 6 0 ρ re d 7 5 ρ blue where ρ blue ρ green ρ red ρ nir and ρ swir are the surface reflectance values of bands blue 0 45 0 52 μm green 0 52 0 60 μm red 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared nir 0 77 0 90 μm and shortwave infrared swir 1 55 1 75 μm in the landsat tm etm and oli evi 0 1 can eliminate vegetation pixels or mixed pixels of water and vegetation therefore mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi and evi 0 1 was used as the standard for identifying the pixels with stronger water signal than vegetation signal therefore only those pixels that meet the above standard are classified as water pixels while others are classified as non water pixels for each landsat pixel the annual wf was calculated using the following formula zhou et al 2019 6 f y 1 n y i 1 n y ω y i 100 where f is the water frequency of the pixel y is the specified year n y is the number of total landsat observations of the pixel in that year ω y i denotes whether one observation of the pixel is water with 1 indicating water and 0 indicating non water based on this method the annual wf map fig 3 of the irb for the past 30 years is generated from all landsat pixels the sentinel 2a images were used to evaluate the accuracy of swa extraction in this study due to the dramatic dynamics of swa the sentinel 2a images with the same date as landsat images was chosen a total of 33 sentinel 2a images table s1 were used in this study according to the swa extracted by landsat 9 900 test samples were randomly generated from the 33 sentinel 2a images including 5 201 water samples and 4 699 non water samples the test samples were then visually interpreted finally using the water information of the interpreted sentinel 2a images as the standard compared whether the pixels of 9900 samples in landsat images were consistent with it the confusion matrix of water detection is shown in table 1 the results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 96 51 and 0 93 respectively indicating that the water information extracted based on landsat images in this study had high accuracy and could be used for further research 3 results 3 1 water body frequency maps and water body areas there are about 640 million 30 meter pixels in the irb and its annual wf was greater than zero in 2019 and the maximum swa was about 576 316 km2 setting different thresholds different wf will be observed therefore the jrc global surface water occurrence layer was used as ancillary data to filter the misclassifications here three thresholds 0 30 and 70 were selected the results fig 3d showed that when the frequency threshold of our dataset was set to 70 the total area has good consistency with the jrc dataset water pixels with frequency 70 were therefore defined as permanent water bodies rokni et al 2015 while others were classified as seasonal water bodies the permanent surface water body area pswa of the irb was about 250 000 km2 and the seasonal surface water body area sswa was about 310 000 km2 in 2019 the 30 year wf map of the irb open surface water bodies is very similar to the spatial pattern of the 2019 annual wf map fig 3b c according to the wf map fig 3a of the irb for the past 30 years there are 150 million pixels of wf 70 approximately 570 000 km2 which is equivalent to the tswa in 2019 3 2 spatial distribution of surface water body area the spatial distribution of swa in the irb has significant unevenness fig 4 table s2 over the past 30 years most of the water body of the irb is in lobb accounting for about 53 of the tswa followed by trb at about 17 and vrb is the smallest accounting for only 0 6 during 2000 2019 the tswa of the obb sub basin was the largest accounting for about 68 with a total volume of about 3 578 005 km2 and the glb had the smallest tswa with a total of about 470 548 km2 accounting for about 9 of the total area of the three sub basins over the past 30 years the multi year average of permanent and seasonal twsa in the irb were approximately 6 884 780 km2 and 5 915 968 km2 respectively accounting for 54 and 46 of the tswa therefore the irb was dominated by pswa fig 4a the proportion of pswa in glb ranks first among all sub basins accounting for about 71 4 the second was krb where the pswa of this sub basin accounts for 69 of the tswa it is worth noting that the composition of water bodies of the two sub basins of trb and isrb were different from other sub basins the above two sub basins were dominated by seasonal water bodies and due to greater evapotranspiration with less precipitation and snow water equivalent the loss of pswa has been increased in addition the tobol river and the ishim river are two important rivers in kazakhstan with the increase of population and the continuous development of urbanization rivotti et al 2019 the surface water extraction in the above two river basins continue to increase ding et al 2020 which is an important human factor owing to a reduction in the pswa this study analyzed the irb s pswa and sswa during 1990 2019 the average of year long pswa and sswa per unit land varied in time and space fig 4 the value of pswa varied between 1 58 and 4 48 ha km2 as the third largest sub basin lobb has the largest pswa reaching 4 48 ha km2 which is due to the lobb is in the outlet of the river however as the fourth largest sub basin of the irb trb has a minimum value of pswa only 1 5 ha km2 this is because the water bodies in this sub basin is mostly seasonal and the climate in northern kazakhstan is arid salnikov et al 2015 with less precipitation and large evapotranspiration leading to increase water consumption for sswa the range of irb s values over the past 30 years was 1 38 ha km2 4 09 ha km2 similarly the sswa of lobb at the estuary of rivers is the highest while that of glb in the middle reaches is the smallest because the proportion of pswa in this sub basin is the highest here the standard deviations sd of the pswa and sswa in all sub basins during the past 30 years were analyzed separately as for pswa fig 4 table s3 the sd values varied between 840 and 17000 km2 the sd value of lobb in the downstream area was the largest of all sub basins at about 17 000 km2 indicating that the pswa of this basin changed significantly from 1990 to 2019 the sd value of glb in the middle reaches was minimum only 840 km2 indicating that the dynamics of pswa in this sub basin was relatively small compared with the other seven sub basins as far as the entire study area is concerned the area of pswa in the upstream and middle reaches changed less than the downstream area in the past 30 years during the study period of past 30 years the sd value of sswa has changed from the lowest value of glb of 1640 km2 to the highest value of obb of 18 900 km2 fig 4b as shown in table s3 that the two sub basins of lobb and krb the sd of the pswa of each sub basin is smaller than that of the sswa indicating that the degree of fluctuation of the pswa is relatively stable than that of sswa thus climate change and human activities have a greater influence on sswa the cv value was also used as an indicator to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of the swa of the irb fig 4 the results showed that the cv values of the pswa ranging from 5 to 25 and the sswa varied from 23 to 42 as shown in table s3 the cv value of the sswa in each sub basin is higher than that of the pswa indicating that the degree of variation of the sswa is higher than that of the pswa the cv values of the pswa and sswa showed significant differences in space the cv values of pswa were the highest in lobb and the smallest in glb the high cv values of sswa appear in vrb and isrb sub basins while the cv values of obb and mirb are relatively small in the past 30 years lobb s pswa and sswa have a large degree of variation and the swa of other sub basins have a relatively small degree of variation 3 3 temporal trends of surface water body area over the past 30 years the three dependent variables of the tswa pswa and sswa in each sub basin showed different interannual trends in order to understand the trend of the tswa in more detail the level 6 sub basins provided by hydrosheds were used as the statistical unit to calculate the trend of the tswa as shown in fig s4 we can find that the tswa in most areas in irb is increasing and has been increased by 87 664 km2 over the past 30 years only in very few areas of the estuary the tswa is decreasing in the past 30 years the tswa has decreased by 483 km2 which is far less than the increase therefore the tswa in irb is increasing as shown in table s4 that the tswa of all sub basins have shown an increasing trend over the past 30 years only lobb s total increase in swa is insignificant the remaining seven sub basins all show significant increasing trends and the increasing trends of isrb mirb glb and obb are highly significant p 0 01 among all the sub basins the tswa of obb has the largest growth rate and the increase amount is as high as 32 020 km2 during 2000 2019 the growth rate of lobb is the lowest and the tswa has increased by 1470 km2 during 1990 2019 in general the tswa of each sub basin in the upstream and middle reaches has the highest rate of increase while that in downstream is relatively small the main reason for the increase in the tswa of all sub basins is that the sswa of all sub basins has increased significantly over the past 30 years and the increase is greater than the loss of pswa as shown in fig 5 from 1990 to 2019 only three sub basins vrb mirb glb of all the sub basins showed an insignificant increase in the pswa while the other five showed a decreasing trend during 1990 2019 the mirb has grown at a maximum rate of about 9 77 and the pswa of that has increased by 2960 km2 the loss of lobb s pswa was the largest about 11 010 km2 and the loss rate was as high as 15 over the past 30 years the loss rate of obb s pswa is only 7 66 but the loss is as high as 7540 km2 indicating that its water resources are relatively abundant the sswa of all sub basins showed an increasing trend over the past 30 years fig 6 the growth trends of isrb mirb glb and obb sub basins were highly significant p 0 01 and sswa increased by 12 210 km2 12 540 km2 3700 km2 and 49 340 km2 respectively with the highest growth rate isrb at 110 97 over the past 30 years although lobb s sswa has not increased significantly its increase is higher about 11 340 km2 in terms of spatial distribution the sswa of all sub basins were increased and the upstream and middle reaches increased rapidly while the downstream areas were relatively slow in the sub basins where the pswa decreases the increase in sswa far exceeds the loss of former the extent of pswa change is much more stable than sswa 3 4 attribution analyses of total surface water body area dynamics the swa for each year of the past 30 years were calculated during 1990 2019 the swa of the irb level 6 provided by hydrosheds sub basins were summarized and the eight sub basins of level 4 were used as the reporting unit the gdm was used to analyze the driving force of tswa dynamics over the past 30 years 3 4 1 quantitative assessment of driving factors contribution rate the factor detector was used to analyze the magnitude of the effect of each factor on the tswa this study quantified the influence of each factor on the tswa by calculating the q value table s5 of each factor according to the influence of each factor on the tswa of the eight sub basins the order of all factors is shown in fig 7 the evapotranspiration has the largest impact on tswa of the six sub basins trb krb vrb isrb mirb and glb with an average contribution rate of 63 fig 7 the average contribution of precipitation is 54 which is lower than evapotranspiration however temperature has a relatively small impact on tswa dynamics in each sub basin and the contribution was only 15 the contribution of all factors to tswa also showed differences in spatial distribution the main driving factors in the upstream and middle reaches are evapotranspiration and its contribution rates are 50 and 72 respectively while temperature has the smallest contribution rate to the tswa dynamics in the sub basin with 12 and 18 respectively in the downstream areas where water was relatively abundant the contributions of evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent were 45 and 40 respectively which were the highest values of the downstream areas while the influence of temperature 7 9 and urbanization 8 7 were lower than other factors as shown in table s6 the same factor has different effects on different regions taking evapotranspiration as an example although this factor has the highest contribution rate in the entire basin it had a much greater impact on the midstream tswa than the downstream although the contribution of urbanization to tswa was the smallest its contribution in the upstream still accounted for 25 while in the downstream the contribution was only 8 7 the contribution of precipitation was as high as 66 in the middle reaches which was the most influential factor but the contribution of this factor to the downstream was only 33 as the results of the factor detector shown it can be found that the driving factors of the tswa have significant spatial differences on the one hand the degree of influence of the same factor on different regions is significantly different table s6 taking evapotranspiration as an example although its contribution is relatively high in the entire study area the impact on the midstream is as high as 72 which is higher than the upstream and downstream the midstream is in kazakhstan where the continental climate is drought and rainless in the context of global warming the evaporation is increasing yang et al 2020a 2020b which makes the possibility of conversion of irb s permanent water bodies into seasonal water bodies non water bodies greatly increased in addition the contribution of urbanization in the downstream is only 8 7 but in the middle reaches the value can be as high as 29 indicating that under the influence of urbanization the loss rate of the tswa in the middle reaches will be higher than other sub basins on the other hand as shown in table s6 the contribution of the six drivers selected in this study in the midstream is higher than the other regions this indicates that the tswa in the middle reaches is more susceptible to climate and human factors therefore in the process of future climate change and socioeconomic development we should focus on changes in the midstream tswa 3 4 2 statistical analysis of significant differences between factors the ecological detector was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the various factors as shown in table s7 that the ecological detection results of all the sub basins and the statistically significant differences among the factors in each sub basin there were significant differences in the influence of all factors on dynamics in tswa of the isrb except for isrb watershed each group of factors in others had different effects on response variables in the lobb watershed there was no significant difference between the two factors of precipitation and vc temperature and urbanization in the trb watershed except for one pair of factors snow water equivalent and urbanization there were significant differences among other factors for the krb only two pairs of factors precipitation and snow water equivalent temperature and urbanization have no significant difference in the vrb watershed only the influence of precipitation and vc showed no difference while any other pair of possible matching factors showed differences in the mirb watershed only three groups of factors snow water equivalent and vc snow water equivalent and urbanization and vc and urbanization showed differences in the impact of tswa in the glb basin only three groups of factors showed differences while other possible combinations have no significant difference in the obb watershed the number of combinations with no clear difference was the highest with a total of four groups evapotranspiration and precipitation evapotranspiration and urbanization precipitation and urbanization and snow water equivalent and vc we therefore found that most factors have significant differences in the impact of tswa dynamics and the spatial distribution of this difference was uneven 3 4 3 prediction of the largest total surface water area risk detector was used to analyze the optimal range table 2 of the factors that were conducive to maintaining the largest tswa in irb the higher the average value of the tswa the larger the tswa in irb and the richer the water resources the more positive the characteristics of the factors the average value of tswa varied greatly among various factors and there were also differences in the values of response variables among different sub basins for example in the lobb watershed only when the evapotranspiration was between 335 1 and 349 8 mm the tswa of the lobb could reach the maximum however in the vrb watershed only when the evapotranspiration was much greater than that in lobb the tswa of vrb could reach maximum it was about 14 914 18 km2 precipitation showed similar characteristics to evapotranspiration in the glb and obb watersheds the tswa of the sub basins could reach the maximum only when the precipitation was maintained at a relatively high value of about 490 mm however in the other watersheds such as lobb and isrb the optimal range of precipitation is 200 300 mm far lower than other watersheds in the trb vrb isrb and glb tswa increased with the increase of snow water equivalent if the snow water equivalent reached the highest in those sub basins the tswa will also be reached its maximum compared with the above four sub basins the impact of snow water equivalent on the lobb krb mirb and obb fluctuated slightly if the snow water equivalent of these four watersheds changed at the fifth level the tswa in the above four sub basins will be reached the maximum the effects of temperature on different sub basins showed significant differences in the lobb krb glb and obb the tswa of the above basins could be maintained at the maximum level only when the multi year average temperature was below 0 c however in the other four sub basins when their multi year average temperature changed within the range of 2 5 c the largest tswa could be maintained there were clear differences in the response degree of tswa in different sub basins to the change of vc in the lobb mirb vrb isrb and obb the tswa reached the maximum when the vc ranged in 22 40 while in the remaining three sub basins only when the variation range of vc was 44 70 could tswa reach their maximum due to the uneven urbanization development level of each sub basin the response of tswa to artificial impervious area had spatial heterogeneity in the lobb isrb krb and glb when the artificial impervious area varied between 0 and 7 km2 the tswa at the highest level and the optimal range of the artificial impervious area in mirb trb and vrb was about 10 25 km2 the optimal range of the artificial impervious area in obb was the highest about 100 120 km2 it was mainly due to the large area of the obb and the relatively high level of urbanization 3 4 4 influence of interactions between driving factors interaction detector was used in this study to quantitatively evaluate the interaction between factors and analyzed the explanatory power ep when two factors simultaneously act on tswa as shown in fig 8 the factors of all sub basins had an interactive effect on tswa the interaction of various factors was divided into two types enhancing each other and nonlinear enhancement but different sub basins had different manifestations table s8 from the spatial perspective among all the sub basins the interaction of the factors in the vrb and isrb watersheds had the strongest ep for tswa among these interactions vege evap ep 0 97 and vege swe ep 0 97 were the strongest it further indicating that the driving factors affecting the dynamics of tswa in vrb were vc and evapotranspiration it also showed that the tswa of the basin was more susceptible to external factors in the lobb watershed the interaction between the factors was relatively weak indicating that the extent of dynamics in the tswa of the basin was small this was mainly because lobb was in the lower reaches of the irb with abundant water resources and a more stable state in addition urba temp ep 0 13 had the lowest interaction in the lobb suggesting that the development of urbanization and temperature had little effect on the dynamics of tswa in the lobb from the perspective of factors the same two factors had different interaction results in different sub basins for example the ep of prec evap was 0 96 in the vrb followed by isrb ep 0 89 and glb ep 0 82 however the ep in the lobb and obb watersheds were very weak only about 0 3 this further indicating that precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main dividers of tswa in the vrb isrb and glb watersheds the ep of vege temp was as high as 0 95 in the vrb watersheds but in other sub basins was below 0 5 indicating that vc and temperature only had a greater influence on the tswa of the vrb watershed 4 discussions 4 1 effect of dynamics in surface water body area on terrestrial water storage as one of the main components of tws the dynamics of surface water will inevitably have a significant impact on tws tao et al 2020 in order to analyze the significance of the dynamics in surface water bodies to water resources this study chose tws as an index of water resources in the irtysh river basin and discussed the hydrological significance of the dynamics in swa to quantitatively evaluate the correlation between swa and tws we used the segmented correlation coefficient maximize the sum of the correlation coefficients of the two segments yuan et al 2019 to quantitatively describe the correlation between swa and tws the results are shown in the fig 9 the correlation coefficient between swa and tws of lobb had an abrupt change in 2010 before 2010 the correlation between swa and tws in this sub basin was as high as 0 81 and after 2010 the correlation between the two was as low as 0 74 fig 9 the swa and tws in lobb also showed a gradual decline from 2007 to 2010 indicating that swa reduced the tws of the downstream area but as the correlation decreased although swa began to increase after 2010 tws still appeared the phenomenon of reduction in the obb watershed the correlation coefficient abruptly changed in 2010 before 2011 the correlation coefficient between swa and tws in obb was 0 68 after 2011 the correlation coefficient was as high as 0 95 indicating that changes in swa had an increasingly higher impact on tws the swa in the obb watershed declined from 2009 to 2011 but the decline in tws began in 2010 one year behind the reduction in swa as shown in fig s1 the vc and precipitation of obb have shown a significant increase over the past 30 years which has alleviated the loss rate of tws and caused its decrease trend to lag behind swa the correlation coefficients of the three sub basins of trb vrb and isrb all had an abruptly changed in 2008 before 2008 the changes in swa and tws of the above three sub basins showed a high consistency especially the correlation coefficient of trb basin before 2008 was the highest 0 96 however after 2008 tws s response to swa changes lagged and even showed the opposite trend for example in the isrb swa decreased sharply during 2010 2011 while tws increased at the same period indicating that the main factor affecting tws during this period was not swa in the vrb watershed the maximum correlation coefficient around 2008 was 0 64 which shows that the swa and tws in this watershed had a high correlation around 2008 however as shown in fig 9 that tws was higher than swa before 2008 therefore during this period the vrb watershed was replenishing swa for tws after 2008 swa was much higher than tws and swa replenishing tws the correlation coefficients of the three sub basins of krb mirb and glb all showed an abrupt change in 2007 before 2007 the change trends of swa and tws in the krb and glb showed good consistent after 2007 the changes of the two indicators were the same but the degree of change was quite different for example krb s swa was reduced by about 5729 km2 during 2009 2011 but the reduction in tws was only about 65 cm during 2007 2010 the change trends of tws and swa in mirb showed a high consistency in 2011 swa dropped to a minimum and the minimum value of tws was delayed by 1 year although the correlation coefficient between swa and tws in mirb reached the highest value after 2007 at 0 75 mirb s swa began to increase in 2011 however tws has been on a downward trend in 2010 and reached its lowest value in 2012 this is due to the upstream area of mirb is in the altay mountains in northern xinjiang which is covered by large number of glaciers and snow in the past few decades the glaciers here have receded a lot zhang et al 2017 which has exacerbated the loss of tws in 2012 with the increase of swa tws also increased in the glb swa began to decrease in 2010 and reached its lowest in 2012 but it has shown an increasing trend after 2013 the tws of the same period showed extremely high consistency which showed that the dynamics of swa directly affected the temporal characteristics of tws the dynamics of irb s swa will directly affect tws especially in the middle reaches therefore analyzing the relationship between swa and tws can help to understand the impact of irb droughts and floods on water resources and provide the latest scientific reference information for solving the increasing water pressure and water and food security issues 4 2 regional geographical significance of the dynamics of surface water body area in irtysh river as the main source of freshwater in the arctic ocean dynamics in runoff will affect the distribution of sea ice in the arctic ocean steele and boyd 1998 and even the arctic circulation mode prange and lohmann 2003 and the north atlantic thermohaline circulation tarasov and peltier 2005 mcclelland et al 2006 rennermalm et al 2006 will respond to dynamics in arctic rivers the irtysh river the only river in china that inflow into the arctic ocean dynamics in its tswa will inevitably affect the water cycle in the arctic and ultimately affect the global climate system existing studies on the arctic river wagner et al 2011 indicating that the runoff of ob river is positive the tswa of lobb and obb in this study corresponding to the ob river has shown an increasing trend over the past 30 years therefore our results are further corroborated according to the results of the factor detector the factors that affect the dynamics in the tswa of the two sub basins are evapotranspiration and vegetation coverage only when the values of these two factors are in the optimal range the tswa of lobb and obb can reach maximum therefore only when the evapotranspiration of lobb is between 335 1 and 349 8 mm and the vegetation coverage of obb is between 30 6 and 37 1 the largest freshwater supply to the arctic ocean can be ensured in the future the management of river is not only the water management between river banks but the comprehensive management of all factors in the river basin including water resources utilization water quality monitoring zhang and luo 2020 population and urbanization which complicated the management of transboundary rivers after the soviet union s disintegration central asia s transboundary rivers water resources management issues become increasingly prominent zheng et al 2019 conflicts often occur between upstream and downstream countries due to uneven distribution of water resources schöne et al 2018 although there have been many efforts to manage the transboundary rivers in central asia olsson et al 2010 duan et al 2020 sehring 2020 the problem has not been completely resolved according to the results in this study we find that the water resources of transboundary rivers are spatially heterogeneous therefore when formulating transboundary rivers management measures the spatial heterogeneity of water resources and other driving factors in the basin should be considered only in this way water resource disputes can be resolved more effectively 4 3 uncertainty analysis and future prospects the method of extracting swa information based on the relationship between water and vegetation index has been successfully applied in the analysis of swa dynamic changes in contiguous united state and mongolian plateau zou et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 existing research shows that the accuracy of this method is relatively high generally above 96 table 3 therefore the above method was chosen in this study and sentinel 2a images was used from ground zero to evaluate the accuracy of the swa based on the confusion matrix method the results showed that the accuracy of the swa obtained based on this method is 96 51 which was very close to the accuracy of the previous researches as mentioned in table 3 indicating that the surface water body information obtained in this study is very reliable there are two main uncertainties or limitations in this study first the data quality and the amount of landsat images needs attention in the future research since landsat s revisit cycle is 16 days when the observations are inconsistent with these surface water events some short term surface water events such as fresh floods will inevitably be missed second this study did not analyze the seasonal variation of the swa in irb the main reason is the cover of snow and ice reduced the accuracy of water surface extraction results in winter wang et al 2018 although the existence of the above reasons makes the research more difficult the gee platform currently provides rapid access to landsat images as well as other remote sensing images bunting et al 2019 such as modis sentinel etc to minimize the gap in research although snow and ice coverage may affect the accuracy of the water surface extraction results it is also meaningful to study the intra year changes of swa in irb in other seasons in future work 5 conclusions all landsat images during the monitoring period were used to extract the annual open surface water area swa of the irtysh river basin irb in this study and integrated the assessment of the temporal and spatial dynamics characteristics of the swa over the past 30 years under the influence of climate changes and urbanization considering that the watershed area of irtysh river is very large and the distribution of swa shows spatial heterogeneous therefore the entire study area was divided into eight sub basins and the dynamics of the open total surface water body area tswa was analyzed one by one the geographical detector model gdm was used to quantitatively evaluate the driving factors of the dynamics in open tswa firstly the tswa in irb continued to increase at a rate of 2922 km2 year over the past 30 years which directly affect the terrestrial water storage tws in the basin secondly the driving factors affecting the tswa in the irb have clear spatial differences evapotranspiration has the highest contribution to the tswa in the entire study area but its contribution is as high as 72 8 in the middle reaches and about 50 1 in the upstream however its contribution in the downstream is higher than other factors with 45 3 finally the tswa in lobb and obb increased significantly during 1990 2019 which will directly increase the freshwater resources of the arctic ocean in addition the influence of various factors on the tswa is neither an independent process nor a simple superposition process but is manifested as mutual enhancement or nonlinear enhancement generally results obtained from this study provide the latest information for fully understanding the spatio temporal variation of surface water body area and its driving factors for the whole irtysh river basin which could be used to effectively manage water resources for possibly reducing international water disputes and protecting the fragile ecology in the arctic declaration of competing interest

4958,climate change and urbanization are jointly impacting on the open surface water area of the irtysh river in the arctic circle this will affect the economic development and ecology of the countries in the irtysh river basin and the hydrological cycle of the arctic circle however the long term changes of open surface water bodies in the irtysh river basin have not been well quantified to address this 89 000 landsat 4 5 7 and 8 images from 1990 to 2019 were used to extract the surface water body area of the irtysh river basin and integrated the assessment of open surface water area dynamics the geographical detector model was used to quantify the factors that affect the area of open surface water bodies the results show that the total open surface water area of the irtysh river basin is an increasing trend over the past 30 years with a total increase of 88 790 km2 of which the permanent water body area decreased by 20 800 km2 and the seasonal water body area increased by 109 590 km2 in addition the factors that contributed the most to the dynamics of the surface water area in the irtysh river basin were evapotranspiration precipitation and snow water equivalent whose contribution rates could reach 72 66 and 61 respectively with important interactions between factors this suggests that monitoring dynamics in surface water area requires comprehensive consideration of all factors results obtained from this study offer the latest information for fully understanding the spatio temporal variation of surface water body area and its driving factors in this basin which could be used to effectively manage water resources for possibly reducing international water disputes and protecting the fragile ecology in the arctic keywords surface water body area dynamics irtysh river basin google earth engine times series landsat image driving force 1 introduction the irtysh river is an international river flowing through china kazakhstan and russia it is an important water resource for agricultural and industrial production in the three countries karatayev et al 2017a 2017b yang et al 2019 at the same time the irtysh river basin irb plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining biodiversity by protecting endangered species and migrating waterfowl zheng et al 2018 which is closely related to human well being increasing pressure from human activities ullrich et al 2007 yang and hu 2019 fang et al 2020 and climate change have driven significant fluctuation in the irb runoff over the past few decades posing a threat to the regional ecology and international relations with notable impacts on water quality habitat reduction and tensions between upstream and downstream countries seidakhmetov et al 2014 in view of the severe negative impact of the decrease in water resources of the irtysh river rim countries in the region monitoring dynamics of the open surface water bodies of the irb are essential for managing the future development of the river s water resources and international relations existing researches show that the temperature in the arctic has increased at twice the global average rate in the recent decades bekryaev et al 2010 yamanouchi and takata 2020 which has greatly affected the arctic ecosystem and hydrological processes as global warming intensifies in the arctic changes in runoff may have a major impact on arctic rivers and coastal areas in addition the arctic rivers discharge 3299 km3 of fresh water into the arctic ocean each year accounting for about 11 of global river discharge bring et al 2017 as one of the three largest rivers in the arctic circle the ob river escoube et al 2015 has an annual discharge of 8 of the total arctic freshwater agafonov et al 2016 the irtysh river is the largest tributary of the ob river so the dynamics in its surface water body area will affect the hydrological cycle process in the arctic and even the ecological environment of the arctic ocean water conflict in transboundary river basins is one of the most important water resource problems in the world especially in central asia bernauer and siegfried 2012 previous studies have shown de stefano et al 2017 that the relatively large number of new dams in the irb has increased the pressure on regional water resources and the intensification of climate change led to water shortage and increasing conflicts as an important international transboundary river the dynamics of the open surface water body area swa of the irtysh river will not only exacerbate the conflicts of transboundary water resources in central asia but will also intensify water disputes between upstream midstream and downstream countries of china kazakhstan and russia respectively rapid development of remote sensing technology rokni et al 2015 chen et al 2018 hou et al 2018 huang et al 2018 not only has made satellite based water mapping the main method for monitoring swa but also has made large scale water monitoring possible especially in remote mountainous areas crétaux et al 2011 song et al 2014 2013 among all satellite sensors the landsat series has the longest satellite surveillance capability and medium spatial resolution chander et al 2009 hansen and loveland 2012 although a series of studies have been conducted on surface water regime maps feyisa et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 zou et al 2018 there are few long term series analyses of regions and countries that are heavily influenced by political factors especially in high latitude areas where the ecological environment is fragile and data is scarce most of the previous studies on the irb focused on ecology and community characteristics chemagin 2020 leskovskaya and mikhaylova 2019 liu et al 2019a 2019b xi et al 2016 and only a few studies focused on irb water resources these studies mainly use hydrological station data to analyze interannual changes of runoff and the distribution characteristics huang et al 2012 2014a 2014b however runoff and climate in the irb vary dramatically interannual owing to higher latitudinal location requiring long time series data for the study there were few previous studies on the irb but hardly any study on the entire basin system however the irb shows important spatial heterogeneity wang et al 2016 therefore a part of the basin cannot represent the characteristics of the entire basin making it necessary to consider the overall geographical area and divide the basin into sub regions according to the characteristics of the study area for detail analysis considering the above issues this study analyzes the dynamics of the swa in the irb and its driving factors from several perspectives first continuous long term river swa monitoring is carried out during the interannual period annual swa dynamics were detected in previous studies with yearly and monthly global water body maps at 30 m resolution from 1984 to 2015 produced by the joint research center jrc of the european commission pekel et al 2016 and the annual water body maps for the united states from 1984 to 2016 zou et al 2018 second compared with the research based on the hydrological stations the long term continuous monitoring of rivers by remote sensing satellites can better reflect the detailed information of swa for example zou et al 2017 conducted the driver analyses of annual water body dynamics in the contiguous united states and found that precipitation had a statistically positive effects on water body area while temperature and surface water withdrawals for public water supply and agricultural irrigation had negative effects third the irb was divided into eight sub basins for detailed analysis so that the characteristics of the sub basin could be understood as well as the characteristics of the entire irb in this context the main objectives of this study were to 1 map the surface water frequencies wf distribution in the irb from 1990 to 2019 2 study the driving factors of water dynamics in the irb based on the geographic detector model and 3 comprehensively evaluate the surface water dynamics in the irb during 1990 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the irtysh river fig 1 a is the largest tributary of the ob river with a total length of 4248 km and a drainage area of 160 104 km2 huang et al 2012 it originates in the altai mountains in xinjiang china continuing to flow northwest after flowing out of china the upstream is in china with an area of 45 300 km2 and a length of 633 km the area of middle reaches is 498 700 km2 and the river length is 1637 km the lower reaches cover an area of 109 900 km2 and the length is 1978 km in the past few decades the irb has experienced rapid warming yang et al 2019 specifically in the northwest region of xinjiang of china s mountainous region with desert plain landform and retreat of glaciers have been noticed yang et al 2019 the northeast region of kazakhstan has a dry climate and widespread deserts wu et al 2019 the lower reaches are in the western siberian plain with a high proportion of grasslands and cultivated land gusarov et al 2018 therefore from upstream to downstream the ecological environment of the irb shows significant differences the political systems and socioeconomic development conditions of the three countries are also very different medvedev 2016 akhanova et al 2020 xia et al 2020 xinjiang is dominated by animal husbandry northeast kazakhstan is dominated by agriculture and russia is dominated by industry which leads to different land use patterns according to the sub basin information provided by hydrosheds https www hydrosheds org the irb was divided into eight sub basins based on level 4 sub basin data fig 1b these are the ob river basin obb the lower reaches of the ob river basin lobb the konda river basin krb the tobol river basin trb the vagay river basin trb the ishim river basin isrb the middle reaches of the irtysh river basin mirb and the gor koye lake basin glb 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat images in this study all swa information was obtained by google earth engine gee which is known as a cloud computing platform gorelick et al 2017 patel et al 2015 zurqani et al 2018 for planetary geospatial analysis gorelick et al 2017 all landsat 4 5 7 and 8 tier 1 surface reflectance data in the irb are covered within 89 000 images fig 2 a specifically there were differences in the data quality of the eight sub basins fig 2b in order to demonstrate that the data quality will not affect the analyses of temporal change of surface waterbody occurrence we have plotted the spatial distribution of high quality images for each of the past 30 years as shown in fig s1 the three sub basins of mirb glb and obb lacked landsat images before 2000 while the images of other five sub basins were complete therefore the parts of the three sub basins before 2000 were not included in this study a total of 274 tiles fig 2c cover the entire study area for each image the cloud cloud shadow and snow pixels were removed using a cloud masking method called cfmask which is suitable for preparing landsat data for swa detection yan et al 2020 zhu and woodcock 2014 terrain shadows were removed using the solar azimuth and zenith angles from landsat images and the digital elevation model from shuttle radar topography mission zou et al 2018 2 2 2 climate data the era5 reanalysis data https www ecmwf int is the latest reanalysis product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and compared with the era interim dee et al 2011 the era5 has been significantly improved the temporal resolution was improved to 1 h the horizontal resolution was increased to 0 25 0 25 and the vertical direction was divided into 137 levels urraca et al 2018 four natural factors figs s2a 2d of temperature precipitation snowfall is not included snow water equivalent and evapotranspiration in the dataset were selected as independent variables that affect the swa in the irb figure s2 shows that all climate factors have significant spatial heterogeneity over the past 30 years the detailed information is shown in text s1 2 2 3 vegetation coverage vegetation coverage vc is an important parameter that affects the exchange of water between the atmosphere and the surface the size of ndvi depends on factors such as vc and leaf area index so ndvi can be used to remotely estimate vc vc can be measured by the following formula 1 vc ndvi ndvi soil ndvi veg ndvi soil where vc is the vegetation coverage ndvi soil is the ndvi value of bare land ndvi veg is the ndvi value of the land completely covered with vegetation the values of the above two indicators are determined by an approximate alternative method first the ndvi value is obtained through remote sensing images next to remove outliers the cumulative frequencies of ndvi in each time series image were calculated then the ndvi value with the cumulative frequency of 1 was selected as the ndvi soil value and the ndvi value with a cumulative frequency of 99 was selected as the ndvi veg value in different time series images the ndvi soil and ndvi veg values were different based on this method to minimize distractions li 2003 for ndvi selection we used two datasets to reduce the uncertainties caused by a single data source ndvi3g data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and ndvi values derived from modis the global inventory monitoring and modeling studies gimms ndvi version 3 dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 12 and a half month interval and a 34 year time span 1981 2015 liu et al 2019a 2019b the modis mod13a2 ndvi version 6 product provides vegetation index values with a spatial resolution of 1 km per pixel and the time period is from 2000 to present to obtain a consistent and long time series vc we used the artificial neural network ann to construct 1990 2019 ndvi time series data from gimms and modis we constructed a new ndvi with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the time series from 1990 to 1999 named as expanded ndvi the specific method was shown in the appendix text s2 according to expanded ndvi and modis ndvi we calculated the average monthly vc and annual mean vc distribution map of irb during 1990 2019 fig s2e as shown in fig s2e as the latitude increases the value gradually increases with significant spatial stratification heterogeneity at the same time we calculated trends of the vc and the results are shown in fig s3 we found that the vc in the middle reaches of the irb experienced a significant decrease during 1990 to 2019 while it increased significantly in the upstream areas 2 2 4 urbanization urbanization is the main trend of the global population zhao et al 2016 by 2030 urban land cover will increase by 1 2 million km2 almost three times seto et al 2012 the global urban land area in 2000 the rapid expansion of the impervious surface is not only a sign of the urbanization process it can also change the hydrological status of the city hibbs and sharp 2012 and have a negative impact on swa and downstream areas zhou et al 2013 therefore monitoring the time varying trend of the impervious surface of the irb is crucial for understanding the impact of urbanization on the swa here we used the annual global artificial impervious area gaia draw by gong et al 2020 as urbanization indicator to quantitatively analyze the contribution of urbanization to the dynamics of swa in the irb the cumulative annual impervious surface area of each sub basin of the irb was calculated in this study km2 the expansion process of the impervious surface of the irb from 1990 to 2019 are shown in fig s2f although the impervious surface area has increased by almost 17 times over the past 30 years its annual growth rate is relatively low therefore the impervious surface area in 2019 was replaced by that in 2018 2 2 5 terrestrial water storage in order to investigate the relationship between surface water area swa and terrestrial water storage tws the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data was used to obtain terrestrial water storage information in this study the latest tws product grctellus jpl mascons rl06m mscnv02 released by nasa jet propulsion laboratory he et al 2020 was selected to calculate the tws the grctellus jpl mascons provides user friendly monthly time scale and 0 5 spatial resolution data with most geophysical corrections applied which is helpful to analyze dynamics in the mass of the earth s hydrologic parameters to reduce leakage errors for hydrology applications we had applied the gain factor to the jpl mascons data wiese et al 2016 the jpl mascons rl06m data and corresponding gain factor can be found on the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov the data has been widely used in the research of ocean ice and hydrology amin et al 2020 boergens et al 2020 dobslaw et al 2017 due to the large amount of missing data in 2017 and 2018 the total annual tws from 2002 to 2016 was used to explore the relationship between swa and tws of the irb 2 3 method 2 3 1 trend analysis methods the trend analysis methods used in this study are mann kendall test güçlü 2020 kendall 1975 mann 1945 and sen slope sen 1968 sen slope as a non parametric method chauluka et al 2020 malik et al 2020 can be used to discover trends in univariate time series in this study the surface water area was a univariate so this method can be used to analyze its trend changes additionally this method has the advantages of being insensitive to outliers and has been used widely to detect temporal trends in hydrological and meteorological data gocic and trajkovic 2013 hamed 2009 panda and sahu 2019 winslow et al 2015 yang et al 2020a 2020b 2 3 2 geographical detector model the geographical detector model gdm was used in this study to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities and their interactions on the water bodies area of the irb the q statistic is a spatial variance analysis model used to evaluate the pattern of spatial stratification heterogeneity and the factors that cause risk wang et al 2016 2010 the core of the model s basic assumption is that if x explanatory variables lead to y response variables then their spatial distribution is consistent compared with traditional linear methods gdm has the advantage of studying spatial stratification heterogeneity and categorical variables the spatial relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y can be quantified by the q statistic 2 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 where σ 2 is the variance of the independent variable y n is the number of samples in y the superposition of x and y variables forms the l layer in y and is represented by h 1 2 l n h and σ 2 represent the scale change of the h layer q represents the interpretation of degree of x for y ranging from 0 to 1 0 means there is no correlation between the two and 1 means that y is completely dependent on x gdm includes four detectors namely factor detector interaction detector ecological detector and risk detector the complete description of the gdm can be found in the article by wang and hu 2012 in this study the above four detectors were all used to quantitatively evaluate the driving factors in this study six factors were selected to detect the driving force of the water body dynamics in the irb including climate indicators temperature temp precipitation prec snow water equivalent swe evapotranspiration evap vegetation coverage vege and human activity indicators urbanization urba here the discretization based on the principle of maximum q value was used as the classification method which can reveal more relevant information between environmental factors and geographical phenomena wang et al 2010 according to this method the six drivers were divided into six classifications 2 3 3 water body detection and validation the relationship between water and vegetation index was used to detect swa in this study wang et al 2020 in previous research chen et al 2017 there are many cases of water body dynamic analysis based on time series landsat images and water body mapping algorithms based on indicators and thresholds the water and vegetation index and the modified normalized difference water index mndwi the enhanced vegetation index evi and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are used to map the water body in irb these water and vegetation indices are calculated using the following formula zhou et al 2019 3 mndwi ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir 4 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 5 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ re d 1 0 ρ nir 6 0 ρ re d 7 5 ρ blue where ρ blue ρ green ρ red ρ nir and ρ swir are the surface reflectance values of bands blue 0 45 0 52 μm green 0 52 0 60 μm red 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared nir 0 77 0 90 μm and shortwave infrared swir 1 55 1 75 μm in the landsat tm etm and oli evi 0 1 can eliminate vegetation pixels or mixed pixels of water and vegetation therefore mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi and evi 0 1 was used as the standard for identifying the pixels with stronger water signal than vegetation signal therefore only those pixels that meet the above standard are classified as water pixels while others are classified as non water pixels for each landsat pixel the annual wf was calculated using the following formula zhou et al 2019 6 f y 1 n y i 1 n y ω y i 100 where f is the water frequency of the pixel y is the specified year n y is the number of total landsat observations of the pixel in that year ω y i denotes whether one observation of the pixel is water with 1 indicating water and 0 indicating non water based on this method the annual wf map fig 3 of the irb for the past 30 years is generated from all landsat pixels the sentinel 2a images were used to evaluate the accuracy of swa extraction in this study due to the dramatic dynamics of swa the sentinel 2a images with the same date as landsat images was chosen a total of 33 sentinel 2a images table s1 were used in this study according to the swa extracted by landsat 9 900 test samples were randomly generated from the 33 sentinel 2a images including 5 201 water samples and 4 699 non water samples the test samples were then visually interpreted finally using the water information of the interpreted sentinel 2a images as the standard compared whether the pixels of 9900 samples in landsat images were consistent with it the confusion matrix of water detection is shown in table 1 the results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 96 51 and 0 93 respectively indicating that the water information extracted based on landsat images in this study had high accuracy and could be used for further research 3 results 3 1 water body frequency maps and water body areas there are about 640 million 30 meter pixels in the irb and its annual wf was greater than zero in 2019 and the maximum swa was about 576 316 km2 setting different thresholds different wf will be observed therefore the jrc global surface water occurrence layer was used as ancillary data to filter the misclassifications here three thresholds 0 30 and 70 were selected the results fig 3d showed that when the frequency threshold of our dataset was set to 70 the total area has good consistency with the jrc dataset water pixels with frequency 70 were therefore defined as permanent water bodies rokni et al 2015 while others were classified as seasonal water bodies the permanent surface water body area pswa of the irb was about 250 000 km2 and the seasonal surface water body area sswa was about 310 000 km2 in 2019 the 30 year wf map of the irb open surface water bodies is very similar to the spatial pattern of the 2019 annual wf map fig 3b c according to the wf map fig 3a of the irb for the past 30 years there are 150 million pixels of wf 70 approximately 570 000 km2 which is equivalent to the tswa in 2019 3 2 spatial distribution of surface water body area the spatial distribution of swa in the irb has significant unevenness fig 4 table s2 over the past 30 years most of the water body of the irb is in lobb accounting for about 53 of the tswa followed by trb at about 17 and vrb is the smallest accounting for only 0 6 during 2000 2019 the tswa of the obb sub basin was the largest accounting for about 68 with a total volume of about 3 578 005 km2 and the glb had the smallest tswa with a total of about 470 548 km2 accounting for about 9 of the total area of the three sub basins over the past 30 years the multi year average of permanent and seasonal twsa in the irb were approximately 6 884 780 km2 and 5 915 968 km2 respectively accounting for 54 and 46 of the tswa therefore the irb was dominated by pswa fig 4a the proportion of pswa in glb ranks first among all sub basins accounting for about 71 4 the second was krb where the pswa of this sub basin accounts for 69 of the tswa it is worth noting that the composition of water bodies of the two sub basins of trb and isrb were different from other sub basins the above two sub basins were dominated by seasonal water bodies and due to greater evapotranspiration with less precipitation and snow water equivalent the loss of pswa has been increased in addition the tobol river and the ishim river are two important rivers in kazakhstan with the increase of population and the continuous development of urbanization rivotti et al 2019 the surface water extraction in the above two river basins continue to increase ding et al 2020 which is an important human factor owing to a reduction in the pswa this study analyzed the irb s pswa and sswa during 1990 2019 the average of year long pswa and sswa per unit land varied in time and space fig 4 the value of pswa varied between 1 58 and 4 48 ha km2 as the third largest sub basin lobb has the largest pswa reaching 4 48 ha km2 which is due to the lobb is in the outlet of the river however as the fourth largest sub basin of the irb trb has a minimum value of pswa only 1 5 ha km2 this is because the water bodies in this sub basin is mostly seasonal and the climate in northern kazakhstan is arid salnikov et al 2015 with less precipitation and large evapotranspiration leading to increase water consumption for sswa the range of irb s values over the past 30 years was 1 38 ha km2 4 09 ha km2 similarly the sswa of lobb at the estuary of rivers is the highest while that of glb in the middle reaches is the smallest because the proportion of pswa in this sub basin is the highest here the standard deviations sd of the pswa and sswa in all sub basins during the past 30 years were analyzed separately as for pswa fig 4 table s3 the sd values varied between 840 and 17000 km2 the sd value of lobb in the downstream area was the largest of all sub basins at about 17 000 km2 indicating that the pswa of this basin changed significantly from 1990 to 2019 the sd value of glb in the middle reaches was minimum only 840 km2 indicating that the dynamics of pswa in this sub basin was relatively small compared with the other seven sub basins as far as the entire study area is concerned the area of pswa in the upstream and middle reaches changed less than the downstream area in the past 30 years during the study period of past 30 years the sd value of sswa has changed from the lowest value of glb of 1640 km2 to the highest value of obb of 18 900 km2 fig 4b as shown in table s3 that the two sub basins of lobb and krb the sd of the pswa of each sub basin is smaller than that of the sswa indicating that the degree of fluctuation of the pswa is relatively stable than that of sswa thus climate change and human activities have a greater influence on sswa the cv value was also used as an indicator to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of the swa of the irb fig 4 the results showed that the cv values of the pswa ranging from 5 to 25 and the sswa varied from 23 to 42 as shown in table s3 the cv value of the sswa in each sub basin is higher than that of the pswa indicating that the degree of variation of the sswa is higher than that of the pswa the cv values of the pswa and sswa showed significant differences in space the cv values of pswa were the highest in lobb and the smallest in glb the high cv values of sswa appear in vrb and isrb sub basins while the cv values of obb and mirb are relatively small in the past 30 years lobb s pswa and sswa have a large degree of variation and the swa of other sub basins have a relatively small degree of variation 3 3 temporal trends of surface water body area over the past 30 years the three dependent variables of the tswa pswa and sswa in each sub basin showed different interannual trends in order to understand the trend of the tswa in more detail the level 6 sub basins provided by hydrosheds were used as the statistical unit to calculate the trend of the tswa as shown in fig s4 we can find that the tswa in most areas in irb is increasing and has been increased by 87 664 km2 over the past 30 years only in very few areas of the estuary the tswa is decreasing in the past 30 years the tswa has decreased by 483 km2 which is far less than the increase therefore the tswa in irb is increasing as shown in table s4 that the tswa of all sub basins have shown an increasing trend over the past 30 years only lobb s total increase in swa is insignificant the remaining seven sub basins all show significant increasing trends and the increasing trends of isrb mirb glb and obb are highly significant p 0 01 among all the sub basins the tswa of obb has the largest growth rate and the increase amount is as high as 32 020 km2 during 2000 2019 the growth rate of lobb is the lowest and the tswa has increased by 1470 km2 during 1990 2019 in general the tswa of each sub basin in the upstream and middle reaches has the highest rate of increase while that in downstream is relatively small the main reason for the increase in the tswa of all sub basins is that the sswa of all sub basins has increased significantly over the past 30 years and the increase is greater than the loss of pswa as shown in fig 5 from 1990 to 2019 only three sub basins vrb mirb glb of all the sub basins showed an insignificant increase in the pswa while the other five showed a decreasing trend during 1990 2019 the mirb has grown at a maximum rate of about 9 77 and the pswa of that has increased by 2960 km2 the loss of lobb s pswa was the largest about 11 010 km2 and the loss rate was as high as 15 over the past 30 years the loss rate of obb s pswa is only 7 66 but the loss is as high as 7540 km2 indicating that its water resources are relatively abundant the sswa of all sub basins showed an increasing trend over the past 30 years fig 6 the growth trends of isrb mirb glb and obb sub basins were highly significant p 0 01 and sswa increased by 12 210 km2 12 540 km2 3700 km2 and 49 340 km2 respectively with the highest growth rate isrb at 110 97 over the past 30 years although lobb s sswa has not increased significantly its increase is higher about 11 340 km2 in terms of spatial distribution the sswa of all sub basins were increased and the upstream and middle reaches increased rapidly while the downstream areas were relatively slow in the sub basins where the pswa decreases the increase in sswa far exceeds the loss of former the extent of pswa change is much more stable than sswa 3 4 attribution analyses of total surface water body area dynamics the swa for each year of the past 30 years were calculated during 1990 2019 the swa of the irb level 6 provided by hydrosheds sub basins were summarized and the eight sub basins of level 4 were used as the reporting unit the gdm was used to analyze the driving force of tswa dynamics over the past 30 years 3 4 1 quantitative assessment of driving factors contribution rate the factor detector was used to analyze the magnitude of the effect of each factor on the tswa this study quantified the influence of each factor on the tswa by calculating the q value table s5 of each factor according to the influence of each factor on the tswa of the eight sub basins the order of all factors is shown in fig 7 the evapotranspiration has the largest impact on tswa of the six sub basins trb krb vrb isrb mirb and glb with an average contribution rate of 63 fig 7 the average contribution of precipitation is 54 which is lower than evapotranspiration however temperature has a relatively small impact on tswa dynamics in each sub basin and the contribution was only 15 the contribution of all factors to tswa also showed differences in spatial distribution the main driving factors in the upstream and middle reaches are evapotranspiration and its contribution rates are 50 and 72 respectively while temperature has the smallest contribution rate to the tswa dynamics in the sub basin with 12 and 18 respectively in the downstream areas where water was relatively abundant the contributions of evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent were 45 and 40 respectively which were the highest values of the downstream areas while the influence of temperature 7 9 and urbanization 8 7 were lower than other factors as shown in table s6 the same factor has different effects on different regions taking evapotranspiration as an example although this factor has the highest contribution rate in the entire basin it had a much greater impact on the midstream tswa than the downstream although the contribution of urbanization to tswa was the smallest its contribution in the upstream still accounted for 25 while in the downstream the contribution was only 8 7 the contribution of precipitation was as high as 66 in the middle reaches which was the most influential factor but the contribution of this factor to the downstream was only 33 as the results of the factor detector shown it can be found that the driving factors of the tswa have significant spatial differences on the one hand the degree of influence of the same factor on different regions is significantly different table s6 taking evapotranspiration as an example although its contribution is relatively high in the entire study area the impact on the midstream is as high as 72 which is higher than the upstream and downstream the midstream is in kazakhstan where the continental climate is drought and rainless in the context of global warming the evaporation is increasing yang et al 2020a 2020b which makes the possibility of conversion of irb s permanent water bodies into seasonal water bodies non water bodies greatly increased in addition the contribution of urbanization in the downstream is only 8 7 but in the middle reaches the value can be as high as 29 indicating that under the influence of urbanization the loss rate of the tswa in the middle reaches will be higher than other sub basins on the other hand as shown in table s6 the contribution of the six drivers selected in this study in the midstream is higher than the other regions this indicates that the tswa in the middle reaches is more susceptible to climate and human factors therefore in the process of future climate change and socioeconomic development we should focus on changes in the midstream tswa 3 4 2 statistical analysis of significant differences between factors the ecological detector was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the various factors as shown in table s7 that the ecological detection results of all the sub basins and the statistically significant differences among the factors in each sub basin there were significant differences in the influence of all factors on dynamics in tswa of the isrb except for isrb watershed each group of factors in others had different effects on response variables in the lobb watershed there was no significant difference between the two factors of precipitation and vc temperature and urbanization in the trb watershed except for one pair of factors snow water equivalent and urbanization there were significant differences among other factors for the krb only two pairs of factors precipitation and snow water equivalent temperature and urbanization have no significant difference in the vrb watershed only the influence of precipitation and vc showed no difference while any other pair of possible matching factors showed differences in the mirb watershed only three groups of factors snow water equivalent and vc snow water equivalent and urbanization and vc and urbanization showed differences in the impact of tswa in the glb basin only three groups of factors showed differences while other possible combinations have no significant difference in the obb watershed the number of combinations with no clear difference was the highest with a total of four groups evapotranspiration and precipitation evapotranspiration and urbanization precipitation and urbanization and snow water equivalent and vc we therefore found that most factors have significant differences in the impact of tswa dynamics and the spatial distribution of this difference was uneven 3 4 3 prediction of the largest total surface water area risk detector was used to analyze the optimal range table 2 of the factors that were conducive to maintaining the largest tswa in irb the higher the average value of the tswa the larger the tswa in irb and the richer the water resources the more positive the characteristics of the factors the average value of tswa varied greatly among various factors and there were also differences in the values of response variables among different sub basins for example in the lobb watershed only when the evapotranspiration was between 335 1 and 349 8 mm the tswa of the lobb could reach the maximum however in the vrb watershed only when the evapotranspiration was much greater than that in lobb the tswa of vrb could reach maximum it was about 14 914 18 km2 precipitation showed similar characteristics to evapotranspiration in the glb and obb watersheds the tswa of the sub basins could reach the maximum only when the precipitation was maintained at a relatively high value of about 490 mm however in the other watersheds such as lobb and isrb the optimal range of precipitation is 200 300 mm far lower than other watersheds in the trb vrb isrb and glb tswa increased with the increase of snow water equivalent if the snow water equivalent reached the highest in those sub basins the tswa will also be reached its maximum compared with the above four sub basins the impact of snow water equivalent on the lobb krb mirb and obb fluctuated slightly if the snow water equivalent of these four watersheds changed at the fifth level the tswa in the above four sub basins will be reached the maximum the effects of temperature on different sub basins showed significant differences in the lobb krb glb and obb the tswa of the above basins could be maintained at the maximum level only when the multi year average temperature was below 0 c however in the other four sub basins when their multi year average temperature changed within the range of 2 5 c the largest tswa could be maintained there were clear differences in the response degree of tswa in different sub basins to the change of vc in the lobb mirb vrb isrb and obb the tswa reached the maximum when the vc ranged in 22 40 while in the remaining three sub basins only when the variation range of vc was 44 70 could tswa reach their maximum due to the uneven urbanization development level of each sub basin the response of tswa to artificial impervious area had spatial heterogeneity in the lobb isrb krb and glb when the artificial impervious area varied between 0 and 7 km2 the tswa at the highest level and the optimal range of the artificial impervious area in mirb trb and vrb was about 10 25 km2 the optimal range of the artificial impervious area in obb was the highest about 100 120 km2 it was mainly due to the large area of the obb and the relatively high level of urbanization 3 4 4 influence of interactions between driving factors interaction detector was used in this study to quantitatively evaluate the interaction between factors and analyzed the explanatory power ep when two factors simultaneously act on tswa as shown in fig 8 the factors of all sub basins had an interactive effect on tswa the interaction of various factors was divided into two types enhancing each other and nonlinear enhancement but different sub basins had different manifestations table s8 from the spatial perspective among all the sub basins the interaction of the factors in the vrb and isrb watersheds had the strongest ep for tswa among these interactions vege evap ep 0 97 and vege swe ep 0 97 were the strongest it further indicating that the driving factors affecting the dynamics of tswa in vrb were vc and evapotranspiration it also showed that the tswa of the basin was more susceptible to external factors in the lobb watershed the interaction between the factors was relatively weak indicating that the extent of dynamics in the tswa of the basin was small this was mainly because lobb was in the lower reaches of the irb with abundant water resources and a more stable state in addition urba temp ep 0 13 had the lowest interaction in the lobb suggesting that the development of urbanization and temperature had little effect on the dynamics of tswa in the lobb from the perspective of factors the same two factors had different interaction results in different sub basins for example the ep of prec evap was 0 96 in the vrb followed by isrb ep 0 89 and glb ep 0 82 however the ep in the lobb and obb watersheds were very weak only about 0 3 this further indicating that precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main dividers of tswa in the vrb isrb and glb watersheds the ep of vege temp was as high as 0 95 in the vrb watersheds but in other sub basins was below 0 5 indicating that vc and temperature only had a greater influence on the tswa of the vrb watershed 4 discussions 4 1 effect of dynamics in surface water body area on terrestrial water storage as one of the main components of tws the dynamics of surface water will inevitably have a significant impact on tws tao et al 2020 in order to analyze the significance of the dynamics in surface water bodies to water resources this study chose tws as an index of water resources in the irtysh river basin and discussed the hydrological significance of the dynamics in swa to quantitatively evaluate the correlation between swa and tws we used the segmented correlation coefficient maximize the sum of the correlation coefficients of the two segments yuan et al 2019 to quantitatively describe the correlation between swa and tws the results are shown in the fig 9 the correlation coefficient between swa and tws of lobb had an abrupt change in 2010 before 2010 the correlation between swa and tws in this sub basin was as high as 0 81 and after 2010 the correlation between the two was as low as 0 74 fig 9 the swa and tws in lobb also showed a gradual decline from 2007 to 2010 indicating that swa reduced the tws of the downstream area but as the correlation decreased although swa began to increase after 2010 tws still appeared the phenomenon of reduction in the obb watershed the correlation coefficient abruptly changed in 2010 before 2011 the correlation coefficient between swa and tws in obb was 0 68 after 2011 the correlation coefficient was as high as 0 95 indicating that changes in swa had an increasingly higher impact on tws the swa in the obb watershed declined from 2009 to 2011 but the decline in tws began in 2010 one year behind the reduction in swa as shown in fig s1 the vc and precipitation of obb have shown a significant increase over the past 30 years which has alleviated the loss rate of tws and caused its decrease trend to lag behind swa the correlation coefficients of the three sub basins of trb vrb and isrb all had an abruptly changed in 2008 before 2008 the changes in swa and tws of the above three sub basins showed a high consistency especially the correlation coefficient of trb basin before 2008 was the highest 0 96 however after 2008 tws s response to swa changes lagged and even showed the opposite trend for example in the isrb swa decreased sharply during 2010 2011 while tws increased at the same period indicating that the main factor affecting tws during this period was not swa in the vrb watershed the maximum correlation coefficient around 2008 was 0 64 which shows that the swa and tws in this watershed had a high correlation around 2008 however as shown in fig 9 that tws was higher than swa before 2008 therefore during this period the vrb watershed was replenishing swa for tws after 2008 swa was much higher than tws and swa replenishing tws the correlation coefficients of the three sub basins of krb mirb and glb all showed an abrupt change in 2007 before 2007 the change trends of swa and tws in the krb and glb showed good consistent after 2007 the changes of the two indicators were the same but the degree of change was quite different for example krb s swa was reduced by about 5729 km2 during 2009 2011 but the reduction in tws was only about 65 cm during 2007 2010 the change trends of tws and swa in mirb showed a high consistency in 2011 swa dropped to a minimum and the minimum value of tws was delayed by 1 year although the correlation coefficient between swa and tws in mirb reached the highest value after 2007 at 0 75 mirb s swa began to increase in 2011 however tws has been on a downward trend in 2010 and reached its lowest value in 2012 this is due to the upstream area of mirb is in the altay mountains in northern xinjiang which is covered by large number of glaciers and snow in the past few decades the glaciers here have receded a lot zhang et al 2017 which has exacerbated the loss of tws in 2012 with the increase of swa tws also increased in the glb swa began to decrease in 2010 and reached its lowest in 2012 but it has shown an increasing trend after 2013 the tws of the same period showed extremely high consistency which showed that the dynamics of swa directly affected the temporal characteristics of tws the dynamics of irb s swa will directly affect tws especially in the middle reaches therefore analyzing the relationship between swa and tws can help to understand the impact of irb droughts and floods on water resources and provide the latest scientific reference information for solving the increasing water pressure and water and food security issues 4 2 regional geographical significance of the dynamics of surface water body area in irtysh river as the main source of freshwater in the arctic ocean dynamics in runoff will affect the distribution of sea ice in the arctic ocean steele and boyd 1998 and even the arctic circulation mode prange and lohmann 2003 and the north atlantic thermohaline circulation tarasov and peltier 2005 mcclelland et al 2006 rennermalm et al 2006 will respond to dynamics in arctic rivers the irtysh river the only river in china that inflow into the arctic ocean dynamics in its tswa will inevitably affect the water cycle in the arctic and ultimately affect the global climate system existing studies on the arctic river wagner et al 2011 indicating that the runoff of ob river is positive the tswa of lobb and obb in this study corresponding to the ob river has shown an increasing trend over the past 30 years therefore our results are further corroborated according to the results of the factor detector the factors that affect the dynamics in the tswa of the two sub basins are evapotranspiration and vegetation coverage only when the values of these two factors are in the optimal range the tswa of lobb and obb can reach maximum therefore only when the evapotranspiration of lobb is between 335 1 and 349 8 mm and the vegetation coverage of obb is between 30 6 and 37 1 the largest freshwater supply to the arctic ocean can be ensured in the future the management of river is not only the water management between river banks but the comprehensive management of all factors in the river basin including water resources utilization water quality monitoring zhang and luo 2020 population and urbanization which complicated the management of transboundary rivers after the soviet union s disintegration central asia s transboundary rivers water resources management issues become increasingly prominent zheng et al 2019 conflicts often occur between upstream and downstream countries due to uneven distribution of water resources schöne et al 2018 although there have been many efforts to manage the transboundary rivers in central asia olsson et al 2010 duan et al 2020 sehring 2020 the problem has not been completely resolved according to the results in this study we find that the water resources of transboundary rivers are spatially heterogeneous therefore when formulating transboundary rivers management measures the spatial heterogeneity of water resources and other driving factors in the basin should be considered only in this way water resource disputes can be resolved more effectively 4 3 uncertainty analysis and future prospects the method of extracting swa information based on the relationship between water and vegetation index has been successfully applied in the analysis of swa dynamic changes in contiguous united state and mongolian plateau zou et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 existing research shows that the accuracy of this method is relatively high generally above 96 table 3 therefore the above method was chosen in this study and sentinel 2a images was used from ground zero to evaluate the accuracy of the swa based on the confusion matrix method the results showed that the accuracy of the swa obtained based on this method is 96 51 which was very close to the accuracy of the previous researches as mentioned in table 3 indicating that the surface water body information obtained in this study is very reliable there are two main uncertainties or limitations in this study first the data quality and the amount of landsat images needs attention in the future research since landsat s revisit cycle is 16 days when the observations are inconsistent with these surface water events some short term surface water events such as fresh floods will inevitably be missed second this study did not analyze the seasonal variation of the swa in irb the main reason is the cover of snow and ice reduced the accuracy of water surface extraction results in winter wang et al 2018 although the existence of the above reasons makes the research more difficult the gee platform currently provides rapid access to landsat images as well as other remote sensing images bunting et al 2019 such as modis sentinel etc to minimize the gap in research although snow and ice coverage may affect the accuracy of the water surface extraction results it is also meaningful to study the intra year changes of swa in irb in other seasons in future work 5 conclusions all landsat images during the monitoring period were used to extract the annual open surface water area swa of the irtysh river basin irb in this study and integrated the assessment of the temporal and spatial dynamics characteristics of the swa over the past 30 years under the influence of climate changes and urbanization considering that the watershed area of irtysh river is very large and the distribution of swa shows spatial heterogeneous therefore the entire study area was divided into eight sub basins and the dynamics of the open total surface water body area tswa was analyzed one by one the geographical detector model gdm was used to quantitatively evaluate the driving factors of the dynamics in open tswa firstly the tswa in irb continued to increase at a rate of 2922 km2 year over the past 30 years which directly affect the terrestrial water storage tws in the basin secondly the driving factors affecting the tswa in the irb have clear spatial differences evapotranspiration has the highest contribution to the tswa in the entire study area but its contribution is as high as 72 8 in the middle reaches and about 50 1 in the upstream however its contribution in the downstream is higher than other factors with 45 3 finally the tswa in lobb and obb increased significantly during 1990 2019 which will directly increase the freshwater resources of the arctic ocean in addition the influence of various factors on the tswa is neither an independent process nor a simple superposition process but is manifested as mutual enhancement or nonlinear enhancement generally results obtained from this study provide the latest information for fully understanding the spatio temporal variation of surface water body area and its driving factors for the whole irtysh river basin which could be used to effectively manage water resources for possibly reducing international water disputes and protecting the fragile ecology in the arctic declaration of competing interest

4959,the inflow of groundwater into the oil shale in situ pyrolysis zone reduces the heating efficiency and has negative impacts on soil ecology and drinking water safety thus we propose a sealing system for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation with a gas injection barrier in this study the characteristics of gas injection barrier were investigated comprehensively in the two dimensional porous media first the evolution and distribution of hydraulic conductivity were studied results showed that gas injection promoted water flow in the central subregion when the gas flow rate was less than 50 ml min with a further increase in the gas flow rate a significant inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions was achieved then the gas injection barrier mechanism was quantitatively analyzed showing that a pressure balanced state in the extended front of the upstream gas flow served as one mechanism when a larger gas flow rate was reached which was verified by experiments for the first time finally the distribution of the gas flow fitted by a gaussian curve was explored in addition the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivity was discussed with increasing water flow rate and the coarsening of glass beads the relative hydraulic conductivity improved comprehensively all results obtained are conducive to a comprehensive understanding and application of the gas injection barrier keywords oil shale groundwater flow gas injection barrier pressure balance hydraulic conductivity flow pattern 1 introduction underground in situ pyrolysis is an ideal method for oil shale exploitation brandt 2008 although experts in many countries have extensively studied this technology hao and yunxing 2014 kang et al 2020 speight 2012 it remains in the experimental stage and has not yet been commercialized owing to many technical problems among them is the difficulty of severing the connection between the pyrolysis zone and surrounding groundwater especially after hydraulic fracturing and establishing support using proppants as a result the inflow of groundwater inevitably reduces the heating efficiency and negatively impacts the soil ecology and drinking water safety in the mining area hu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 therefore appropriate measures are needed to better control the unexpected flow of groundwater gas injections play various roles in porous media and are an integral part of several geological field studies such as petroleum engineering rezaei et al 2018 sohrabi et al 2007 wang et al 2018b co2 geological sequestration middleton et al 2012 trevisan et al 2017 and environmental engineering johnson et al 1993 song et al 2015 in particular gas injections have the potential to block water flow thereby achieving the control of unexpected groundwater flow fry et al 1997 compared with physical barriers e g grout curtains and artificial ground freezing walls etc abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 huang et al 2018 jin et al 2015 sui et al 2015 gas injection as a hydraulic barrier minimizes the irreversible damage to the subsurface e g pores fractures and mechanical properties therefore we propose to study this phenomenon by creating a closed environment for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation by gas injection the subsurface evolves from the saturated state into the gas water coexistence state during gas injection consequently the hydraulic conductivity of the formation is reduced therefore gas injection may be regarded as an underground barrier for controlling groundwater flow in different fields for example attempts have been made to inhibit seawater intrusion by air injection dror et al 2004 sun and semprich 2013 such results showed that injecting compressed air can mitigate seawater intrusion whereby a significant decrease in hydraulic conductivity is realized furthermore in previous studies results have focused on the local shielding effect of the gas injection point while the lateral expansion of the gas injection barrier has not been characterized based on gas water relative permeability models drainage by air injection can be used as a solution for slope stabilization as found by xie et al 2018 who studied the formation of a low permeability unsaturated zone and determined that the groundwater level downstream of the injection point decreased significantly although preliminary attempts have been made the mechanism has not been quantitatively verified another method anti water coning through gas injection has also been investigated lai and wardlaw 1999 wang et al 2018b zhanxi et al 2008 the results for which indicated that discrete and elongated bubbles are the main factors of anti water coning the reduction of hydraulic conductivity is an essential feature of the gas injection barrier apart from the internal properties of porous media e g surface tension and pore size the hydraulic conductivity of porous media mainly depends on the gas water flow pattern distribution and interaction chen et al 2004 jiang et al 2018 johnsen et al 2006 lebeau and konrad 2010 in the process of gas flow the migration of gas bubbles is the main flow pattern far from the gas injection point whereas continuous gas channels appear near the source region geistlinger et al 2006 in that case some of the gas bubbles can reside on the surface of solid particles followed by the formation of trapped gas thus trapped gas as an important characteristic to consider during gas flow has been studied comprehensively such studies have mostly focused on morphological configurations e g gas bubble migration fragmentation coalescence and trapping liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a and relationships with the gas water two phase relative permeability jang and santamarina 2014 mahabadi et al 2018 the results obtained in these studies have indicated that trapped gas bubbles could dramatically reduce hydraulic conductivity owing to the jamin effect without significant reduction in the liquid saturation motivated by the aforementioned applications gas injection barriers can serve to cut off the external inflow of groundwater during the in situ pyrolysis of oil shale thus facilitating the formation of a sealing system as mentioned above different research topics should be emphasized in various application fields of gas injection for example the recovery factor is an important feature in the process of using gas injection to enhance oil recovery zhang et al 2020 another example is the zone of influence which is important for the process of using gas injection in air sparging remediation song et al 2015 moreover flow pattern and trapped gas have received increased attention in co2 geological sequestration undoubtedly the flow pattern of immiscible phases is the most important factor to consider in terms of gas injection playing different roles kazemifar et al 2016 qin et al 2018 in this work a gas injection barrier was proposed to form a sealing system for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation accordingly the change of regional hydraulic conductivity caused by gas injection was the most critical feature and it should be noted that references for the mechanisms and distribution of the gas injection barrier were difficult to obtain from existing studies apart from our initial numerical simulations liu et al 2020 sun et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge there is no study on the effect of gas injection barriers in oil shale sealing systems oil shale is typically well bedded especially after hydraulic fracturing has been carried out and support by proppants has been established as fractures that are full of proppants form in the direction of bedding hence the lateral expansion of the gas injection barrier is key to the establishment of a sealing system based on the above conditions targeted research on gas injection barriers is necessary to provide new possibilities for system sealing of oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation in this study two dimensional 2 d porous media simulating hydraulic fractures with proppants were used to conduct the gas injection experiments the characteristics of the gas injection barrier in 2 d porous media with different size distributions were determined and the effects of the dynamic water flow rate were also investigated further the mechanism of the gas injection barrier was quantitatively analyzed the results obtained herein are expected to be a reference for the system sealing of oil shale in situ pyrolysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus experiments were conducted using a laboratory scale flow system the flow system schematic is illustrated in fig 1 a the 2 d visual flow cell was the core section consisting of two toughened glass plates with external dimensions of 48 length 48 width 3 height cm and packed with transparent glass beads a 4 mm hole was opened in the center of the bottom plate for gas injection while 10 holes of the same size were evenly distributed at both ends of the top plate as shown in fig 1b the holes upstream were used as water inlet ports whereas the holes downstream were used as the outlet ports denoted as a b c d and e the 2 d flow cell was designed for visualization of the experimental results and the methodology of the 2 d flow cell creation was as follows see fig 1c step 1 a silicone tube lightly glued with the use of silica gel on the bottom plate was used to seal the gap between the two plates a square area with dimensions of 45 length 45 width cm was formed which was also the effective range of the 2 d porous media step 2 all holes were covered with nylon meshes to contain the glass beads then approximately 600 g of glass beads after washing and drying were tiled in the square area bottom plate the thickness of the 2 d porous media was dependent on the final amount of glass beads see table 1 step 3 bow clamps were used to tighten the glass beads between the two plates thus the clamping force restricted the movement of the glass beads during fluid flow it was demonstrated that the glass beads had only minimal movement during the entire experiment the movement restriction also minimized the effect of particle migration on the obtained results in the experiments water was injected from the water inlet ports and flowed out with gas from the outlet ports two pressure sensors pin and pout with a measuring range of 0 20 kpa were arranged at both ends to measure the pressure difference δp with an accuracy of 0 2 another sensor with the same parameters was set at the gas injection port to measure the gas pressure pg apart from the 2 d flow cell gas and water were introduced into the flow system by matching pipelines the injected gas was provided by a gas compressor and four types of flow meters were used to measure the gas flow rate q kd800 4 lzb 3wb lzb 4wb and lzb 6wb their measuring ranges were 4 40 10 100 and 60 600 ml min and 0 3 3 and 1 0 10 l min respectively water was injected into the 2 d flow cell at a constant flow rate using a metering pump although a previous study used a set constant hydraulic head to realize the flow of water in porous media dror et al 2004 in this study constant water flow rates were instead utilized to investigate the effects of the dynamic water flow rate in addition imagery of the gas water flow pattern during the experiments was captured using an industrial high speed camera which was controlled by a computer over an s eye interface 2 2 materials and experimental setup for visualization three types of uniform transparent glass beads with properties indicated in table 1 were adopted to construct porous media before being packed in the 2 d flow cell the glass beads were washed and dried in an oven at 80 c for 8 h distilled water and air were used in the study because glass was the inner surface of the porous media the distilled water and air can be regarded as the wetting and non wetting phases respectively the addition of sudan red helped the phase distribution to be more distinguishable and had no significant effect on the fluid properties 2 3 experimental procedure in this study three gas injection experiments were conducted in 2 d porous media with different size distributions of glass beads and the characteristics of the gas water flow patterns were studied under the following approximate water flow rates 0 14 0 26 0 38 0 53 and 0 63 ml s in the experiments the 2 d porous media was saturated with dd water by a pulling vacuum then dd water at a constant flow rate was introduced into the 2 d porous media thereafter gas injection was initiated until a steady state was achieved this could also be interpreted as the state when the pressure difference δp and water discharge reached stability next a sequence of gas injection experiments each lasting 10 min was conducted nonstop until steady state for the gas flow rates was achieved the gas injection rates q from q1 to q6 were approximately 10 50 200 500 2000 and 4000 ml min at each gas flow rate steady state was reached after approximately 3 min as judged by the same standards mentioned above finally the water discharge qwi in each outlet port was measured by the volume of outflow water over a given time interval and the gas outflow rate qgi was measured by a flowmeter the corresponding imagery was recorded by the camera although comprehensive experiments were carried out in this study for the sake of analysis of the results certain repeated experiments were performed in a 2 d flow cell packed with medium sized glass beads 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of gas water flow pattern before the successive gas injections a steady state of water flow single phase was maintained at a designated water flow rate while it was immediately converted to a two phase gas water flow this transition can be regarded as the gas displacement of water in particular with the increase in the gas flow rate the competition between the gas flow and water flow became increasingly prominent thus determining the effect of the gas injection barrier because of this a good understanding of the characteristics of the gas water flow pattern during gas injection is necessary to this end the immiscible displacement can be characterized by a dimensionless number kong et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 known as the capillary number ca which is defined as the relation of viscous to capillary force μnun σnw where μn and un are the viscosity and characteristic velocity respectively of the invading non wetting fluid and for this study the surface tension σnw between water and air was 7 2 10 2n m at room temperature accordingly a range of 3 2 log ca 0 56 according to the magnitude of gas flow rates could be obtained fig 2 illustrates the development of the gas water flow pattern under various conditions also shown is the influence of the dynamic water flow rate during the successive gas injection as shown in fig 2 for all experiments with different water flow rates the desaturated zone expanded gradually with an increase in the gas flow rate i e capillary number for low capillary number conditions the capillary force was dominant during immiscible displacement as shown in fig 2a d log ca 3 2 while the outflow of dd water mixed with discontinuous gas was observed only in outlet port c and branches of capillary fingers formed around outlet ports b and d indicating that those gas flow paths terminated before reaching the ports due to being loosely connected or disconnected as the initial fingers broke through from port c most of the gas flowed along these fingers because the non wetting fluid tended to progress along the path of least resistance or even in the backward direction consequently the branches of additional gas flow that ended earlier formed around ports b and d preferentially and the regional saturated zones embraced by gas flow were also formed due to the arbitrariness of capillary fingering as a result the water discharge from ports b and d decreased considerably even without the outflow of water while significantly increasing from port c this indicates that the water flow around ports b and d was blocked by the dead end gas flow but flushed away by the initial fingers relevant literature also shows that shear action in the fingers can carry away the water from the leading front of the gas flow kazemifar et al 2016 moreover as shown in fig 5 the pore pressure equivalent to the capillary force was also conducive to the inflow of water to the desaturated zone through capillary suction a similar phenomenon occurred for a relatively larger capillary number and a higher water flow rate see fig 2e h viscous fingering dominated at higher capillary numbers and the development of gas flow was observed with an increase in the capillary number while in contrast the water flow paths were correspondingly reduced as shown in fig 2i t log ca 2 5 the gas flow paths intersected with each other and stable fronts of the invading fluid were observed correspondingly dense desaturated zones were formed approximately 90 of the visualization area was covered by gas when the highest gas flow rates were reached see fig 3 however with an increase in the water flow rate the range of the desaturated zone decreased remarkably gas flow paths against the direction of water appear during gas injection with a large gas flow rate 2000 ml min and this phenomenon was relatively significant at the lower water flow rate typically the gas injection barrier is determined by the range of the desaturated zone therefore in this study proportion of the desaturated zone to visible area was calculated based on the flow pattern in fig 2 as shown in fig 3a with the increase in gas flow rate the ratio increased gradually while the growth rate slowed down when the gas flow rate was greater than 1000 ml min owing to the size limitation of the 2 d porous media furthermore the ratio decreased with an increase in the water flow rate because a higher pore water pressure needs to be overcome when a new gas flow path forms therefore the dynamic water flow can be regarded as the resistance of the desaturated zone development which in this case showed that the effect of the gas injection barrier was also weakened fig 3b shows the displacement distance of the gas flow towards the upstream and the results indicate that the displacement distance increased rapidly in the capillary fingering stage in the viscous fingering stage the growth rate of the displacement distance slowed significantly it is known that unlike the arbitrariness of capillary fingering the viscous pressure gradient drives the gas flow upstream when viscous fingering occurs therefore gas tends to flow forward with a flat leading front as is shown in fig 2m t similar to the ratio of the desaturated zone the displacement distance was also limited by the enhancement of dynamic water flow 3 2 evolution and distribution of hydraulic conductivity it is known that hydraulic conductivity is affected by the gas water flow pattern directly further it is also an important criterion for evaluating the effect of the gas injection barrier as mentioned in the previous section the desaturated zone expanded with the increase in the gas flow rate and the gas flow in the central area was more developed than at the edge correspondingly the hydraulic conductivity of different areas also varied and demonstrated non uniformity darcy s law was used to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity during continuous gas injection beltrán et al 2019 dror et al 2004 because the gas water flow pattern was symmetrical the entire visible area was divided into five subregions suba to sube along the direction vertical to the water flow and each subregion was centered on an outlet port see fig 2b based on the measured water discharge qwi of the corresponding outlet port and total pressure difference δp the effective hydraulic conductivity ki of each subregion could be calculated with i corresponding to the outlet ports a b c d and e although the evaporation of water reduces the discharge of water according to a previous study such evaporation is negligible compared with the water discharge dror et al 2004 hence in this study the evaporation of water was not considered the common form of darcy s law is as follows 1 k i q wi μ l a δ p where μ is the viscosity of water l is the length along the flow direction and a is the sectional area of each subregion these three parameters are identical for all subregions the relative hydraulic conductivity kri of each subregion can be obtained as 2 k ri k i k here k is the measured hydraulic conductivity in the single phase steady state before the successive implementation of gas injection see table 1 fig 4 presents a summary of the relative hydraulic conductivity distribution during successive gas injections indicating that the distribution characteristics of kri for the two lower gas flow rates were significantly different from the others the relative hydraulic conductivity of the central subregion was approximately 1 15 for a gas flow rate of 10 ml min indicating that the gas injection promoted water flow in this subregion conversely the relative hydraulic conductivity of the nearby subregions was 0 87 indicating that the water flow in these subregions was weakly restrained in addition gas injection had a negligible impact on the marginal subregions because the relative hydraulic conductivity was approximately equal to unity however when the gas flow rate was increased to 50 ml min apart from the central subregion the relative hydraulic conductivity of the other subregions was 0 8 0 9 showing that the water flow in the marginal subregions was also affected and restrained with the increase in the gas flow rate to greater than 200 ml min the opposite effect was observed wherein an inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions occurred furthermore when the highest gas flow rate was gradually reached the relative hydraulic conductivity of the central subregion decreased from 0 68 to 0 05 and a significant inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions was achieved the distribution characteristics of hydraulic conductivity can be well reflected from the gas water flow pattern during successive gas injections as described above except in a few cases a small portion of the gas flowed out from ports b or d the injected gas only flowed out from port c when the gas flow rate was no greater than 50 ml min in addition branches of dead end gas flow formed around ports b and d therefore the water flow was restrained by the shielding effect of the dead end gas flow in these subregions part of the water flowed around the remaining water entered the gas flow path under the action of capillary suction and shear of gas flow kazemifar et al 2016 further this part of the water was directed toward port c by the gas flow consequently the flow capacity of water within the central subregion was enhanced conversely the water flow around was restrained when the gas flow rate was increased to 50 ml min as shown in fig 2e h branches of the dead end gas flow extended further even to the marginal subregions accordingly the water flow was subsequently restrained owing to the interphase interaction in the lower gas flow rate an undesired distribution of hydraulic conductivity emerged which suggests that the pore pressure and distribution caused by capillary fingering are not conducive to blocking water flow when the gas flow rate further increased the range of the desaturated zone expanded rapidly and the gas flow in the desaturated zone was denser as a result the gas saturation also increased and the hydraulic conductivity decreased significantly according to gas water relative permeability models jang and santamarina 2014 mahabadi et al 2018 these results suggest that capillary fingering and viscous fingering have opposite influences on the gas injection barrier the characteristics of the desaturated zone and pressure state under different flow patterns are the most important factors which will be discussed in section 3 3 although the inhibition effect was achieved comprehensively at higher gas flow rates the water flow promoted by the gas flow remained because of the lower gas flow rate distributed in different areas especially the areas at the edge of the desaturated zone in addition in the practical application of the gas injection barrier the distribution of the gas flow rate is difficult to control therefore the characteristics of the hydraulic conductivity distribution at lower gas flow rates need to be seriously considered 3 3 mechanisms of gas injection barrier early studies have indicated that trapped gas is a water blocking mechanism jang and santamarina 2014 while additional research has confirmed that it may block water flow pathways effectively reducing hydraulic conductivity ronen et al 1988 in addition the existing gas water relative permeability models can also explain the effects of the desaturated zone on hydraulic conductivity reduction thus to better understand the mechanisms of the gas injection barrier we carried out further study of the pressure characteristics during continuous gas injection the real time pressures at different locations are shown in fig 5 owing to the connection between the outlet ports and the atmosphere the pressure of the outlet ports pout was kept equal to the atmospheric pressure without significant fluctuation pg and pin increased with successive gas injection in a stair like manner in addition pg and pin increased only to a small extent before the gas flow rate reached 2000 ml min while it should be noted that a significant increase appeared with further improvement in the gas flow rate this can be explained in that water is a high viscosity wetting fluid thus when the capillary number was small capillary fingering occurred and the pressure drop due to capillary effects was negligible however the pressure drop caused by viscous effects was increasingly more significant with the increase in capillary number therefore the pressure difference δp at the starting point of gas injection reflected the capillary entry pressure pcap which was approximately 2 41 kpa the capillary entry pressure pcap of 2 d porous media with different size distributions of glass beads is summarized in table 1 the average pressure difference δp for each gas injection stage is presented in fig 6 as noted in section 3 1 the pore water pressure and capillary entry pressure can be regarded as the extension resistance of new gas flow paths especially the extension direction toward the upstream this means that the following conditions should be met for the new gas flow paths to form 3 p g p wu p cap or 4 p g p wd p cap here pg is the pressure of gas injection and pwu and pwd are the pore water pressures upstream and downstream respectively the pressure of water injection pin in fig 5 can be regarded as the maximum value of pore water pressure upstream pwu generally for the flow system to stabilize and the outlets to connect to the atmosphere pwd would be less than half of pin therefore eq 4 is usually satisfied earlier as shown in fig 6 eq 3 was not satisfied when the gas flow rate was no more than 2000 ml min whereas eq 4 could be satisfied although viscous fingering was obvious when the gas flow rate was approximately 200 ml min the injected gas still did not have sufficient power to invade upstream it is assumed that if a finger invades upstream a viscous wetting fluid with a higher pressure around it would rush into the gas channel thus only the trapped gas would remain in summary new gas flow paths were generated continuously downstream as shown in fig 2 while almost no new paths were formed upstream owing to the formation of the desaturated zone the relative hydraulic conductivity decreased gradually the weak effect of water blocking functioned at low gas flow rates which can be explained by the existing gas water relative permeability models jang and santamarina 2014 mahabadi et al 2018 when the gas flow rate was no less than 2000 ml min eq 4 was satisfied while numerous intersecting new gas flow paths were generated upstream and the pressure in the gas channels was sufficient to overcome the inward invasion of the surrounding water from this we infer that as long as the above condition is met new paths can continue to extend upstream because in the extension process the pore water pressure of the extended front increases gradually the extension will cease upon the realization of the pressure balance state in the extended front which can be expressed by the following equation 5 p g p wu p cap the inflow of water to the desaturated zone was restrained by the gas flow paths in the pressure balance state therefore as shown in fig 7 the average relative hydraulic conductivity decreased considerably from 0 75 to 0 2 although some feasibility studies exist regarding the gas injection barrier dror et al 2004 sun et al 2019 xie et al 2018 the pressure balance as a mechanism has been quantitatively verified by experiments in this study for the first time in our previous numerical simulation works results have indicated that pressure balance forms at the front of the desaturated zone and the velocity of water towards the desaturated zone was 0 when the pressure balance was achieved similarly in this work the flow direction was also deflected when the water reached the pressure balance position and instead flowed along the two sides with lower resistance this can explain the dramatic decrease in average relative hydraulic conductivity therefore both numerical simulations and experiments verify that the pressure balance is the main mechanism of the gas injection barrier based on the above analysis the displacement distance during viscous fingering in fig 3b can also be regarded as the position of the pressure balance point in this study not all gas flow paths experienced this state water could also flow into the desaturated zone through the marginal subregions and was controlled by the gas water relative permeability models the results at different water flow rates exhibited similar trends fig 7 undoubtedly regardless of the magnitude of the gas flow rates the trapped gas also contributed to the decrease in kri because only a few groups of gas flow rates were used in the experiments the gas flow threshold rate corresponding to the upstream expansion of the gas flow paths was not realized however it is known that for any given capillary entry pressure there is a corresponding threshold overall for low gas flow rates the mechanisms of the gas injection barrier can be explained by the gas water relative permeability models however the pressure balance state in the extended front of the upstream gas flow paths should also be considered when larger gas flow rates are reached trapped gas is almost certainly a factor for water blocking ronen et al 1988 3 4 distribution of gas flow as noted in section 3 3 the gas water flow in the desaturated zone follows the gas water relative permeability models regardless of the model considered the area with higher gas saturation is always the dominant gas flow path therefore the distribution of gas flow in the outlet ports reflects the gas saturation in the corresponding subregions this is illustrated by fig 8 which shows the distribution of gas flow with different water flow rates and the distribution was fitted using a gaussian function which can be expressed in the following common form 6 q gi q total f x x 0 a 2 π w e x x c 2 2 w 2 where qtotal is the total outflow rate of the five outlet ports in each gas injection stage qgi is the gas outflow rate of each outlet port x is the lateral distance from the gas injection port and x0 a xc and w are the fitted parameters the corresponding fitted parameters are summarized in table 2 in the experiments the detection of gas flow distribution was carried out when the steady state was reached at the highest gas flow rate the distribution was essentially identical because the desaturated zone range and saturation of the gas phase were stable in addition the distribution of gas flow at different water flow rates was similar such that the different curves in fig 8 could also be verified based on the above considerations we excluded the record of gas distribution data in the subsequent repeated experiments and only one of the experimental results is shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the distribution of gas flow could be fitted well by a gaussian function with all coefficients of determination exceeding 0 98 these characteristics of distribution indicate that the gas flow in the desaturated zone was concentrated in the central subregion the parameter w represents the concentration level of the gas flow thus the smaller the w the more concentrated the gas flow towards the central axis with an increase in the water flow rate w generally decreased and the proportion of gas flow in the central subregion increased from 0 28 to 0 38 while in contrast the proportion in the marginal subregion decreased from 0 13 to 0 07 in summary the results indicated that the distribution of gas flow gradually converged to the center with progressively higher water flow rates undoubtedly the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the desaturated zone showed a similar distribution because gas is the main material of the gas injection barrier the distribution characteristics of the gas flow can explain the distribution of kri meanwhile the distribution of gas flow should also be considered to avoid affecting other construction segments 3 5 sensitivity analysis of relative hydraulic conductivity in this experiment the size distribution of the glass beads determined the porosity and pore throat size which could be regarded as the internal factors affecting the gas water flow pattern without considering the interfacial tension clearly the water flow served as an external factor thus the effects of the gas injection barrier were further studied with changes in the internal and external factors fig 8 shows the change in the relative hydraulic conductivity under different conditions as shown in fig 9 with an increase in the water flow rate the relative hydraulic conductivity improved comprehensively yielding similar trends for different size distributions of glass beads for example in fig 9a the relative hydraulic conductivity was almost less than 0 1 at the lowest water flow rate 0 14 ml s indicating that the gas injection barrier had a better water blocking effect however this effect was significantly reduced when the water flow rate increased to 0 63 ml s particularly in the marginal subregions the relative hydraulic conductivity increased to 0 6 a better water blocking effect was maintained only near the central subregion as noted in section 3 1 the desaturated zone condensed and converged to the central subregion with an increase in the water flow rate meanwhile darkening of the desaturated zone as shown in fig 2 indicated that the gas saturation decreased gradually therefore the overall relative hydraulic conductivity increased comprehensively meanwhile the improvement in the water flow rate increased the pore water pressure hence the gas flow paths in the pressure balance state decreased correspondingly suggesting that a higher gas flow rate is required for an improved water blocking effect at a higher water flow rate similar to the effects of the water flow rate a slight improvement in the relative hydraulic conductivity was observed with the coarsening of glass beads however the impact on the central subregion was weak even in the flow system of the coarsest glass beads the relative hydraulic conductivity of the central subregion can be maintained at approximately 0 1 according to table 1 the capillary entry pressure decreases with the coarsening of the particles which is not conducive to the retention of gas in porous media thus the relative hydraulic conductivity increased 4 conclusions in order to comprehensively study the characteristics of the gas injection barrier which was proposed to create a closed environment for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation in this study visualization experiments of successive implementation of gas injection were conducted using a 2 d flow cell the specific conclusions are as follows 1 the evolution of the gas water flow pattern and hydraulic conductivity were investigated gas injection promoted water flow in the central subregion when capillary fingering occurred with a further increase in the gas flow rate viscous fingering dominated a significant inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions was achieved 2 the mechanism of the gas injection barrier was quantitatively analyzed results showed that a pressure balanced state in the extended front of the upstream gas flow served as the main mechanism when a larger gas flow rate was reached which was verified by experiments for the first time 3 the

4959,the inflow of groundwater into the oil shale in situ pyrolysis zone reduces the heating efficiency and has negative impacts on soil ecology and drinking water safety thus we propose a sealing system for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation with a gas injection barrier in this study the characteristics of gas injection barrier were investigated comprehensively in the two dimensional porous media first the evolution and distribution of hydraulic conductivity were studied results showed that gas injection promoted water flow in the central subregion when the gas flow rate was less than 50 ml min with a further increase in the gas flow rate a significant inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions was achieved then the gas injection barrier mechanism was quantitatively analyzed showing that a pressure balanced state in the extended front of the upstream gas flow served as one mechanism when a larger gas flow rate was reached which was verified by experiments for the first time finally the distribution of the gas flow fitted by a gaussian curve was explored in addition the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivity was discussed with increasing water flow rate and the coarsening of glass beads the relative hydraulic conductivity improved comprehensively all results obtained are conducive to a comprehensive understanding and application of the gas injection barrier keywords oil shale groundwater flow gas injection barrier pressure balance hydraulic conductivity flow pattern 1 introduction underground in situ pyrolysis is an ideal method for oil shale exploitation brandt 2008 although experts in many countries have extensively studied this technology hao and yunxing 2014 kang et al 2020 speight 2012 it remains in the experimental stage and has not yet been commercialized owing to many technical problems among them is the difficulty of severing the connection between the pyrolysis zone and surrounding groundwater especially after hydraulic fracturing and establishing support using proppants as a result the inflow of groundwater inevitably reduces the heating efficiency and negatively impacts the soil ecology and drinking water safety in the mining area hu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 therefore appropriate measures are needed to better control the unexpected flow of groundwater gas injections play various roles in porous media and are an integral part of several geological field studies such as petroleum engineering rezaei et al 2018 sohrabi et al 2007 wang et al 2018b co2 geological sequestration middleton et al 2012 trevisan et al 2017 and environmental engineering johnson et al 1993 song et al 2015 in particular gas injections have the potential to block water flow thereby achieving the control of unexpected groundwater flow fry et al 1997 compared with physical barriers e g grout curtains and artificial ground freezing walls etc abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 huang et al 2018 jin et al 2015 sui et al 2015 gas injection as a hydraulic barrier minimizes the irreversible damage to the subsurface e g pores fractures and mechanical properties therefore we propose to study this phenomenon by creating a closed environment for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation by gas injection the subsurface evolves from the saturated state into the gas water coexistence state during gas injection consequently the hydraulic conductivity of the formation is reduced therefore gas injection may be regarded as an underground barrier for controlling groundwater flow in different fields for example attempts have been made to inhibit seawater intrusion by air injection dror et al 2004 sun and semprich 2013 such results showed that injecting compressed air can mitigate seawater intrusion whereby a significant decrease in hydraulic conductivity is realized furthermore in previous studies results have focused on the local shielding effect of the gas injection point while the lateral expansion of the gas injection barrier has not been characterized based on gas water relative permeability models drainage by air injection can be used as a solution for slope stabilization as found by xie et al 2018 who studied the formation of a low permeability unsaturated zone and determined that the groundwater level downstream of the injection point decreased significantly although preliminary attempts have been made the mechanism has not been quantitatively verified another method anti water coning through gas injection has also been investigated lai and wardlaw 1999 wang et al 2018b zhanxi et al 2008 the results for which indicated that discrete and elongated bubbles are the main factors of anti water coning the reduction of hydraulic conductivity is an essential feature of the gas injection barrier apart from the internal properties of porous media e g surface tension and pore size the hydraulic conductivity of porous media mainly depends on the gas water flow pattern distribution and interaction chen et al 2004 jiang et al 2018 johnsen et al 2006 lebeau and konrad 2010 in the process of gas flow the migration of gas bubbles is the main flow pattern far from the gas injection point whereas continuous gas channels appear near the source region geistlinger et al 2006 in that case some of the gas bubbles can reside on the surface of solid particles followed by the formation of trapped gas thus trapped gas as an important characteristic to consider during gas flow has been studied comprehensively such studies have mostly focused on morphological configurations e g gas bubble migration fragmentation coalescence and trapping liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a and relationships with the gas water two phase relative permeability jang and santamarina 2014 mahabadi et al 2018 the results obtained in these studies have indicated that trapped gas bubbles could dramatically reduce hydraulic conductivity owing to the jamin effect without significant reduction in the liquid saturation motivated by the aforementioned applications gas injection barriers can serve to cut off the external inflow of groundwater during the in situ pyrolysis of oil shale thus facilitating the formation of a sealing system as mentioned above different research topics should be emphasized in various application fields of gas injection for example the recovery factor is an important feature in the process of using gas injection to enhance oil recovery zhang et al 2020 another example is the zone of influence which is important for the process of using gas injection in air sparging remediation song et al 2015 moreover flow pattern and trapped gas have received increased attention in co2 geological sequestration undoubtedly the flow pattern of immiscible phases is the most important factor to consider in terms of gas injection playing different roles kazemifar et al 2016 qin et al 2018 in this work a gas injection barrier was proposed to form a sealing system for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation accordingly the change of regional hydraulic conductivity caused by gas injection was the most critical feature and it should be noted that references for the mechanisms and distribution of the gas injection barrier were difficult to obtain from existing studies apart from our initial numerical simulations liu et al 2020 sun et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge there is no study on the effect of gas injection barriers in oil shale sealing systems oil shale is typically well bedded especially after hydraulic fracturing has been carried out and support by proppants has been established as fractures that are full of proppants form in the direction of bedding hence the lateral expansion of the gas injection barrier is key to the establishment of a sealing system based on the above conditions targeted research on gas injection barriers is necessary to provide new possibilities for system sealing of oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation in this study two dimensional 2 d porous media simulating hydraulic fractures with proppants were used to conduct the gas injection experiments the characteristics of the gas injection barrier in 2 d porous media with different size distributions were determined and the effects of the dynamic water flow rate were also investigated further the mechanism of the gas injection barrier was quantitatively analyzed the results obtained herein are expected to be a reference for the system sealing of oil shale in situ pyrolysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus experiments were conducted using a laboratory scale flow system the flow system schematic is illustrated in fig 1 a the 2 d visual flow cell was the core section consisting of two toughened glass plates with external dimensions of 48 length 48 width 3 height cm and packed with transparent glass beads a 4 mm hole was opened in the center of the bottom plate for gas injection while 10 holes of the same size were evenly distributed at both ends of the top plate as shown in fig 1b the holes upstream were used as water inlet ports whereas the holes downstream were used as the outlet ports denoted as a b c d and e the 2 d flow cell was designed for visualization of the experimental results and the methodology of the 2 d flow cell creation was as follows see fig 1c step 1 a silicone tube lightly glued with the use of silica gel on the bottom plate was used to seal the gap between the two plates a square area with dimensions of 45 length 45 width cm was formed which was also the effective range of the 2 d porous media step 2 all holes were covered with nylon meshes to contain the glass beads then approximately 600 g of glass beads after washing and drying were tiled in the square area bottom plate the thickness of the 2 d porous media was dependent on the final amount of glass beads see table 1 step 3 bow clamps were used to tighten the glass beads between the two plates thus the clamping force restricted the movement of the glass beads during fluid flow it was demonstrated that the glass beads had only minimal movement during the entire experiment the movement restriction also minimized the effect of particle migration on the obtained results in the experiments water was injected from the water inlet ports and flowed out with gas from the outlet ports two pressure sensors pin and pout with a measuring range of 0 20 kpa were arranged at both ends to measure the pressure difference δp with an accuracy of 0 2 another sensor with the same parameters was set at the gas injection port to measure the gas pressure pg apart from the 2 d flow cell gas and water were introduced into the flow system by matching pipelines the injected gas was provided by a gas compressor and four types of flow meters were used to measure the gas flow rate q kd800 4 lzb 3wb lzb 4wb and lzb 6wb their measuring ranges were 4 40 10 100 and 60 600 ml min and 0 3 3 and 1 0 10 l min respectively water was injected into the 2 d flow cell at a constant flow rate using a metering pump although a previous study used a set constant hydraulic head to realize the flow of water in porous media dror et al 2004 in this study constant water flow rates were instead utilized to investigate the effects of the dynamic water flow rate in addition imagery of the gas water flow pattern during the experiments was captured using an industrial high speed camera which was controlled by a computer over an s eye interface 2 2 materials and experimental setup for visualization three types of uniform transparent glass beads with properties indicated in table 1 were adopted to construct porous media before being packed in the 2 d flow cell the glass beads were washed and dried in an oven at 80 c for 8 h distilled water and air were used in the study because glass was the inner surface of the porous media the distilled water and air can be regarded as the wetting and non wetting phases respectively the addition of sudan red helped the phase distribution to be more distinguishable and had no significant effect on the fluid properties 2 3 experimental procedure in this study three gas injection experiments were conducted in 2 d porous media with different size distributions of glass beads and the characteristics of the gas water flow patterns were studied under the following approximate water flow rates 0 14 0 26 0 38 0 53 and 0 63 ml s in the experiments the 2 d porous media was saturated with dd water by a pulling vacuum then dd water at a constant flow rate was introduced into the 2 d porous media thereafter gas injection was initiated until a steady state was achieved this could also be interpreted as the state when the pressure difference δp and water discharge reached stability next a sequence of gas injection experiments each lasting 10 min was conducted nonstop until steady state for the gas flow rates was achieved the gas injection rates q from q1 to q6 were approximately 10 50 200 500 2000 and 4000 ml min at each gas flow rate steady state was reached after approximately 3 min as judged by the same standards mentioned above finally the water discharge qwi in each outlet port was measured by the volume of outflow water over a given time interval and the gas outflow rate qgi was measured by a flowmeter the corresponding imagery was recorded by the camera although comprehensive experiments were carried out in this study for the sake of analysis of the results certain repeated experiments were performed in a 2 d flow cell packed with medium sized glass beads 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of gas water flow pattern before the successive gas injections a steady state of water flow single phase was maintained at a designated water flow rate while it was immediately converted to a two phase gas water flow this transition can be regarded as the gas displacement of water in particular with the increase in the gas flow rate the competition between the gas flow and water flow became increasingly prominent thus determining the effect of the gas injection barrier because of this a good understanding of the characteristics of the gas water flow pattern during gas injection is necessary to this end the immiscible displacement can be characterized by a dimensionless number kong et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 known as the capillary number ca which is defined as the relation of viscous to capillary force μnun σnw where μn and un are the viscosity and characteristic velocity respectively of the invading non wetting fluid and for this study the surface tension σnw between water and air was 7 2 10 2n m at room temperature accordingly a range of 3 2 log ca 0 56 according to the magnitude of gas flow rates could be obtained fig 2 illustrates the development of the gas water flow pattern under various conditions also shown is the influence of the dynamic water flow rate during the successive gas injection as shown in fig 2 for all experiments with different water flow rates the desaturated zone expanded gradually with an increase in the gas flow rate i e capillary number for low capillary number conditions the capillary force was dominant during immiscible displacement as shown in fig 2a d log ca 3 2 while the outflow of dd water mixed with discontinuous gas was observed only in outlet port c and branches of capillary fingers formed around outlet ports b and d indicating that those gas flow paths terminated before reaching the ports due to being loosely connected or disconnected as the initial fingers broke through from port c most of the gas flowed along these fingers because the non wetting fluid tended to progress along the path of least resistance or even in the backward direction consequently the branches of additional gas flow that ended earlier formed around ports b and d preferentially and the regional saturated zones embraced by gas flow were also formed due to the arbitrariness of capillary fingering as a result the water discharge from ports b and d decreased considerably even without the outflow of water while significantly increasing from port c this indicates that the water flow around ports b and d was blocked by the dead end gas flow but flushed away by the initial fingers relevant literature also shows that shear action in the fingers can carry away the water from the leading front of the gas flow kazemifar et al 2016 moreover as shown in fig 5 the pore pressure equivalent to the capillary force was also conducive to the inflow of water to the desaturated zone through capillary suction a similar phenomenon occurred for a relatively larger capillary number and a higher water flow rate see fig 2e h viscous fingering dominated at higher capillary numbers and the development of gas flow was observed with an increase in the capillary number while in contrast the water flow paths were correspondingly reduced as shown in fig 2i t log ca 2 5 the gas flow paths intersected with each other and stable fronts of the invading fluid were observed correspondingly dense desaturated zones were formed approximately 90 of the visualization area was covered by gas when the highest gas flow rates were reached see fig 3 however with an increase in the water flow rate the range of the desaturated zone decreased remarkably gas flow paths against the direction of water appear during gas injection with a large gas flow rate 2000 ml min and this phenomenon was relatively significant at the lower water flow rate typically the gas injection barrier is determined by the range of the desaturated zone therefore in this study proportion of the desaturated zone to visible area was calculated based on the flow pattern in fig 2 as shown in fig 3a with the increase in gas flow rate the ratio increased gradually while the growth rate slowed down when the gas flow rate was greater than 1000 ml min owing to the size limitation of the 2 d porous media furthermore the ratio decreased with an increase in the water flow rate because a higher pore water pressure needs to be overcome when a new gas flow path forms therefore the dynamic water flow can be regarded as the resistance of the desaturated zone development which in this case showed that the effect of the gas injection barrier was also weakened fig 3b shows the displacement distance of the gas flow towards the upstream and the results indicate that the displacement distance increased rapidly in the capillary fingering stage in the viscous fingering stage the growth rate of the displacement distance slowed significantly it is known that unlike the arbitrariness of capillary fingering the viscous pressure gradient drives the gas flow upstream when viscous fingering occurs therefore gas tends to flow forward with a flat leading front as is shown in fig 2m t similar to the ratio of the desaturated zone the displacement distance was also limited by the enhancement of dynamic water flow 3 2 evolution and distribution of hydraulic conductivity it is known that hydraulic conductivity is affected by the gas water flow pattern directly further it is also an important criterion for evaluating the effect of the gas injection barrier as mentioned in the previous section the desaturated zone expanded with the increase in the gas flow rate and the gas flow in the central area was more developed than at the edge correspondingly the hydraulic conductivity of different areas also varied and demonstrated non uniformity darcy s law was used to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity during continuous gas injection beltrán et al 2019 dror et al 2004 because the gas water flow pattern was symmetrical the entire visible area was divided into five subregions suba to sube along the direction vertical to the water flow and each subregion was centered on an outlet port see fig 2b based on the measured water discharge qwi of the corresponding outlet port and total pressure difference δp the effective hydraulic conductivity ki of each subregion could be calculated with i corresponding to the outlet ports a b c d and e although the evaporation of water reduces the discharge of water according to a previous study such evaporation is negligible compared with the water discharge dror et al 2004 hence in this study the evaporation of water was not considered the common form of darcy s law is as follows 1 k i q wi μ l a δ p where μ is the viscosity of water l is the length along the flow direction and a is the sectional area of each subregion these three parameters are identical for all subregions the relative hydraulic conductivity kri of each subregion can be obtained as 2 k ri k i k here k is the measured hydraulic conductivity in the single phase steady state before the successive implementation of gas injection see table 1 fig 4 presents a summary of the relative hydraulic conductivity distribution during successive gas injections indicating that the distribution characteristics of kri for the two lower gas flow rates were significantly different from the others the relative hydraulic conductivity of the central subregion was approximately 1 15 for a gas flow rate of 10 ml min indicating that the gas injection promoted water flow in this subregion conversely the relative hydraulic conductivity of the nearby subregions was 0 87 indicating that the water flow in these subregions was weakly restrained in addition gas injection had a negligible impact on the marginal subregions because the relative hydraulic conductivity was approximately equal to unity however when the gas flow rate was increased to 50 ml min apart from the central subregion the relative hydraulic conductivity of the other subregions was 0 8 0 9 showing that the water flow in the marginal subregions was also affected and restrained with the increase in the gas flow rate to greater than 200 ml min the opposite effect was observed wherein an inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions occurred furthermore when the highest gas flow rate was gradually reached the relative hydraulic conductivity of the central subregion decreased from 0 68 to 0 05 and a significant inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions was achieved the distribution characteristics of hydraulic conductivity can be well reflected from the gas water flow pattern during successive gas injections as described above except in a few cases a small portion of the gas flowed out from ports b or d the injected gas only flowed out from port c when the gas flow rate was no greater than 50 ml min in addition branches of dead end gas flow formed around ports b and d therefore the water flow was restrained by the shielding effect of the dead end gas flow in these subregions part of the water flowed around the remaining water entered the gas flow path under the action of capillary suction and shear of gas flow kazemifar et al 2016 further this part of the water was directed toward port c by the gas flow consequently the flow capacity of water within the central subregion was enhanced conversely the water flow around was restrained when the gas flow rate was increased to 50 ml min as shown in fig 2e h branches of the dead end gas flow extended further even to the marginal subregions accordingly the water flow was subsequently restrained owing to the interphase interaction in the lower gas flow rate an undesired distribution of hydraulic conductivity emerged which suggests that the pore pressure and distribution caused by capillary fingering are not conducive to blocking water flow when the gas flow rate further increased the range of the desaturated zone expanded rapidly and the gas flow in the desaturated zone was denser as a result the gas saturation also increased and the hydraulic conductivity decreased significantly according to gas water relative permeability models jang and santamarina 2014 mahabadi et al 2018 these results suggest that capillary fingering and viscous fingering have opposite influences on the gas injection barrier the characteristics of the desaturated zone and pressure state under different flow patterns are the most important factors which will be discussed in section 3 3 although the inhibition effect was achieved comprehensively at higher gas flow rates the water flow promoted by the gas flow remained because of the lower gas flow rate distributed in different areas especially the areas at the edge of the desaturated zone in addition in the practical application of the gas injection barrier the distribution of the gas flow rate is difficult to control therefore the characteristics of the hydraulic conductivity distribution at lower gas flow rates need to be seriously considered 3 3 mechanisms of gas injection barrier early studies have indicated that trapped gas is a water blocking mechanism jang and santamarina 2014 while additional research has confirmed that it may block water flow pathways effectively reducing hydraulic conductivity ronen et al 1988 in addition the existing gas water relative permeability models can also explain the effects of the desaturated zone on hydraulic conductivity reduction thus to better understand the mechanisms of the gas injection barrier we carried out further study of the pressure characteristics during continuous gas injection the real time pressures at different locations are shown in fig 5 owing to the connection between the outlet ports and the atmosphere the pressure of the outlet ports pout was kept equal to the atmospheric pressure without significant fluctuation pg and pin increased with successive gas injection in a stair like manner in addition pg and pin increased only to a small extent before the gas flow rate reached 2000 ml min while it should be noted that a significant increase appeared with further improvement in the gas flow rate this can be explained in that water is a high viscosity wetting fluid thus when the capillary number was small capillary fingering occurred and the pressure drop due to capillary effects was negligible however the pressure drop caused by viscous effects was increasingly more significant with the increase in capillary number therefore the pressure difference δp at the starting point of gas injection reflected the capillary entry pressure pcap which was approximately 2 41 kpa the capillary entry pressure pcap of 2 d porous media with different size distributions of glass beads is summarized in table 1 the average pressure difference δp for each gas injection stage is presented in fig 6 as noted in section 3 1 the pore water pressure and capillary entry pressure can be regarded as the extension resistance of new gas flow paths especially the extension direction toward the upstream this means that the following conditions should be met for the new gas flow paths to form 3 p g p wu p cap or 4 p g p wd p cap here pg is the pressure of gas injection and pwu and pwd are the pore water pressures upstream and downstream respectively the pressure of water injection pin in fig 5 can be regarded as the maximum value of pore water pressure upstream pwu generally for the flow system to stabilize and the outlets to connect to the atmosphere pwd would be less than half of pin therefore eq 4 is usually satisfied earlier as shown in fig 6 eq 3 was not satisfied when the gas flow rate was no more than 2000 ml min whereas eq 4 could be satisfied although viscous fingering was obvious when the gas flow rate was approximately 200 ml min the injected gas still did not have sufficient power to invade upstream it is assumed that if a finger invades upstream a viscous wetting fluid with a higher pressure around it would rush into the gas channel thus only the trapped gas would remain in summary new gas flow paths were generated continuously downstream as shown in fig 2 while almost no new paths were formed upstream owing to the formation of the desaturated zone the relative hydraulic conductivity decreased gradually the weak effect of water blocking functioned at low gas flow rates which can be explained by the existing gas water relative permeability models jang and santamarina 2014 mahabadi et al 2018 when the gas flow rate was no less than 2000 ml min eq 4 was satisfied while numerous intersecting new gas flow paths were generated upstream and the pressure in the gas channels was sufficient to overcome the inward invasion of the surrounding water from this we infer that as long as the above condition is met new paths can continue to extend upstream because in the extension process the pore water pressure of the extended front increases gradually the extension will cease upon the realization of the pressure balance state in the extended front which can be expressed by the following equation 5 p g p wu p cap the inflow of water to the desaturated zone was restrained by the gas flow paths in the pressure balance state therefore as shown in fig 7 the average relative hydraulic conductivity decreased considerably from 0 75 to 0 2 although some feasibility studies exist regarding the gas injection barrier dror et al 2004 sun et al 2019 xie et al 2018 the pressure balance as a mechanism has been quantitatively verified by experiments in this study for the first time in our previous numerical simulation works results have indicated that pressure balance forms at the front of the desaturated zone and the velocity of water towards the desaturated zone was 0 when the pressure balance was achieved similarly in this work the flow direction was also deflected when the water reached the pressure balance position and instead flowed along the two sides with lower resistance this can explain the dramatic decrease in average relative hydraulic conductivity therefore both numerical simulations and experiments verify that the pressure balance is the main mechanism of the gas injection barrier based on the above analysis the displacement distance during viscous fingering in fig 3b can also be regarded as the position of the pressure balance point in this study not all gas flow paths experienced this state water could also flow into the desaturated zone through the marginal subregions and was controlled by the gas water relative permeability models the results at different water flow rates exhibited similar trends fig 7 undoubtedly regardless of the magnitude of the gas flow rates the trapped gas also contributed to the decrease in kri because only a few groups of gas flow rates were used in the experiments the gas flow threshold rate corresponding to the upstream expansion of the gas flow paths was not realized however it is known that for any given capillary entry pressure there is a corresponding threshold overall for low gas flow rates the mechanisms of the gas injection barrier can be explained by the gas water relative permeability models however the pressure balance state in the extended front of the upstream gas flow paths should also be considered when larger gas flow rates are reached trapped gas is almost certainly a factor for water blocking ronen et al 1988 3 4 distribution of gas flow as noted in section 3 3 the gas water flow in the desaturated zone follows the gas water relative permeability models regardless of the model considered the area with higher gas saturation is always the dominant gas flow path therefore the distribution of gas flow in the outlet ports reflects the gas saturation in the corresponding subregions this is illustrated by fig 8 which shows the distribution of gas flow with different water flow rates and the distribution was fitted using a gaussian function which can be expressed in the following common form 6 q gi q total f x x 0 a 2 π w e x x c 2 2 w 2 where qtotal is the total outflow rate of the five outlet ports in each gas injection stage qgi is the gas outflow rate of each outlet port x is the lateral distance from the gas injection port and x0 a xc and w are the fitted parameters the corresponding fitted parameters are summarized in table 2 in the experiments the detection of gas flow distribution was carried out when the steady state was reached at the highest gas flow rate the distribution was essentially identical because the desaturated zone range and saturation of the gas phase were stable in addition the distribution of gas flow at different water flow rates was similar such that the different curves in fig 8 could also be verified based on the above considerations we excluded the record of gas distribution data in the subsequent repeated experiments and only one of the experimental results is shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the distribution of gas flow could be fitted well by a gaussian function with all coefficients of determination exceeding 0 98 these characteristics of distribution indicate that the gas flow in the desaturated zone was concentrated in the central subregion the parameter w represents the concentration level of the gas flow thus the smaller the w the more concentrated the gas flow towards the central axis with an increase in the water flow rate w generally decreased and the proportion of gas flow in the central subregion increased from 0 28 to 0 38 while in contrast the proportion in the marginal subregion decreased from 0 13 to 0 07 in summary the results indicated that the distribution of gas flow gradually converged to the center with progressively higher water flow rates undoubtedly the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the desaturated zone showed a similar distribution because gas is the main material of the gas injection barrier the distribution characteristics of the gas flow can explain the distribution of kri meanwhile the distribution of gas flow should also be considered to avoid affecting other construction segments 3 5 sensitivity analysis of relative hydraulic conductivity in this experiment the size distribution of the glass beads determined the porosity and pore throat size which could be regarded as the internal factors affecting the gas water flow pattern without considering the interfacial tension clearly the water flow served as an external factor thus the effects of the gas injection barrier were further studied with changes in the internal and external factors fig 8 shows the change in the relative hydraulic conductivity under different conditions as shown in fig 9 with an increase in the water flow rate the relative hydraulic conductivity improved comprehensively yielding similar trends for different size distributions of glass beads for example in fig 9a the relative hydraulic conductivity was almost less than 0 1 at the lowest water flow rate 0 14 ml s indicating that the gas injection barrier had a better water blocking effect however this effect was significantly reduced when the water flow rate increased to 0 63 ml s particularly in the marginal subregions the relative hydraulic conductivity increased to 0 6 a better water blocking effect was maintained only near the central subregion as noted in section 3 1 the desaturated zone condensed and converged to the central subregion with an increase in the water flow rate meanwhile darkening of the desaturated zone as shown in fig 2 indicated that the gas saturation decreased gradually therefore the overall relative hydraulic conductivity increased comprehensively meanwhile the improvement in the water flow rate increased the pore water pressure hence the gas flow paths in the pressure balance state decreased correspondingly suggesting that a higher gas flow rate is required for an improved water blocking effect at a higher water flow rate similar to the effects of the water flow rate a slight improvement in the relative hydraulic conductivity was observed with the coarsening of glass beads however the impact on the central subregion was weak even in the flow system of the coarsest glass beads the relative hydraulic conductivity of the central subregion can be maintained at approximately 0 1 according to table 1 the capillary entry pressure decreases with the coarsening of the particles which is not conducive to the retention of gas in porous media thus the relative hydraulic conductivity increased 4 conclusions in order to comprehensively study the characteristics of the gas injection barrier which was proposed to create a closed environment for oil shale in situ pyrolysis exploitation in this study visualization experiments of successive implementation of gas injection were conducted using a 2 d flow cell the specific conclusions are as follows 1 the evolution of the gas water flow pattern and hydraulic conductivity were investigated gas injection promoted water flow in the central subregion when capillary fingering occurred with a further increase in the gas flow rate viscous fingering dominated a significant inhibition effect on the water flow within all subregions was achieved 2 the mechanism of the gas injection barrier was quantitatively analyzed results showed that a pressure balanced state in the extended front of the upstream gas flow served as the main mechanism when a larger gas flow rate was reached which was verified by experiments for the first time 3 the distribution of gas flow fitted by a gaussian curve was obtained indicating that the gas flow in the desaturated zone was concentrated in the central subregion in addition the effects of the dynamic water flow and size distribution of glass beads on the hydraulic conductivity were investigated with an increase in the water flow rate the relative hydraulic conductivity improved comprehensively and similar trends were obtained with the coarsening of glass beads credit authorship contribution statement zhao liu conceptualization investigation writing original draft youhong sun conceptualization
