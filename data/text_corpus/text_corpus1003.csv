5015,catchment scale assessment of evapotranspiration et becomes indispensable for evaluating agricultural drought hazard and irrigation water management as direct estimation of et is quite intricate under sparse data availability scenarios the recent indirect et estimation approaches heavily depend on the water balance based et estimates from the popular land surface models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic 3l model or the mod16a2 satellite product along with the land uses the irrigation application methods of alternate wetting and drying awd could also influence the actual et etact estimates this study evaluates the usability of these indirect et estimation methods with reference to the moisture stress specific fao 56 penman monteith pm equation for catchment scale drought and irrigation planning in a real paddy dominated integrated reservoir catchment command the results reveal that the swat derived et in the non irrigated paddy fields was consistent with the fao 56 pm based et estimates during two crop growing seasons however significant overestimation was observed by the vic 3l and mod16a2 products showed a relatively better estimate the swat and vic 3l derived standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized evapotranspiration drought index sedi for the study area revealed that the vic 3l based drought severity was continuously overestimated or underestimated whereas the swat derived sedi indices were almost consistent with the benchmark mod16a2 et and esa cci soil moisture derived estimates finally this study endorses to use these indirect catchment scale drought assessment tools with caution with a need to revise the existing et subroutines in these hydrological models to deal with the crop dynamics and water management options realistically keywords drought evapotranspiration irrigation soil moisture stress swat vic 3l 1 introduction evapotranspiration et that can be estimated from the complex surface energy balance equations plays a decisive role in various water resources management activities including irrigation water requirement irrigation scheduling vegetation atmosphere interactions and terrestrial ecosystem productivity over a range of spatial and temporal domains nemani et al 2002 however the reliable estimation of et in an integrated reservoir catchment command characterized by complex vegetation atmosphere interactions is constrained due to limited data availability and lack of expertise in conceptualizing the real field scenario xu and singh 2005 on the basis of input data availability and associated degree of uncertainty three broad categories of et estimation techniques are documented in the literature sahoo et al 2012 i black box approach the simplest one which is based on the linear or non linear association between various predictor variables e g rainfall temperature and solar radiation ii semi physically based that deals with either energy or mass conservation george et al 2002 and iii physically based that considers both energy and mass conservation in their modelling framework pandey and pandey 2016 as per the recommendation of the international commission of irrigation and drainage icid and food and agriculture organization fao the physically based fao 56 penman monteith pm allen et al 1989 is globally adopted as the standard method for estimation and evaluation of et0 however in many developing countries worldwide the limited availability of meteorological inputs namely rainfall air temperature wind speed relative humidity solar radiation and plant physiological parameter like leaf area index lai at required spatiotemporal scales lead to erroneous et estimation further the conventional et measurement approaches like the flux tower eddy covariance system baldocchi 2003 bowen ratio method peacock and hess 2004 and lysimeter are less generalized due to the involved cost and handling expertise recently the remote sensing based et estimation approaches have gained considerable attention over the existing conventional approaches and are suitable for both field scale bastiaanssen et al 2005 and regional scale applications trezza 2002 srivastava et al 2017 several remote sensing based et estimation approaches those estimate sensible heat flux in a smaller spatial domain include the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a 2007b and surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal allen et al 2011 the applicability of these ground based observations is limited to cloudy sky and ephemeral snow cover conditions which lead to increased uncertainty in catchment scale applications sahoo et al 2020b the introduction of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite that on boards the aqua and terra sensors provided continuous et estimates at 250 m spatial and 8 days temporal resolutions mu et al 2007 yuan et al 2010 with an aim for improved irrigation scheduling at 8 daily time scale in congruence with the general water stress sensitive period for major crops the global scale evaluation of mod16a2 et product evidenced its improved performance in forest regions and poor performance in polar and arid regions kim et al 2012 causing significant underestimation of the eddy covariance based flux tower based et estimates thereby demands the evaluation of mod16a2 product over varying lulc and climatic conditions before its field application autovino et al 2016 the paddy cultivation practice in many tropical monsoon climatic regions is characterized by two basic water application methods surface flooding and water efficient alternate wetting and drying awd technique the quantity of water application is subjected to varying soil moisture stress conditions during different crop growth phases as quantified in the form of moisture stress coefficient kms in this context the crop coefficient kc based actual et etact differs significantly from that of the kms based approach in different popular land surface models lsms such as the soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic et is estimated based on the concept of total plant water availability moreover the diversified modeling framework of lsms with the provision of simplified water balance approach to physically based surface water and vadose zone dynamics have the potential to be applied for regional et estimation under data sparse scenarios this leads to more popularity of the lsms for et estimation over the conventional field measurement and remote sensing based techniques the application of several popular lsms for et modeling include i vic model liang et al 1994 which considers the sub grid scale variability in soil moisture vegetation and forcing parameters for et estimation ii swat arnold et al 1998 nguyen et al 2018 sahoo and sahoo 2020 that conceptualizes the physiology of crop variety management operation practiced and layer wise soil moisture variation across different hydrologic response units hrus and iii mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 which estimates grid scale et based on the derived coefficients of c1 for transpiration loss c2 for canopy evaporation loss cint for interception loss lai soil moisture content in the root zone and root distribution function rdf however in vic 3l and mike she the absence of crop growth module and crop management practice simulation options make the etact estimates less trustworthy for catchment scale application conversely the public domain swat hydrological framework can be applied in multi crop growing regions considering crop growth stage specific management options dash et al 2018 2019 a study conducted in arid and semi arid regions reveals that swat derived monthly etact overestimated the mod16a2 based etact by 3 20 uniyal et al 2019 and the uncertainty may increase further at finer temporal resolutions chun et al 2018 however the performance of the above mentioned lsms in estimating the etact during alternate moisture stress periods of crop growth is yet to be evaluated the catchment scale heterogeneity in soil properties and varying soil depth along with the scarce point scale in situ observations make the spatiotemporal estimation of soil moisture quite intricate in this context different satellite datasets such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 european space agency under the climate change initiative esa cci wagner et al 1999 soil moisture active and passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and lsm based indirect soil moisture retrieval are getting the global attention sridhar et al 2006 al shrafany et al 2014 however the involved uncertainties in the satellite soil moisture products due to the presence of cloud cover limitations in the cloud masking spectral algorithms and both model and input data uncertainty in the lsms lead to less trustworthy soil moisture estimates which adversely affect the catchment scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning moreover under highly erratic rainfall and awd scenario based intermittent irrigation the agrarian catchments exhibit a complicated vadose zone soil moisture dynamics which may not be replicated accurately by the existing soil moisture retrieval approaches till date no past studies have evaluated the performance of the satellite and lsm based products under such complex awd vadose zone dynamics scenario for catchment scale drought monitoring and subsequent irrigation planning quantification of crop water requirement and plant water availability are of utmost importance gu et al 2020a globally lsm based hydrological modelling is mostly used by the policy makers and water managers to assess catchment scale drought funk et al 2015 svoboda and fuchs 2016 kang and sridhar 2018 mishra et al 2018 sehgal and venkataramana 2019 gu et al 2020b the accuracy of the soil moisture and etact estimates by these lsms are influenced by the model conceptualization to mimic the existing hydrological process data availability and spatiotemporal scale of application sridhar et al 2013 therefore the bias associated with these lsm based water balance components could result in uncertain drought assessment indices and subsequent irrigation planning at the catchment scale sahoo et al 2020a dash et al 2020 moreover in paddy dominated catchment reservoir command areas with the conventional pondage or advanced awd irrigation practice as considered in this study the uncertainty could be significant in light of the above discussion the specific research gaps pertaining to paddy dominated catchment scale etact estimation under moisture stress condition are summarized as follows i the spatiotemporal variation of catchment scale soil moisture under awd condition using the satellite and lsm based indirect approaches is yet to be evaluated ii no past studies have quantified the daily scale soil moisture stress in a paddy dominant catchment iii no attempt has been made in the literature to estimate the bias in the etact estimates due to non consideration of soil moisture stress in the popular lsms and iv no study assesses the effect of associated bias with the lsm derived etact and available soil moisture estimates on the drought severity indices for catchment scale irrigation planning therefore this study is attempted to address the following research questions i does the incorporation of soil moisture stress condition in the et modeling framework represent the true catchment scale water balance ii how accurately does the mo16a2 product represent the moisture stressed et condition in a paddy dominated catchment and iii what are the implications of using the swat and vic 3l derived soil moisture and etact estimates for catchment scale agricultural drought analysis and irrigation planning the specific objectives of this study are i to quantify the moisture stress condition in a paddy dominated catchment at a daily time scale using the satellite derived european space agency under the climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture product ii to estimate the catchment scale etact using the swat and vic 3l hydrological models and mod16a2 products under awd condition iii to evaluate the selected lsms and mod16a2 etact products in reproducing the 8 daily fao 56 pm derived etact so as to assess their implications on catchment scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning the manuscript has been organized as follows in sections 2 4 the frameworks of etact estimation by different lsms are described followed by the analysis of water balance in the paddy dominated typical study locations the usability of lsm and satellite based soil moisture and etact estimates in catchment scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning are discussed in section 5 conclusively section 6 briefs the overview of this study and its applicability for real world water resources management 2 et modeling frameworks 2 1 et modeling framework in vic 3l the vic 3l is a physically based semi distributed catchment scale model that conceptualizes both energy and mass balance principles to estimate the grid scale etact using the water balance of different hydrological flux components the vic 3l computes the total etact loss under three major heads i e canopy layer evaporation ec transpiration loss from individual vegetation class et and evaporation from the bare soil surface es as liang et al 1994 1 et act i 1 n c i e c i e t i c n 1 e s where c i is the fractional vegetation coverage of the i th vegetation class in a grid c n 1 is the bare soil fraction in a grid and i is the land use identification code the water evaporated from the plant canopy is regarded as the canopy evaporation and the grid scale canopy evaporation in vic 3l is estimated as 2 e c p i p im 2 3 et 0 a w a w a 0 where p i is the water intercepted by the plant canopy mm day p im is the maximum canopy interception mm day et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day a w is the aerodynamic resistance s m and a 0 is the grid specific architectural resistance s m further the plant transpiration in vic 3l is given by blondin 1991 3 e t 1 p i p im 2 3 et 0 a w a w a 0 a c where a c is the plant canopy resistance s m under unsaturated condition of the top soil layer the soil evaporation process is initiated and continued till the soil reaches saturation phase in vic 3l the bare soil evaporation is estimated by using the sub grid scale distribution of the infiltration capacity as described in the arno model conceptualization franchini and pacciani 1991 4 e s e p f s 0 d f f s 1 i 0 i m 1 1 f 1 b i d f where e p is the potential et pet mm day f s is the saturated bare soil fraction i m is the maximum soil infiltration capacity mm day of the i th grid and io is the point infiltration capacity mm day of the respective grid given by 5 i 0 i m 1 1 a 1 b i 6 i m 1 b i θ s d where a is the fractional soil area with the infiltration capacity less than i m b i is the infiltration shape parameter θs is the porosity of soil and d is the soil depth mm 2 2 et modeling framework in swat swat uses the water balance approach to compute the et as a residual model derivative neitsch et al 2011 7 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r daily q sur e a w seep q gw where s w t is the final soil water content at any time t mm day s w 0 is the initial soil water content mm day r daily is the amount of precipitation on the ith day mm day q sur is the amount of surface runoff on the ith day mm day e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on the ith day mm day w seep is the amount of water as recharge to groundwater from the soil profile on the ith day mm day and q gw is the amount of return flow on the ith day mm day initially swat computes the pet using three basic approaches namely penman monteith equation monteith 1965 under data abundant condition hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1982 under limited data availability scenario and priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 under low advective condition of humid regions after computation of the pet swat estimates etact as the sum of the portioned components canopy evaporation e c soil layer evaporation e s and maximum plant transpiration e t as estimated by ritchie 1972 in heavy snowfall regions first sublimation occurs and after the melting of snow soil evaporation takes place the rainfall is intercepted by the crop canopy and is lost in the form of canopy evaporation e c as 8 e c e p i f e p e c p i n t i f e p e c where pint is the canopy intercepted rainfall mm day after the canopy evaporation the remaining evaporative demand is compensated from vegetation and soil as 9 e p e p e c where e p is the adjusted potential evapotranspiration for canopy water mm day the plant transpiration e t is computed as a function of the lai as neitsch et al 2011 10 e t e p l a i 3 i f 0 l a i 3 e p i f l a i 3 note that the actual transpiration may vary depending upon the water availability in the soil profile the maximum daily soil evaporation e s is computed as 11 e s e p s cov e x p 5 0 10 5 b m where s cov is the soil cover fraction describing the biomass extent present in the hru bm is the crop residue and above ground biomass kg ha obtained from the crop database of swat 2012 the net soil evaporation demand e s z for any soil layer of depth z is computed as 12 e s z e s z z e x p 2 374 0 00713 z where z is the depth of the soil layer below the ground surface mm in eq 12 the coefficients are assigned so as to meet 50 and 95 of the total evaporative demands from the top 10 and 100 mm of soil layers respectively moreover during dry condition swat allows maximum 80 depletion of plant available water in the form of evaporation loss wherein the plant available water is defined as the difference between the available water content and wilting point 1 5 mpa water content of the soil layer the amount of water removed from the soil layer through evaporation can be computed as 13 e s l y 0 8 sw ly wp ly where e s l y is the amount of water removed from the soil layer ly through evaporation mm day sw ly is the soil water content of this layer mm and wp ly is the wilting point moisture content of this layer mm note that although the validity of the fao 56 pm approach is higher for sub daily applications swat can obtain reliable estimates of daily etact using the mean daily weather parameters by accounting for the resulting uncertainty due to diurnal distributions of wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation which are generally not replicated by the mean daily values 2 3 modis based mod16a2 et algorithm the conventional remote sensing based regional et estimation approaches are confined to the energy balance method and explicit characterization of physically based parameters these input parameters are derived from simplified thermal remote sensing products such as land surface temperature lst which perform poorly during night time and cloudy sky conditions to overcome these limitations since the year 2000 1 km gridded modis global et estimates are available at 8 daily monthly and yearly temporal resolutions mu et al 2013 modis terrestrial et budgeting is characterized by the evaporation from dry and wet soil layers evaporation of canopy intercepted water transpiration from plant leaves and stems by using the penman monteith equation mu et al 2007 the existing modis et algorithm has been improved further to address with i simplified estimation of vegetation cover fraction fc ii separate computation of et during both day and night times iii computation of soil heat flux by distributing the incoming radiation with respect to fc and iv improved estimation of stomatal conductance aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance this improved approach is popularly known as the mod16a2 algorithm mu et al 2011 given by 14 et act a e d e z 0 d t ρ c p e z 0 e z r a λ d e z 0 d t γ 1 r s r a e p where a e is the partitioned energy between sensible heat latent heat and soil heat fluxes on the land surface mj m2 day d e z 0 d t is the slope of saturation vapor pressure vs temperature curve ρ is the density of air kg m3 c p is the specific heat capacity of air 1013 j kg k λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m r s is the surface resistance that restricts evaporation and canopy transpiration on the land surface s m and γ is psychrometric constant given by 15 γ c p m d p a λ m w where p a is the atmospheric pressure and m d and m w are the molecular masses of dry and moist air respectively a detailed description of the mod16a2 et estimation algorithm is illustrated in fig 1 the mod16a2 product provides both actual and potential evapotranspiration estimates on the land surface and is useful for determining the agricultural drought intensity and regional water stress given by 16 et act e wc e s e t 17 et p e wc e pt e ws e ps where e wc is the evaporation from wet canopy mm day e pt is potential plant transpiration mm day e ws is the evaporation from wet soil fraction mm day and e ps is the potential soil evaporation mm day 2 4 etact estimation by fao 56 penman monteith pm approach under moisture stress condition the fao 56 penman monteith pm approach is regarded as the fully physically based approach for estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration as allen et al 1998 18 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e z 0 e z δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the reference plant evapotranspiration mm day δ is the slope of saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c g is the soil heat flux mj m2 day u 2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s e z 0 is the saturation vapor pressure at height z from the ground surface kpa and e z is the actual vapor pressure at height z from the ground surface kpa subsequently under zero moisture stress condition et act is estimated by multiplying the growth stage specific kc with the previously estimated et 0 given as 19 et act k c et 0 however under moisture stress condition which is experienced in real fields with awd phenomenon the approaches mentioned in sections 2 1 and 2 2 could overestimate the etact therefore in this section a revised etact estimation approach is advocated to deal with the awd field condition since the conventional tropical paddy cultivation practice consumes excess irrigation water many of the recent irrigation practices prescribe for the awd technique to reduce irrigation water consumption in which intermittent soil moisture condition is allowed to exist throughout the crop base period in this practice etact can be estimated as 20 et act k ms k c et 0 where k ms soil moisture stress coefficient which is a function of soil water deficit in the root zone the value of k ms can be estimated using the fao 56 approach as given by lyra et al 2016 21 k ms θ s θ r θ fc θ i θ s θ r 1 p where θ s is the saturation moisture content cm3 cm3 θ r is the residual moisture content cm3 cm3 θ fc is the field capacity moisture content cm3 cm3 θ i is the actual moisture content cm3 cm3 p is a crop specific parameter called as depletion fraction and for paddy p 0 20 allen et al 1998 these soil hydraulic parameters for individual locations can be derived from the soil textural information sand silt clay and bulk density using the rosetta model 2 5 model performance evaluation measures the performance of all the models was evaluated using the widely used measures of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse the acceptance criteria of the model performance indicators were set as nse 0 5 r2 0 6 and pbias 15 3 drought assessment approaches 3 1 standardized soil moisture index ssi the severity of moisture stress is an explicit function of the available soil water content which can be assessed by the standardized soil moisture index ssi for characterizing the agricultural drought the ssi estimates the deviation of the current soil moisture from its long term historical mean value to obtain the ssi time series the bounded a b continuous beta probability distribution with two shape parameters α β can be fitted to the derived soil moisture flux time series note that the beta frequency distribution can model a wide range of shapes than other existing parametric gumbel and normal and non parametric weibull distributions for fitting volumetric soil moisture time series sheffield et al 2004 the probability density function of the two parameter beta distribution is given by 22 f θ θ a α 1 b θ α β 1 b b a α 1 α θ β where θ is the volumetric moisture content cm3 cm3 b is the beta function and the parameters a and b correspond to the lower and upper bounds of soil moisture content signifying the effect of climatic factors and soil porosity respectively the parameters a b α and β in eq 22 can be estimated for each spatial grid based soil moisture estimates generated by the vic swat and esa cci satellite products to determine the shape parameters α and β the bounds a and b are first estimated from the sorted soil moisture time series estimates the first μ 1 and second μ 2 moments of the beta distribution can be equated with the l moments based sample estimators of mean θ and variance σ 2 as 23 μ 1 α α β θ 24 μ 2 α α 1 α β α β 1 σ 2 solving eqs 23 and 24 yields 25 α θ θ 1 θ σ 2 1 26 β 1 θ θ 1 θ σ 2 1 finally the ssi is estimated as the quantile q θ of a given soil moisture content θ given by 27 q θ θ a f θ d θ using eq 27 the ssi based drought severity q θ is assessed at monthly scale for each spatial grids of the selected study area considering the monthly averaged soil moistures generated from the daily scale simulations of the vic 3l swat and esa cci satellite soil moisture products 3 2 standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi as the precipitation measurement uncertainty is higher relative to other climatic variables the catchment scale drought assessment by the existing standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which is based on the difference between the precipitation and pet may not depict the true catchment condition gao et al 2010 moreover pet only represents the atmospheric water demand without accounting for the crop factors such as crop type growth stage root zone depth and soil water deficit to address this limitation while evaluating the utility of lsm derived etact estimates in catchment scale drought assessment and irrigation planning the sedi index conceptualization proposed by kim and rhee 2016 is used in this study the sedi index which is based on the difference between the etact and pet poses very good correlation with the popular palmer drought severity index pdsi meant for assessing the agricultural drought anderson et al 2011 in this approach the evapotranspiration deficit ed estimates are computed as the difference between the simulated daily etact and pet values by the swat and vic 3lmodels and the 8 daily mod16a2 products are transformed into monthly time series first the three parameter log logistic distribution is fitted to the individual ed estimate accumulated for a pre defined time scale followed by the estimation of z score the three shape scale and location parameters of the log logistic distribution are derived using the unbiased probability weighted moments subsequently the cumulative probability of ed is converted into the standardized metrics of sedi the computation of sedi from the ed time series for the last accumulated n months is given by 28 sedi n t φ 1 f i t n 1 t ed i where sedi n t corresponds to the sedi at monthly time step t accumulated over n months φ 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function f is the fitted cumulative density function of the three parameter log logistic distribution and ed i is the ed value at the i th monthly time step the characterization of the ssi and sedi derived drought severity values was accomplished using the five drought severity classes as recommended by mckee et al 1993 table 1 4 study area and pedo hydrologic database 4 1 study area the chosen study area is the 12 014 70 km2 kangsabati river catchment krc a paddy dominated catchment 48 paddy area of west bengal state in eastern india fig 2 with tropical monsoon type climatology the total catchment area is characterized by two distinct hydro geographic regions i e kangsabati river catchment 5735 22 km2 and kangsabati reservoir command 6729 48 km2 this catchment receives an average annual rainfall of 1348 mm year about 80 of which is confined to the monsoon season june october the catchment has a highly undulated topography with an elevation of 2 656 m above the mean sea level amsl sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils are the two predominant soil classes in krc being distributed mostly in the central part of the catchment since paddy is the major cultivated crop in the command area a significant amount of water is lost through et due to the higher average maximum temperature of 43 c during the summer the kangsabati reservoir 22 56 n 86 47 e is located at the confluence of the kangsabati and the kumari rivers which is being operational from the year 1965 the kangsabati reservoir project is meant for two major water management activities in the downstream i e flood control in the command area bounded between the reservoir and mohanpur outlet and the fulfillment of irrigation water demand during the stress phases of crop growing periods the krc command region is characterized by acute drought problems due to the highly erratic rainfall and insufficient inflow to the reservoir during the lean period 4 2 data acquisition and pre processing the daily scale 0 25 0 25 gridded weather data of precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures available 1980 2019 for 33 weather grids were procured from the india meteorological department imd pune and used as a substitute in the absence of long term observed meteorological data sheffield et al 2006 behera et al 2020 swain et al 2020 the daily observed streamflow and water level data at the mohanpur outlet for the period 1980 2019 was collected from the central water commission cwc asansol the kangsabati reservoir datasets pertaining to the surface area and storage volume up to the principal and emergency spillways and daily reservoir outflow for the period 1986 2019 were collected from the irrigation and water ways department iwwd government of west bengal the mod16a2 et product with the sinusoidal projection system was downloaded from http reverb echo nasa gov reverb website the raw mod16a2 product with the spatial resolution of 250 m and temporal resolution of 8 days was processed using the modis re projection tool mrt and modis swath re projection tool mrt swath for accurate geo referencing of the raw images and later re projected into wgs 1984 utm 45n projection system valid for the study region all the cloud contaminated pixels were masked out from the calculation as they alter the latent heat flux significantly sub setting and extraction of bulk amount of pixel values from the modis images were carried out through a matlab 2016a code developed by the authors finally the latent heat flux estimates of the selected five grid locations in the study area were extracted from the individual processed image file and were converted into 8 daily accumulated etact values mm 8 day the obtained gridded etact estimates were used to evaluate the capability of different lsms in simulating the catchment scale et generation as a water balance component due to the unavailability of daily scale desired observed meteorological data the benchmark fao 56 pm based etact were estimated only for the period 2001 2005 however the water balance and drought analysis carried out in this study were confined to the period 1980 2019 to estimate the soil moisture stress at a daily time scale in the paddy fields there is a need for continuous in situ soil moisture information in the selected study area since field observed daily scale soil moisture data is not available the 0 25 gridded soil moisture data products of the european space agency esa under the climate change initiative cci project was used as the benchmark in this study the esa cci sm v04 2 is a blended active and passive soil moisture product formed by the retrieved soil moisture information from ami and ascat scatterometers and four microwave radiometers ssm i tmi smmr and amsr e that provides soil moisture information up to 10 cm depth with reasonable accuracy https www esa soilmoisture cci org node 227 for the period 1979 2016 these soil moisture datasets available in the netcdf format were extracted using the ncdf4 r package these datasets were used to estimate the daily scale stress coefficient kms for etact estimation the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem was used to delineate the stream networks and basin boundary meant for the vic 3l and swat to prepare the lulc map of the krc two liss iii image tiles of the year 2008 were downloaded from http bhuvan nrsc gov in bhuvan links php the lulc map consisting of thirteen distinct lulc classes was prepared using the supervised classification in the erdas imagine 2014 software wherein the training samples were created based on the ground truth information fig 3 the lulc map was prepared at a spatial resolution of 24 m by considering the ground truth data for all the three major crop growing seasons of summer march may kharif june october and rabi november february moreover the prepared lulc map was validated with the nation scale lulc map 56 m resolution at 1 250000 scale as prepared by the national remote sensing centre nrsc hyderabad india before the model application the soil information of the krc was obtained from the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbsslup kolkata and harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 1 developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao un for two soil layers of depths 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm further the desired soil hydraulic information was processed in grid and mapping unit based formats for the input database of the swat and vic 3l model respectively the presence of flow regulation structures actively alters the downstream hydrologic behavior of the catchment hence conceptualization of such structures in the lsms is quite essential ali and sridhar 2019 the primary inputs for reservoir simulation in the swat model is described in table 2 which are updated in the swat model at the beginning of model set up moreover to simulate the downstream hydrology of the krc daily reservoir outflow time series for the period 1980 2019 was used the value of crop coefficient kc for the paddy crop was derived from the lysimeter study carried out in the experimental plots of agricultural and food engineering department indian institute of technology kharagpur for the three growing seasons i e kharif rabi and summer the lysimeters with the dimensions of 1 25 m length 1 25 m width 1 00 m depth were of two close bottom and four open bottom non weighing type lysimeters the volumetric water balance of all the six lysimeters was performed to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration etc further the division of etc by the et0 derived from fao 56 pm approach resulted in daily kc value and subsequently averaged over each paddy growing stage to estimate the seasonal kc values as illustrated in fig 4 4 3 model set up the vic 3l model was set up at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with 33 discrete grids covering the krc with the daily forcing inputs of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed and solar radiation to estimate the catchment scale hydrological fluxes of streamflow soil moisture baseflow and et based on the principle of water balance as there is no reservoir module available in the vic 3l model the vic 3l model setup was carried out individually for the upstream river catchment and the downstream reservoir catchment command the outlet of the upstream catchment is located at the inflow location of the kangsabati reservoir and the reservoir releases formed the upstream boundary condition of the downstream catchment command conversely the hru based swat model was set up using the same forcing inputs resulting in 44 sub basins and 191 hrus the add in reservoir module in swat simulates the hydropeaking effect on the downstream catchment command region the swat model has four options for defining the daily reservoir releases to the downstream catchments under uncontrolled scenario the user needs to define the average annual release rate or target release as a function of reservoir storage at the reservoir outlet which is far away from reality in the daily scale hydrological modeling studies conversely in controlled reservoir the swat has a provision to input the time series of daily or monthly reservoir outflow which is more realistic since the kangsabati reservoir under study is a highly managed reservoir the daily time series of reservoir outflow is available from the competent authority hence in this study the daily outflow based reservoir simulation option was chosen moreover since the streamflow time series available at the reservoir inflow location was used for swat calibration the inflow to the reservoir was simulated with high precision and subsequently the inflow outflow and water balance dynamics of the reservoir was maintained with utmost accuracy during the course of the study to envisage the inter annual variability of forcing inputs and their response towards different hydrological flux components as per the availability of daily scale streamflow data three years 1977 1979 of data was used for model spin up followed by twenty one years 1980 2000 of data for calibration and ten years 2001 2010 of data for validation the model calibration and validation were carried out at two locations namely the inflow location of the kangsabati reservoir and at mohanpur outlet attributing the hydropeaking effect caused by the kangsabati reservoir the sensitivity analysis of 7 and 10 model parameters of swat and vic 3l was carried out prior to the model calibration respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 performance of swat and vic 3l model in simulating water balance components during calibration and validation table 3 shows the hydraulic parameters for different types of soils in the study area as derived using the rosetta model the rank and calibrated values of the top 10 sensitive swat parameters are presented in table 4 similarly the calibrated vic 3l model parameters are given in table 5 the reproduction of observed daily streamflow by the swat and vic 3l models during both the monsoon and non monsoon periods is shown in the form of box and scatter plots figs 5 and 6 it can be envisaged from figs 5 and 6 and the performance evaluation error measures presented in table 6 that the swat performed the best in reproducing the observed daily reservoir inflow with the nse estimates of 0 64 0 79 for the upper and lower catchments whereas the corresponding performances by the vic 3l model was reasonably well with the nse estimate of 0 60 0 68 as compared to vic 3l swat mostly overestimated the low and medium flows the low streamflow estimates at the reservoir inflow location characterized by the 90 exceedance probability values were best reproduced by the swat with kge estimates of 0 57 as compared to kge 0 52 in case of vic 3l similarly at the mohanpur outlet location significant underestimation of low flows was exhibited by vic 3l whereas swat could best reproduce the low flows with kge estimates of 0 61 in terms of the pbias estimate both the models performed almost similarly with pbias 25 whereas the swat model showed better estimates in terms of r2 and rmse measures table 6 for swat the r2 and rmse estimates ranged from 0 66 to 0 79 and 75 20 111 26 m3 s respectively which were 0 67 0 71 and 80 17 120 65 m3 s for the vic 3l model respectively from the flow duration curve fdc analysis presented in fig 7 it can be envisaged that there was significant underestimation and overestimation of the simulated reservoir inflows by the swat and vic models for the observed threshold flows of 200 m3 s respectively conversely below the threshold value of 500 m3 s significant underestimations were observed at mohanpur outlet by both swat and vic 3l since the add in reservoir module in swat simulated the reservoir dynamics with utmost accuracy the swat could efficiently reproduce both the high and low flows in the command area located to the downstream of the kangsabati reservoir conversely absence of reservoir simulation module in the vic 3l resulted in considerable uncertainty in simulating the peak flows in the command region yielding poor estimation of the water balance components the resulting streamflow overestimation and underestimation in the paddy dominated reservoir catchment could be attributed to the incorrect quantification of various loss components of the paddy field water balance by both the models during the awd phase of paddy growth due to the lack of a detailed process description of the vadose zone dynamics under moisture stress conditions in swat there was an overestimated baseflow simulation however due to moisture stress the partitioning of precipitation for the baseflow should have been reduced moreover the vic model assumes et as a residual product of the catchment water balance which causes potential tuning of the et variable to produce improved streamflow but a more biased baseflow output fig 8 the command area of the krc receives reservoir releases as the concentrated upstream flow along with the overland runoff due to rainfall fig 8 illustrates the partitioning of rainfall into streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage components by swat and vic 3l at the five typical locations representing five sub basins in case of swat or five grids in case of vic 3l it can be envisaged from fig 8 that the swat estimated et loss as a percentage of rainfall was the highest 56 01 at jhargram sub basin no 40 and the lowest 46 72 at kharagpur sub basin no 42 whereas the corresponding rainfall to et transformation by the vic 3l was the highest 63 21 at mohanpur grid no 19 and the lowest 60 49 at purulia grid no 3 the highest et loss at mohanpur as simulated by the vic 3l could be attributed to the presence of dominant paddy land use with adequate soil water availability moreover the annual average baseflow contribution to the streamflow as estimated by the swat was in the range of 116 56 199 66 mm the highest contribution being observed at purulia sub basin no 6 similarly the corresponding baseflow contribution as estimated by the vic 3l model was in the range of 56 32 71 03 mm the highest being observed at kharagpur grid no 18 the mean standard deviation of the annual water balance component over the year 1980 2019 fig 8 such as precipitation streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage as simulated by vic 3l was in the range of 1547 93 134 32 mm year 426 54 36 54 mm year 962 02 92 77 mm year 63 99 5 04 mm year and 95 38 13 77 mm year respectively and the streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage components were 27 56 62 15 4 13 and 6 16 of the mean annual rainfall respectively conversely the swat estimated corresponding streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage components were 28 88 51 61 10 58 and 8 93 of the mean annual rainfall respectively the magnitude of vic 3l estimated average annual etact for the five selected typical grid locations were in the increased order purulia 819 26 mm year bankura 889 81 mm year jhargram 1003 91 mm year kharagpur 1029 77 mm year mohanpur 1067 34 mm year signifying the upstream river catchment to be more drought prone conversely the corresponding swat simulated etact was in the increasing order purulia 706 44 mm year bankura 761 44 mm year kharagpur 781 87 mm year mohanpur 848 88 mm year jhargram 894 68 mm year moreover the swat simulated baseflow magnitude of 138 22 26 63 mm year at the five intensive irrigated locations seems more reasonable than that of the vic 3l simulated baseflow estimate of 95 38 13 77 mm year 5 2 evaluation of vic 3l swat and esa cci derived soil moisture products the soil moisture estimates from the calibrated set up of swat and vic 3l were analyzed to study their spatiotemporal variation in the krc the simulated soil moisture estimates from the respective five grids in case of vic 3l and five sub basins in case of swat were extracted and subsequently their dynamics were analyzed during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons across all the five locations both the swat and vic 3l derived soil moisture products represented the incidences of moisture stress and moisture surplus phases reasonably well although there was sizeable disagreement in terms of the magnitude of soil water contents considering the esa cci derived soil moisture product as the benchmark fig 9 the degree of this disagreement was gradually intensified from the upstream rainfed non irrigated areas to the downstream irrigated command area in the krc over the years 1980 2019 the simulated mean seasonal soil moisture estimates by the benchmark esa cci product were 0 15 0 26 and 0 21 m3 m3 during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively which were worse reproduced by the vic 3l model as 0 09 0 20 and 0 14 m3 m3 respectively and better reproduced by the swat as 0 11 0 27 and 0 18 m3 m3 respectively the capability of swat to account for the management practices being followed in the command area could have improved the contribution of excess irrigation water to the soil moisture regimes the considerable underestimation in the soil water content by the vic 3l with reference to the esa cci product could be attributed to the absence of moisture stress accountability conceptualization resulting in erroneous partitioning of water balance components as discussed in section 2 1 as envisaged from fig 9 the seasonal variation of esa cci soil moisture products in the krc exhibited a dynamic spatial distribution pattern wherein the north eastern side command area remains more moisture deficient than the upper catchment overall the average pre monsoon season esa cci derived soil moisture estimates of 0 16 0 18 and 0 14 m3 m3 across the upstream river catchment left bank command lbc and right bank command rbc areas respectively revealed that the rbc is more drought prone resulting in severe moisture stress during the crop growing periods moreover the low average esa cci soil moisture content of 0 23 m3 m3 during the monsoon season revealed that moisture stress condition also prevailed in the rbc during this season due to the intermittent rainfall pattern as shown in fig 10 the degree of correlation between the intermittent rainfall variation and seasonal soil moisture content was reduced in the order of esa cci swat vic 3l resulting in significant underestimation of soil moisture in the case of vic 3l fig 11 illustrates the seasonal variation of soil moisture stress coefficient kms in the krc as derived from the esa cci soil moisture product averaged over 1980 2019 it can be elucidated from fig 11 that the moisture stress periods were more prevalent during the mid december to end february characterized by an average kms value of 0 34 the spatial variation of kms at the five typical study sites was estimated in the increasing order of purulia jhargram bankura kharagpur mohanpur signifying acute moisture stress condition in the command region attributed to higher etact loss conversely relatively stable moisture stress condition of purulia sub basin could be attributed to the presence of dominant clay soil texture which improves the water holding capacity of the soil substantially 5 3 evaluation of vic 3l swat and mod16a2 derived etact products figs 12 and 13 illustrate the spatiotemporal inter comparison of 8 daily etact estimates by the swat vic 3l and mod16a2 during the two crop growing seasons rabi and kharif of 2001 2005 considering the fao 56 pm with moisture stress eq 20 as the benchmark in the selected study area the average rabi season etact estimates in mm year by the swat vic 3l mod16a2 and fao 56 pm were obtained as 253 32 292 65 181 96 and 227 68 mm year respectively whereas the corresponding estimates for the kharif season were 498 06 591 72 483 34 and 476 78 mm year respectively the heat map plot shown in fig 14 revealed that the swat and mod16a2 derived etact estimates captured the dynamics of the fao 56 pm benchmark etact better in the kharif season with the nse estimates of 0 96 to 0 51 and 3 47 to 0 66 respectively however the vic 3l model performed poorly in simulating the 8 daily etact during both the crop growing seasons as evidenced from the nse ranges of 12 32 to 1 02 and 41 24 to 0 77 during the kharif and rabi seasons respectively depicting significant overestimation of etact in the paddy dominated locations as envisaged from fig 14 the degree of disagreement between the fao 56 pm benchmark and vic 3l simulated etact gradually increased from the upstream rain fed region to the downstream command region with relatively poor performance during the rabi season the error statistics of 8 daily etact simulation is reckoned using the measures of pbias and rmse as presented in the violin plots fig 15 note that violin plot is a blend of box plot and rotated density plot in which the white dot in the middle represents the median value the thick black bars represent the interquartile range and the extended black lines correspond to the adjacent upper and lower values it can be surmised from fig 15 that the vic 3l continuously overestimated the benchmark etact during both the crop growing seasons with the rmse and pbias estimates of 8 53 22 94 mm 8 day and 25 87 to 338 40 respectively with higher deviations during the rabi season conversely mod16a2 and swat based etact estimates depicted the command area dynamics reasonably well with the relatively lower rmse estimates of 1 94 9 35 mm 8 day for swat and 2 54 14 95 mm 8 day for mod16a2 respectively and the pbias estimates of 26 10 to 43 21 for swat and 56 8 to 44 1 for mod16a2 respectively in the rainfed paddy fields located in purulia and bankura the mod16a2 performed better than the swat with the improved rmse estimates of 2 54 8 15 mm 8 day whereas in the paddy fields located in mohanpur command region swat outperformed the mod16a2 with an improved rmse estimate of 1 94 9 35 mm 8 day during both the crop growing seasons fig 15 from figs 9 and 11 it can be envisaged that the moisture stress condition in the study area is more prevalent during the pre monsoon season due to the conventional water management practices with several drying phases as illustrated in figs 12 and 13 for reproducing the benchmark etact both the swat and vic 3l have gradually reduced spatial accuracy from the rainfed paddy land uses of purulia to awd irrigated command areas of kharagpur and mohanpur which may be attributed to the absence of moisture stress conceptualization in these model frameworks conversely the mod16a2 product performed very well spatially depicting the enhanced efficiency of this remote sensing based approach in segregating the wet and dry moisture spells in the paddy fields hence the satisfactory performance of mod16a2 and swat based etact during the kharif season in reproducing the fao 56 pm based benchmark etact signifies that these et products could be reliable under low to moderate moisture stress conditions whereas the vic 3l performed poorly the temporal variation of 8 daily etact time series figs 12 and 13 at the extreme upstream purulia and downstream mohanpur locations in the krc implied that during the wet spells of monsoon rainfall certain abrupt spikes in the mod16a2 etact product were present that resulted in reduced efficiency with the nse estimates of 3 47 2 23 and 1 88 during the year 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively this anomaly may be attributed to the presence of cloud covers in the modis image the poor performance of vic 3l for etact estimation under moisture stress condition may be attributed to i non representation of the vic model grid by 100 paddy land use thereby affecting the et estimates because of the presence of multiple land uses and ii absence of moisture stress factor in the vic 3l for et estimation resulting in overestimation of etact therefore to use the vic et product it has to be standardized with reference to the moisture stress factor based fao 56 pm equation moreover the swat etact estimates for irrigated paddy fields are not reliable due to the lack of awd conceptualization in the swat which is inherent in the paddy fields during acute moisture stress periods conversely the mod16a2 et product could be a reasonable estimate of catchment scale etact provided it is not contaminated with the cloud cover 5 4 implications of swat and vic derived et and soil moisture products in drought assessment and irrigation planning since the gridded mod16a2 and esa cci products represent the spatiotemporal variability of etact and soil moisture estimates covering the whole catchment these were used to derive the reference ssi and sedi drought indices respectively table 7 presents the numbers of severe and extreme drought months at the five typical study locations as estimated by the ssi and sedi indices derived using the simulated soil moisture and etact estimates of swat vic 3l and mod16a2 et esa cci sm it can be envisaged from table 7 that the ssi corresponded to more severe agricultural drought than that of the sedi as confirmed from the increased count of drought months the drought propagation across the krc revealed that jhargram is the most drought prone location with 11 6 and 22 numbers of extreme drought months as estimated by esa cci swat and vic 3l derived soil moisture products respectively followed by kharagpur mohanpur purulia and bankura fig 16 illustrates the ssi based monthly scale drought indices as derived from esa cci swat and vic 3l soil moisture products from fig 16 it can be surmised that purulia being a rainfed location experienced more frequent drought characteristics with the maximum drought severity of 2 4 during the year 1997 whereas bankura showed the least severe drought hazard with more persistent wet spells the swat derived ssi estimates corresponded to a similar degree of drought severity as that of the esa cci the highest similarity being observed at the command area location of kharagpur however a significant variation in the spatiotemporal drought pattern at the individual location was perceived the frequent irrigation application in the command areas of kharagpur and mohanpur resulted in a substantial increase in the wet spells during the concerned period since the upstream locations to the reservoir are rainfed in nature the onset and termination of drought events showed a prompt response whereas in the command areas of mohanpur and kharagpur a delayed response was noticed due to an underestimation of grid scale soil moisture by the vic 3l fig 9 the total number of extreme and severe monthly drought events table 7 were the highest i e 19 4 with the individual drought severity estimates of 2 35 and 1 67 respectively the corresponding computed severity in the case of swat were 2 02 and 1 70 and in the case of and esa cci were 2 21 and 1 69 benchmark respectively fig 16 the computed esa cci derived ssi based drought severity in decreasing order for the typical study sites were jhargram purulia mohanpur kharagpur bankura with the high severity values being concentrated during the years 1984 1992 1996 2015 2018 and 2019 moreover the numbers of moderate drought events were the highest in the case of esa cci followed by swat and vic 3l which were more prevalent in the rainfed regions of purulia overall the ssi based drought indices derived from the esa cci and swat sm products showed almost similar drought severity patterns whereas the vic 3l based agricultural drought severity and duration were overestimated and underestimated with reference to the esa cci respectively similarly from table 7 it can be seen that the swat based sedi index assessed similar numbers of drought months as that of mod16a2 benchmark while the vic 3l predicted higher number of drought months except at the command area locations of kharagpur and mohanpur while using the mod16a2 swat and vic 3l derived et estimates the sedi based drought severity decreased to 1 79 1 56 and 1 23 as compared to the corresponding ssi based drought severity respectively this shows that although esa cci and swat models explained the sedi based drought severity similarly the vic 3l model significantly underestimated the drought severity which is just opposite to the ssi based estimates from fig 17 it can be surmised that the drought severity estimated by swat at the five study locations was reduced in the order kharagpur mohanpur bankura jhargram purulia whereas for the vic 3l the corresponding order was purulia bankura mohanpur kharagpur jhargram as envisaged from the swat simulations the higher water requirement by paddy crop in the command regions of kharagpur and mohanpur increased the evapotranspiration deficit etd resulting in increased drought hazard at the kharagpur and mohanpur locations conversely lack of paddy field dynamics conceptualization in the vic 3l resulted non accountability of irrigation water application in the vadose zone soil moisture regime of vic 3l resulted in purulia upstream rainfed location to be highly drought prone than the command area apparently considerable amount of etact overestimation in the vic 3l resulted in reduced etd in the command regions of krc yielding less intense transformation of soil moisture drought into agricultural drought the representation of almost no drought condition in the krc by the vic 3l derived sedi estimates may need a revision in the etact estimation framework of vic 3l however as per the benchmark mod16a2 derived sedi estimates the drought severity decreased from the command area to the upstream rainfed area as mohanpur kharagpur bankura jhargram purulia this revealed that in the rainfed locations the reference onset and termination of drought showed a delayed response whereas swat and vic 3l predicted these responses to be prompt at all the locations there exists a direct correlation between the swat and vic 3l simulated etact and ep however a considerable difference in their magnitudes was observed due to the inherent correlation between the etact and ep the swat and vic 3l estimated etd remains quite similar for a typical location this resulted in a minimum difference in the swat and vic 3l derived sedi drought severity magnitudes although considerable difference was experienced in terms of drought extent as shown in fig 17 this considerable discrepancy between the mod16a2 and swat vic 3l derived agricultural drought severity and duration may be attributed to the lack of exclusive paddy field dynamics in both these lsms resulting in improper quantification of irrigation requirements in the typical paddy growing locations hence the lsm estimated drought duration have greater implications on planning the irrigation scheduling in a typical command area which necessitates for the appropriate selection of lsm for this purpose overall the imprecise estimation of the agricultural drought indices by the lsms would result in erroneous assessment of irrigation water demand in the catchment 6 conclusions for catchment scale drought assessment and irrigation planning reliable estimation of etact under data sparse conditions is one of the major issues therefore in this study the mod16a2 swat and vic 3l based indirect et estimation methods were evaluated with reference to the moisture stress coefficient based fao 56 pm method in a paddy dominated integrated reservoir catchment command under awd scenario based on the obtained results the following conclusions could be drawn 1 from the derived water balance components by the swat and vic 3l model in the study area it is clear that the vic 3l significantly overestimates the grid scale actual evapotranspiration and underestimates the soil moisture storage components whereas the corresponding swat estimates are almost reliable therefore considering the ssi and sedi indices the vic 3l model may not be useful for estimating both the severity and duration of agricultural drought with utmost accuracy conversely swat could estimate the agricultural drought with reasonable accuracy 2 the calibration and validation results revealed that swat model could best reproduce the observed daily streamflow in the selected catchment with utmost accuracy nse 0 7 than that of the vic 3l nse 0 60 therefore swat model may be more useful for assessing the hydrological drought than the vic 3l 3 the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture stress coefficient revealed that during mid november to end february rabi season the command area of the selected catchment is subjected to severe water stress due to frequent alternate wetting and drying conditions where the swat and vic 3l model failed to assess the agricultural drought this is attributed to the unavailability of soil moisture stress factor in these models for estimating the actual evapotranspiration 4 although a few 8 daily mod16a2 et products could be spurious due to cloud contamination this may be more reliable for estimating the drought severity its extent and the corresponding irrigation water requirement in the command area during both the kharif and rabi seasons vic 3l overestimated the ssi based drought extent in the entire krc and underestimated the sedi based drought extent in the rainfed locations of purulia and bankura with almost no drought condition in the command areas adding more uncertainty in agricultural drought assessment conversely during both the kharif and rabi seasons swat consistently predicted the drought extent reasonably closer to that derived from the mod16a2 and esa cci sm products this underlines the scope of accounting for the moisture stress factor in the et modules of vic 3l and swat under the awd scenario therefore under such contrasting model realizations the vic 3l derived etact estimates with proper standardization may be adopted for macro scale water resources planning in scantily gauged catchments although swat as an agro hydrological model satisfactorily reproduced the etact dynamics of paddy fields in the kharif season substantial modification to its et algorithm may enhance its performance further during the rabi season under awd scenario since inferences are drawn based on this typical study the advocated approach could be replicated in other agricultural catchments worldwide under varying climate and land use conditions for more generality

5015,catchment scale assessment of evapotranspiration et becomes indispensable for evaluating agricultural drought hazard and irrigation water management as direct estimation of et is quite intricate under sparse data availability scenarios the recent indirect et estimation approaches heavily depend on the water balance based et estimates from the popular land surface models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic 3l model or the mod16a2 satellite product along with the land uses the irrigation application methods of alternate wetting and drying awd could also influence the actual et etact estimates this study evaluates the usability of these indirect et estimation methods with reference to the moisture stress specific fao 56 penman monteith pm equation for catchment scale drought and irrigation planning in a real paddy dominated integrated reservoir catchment command the results reveal that the swat derived et in the non irrigated paddy fields was consistent with the fao 56 pm based et estimates during two crop growing seasons however significant overestimation was observed by the vic 3l and mod16a2 products showed a relatively better estimate the swat and vic 3l derived standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized evapotranspiration drought index sedi for the study area revealed that the vic 3l based drought severity was continuously overestimated or underestimated whereas the swat derived sedi indices were almost consistent with the benchmark mod16a2 et and esa cci soil moisture derived estimates finally this study endorses to use these indirect catchment scale drought assessment tools with caution with a need to revise the existing et subroutines in these hydrological models to deal with the crop dynamics and water management options realistically keywords drought evapotranspiration irrigation soil moisture stress swat vic 3l 1 introduction evapotranspiration et that can be estimated from the complex surface energy balance equations plays a decisive role in various water resources management activities including irrigation water requirement irrigation scheduling vegetation atmosphere interactions and terrestrial ecosystem productivity over a range of spatial and temporal domains nemani et al 2002 however the reliable estimation of et in an integrated reservoir catchment command characterized by complex vegetation atmosphere interactions is constrained due to limited data availability and lack of expertise in conceptualizing the real field scenario xu and singh 2005 on the basis of input data availability and associated degree of uncertainty three broad categories of et estimation techniques are documented in the literature sahoo et al 2012 i black box approach the simplest one which is based on the linear or non linear association between various predictor variables e g rainfall temperature and solar radiation ii semi physically based that deals with either energy or mass conservation george et al 2002 and iii physically based that considers both energy and mass conservation in their modelling framework pandey and pandey 2016 as per the recommendation of the international commission of irrigation and drainage icid and food and agriculture organization fao the physically based fao 56 penman monteith pm allen et al 1989 is globally adopted as the standard method for estimation and evaluation of et0 however in many developing countries worldwide the limited availability of meteorological inputs namely rainfall air temperature wind speed relative humidity solar radiation and plant physiological parameter like leaf area index lai at required spatiotemporal scales lead to erroneous et estimation further the conventional et measurement approaches like the flux tower eddy covariance system baldocchi 2003 bowen ratio method peacock and hess 2004 and lysimeter are less generalized due to the involved cost and handling expertise recently the remote sensing based et estimation approaches have gained considerable attention over the existing conventional approaches and are suitable for both field scale bastiaanssen et al 2005 and regional scale applications trezza 2002 srivastava et al 2017 several remote sensing based et estimation approaches those estimate sensible heat flux in a smaller spatial domain include the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a 2007b and surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal allen et al 2011 the applicability of these ground based observations is limited to cloudy sky and ephemeral snow cover conditions which lead to increased uncertainty in catchment scale applications sahoo et al 2020b the introduction of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite that on boards the aqua and terra sensors provided continuous et estimates at 250 m spatial and 8 days temporal resolutions mu et al 2007 yuan et al 2010 with an aim for improved irrigation scheduling at 8 daily time scale in congruence with the general water stress sensitive period for major crops the global scale evaluation of mod16a2 et product evidenced its improved performance in forest regions and poor performance in polar and arid regions kim et al 2012 causing significant underestimation of the eddy covariance based flux tower based et estimates thereby demands the evaluation of mod16a2 product over varying lulc and climatic conditions before its field application autovino et al 2016 the paddy cultivation practice in many tropical monsoon climatic regions is characterized by two basic water application methods surface flooding and water efficient alternate wetting and drying awd technique the quantity of water application is subjected to varying soil moisture stress conditions during different crop growth phases as quantified in the form of moisture stress coefficient kms in this context the crop coefficient kc based actual et etact differs significantly from that of the kms based approach in different popular land surface models lsms such as the soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic et is estimated based on the concept of total plant water availability moreover the diversified modeling framework of lsms with the provision of simplified water balance approach to physically based surface water and vadose zone dynamics have the potential to be applied for regional et estimation under data sparse scenarios this leads to more popularity of the lsms for et estimation over the conventional field measurement and remote sensing based techniques the application of several popular lsms for et modeling include i vic model liang et al 1994 which considers the sub grid scale variability in soil moisture vegetation and forcing parameters for et estimation ii swat arnold et al 1998 nguyen et al 2018 sahoo and sahoo 2020 that conceptualizes the physiology of crop variety management operation practiced and layer wise soil moisture variation across different hydrologic response units hrus and iii mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 which estimates grid scale et based on the derived coefficients of c1 for transpiration loss c2 for canopy evaporation loss cint for interception loss lai soil moisture content in the root zone and root distribution function rdf however in vic 3l and mike she the absence of crop growth module and crop management practice simulation options make the etact estimates less trustworthy for catchment scale application conversely the public domain swat hydrological framework can be applied in multi crop growing regions considering crop growth stage specific management options dash et al 2018 2019 a study conducted in arid and semi arid regions reveals that swat derived monthly etact overestimated the mod16a2 based etact by 3 20 uniyal et al 2019 and the uncertainty may increase further at finer temporal resolutions chun et al 2018 however the performance of the above mentioned lsms in estimating the etact during alternate moisture stress periods of crop growth is yet to be evaluated the catchment scale heterogeneity in soil properties and varying soil depth along with the scarce point scale in situ observations make the spatiotemporal estimation of soil moisture quite intricate in this context different satellite datasets such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 european space agency under the climate change initiative esa cci wagner et al 1999 soil moisture active and passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and lsm based indirect soil moisture retrieval are getting the global attention sridhar et al 2006 al shrafany et al 2014 however the involved uncertainties in the satellite soil moisture products due to the presence of cloud cover limitations in the cloud masking spectral algorithms and both model and input data uncertainty in the lsms lead to less trustworthy soil moisture estimates which adversely affect the catchment scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning moreover under highly erratic rainfall and awd scenario based intermittent irrigation the agrarian catchments exhibit a complicated vadose zone soil moisture dynamics which may not be replicated accurately by the existing soil moisture retrieval approaches till date no past studies have evaluated the performance of the satellite and lsm based products under such complex awd vadose zone dynamics scenario for catchment scale drought monitoring and subsequent irrigation planning quantification of crop water requirement and plant water availability are of utmost importance gu et al 2020a globally lsm based hydrological modelling is mostly used by the policy makers and water managers to assess catchment scale drought funk et al 2015 svoboda and fuchs 2016 kang and sridhar 2018 mishra et al 2018 sehgal and venkataramana 2019 gu et al 2020b the accuracy of the soil moisture and etact estimates by these lsms are influenced by the model conceptualization to mimic the existing hydrological process data availability and spatiotemporal scale of application sridhar et al 2013 therefore the bias associated with these lsm based water balance components could result in uncertain drought assessment indices and subsequent irrigation planning at the catchment scale sahoo et al 2020a dash et al 2020 moreover in paddy dominated catchment reservoir command areas with the conventional pondage or advanced awd irrigation practice as considered in this study the uncertainty could be significant in light of the above discussion the specific research gaps pertaining to paddy dominated catchment scale etact estimation under moisture stress condition are summarized as follows i the spatiotemporal variation of catchment scale soil moisture under awd condition using the satellite and lsm based indirect approaches is yet to be evaluated ii no past studies have quantified the daily scale soil moisture stress in a paddy dominant catchment iii no attempt has been made in the literature to estimate the bias in the etact estimates due to non consideration of soil moisture stress in the popular lsms and iv no study assesses the effect of associated bias with the lsm derived etact and available soil moisture estimates on the drought severity indices for catchment scale irrigation planning therefore this study is attempted to address the following research questions i does the incorporation of soil moisture stress condition in the et modeling framework represent the true catchment scale water balance ii how accurately does the mo16a2 product represent the moisture stressed et condition in a paddy dominated catchment and iii what are the implications of using the swat and vic 3l derived soil moisture and etact estimates for catchment scale agricultural drought analysis and irrigation planning the specific objectives of this study are i to quantify the moisture stress condition in a paddy dominated catchment at a daily time scale using the satellite derived european space agency under the climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture product ii to estimate the catchment scale etact using the swat and vic 3l hydrological models and mod16a2 products under awd condition iii to evaluate the selected lsms and mod16a2 etact products in reproducing the 8 daily fao 56 pm derived etact so as to assess their implications on catchment scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning the manuscript has been organized as follows in sections 2 4 the frameworks of etact estimation by different lsms are described followed by the analysis of water balance in the paddy dominated typical study locations the usability of lsm and satellite based soil moisture and etact estimates in catchment scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning are discussed in section 5 conclusively section 6 briefs the overview of this study and its applicability for real world water resources management 2 et modeling frameworks 2 1 et modeling framework in vic 3l the vic 3l is a physically based semi distributed catchment scale model that conceptualizes both energy and mass balance principles to estimate the grid scale etact using the water balance of different hydrological flux components the vic 3l computes the total etact loss under three major heads i e canopy layer evaporation ec transpiration loss from individual vegetation class et and evaporation from the bare soil surface es as liang et al 1994 1 et act i 1 n c i e c i e t i c n 1 e s where c i is the fractional vegetation coverage of the i th vegetation class in a grid c n 1 is the bare soil fraction in a grid and i is the land use identification code the water evaporated from the plant canopy is regarded as the canopy evaporation and the grid scale canopy evaporation in vic 3l is estimated as 2 e c p i p im 2 3 et 0 a w a w a 0 where p i is the water intercepted by the plant canopy mm day p im is the maximum canopy interception mm day et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day a w is the aerodynamic resistance s m and a 0 is the grid specific architectural resistance s m further the plant transpiration in vic 3l is given by blondin 1991 3 e t 1 p i p im 2 3 et 0 a w a w a 0 a c where a c is the plant canopy resistance s m under unsaturated condition of the top soil layer the soil evaporation process is initiated and continued till the soil reaches saturation phase in vic 3l the bare soil evaporation is estimated by using the sub grid scale distribution of the infiltration capacity as described in the arno model conceptualization franchini and pacciani 1991 4 e s e p f s 0 d f f s 1 i 0 i m 1 1 f 1 b

θs is the porosity of soil and d is the soil depth mm 2 2 et modeling framework in swat swat uses the water balance approach to compute the et as a residual model derivative neitsch et al 2011 7 s w t

the soil profile on the ith day mm day and q gw is the amount of return flow on the ith day mm day initially swat computes the pet using three basic approaches namely penman monteith equation monteith 1965 under data abundant condition hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1982 under limited data availability scenario and priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 under low advective condition of humid regions after computation of the pet swat estimates etact as the sum of the portioned components canopy evaporation e c soil layer evaporation e s and maximum plant transpiration e t as estimated by ritchie 1972 in heavy snowfall regions first sublimation occurs and after the melting of snow soil evaporation takes place the rainfall is intercepted by the crop canopy and is lost in the form of canopy evaporation e c as 8 e c e p i f e p e c p i n t i f e p e c where pint is the canopy intercepted rainfall mm day after the canopy evaporation the remaining evaporative demand is compensated from vegetation and soil as 9 e p e p e c where e p is the adjusted potential evapotranspiration for canopy water mm day the plant transpiration e t is computed as a function of the lai as neitsch et al 2011 10 e t e p l a i 3 i f 0 l a i 3 e p i f l a i 3 note that the actual transpiration may vary depending upon the water availability in the soil profile the maximum daily soil evaporation e s is computed as 11 e s e p s cov e x p 5 0 10 5 b m where s cov is the soil cover fraction describing the biomass extent present in the hru bm is the crop residue and above ground biomass kg ha obtained from the crop database of swat 2012 the net soil evaporation demand e s z for any soil layer of depth z is computed as 12 e s z e s z z e x p 2 374 0 00713 z where z is the depth of the soil layer below the ground surface mm in eq 12 the coefficients are assigned so as to meet 50 and 95 of the total evaporative demands from the top 10 and 100 mm of soil layers respectively moreover during dry condition swat allows maximum 80 depletion of plant available water in the form of evaporation loss wherein the plant available water is defined as the difference between the available water content and wilting point 1 5 mpa water content of the soil layer the amount of water removed from the soil layer through evaporation can be computed as 13 e s l y 0 8 sw ly wp ly where e s l y is the amount of water removed from the soil layer ly through evaporation mm day sw ly is the soil water content of this layer mm and wp ly is the wilting point moisture content of this layer mm note that although the validity of the fao 56 pm approach is higher for sub daily applications swat can obtain reliable estimates of daily etact using the mean daily weather parameters by accounting for the resulting uncertainty due to diurnal distributions of wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation which are generally not replicated by the mean daily values 2 3 modis based mod16a2 et algorithm the conventional remote sensing based regional et estimation approaches are confined to the energy balance method and explicit characterization of physically based parameters these input parameters are derived from simplified thermal remote sensing products such as land surface temperature lst which perform poorly during night time and cloudy sky conditions to overcome these limitations since the year 2000 1 km gridded modis global et estimates are available at 8 daily monthly and yearly temporal resolutions mu et al 2013 modis terrestrial et budgeting is characterized by the evaporation from dry and wet soil layers evaporation of canopy intercepted water transpiration from plant leaves and stems by using the penman monteith equation mu et al 2007 the existing modis et algorithm has been improved further to address with i simplified estimation of vegetation cover fraction fc ii separate computation of et during both day and night times iii computation of soil heat flux by distributing the incoming radiation with respect to fc and iv improved estimation of stomatal conductance aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance this improved approach is popularly known as the mod16a2 algorithm mu et al 2011 given by 14 et act a e d e z 0 d t ρ c p e z 0 e z r a λ d e z 0 d t γ 1 r s r a e p where a e is the partitioned energy between sensible heat latent heat and soil heat fluxes on the land surface mj m2 day d e z 0 d t is the slope of saturation vapor pressure vs temperature curve ρ is the density of air kg m3 c p is the

transpiration on the land surface s m and γ is psychrometric constant given by 15 γ c p m d p a λ m w where p a is the atmospheric pressure and m d and m w are the molecular masses of dry and moist air respectively a detailed description of the mod16a2 et estimation algorithm is illustrated in fig 1 the mod16a2 product provides both actual and potential evapotranspiration estimates on the land surface and is useful for determining the agricultural drought intensity and regional water stress given by 16 et act e wc e s e t 17 et p e wc e pt e ws e ps where e wc is the evaporation from wet canopy mm day e pt is potential plant transpiration mm day e ws is the evaporation from wet soil fraction mm day and e ps is the potential soil evaporation mm day 2 4 etact estimation by fao 56 penman monteith pm approach under moisture stress condition the fao 56 penman monteith pm approach is regarded as the fully physically based approach for estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration as allen et al 1998 18 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e z 0 e z δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the reference plant evapotranspiration mm day δ is the slope of saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c g is the soil heat flux mj m2 day u 2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s e z 0 is the saturation vapor pressure at height z from the ground surface kpa and e z is the actual vapor pressure at height z from the ground surface kpa subsequently under zero moisture stress condition et act is estimated by multiplying the growth stage specific kc with the previously estimated et 0 given as 19 et act k c et 0 however under moisture stress condition which is experienced in real fields with awd phenomenon the approaches mentioned in sections 2 1 and 2 2 could overestimate the etact therefore in this section a revised etact estimation approach is advocated to deal with the awd field condition since the conventional tropical paddy cultivation practice consumes excess irrigation water many of the recent irrigation practices prescribe for the awd technique to reduce irrigation water consumption in which intermittent soil moisture condition is allowed to exist throughout the crop base period in this practice etact can be estimated as 20 et act k ms k c et 0 where k ms soil moisture stress coefficient which is a function of soil water deficit in the root zone the value of k ms can be estimated using the fao 56 approach as given by lyra et al 2016 21 k ms θ s θ r θ fc θ i θ s θ r 1 p where θ s is the saturation moisture content cm3 cm3 θ r is the residual moisture content cm3 cm3 θ fc is the field capacity moisture content cm3 cm3 θ i is the actual moisture content cm3 cm3 p is a crop specific parameter called as depletion fraction and for paddy p 0 20 allen et al 1998 these soil hydraulic parameters for individual locations can be derived from the soil textural information sand silt clay and bulk density using the rosetta model 2 5 model performance evaluation measures the performance of all the models was evaluated using the widely used measures of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse the acceptance criteria of the model performance indicators were set as nse 0 5 r2 0 6 and pbias 15 3 drought assessment approaches 3 1 standardized soil moisture index ssi the severity of moisture stress is an explicit function of the available soil water content which can be assessed by the standardized soil moisture index ssi for characterizing the agricultural drought the ssi estimates the deviation of the current soil moisture from its long term historical mean value to obtain the ssi time series the bounded a b continuous beta probability distribution with two shape parameters α β can be fitted to the derived soil moisture flux time series note that the beta frequency distribution can model a wide range of shapes than other existing parametric gumbel and normal and non parametric weibull distributions for fitting volumetric soil moisture time series sheffield et al 2004 the probability density function of the two parameter beta distribution is given by 22 f θ θ a α 1 b θ α β 1 b b a α 1 α θ β where θ is the volumetric moisture content cm3 cm3 b is the beta function and the parameters a and b correspond to the lower and upper bounds of soil moisture content signifying the effect of climatic factors and soil porosity respectively the parameters a b α and β in eq 22 can be estimated for each spatial grid based soil moisture estimates generated by the vic swat and esa cci satellite products to determine the shape parameters α and β the bounds a and b are first estimated from the sorted soil moisture time series estimates the first μ 1 and second μ 2 moments of the beta distribution can be equated with the l moments based sample estimators of mean θ and variance σ 2 as 23 μ 1 α α β θ 24 μ 2 α α 1 α β α β 1 σ 2 solving eqs 23 and 24 yields 25 α θ θ 1 θ σ 2 1 26 β 1 θ θ 1 θ σ 2 1 finally the ssi is estimated as the quantile q θ of a given soil moisture content θ given by 27 q θ θ a f θ d θ using eq 27 the ssi based drought severity q θ is assessed at monthly scale for each spatial grids of the selected study area considering the monthly averaged soil moistures generated from the daily scale simulations of the vic 3l swat and esa cci satellite soil moisture products 3 2 standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi as the precipitation measurement uncertainty is higher relative to other climatic variables the catchment scale drought assessment by the existing standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which is based on the difference between the precipitation and pet may not depict the true catchment condition gao et al 2010 moreover pet only represents the atmospheric water demand without accounting for the crop factors such as crop type growth stage root zone depth and soil water deficit to address this limitation while evaluating the utility of lsm derived etact estimates in catchment scale drought assessment and irrigation planning the sedi index conceptualization proposed by kim and rhee 2016 is used in this study the sedi index which is based on the difference between the etact and pet poses very good correlation with the popular palmer drought severity index pdsi meant for assessing the agricultural drought anderson et al 2011 in this approach the evapotranspiration deficit ed estimates are computed as the difference between the simulated daily etact and pet values by the swat and vic 3lmodels and the 8 daily mod16a2 products are transformed into monthly time series first the three parameter log logistic distribution is fitted to the individual ed estimate accumulated for a pre defined time scale followed by the estimation of z score the three shape scale and location parameters of the log logistic distribution are derived using the unbiased probability weighted moments subsequently the cumulative probability of ed is converted into the standardized metrics of sedi the computation of sedi from the ed time series for the last accumulated n months is given by 28 sedi n t φ 1 f i t n 1 t ed i where sedi n t corresponds to the sedi at monthly time step t accumulated over n months φ 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function f is the fitted cumulative density function of the three parameter log logistic distribution and ed i is the ed value at the i th monthly time step the characterization of the ssi and sedi derived drought severity values was accomplished using the five drought severity classes as recommended by mckee et al 1993 table 1 4 study area and pedo hydrologic database 4 1 study area the chosen study area is the 12 014 70 km2 kangsabati river catchment krc a paddy dominated catchment 48 paddy area of west bengal state in eastern india fig 2 with tropical monsoon type climatology the total catchment area is characterized by two distinct hydro geographic regions i e kangsabati river catchment 5735 22 km2 and kangsabati reservoir command 6729 48 km2 this catchment receives an average annual rainfall of 1348 mm year about 80 of which is confined to the monsoon season june october the catchment has a highly undulated topography with an elevation of 2 656 m above the mean sea level amsl sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils are the two predominant soil classes in krc being distributed mostly in the central part of the catchment since paddy is the major cultivated crop in the command area a significant amount of water is lost through et due to the higher average maximum temperature of 43 c during the summer the kangsabati reservoir 22 56 n 86 47 e is located at the confluence of the kangsabati and the kumari rivers which is being operational from the year 1965 the kangsabati reservoir project is meant for two major water management activities in the downstream i e flood control in the command area bounded between the reservoir and mohanpur outlet and the fulfillment of irrigation water demand during the stress phases of crop growing periods the krc command region is characterized by acute drought problems due to the highly erratic rainfall and insufficient inflow to the reservoir during the lean period 4 2 data acquisition and pre processing the daily scale 0 25 0 25 gridded weather data of precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures available 1980 2019 for 33 weather grids were procured from the india meteorological department imd pune and used as a substitute in the absence of long term observed meteorological data sheffield et al 2006 behera et al 2020 swain et al 2020 the daily observed streamflow and water level data at the mohanpur outlet for the period 1980 2019 was collected from the central water commission cwc asansol the kangsabati reservoir datasets pertaining to the surface area and storage volume up to the principal and emergency spillways and daily reservoir outflow for the period 1986 2019 were collected from the irrigation and water ways department iwwd government of west bengal the mod16a2 et product with the sinusoidal projection system was downloaded from http reverb echo nasa gov reverb website the raw mod16a2 product with the spatial resolution of 250 m and temporal resolution of 8 days was processed using the modis re projection tool mrt and modis swath re projection tool mrt swath for accurate geo referencing of the raw images and later re projected into wgs 1984 utm 45n projection system valid for the study region all the cloud contaminated pixels were masked out from the calculation as they alter the latent heat flux significantly sub setting and extraction of bulk amount of pixel values from the modis images were carried out through a matlab 2016a code developed by the authors finally the latent heat flux estimates of the selected five grid locations in the study area were extracted from the individual processed image file and were converted into 8 daily accumulated etact values mm 8 day the obtained gridded etact estimates were used to evaluate the capability of different lsms in simulating the catchment scale et generation as a water balance component due to the unavailability of daily scale desired observed meteorological data the benchmark fao 56 pm based etact were estimated only for the period 2001 2005 however the water balance and drought analysis carried out in this study were confined to the period 1980 2019 to estimate the soil moisture stress at a daily time scale in the paddy fields there is a need for continuous in situ soil moisture information in the selected study area since field observed daily scale soil moisture data is not available the 0 25 gridded soil moisture data products of the european space agency esa under the climate change initiative cci project was used as the benchmark in this study the esa cci sm v04 2 is a blended active and passive soil moisture product formed by the retrieved soil moisture information from ami and ascat scatterometers and four microwave radiometers ssm i tmi smmr and amsr e that provides soil moisture information up to 10 cm depth with reasonable accuracy https www esa soilmoisture cci org node 227 for the period 1979 2016 these soil moisture datasets available in the netcdf format were extracted using the ncdf4 r package these datasets were used to estimate the daily scale stress coefficient kms for etact estimation the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem was used to delineate the stream networks and basin boundary meant for the vic 3l and swat to prepare the lulc map of the krc two liss iii image tiles of the year 2008 were downloaded from http bhuvan nrsc gov in bhuvan links php the lulc map consisting of thirteen distinct lulc classes was prepared using the supervised classification in the erdas imagine 2014 software wherein the training samples were created based on the ground truth information fig 3 the lulc map was prepared at a spatial resolution of 24 m by considering the ground truth data for all the three major crop growing seasons of summer march may kharif june october and rabi november february moreover the prepared lulc map was validated with the nation scale lulc map 56 m resolution at 1 250000 scale as prepared by the national remote sensing centre nrsc hyderabad india before the model application the soil information of the krc was obtained from the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbsslup kolkata and harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 1 developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao un for two soil layers of depths 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm further the desired soil hydraulic information was processed in grid and mapping unit based formats for the input database of the swat and vic 3l model respectively the presence of flow regulation structures actively alters the downstream hydrologic behavior of the catchment hence conceptualization of such structures in the lsms is quite essential ali and sridhar 2019 the primary inputs for reservoir simulation in the swat model is described in table 2 which are updated in the swat model at the beginning of model set up moreover to simulate the downstream hydrology of the krc daily reservoir outflow time series for the period 1980 2019 was used the value of crop coefficient kc for the paddy crop was derived from the lysimeter study carried out in the experimental plots of agricultural and food engineering department indian institute of technology kharagpur for the three growing seasons i e kharif rabi and summer the lysimeters with the dimensions of 1 25 m length 1 25 m width 1 00 m depth were of two close bottom and four open bottom non weighing type lysimeters the volumetric water balance of all the six lysimeters was performed to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration etc further the division of etc by the et0 derived from fao 56 pm approach resulted in daily kc value and subsequently averaged over each paddy growing stage to estimate the seasonal kc values as illustrated in fig 4 4 3 model set up the vic 3l model was set up at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with 33 discrete grids covering the krc with the daily forcing inputs of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed and solar radiation to estimate the catchment scale hydrological fluxes of streamflow soil moisture baseflow and et based on the principle of water balance as there is no reservoir module available in the vic 3l model the vic 3l model setup was carried out individually for the upstream river catchment and the downstream reservoir catchment command the outlet of the upstream catchment is located at the inflow location of the kangsabati reservoir and the reservoir releases formed the upstream boundary condition of the downstream catchment command conversely the hru based swat model was set up using the same forcing inputs resulting in 44 sub basins and 191 hrus the add in reservoir module in swat simulates the hydropeaking effect on the downstream catchment command region the swat model has four options for defining the daily reservoir releases to the downstream catchments under uncontrolled scenario the user needs to define the average annual release rate or target release as a function of reservoir storage at the reservoir outlet which is far away from reality in the daily scale hydrological modeling studies conversely in controlled reservoir the swat has a provision to input the time series of daily or monthly reservoir outflow which is more realistic since the kangsabati reservoir under study is a highly managed reservoir the daily time series of reservoir outflow is available from the competent authority hence in this study the daily outflow based reservoir simulation option was chosen moreover since the streamflow time series available at the reservoir inflow location was used for swat calibration the inflow to the reservoir was simulated with high precision and subsequently the inflow outflow and water balance dynamics of the reservoir was maintained with utmost accuracy during the course of the study to envisage the inter annual variability of forcing inputs and their response towards different hydrological flux components as per the availability of daily scale streamflow data three years 1977 1979 of data was used for model spin up followed by twenty one years 1980 2000 of data for calibration and ten years 2001 2010 of data for validation the model calibration and validation were carried out at two locations namely the inflow location of the kangsabati reservoir and at mohanpur outlet attributing the hydropeaking effect caused by the kangsabati reservoir the sensitivity analysis of 7 and 10 model parameters of swat and vic 3l was carried out prior to the model calibration respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 performance of swat and vic 3l model in simulating water balance components during calibration and validation table 3 shows the hydraulic parameters for different types of soils in the study area as derived using the rosetta model the rank and calibrated values of the top 10 sensitive swat parameters are presented in table 4 similarly the calibrated vic 3l model parameters are given in table 5 the reproduction of observed daily streamflow by the swat and vic 3l models during both the monsoon and non monsoon periods is shown in the form of box and scatter plots figs 5 and 6 it can be envisaged from figs 5 and 6 and the performance evaluation error measures presented in table 6 that the swat performed the best in reproducing the observed daily reservoir inflow with the nse estimates of 0 64 0 79 for the upper and lower catchments whereas the corresponding performances by the vic 3l model was reasonably well with the nse estimate of 0 60 0 68 as compared to vic 3l swat mostly overestimated the low and medium flows the low streamflow estimates at the reservoir inflow location characterized by the 90 exceedance probability values were best reproduced by the swat with kge estimates of 0 57 as compared to kge 0 52 in case of vic 3l similarly at the mohanpur outlet location significant underestimation of low flows was exhibited by vic 3l whereas swat could best reproduce the low flows with kge estimates of 0 61 in terms of the pbias estimate both the models performed almost similarly with pbias 25 whereas the swat model showed better estimates in terms of r2 and rmse measures table 6 for swat the r2 and rmse estimates ranged from 0 66 to 0 79 and 75 20 111 26 m3 s respectively which were 0 67 0 71 and 80 17 120 65 m3 s for the vic 3l model respectively from the flow duration curve fdc analysis presented in fig 7 it can be envisaged that there was significant underestimation and overestimation of the simulated reservoir inflows by the swat and vic models for the observed threshold flows of 200 m3 s respectively conversely below the threshold value of 500 m3 s significant underestimations were observed at mohanpur outlet by both swat and vic 3l since the add in reservoir module in swat simulated the reservoir dynamics with utmost accuracy the swat could efficiently reproduce both the high and low flows in the command area located to the downstream of the kangsabati reservoir conversely absence of reservoir simulation module in the vic 3l resulted in considerable uncertainty in simulating the peak flows in the command region yielding poor estimation of the water balance components the resulting streamflow overestimation and underestimation in the paddy dominated reservoir catchment could be attributed to the incorrect quantification of various loss components of the paddy field water balance by both the models during the awd phase of paddy growth due to the lack of a detailed process description of the vadose zone dynamics under moisture stress conditions in swat there was an overestimated baseflow simulation however due to moisture stress the partitioning of precipitation for the baseflow should have been reduced moreover the vic model assumes et as a residual product of the catchment water balance which causes potential tuning of the et variable to produce improved streamflow but a more biased baseflow output fig 8 the command area of the krc receives reservoir releases as the concentrated upstream flow along with the overland runoff due to rainfall fig 8 illustrates the partitioning of rainfall into streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage components by swat and vic 3l at the five typical locations representing five sub basins in case of swat or five grids in case of vic 3l it can be envisaged from fig 8 that the swat estimated et loss as a percentage of rainfall was the highest 56 01 at jhargram sub basin no 40 and the lowest 46 72 at kharagpur sub basin no 42 whereas the corresponding rainfall to et transformation by the vic 3l was the highest 63 21 at mohanpur grid no 19 and the lowest 60 49 at purulia grid no 3 the highest et loss at mohanpur as simulated by the vic 3l could be attributed to the presence of dominant paddy land use with adequate soil water availability moreover the annual average baseflow contribution to the streamflow as estimated by the swat was in the range of 116 56 199 66 mm the highest contribution being observed at purulia sub basin no 6 similarly the corresponding baseflow contribution as estimated by the vic 3l model was in the range of 56 32 71 03 mm the highest being observed at kharagpur grid no 18 the mean standard deviation of the annual water balance component over the year 1980 2019 fig 8 such as precipitation streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage as simulated by vic 3l was in the range of 1547 93 134 32 mm year 426 54 36 54 mm year 962 02 92 77 mm year 63 99 5 04 mm year and 95 38 13 77 mm year respectively and the streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage components were 27 56 62 15 4 13 and 6 16 of the mean annual rainfall respectively conversely the swat estimated corresponding streamflow etact baseflow and soil moisture storage components were 28 88 51 61 10 58 and 8 93 of the mean annual rainfall respectively the magnitude of vic 3l estimated average annual etact for the five selected typical grid locations were in the increased order purulia 819 26 mm year bankura 889 81 mm year jhargram 1003 91 mm year kharagpur 1029 77 mm year mohanpur 1067 34 mm year signifying the upstream river catchment to be more drought prone conversely the corresponding swat simulated etact was in the increasing order purulia 706 44 mm year bankura 761 44 mm year kharagpur 781 87 mm year mohanpur 848 88 mm year jhargram 894 68 mm year moreover the swat simulated baseflow magnitude of 138 22 26 63 mm year at the five intensive irrigated locations seems more reasonable than that of the vic 3l simulated baseflow estimate of 95 38 13 77 mm year 5 2 evaluation of vic 3l swat and esa cci derived soil moisture products the soil moisture estimates from the calibrated set up of swat and vic 3l were analyzed to study their spatiotemporal variation in the krc the simulated soil moisture estimates from the respective five grids in case of vic 3l and five sub basins in case of swat were extracted and subsequently their dynamics were analyzed during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons across all the five locations both the swat and vic 3l derived soil moisture products represented the incidences of moisture stress and moisture surplus phases reasonably well although there was sizeable disagreement in terms of the magnitude of soil water contents considering the esa cci derived soil moisture product as the benchmark fig 9 the degree of this disagreement was gradually intensified from the upstream rainfed non irrigated areas to the downstream irrigated command area in the krc over the years 1980 2019 the simulated mean seasonal soil moisture estimates by the benchmark esa cci product were 0 15 0 26 and 0 21 m3 m3 during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively which were worse reproduced by the vic 3l model as 0 09 0 20 and 0 14 m3 m3 respectively and better reproduced by the swat as 0 11 0 27 and 0 18 m3 m3 respectively the capability of swat to account for the management practices being followed in the command area could have improved the contribution of excess irrigation water to the soil moisture regimes the considerable underestimation in the soil water content by the vic 3l with reference to the esa cci product could be attributed to the absence of moisture stress accountability conceptualization resulting in erroneous partitioning of water balance components as discussed in section 2 1 as envisaged from fig 9 the seasonal variation of esa cci soil moisture products in the krc exhibited a dynamic spatial distribution pattern wherein the north eastern side command area remains more moisture deficient than the upper catchment overall the average pre monsoon season esa cci derived soil moisture estimates of 0 16 0 18 and 0 14 m3 m3 across the upstream river catchment left bank command lbc and right bank command rbc areas respectively revealed that the rbc is more drought prone resulting in severe moisture stress during the crop growing periods moreover the low average esa cci soil moisture content of 0 23 m3 m3 during the monsoon season revealed that moisture stress condition also prevailed in the rbc during this season due to the intermittent rainfall pattern as shown in fig 10 the degree of correlation between the intermittent rainfall variation and seasonal soil moisture content was reduced in the order of esa cci swat vic 3l resulting in significant underestimation of soil moisture in the case of vic 3l fig 11 illustrates the seasonal variation of soil moisture stress coefficient kms in the krc as derived from the esa cci soil moisture product averaged over 1980 2019 it can be elucidated from fig 11 that the moisture stress periods were more prevalent during the mid december to end february characterized by an average kms value of 0 34 the spatial variation of kms at the five typical study sites was estimated in the increasing order of purulia jhargram bankura kharagpur mohanpur signifying acute moisture stress condition in the command region attributed to higher etact loss conversely relatively stable moisture stress condition of purulia sub basin could be attributed to the presence of dominant clay soil texture which improves the water holding capacity of the soil substantially 5 3 evaluation of vic 3l swat and mod16a2 derived etact products figs 12 and 13 illustrate the spatiotemporal inter comparison of 8 daily etact estimates by the swat vic 3l and mod16a2 during the two crop growing seasons rabi and kharif of 2001 2005 considering the fao 56 pm with moisture stress eq 20 as the benchmark in the selected study area the average rabi season etact estimates in mm year by the swat vic 3l mod16a2 and fao 56 pm were obtained as 253 32 292 65 181 96 and 227 68 mm year respectively whereas the corresponding estimates for the kharif season were 498 06 591 72 483 34 and 476 78 mm year respectively the heat map plot shown in fig 14 revealed that the swat and mod16a2 derived etact estimates captured the dynamics of the fao 56 pm benchmark etact better in the kharif season with the nse estimates of 0 96 to 0 51 and 3 47 to 0 66 respectively however the vic 3l model performed poorly in simulating the 8 daily etact during both the crop growing seasons as evidenced from the nse ranges of 12 32 to 1 02 and 41 24 to 0 77 during the kharif and rabi seasons respectively depicting significant overestimation of etact in the paddy dominated locations as envisaged from fig 14 the degree of disagreement between the fao 56 pm benchmark and vic 3l simulated etact gradually increased from the upstream rain fed region to the downstream command region with relatively poor performance during the rabi season the error statistics of 8 daily etact simulation is reckoned using the measures of pbias and rmse as presented in the violin plots fig 15 note that violin plot is a blend of box plot and rotated density plot in which the white dot in the middle represents the median value the thick black bars represent the interquartile range and the extended black lines correspond to the adjacent upper and lower values it can be surmised from fig 15 that the vic 3l continuously overestimated the benchmark etact during both the crop growing seasons with the rmse and pbias estimates of 8 53 22 94 mm 8 day and 25 87 to 338 40 respectively with higher deviations during the rabi season conversely mod16a2 and swat based etact estimates depicted the command area dynamics reasonably well with the relatively lower rmse estimates of 1 94 9 35 mm 8 day for swat and 2 54 14 95 mm 8 day for mod16a2 respectively and the pbias estimates of 26 10 to 43 21 for swat and 56 8 to 44 1 for mod16a2 respectively in the rainfed paddy fields located in purulia and bankura the mod16a2 performed better than the swat with the improved rmse estimates of 2 54 8 15 mm 8 day whereas in the paddy fields located in mohanpur command region swat outperformed the mod16a2 with an improved rmse estimate of 1 94 9 35 mm 8 day during both the crop growing seasons fig 15 from figs 9 and 11 it can be envisaged that the moisture stress condition in the study area is more prevalent during the pre monsoon season due to the conventional water management practices with several drying phases as illustrated in figs 12 and 13 for reproducing the benchmark etact both the swat and vic 3l have gradually reduced spatial accuracy from the rainfed paddy land uses of purulia to awd irrigated command areas of kharagpur and mohanpur which may be attributed to the absence of moisture stress conceptualization in these model frameworks conversely the mod16a2 product performed very well spatially depicting the enhanced efficiency of this remote sensing based approach in segregating the wet and dry moisture spells in the paddy fields hence the satisfactory performance of mod16a2 and swat based etact during the kharif season in reproducing the fao 56 pm based benchmark etact signifies that these et products could be reliable under low to moderate moisture stress conditions whereas the vic 3l performed poorly the temporal variation of 8 daily etact time series figs 12 and 13 at the extreme upstream purulia and downstream mohanpur locations in the krc implied that during the wet spells of monsoon rainfall certain abrupt spikes in the mod16a2 etact product were present that resulted in reduced efficiency with the nse estimates of 3 47 2 23 and 1 88 during the year 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively this anomaly may be attributed to the presence of cloud covers in the modis image the poor performance of vic 3l for etact estimation under moisture stress condition may be attributed to i non representation of the vic model grid by 100 paddy land use thereby affecting the et estimates because of the presence of multiple land uses and ii absence of moisture stress factor in the vic 3l for et estimation resulting in overestimation of etact therefore to use the vic et product it has to be standardized with reference to the moisture stress factor based fao 56 pm equation moreover the swat etact estimates for irrigated paddy fields are not reliable due to the lack of awd conceptualization in the swat which is inherent in the paddy fields during acute moisture stress periods conversely the mod16a2 et product could be a reasonable estimate of catchment scale etact provided it is not contaminated with the cloud cover 5 4 implications of swat and vic derived et and soil moisture products in drought assessment and irrigation planning since the gridded mod16a2 and esa cci products represent the spatiotemporal variability of etact and soil moisture estimates covering the whole catchment these were used to derive the reference ssi and sedi drought indices respectively table 7 presents the numbers of severe and extreme drought months at the five typical study locations as estimated by the ssi and sedi indices derived using the simulated soil moisture and etact estimates of swat vic 3l and mod16a2 et esa cci sm it can be envisaged from table 7 that the ssi corresponded to more severe agricultural drought than that of the sedi as confirmed from the increased count of drought months the drought propagation across the krc revealed that jhargram is the most drought prone location with 11 6 and 22 numbers of extreme drought months as estimated by esa cci swat and vic 3l derived soil moisture products respectively followed by kharagpur mohanpur purulia and bankura fig 16 illustrates the ssi based monthly scale drought indices as derived from esa cci swat and vic 3l soil moisture products from fig 16 it can be surmised that purulia being a rainfed location experienced more frequent drought characteristics with the maximum drought severity of 2 4 during the year 1997 whereas bankura showed the least severe drought hazard with more persistent wet spells the swat derived ssi estimates corresponded to a similar degree of drought severity as that of the esa cci the highest similarity being observed at the command area location of kharagpur however a significant variation in the spatiotemporal drought pattern at the individual location was perceived the frequent irrigation application in the command areas of kharagpur and mohanpur resulted in a substantial increase in the wet spells during the concerned period since the upstream locations to the reservoir are rainfed in nature the onset and termination of drought events showed a prompt response whereas in the command areas of mohanpur and kharagpur a delayed response was noticed due to an underestimation of grid scale soil moisture by the vic 3l fig 9 the total number of extreme and severe monthly drought events table 7 were the highest i e 19 4 with the individual drought severity estimates of 2 35 and 1 67 respectively the corresponding computed severity in the case of swat were 2 02 and 1 70 and in the case of and esa cci were 2 21 and 1 69 benchmark respectively fig 16 the computed esa cci derived ssi based drought severity in decreasing order for the typical study sites were jhargram purulia mohanpur kharagpur bankura with the high severity values being concentrated during the years 1984 1992 1996 2015 2018 and 2019 moreover the numbers of moderate drought events were the highest in the case of esa cci followed by swat and vic 3l which were more prevalent in the rainfed regions of purulia overall the ssi based drought indices derived from the esa cci and swat sm products showed almost similar drought severity patterns whereas the vic 3l based agricultural drought severity and duration were overestimated and underestimated with reference to the esa cci respectively similarly from table 7 it can be seen that the swat based sedi index assessed similar numbers of drought months as that of mod16a2 benchmark while the vic 3l predicted higher number of drought months except at the command area locations of kharagpur and mohanpur while using the mod16a2 swat and vic 3l derived et estimates the sedi based drought severity decreased to 1 79 1 56 and 1 23 as compared to the corresponding ssi based drought severity respectively this shows that although esa cci and swat models explained the sedi based drought severity similarly the vic 3l model significantly underestimated the drought severity which is just opposite to the ssi based estimates from fig 17 it can be surmised that the drought severity estimated by swat at the five study locations was reduced in the order kharagpur mohanpur bankura jhargram purulia whereas for the vic 3l the corresponding order was purulia bankura mohanpur kharagpur jhargram as envisaged from the swat simulations the higher water requirement by paddy crop in the command regions of kharagpur and mohanpur increased the evapotranspiration deficit etd resulting in increased drought hazard at the kharagpur and mohanpur locations conversely lack of paddy field dynamics conceptualization in the vic 3l resulted non accountability of irrigation water application in the vadose zone soil moisture regime of vic 3l resulted in purulia upstream rainfed location to be highly drought prone than the command area apparently considerable amount of etact overestimation in the vic 3l resulted in reduced etd in the command regions of krc yielding less intense transformation of soil moisture drought into agricultural drought the representation of almost no drought condition in the krc by the vic 3l derived sedi estimates may need a revision in the etact estimation framework of vic 3l however as per the benchmark mod16a2 derived sedi estimates the drought severity decreased from the command area to the upstream rainfed area as mohanpur kharagpur bankura jhargram purulia this revealed that in the rainfed locations the reference onset and termination of drought showed a delayed response whereas swat and vic 3l predicted these responses to be prompt at all the locations there exists a direct correlation between the swat and vic 3l simulated etact and ep however a considerable difference in their magnitudes was observed due to the inherent correlation between the etact and ep the swat and vic 3l estimated etd remains quite similar for a typical location this resulted in a minimum difference in the swat and vic 3l derived sedi drought severity magnitudes although considerable difference was experienced in terms of drought extent as shown in fig 17 this considerable discrepancy between the mod16a2 and swat vic 3l derived agricultural drought severity and duration may be attributed to the lack of exclusive paddy field dynamics in both these lsms resulting in improper quantification of irrigation requirements in the typical paddy growing locations hence the lsm estimated drought duration have greater implications on planning the irrigation scheduling in a typical command area which necessitates for the appropriate selection of lsm for this purpose overall the imprecise estimation of the agricultural drought indices by the lsms would result in erroneous assessment of irrigation water demand in the catchment 6 conclusions for catchment scale drought assessment and irrigation planning reliable estimation of etact under data sparse conditions is one of the major issues therefore in this study the mod16a2 swat and vic 3l based indirect et estimation methods were evaluated with reference to the moisture stress coefficient based fao 56 pm method in a paddy dominated integrated reservoir catchment command under awd scenario based on the obtained results the following conclusions could be drawn 1 from the derived water balance components by the swat and vic 3l model in the study area it is clear that the vic 3l significantly overestimates the grid scale actual evapotranspiration and underestimates the soil moisture storage components whereas the corresponding swat estimates are almost reliable therefore considering the ssi and sedi indices the vic 3l model may not be useful for estimating both the severity and duration of agricultural drought with utmost accuracy conversely swat could estimate the agricultural drought with reasonable accuracy 2 the calibration and validation results revealed that swat model could best reproduce the observed daily streamflow in the selected catchment with utmost accuracy nse 0 7 than that of the vic 3l nse 0 60 therefore swat model may be more useful for assessing the hydrological drought than the vic 3l 3 the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture stress coefficient revealed that during mid november to end february rabi season the command area of the selected catchment is subjected to severe water stress due to frequent alternate wetting and drying conditions where the swat and vic 3l model failed to assess the agricultural drought this is attributed to the unavailability of soil moisture stress factor in these models for estimating the actual evapotranspiration 4 although a few 8 daily mod16a2 et products could be spurious due to cloud contamination this may be more reliable for estimating the drought severity its extent and the corresponding irrigation water requirement in the command area during both the kharif and rabi seasons vic 3l overestimated the ssi based drought extent in the entire krc and underestimated the sedi based drought extent in the rainfed locations of purulia and bankura with almost no drought condition in the command areas adding more uncertainty in agricultural drought assessment conversely during both the kharif and rabi seasons swat consistently predicted the drought extent reasonably closer to that derived from the mod16a2 and esa cci sm products this underlines the scope of accounting for the moisture stress factor in the et modules of vic 3l and swat under the awd scenario therefore under such contrasting model realizations the vic 3l derived etact estimates with proper standardization may be adopted for macro scale water resources planning in scantily gauged catchments although swat as an agro hydrological model satisfactorily reproduced the etact dynamics of paddy fields in the kharif season substantial modification to its et algorithm may enhance its performance further during the rabi season under awd scenario since inferences are drawn based on this typical study the advocated approach could be replicated in other agricultural catchments worldwide under varying climate and land use conditions for more generality

5016,cave monitoring is crucial to unraveling the factors controlling carbon isotope compositions and their transportation in karst systems here we report a 10 year 2010 2019 cave monitoring of carbon isotopes from the plants soil cave water and speleothems in jiguan cave central china located on the chinese north south divide in an area that is sensitive to the asian monsoon the results show that the cave ventilation and soil air co2 controlled by the local temperature and humidity conditions are responsible for the seasonal variability in the δ13cdic values the variation in the δ13cdic values and trace element ratios of the cave water are sensitive to the local hydrological conditions although there is the lag time from precipitation to cave water in drought year the δ13cdic and trace element ratios mg ca ba ca and sr ca of cave water are strongly coupled and reflect the extreme drought due to the influence of prior calcite precipitation pcp and water rock interaction the 10 year monitoring period covered two complete el niño southern oscillation enso cycles during the two strong el niño years 2010 and 2015 the cave drip water δ13cdic values were negative but the δ18o values were positive this opposite trend is mainly due to their different controlling mechanisms the rainfall amount and moisture sources are responsible for the δ13cdic and δ18o values of the drip water respectively throughout the karst cave system the carbon isotopes in jiguan cave are continuously enriched when migrating from the vegetation to the soil to the cave drip water to the modern speleothems comparisons with the stalagmite δ13c records for the nearby jiguan cave suggest that stalagmite carbon isotopes may reflect the regional precipitation changes induced by the enso on the decadal scale overall we demonstrate that the δ13c is a potentially reliable proxy that records the changes in the regional environment especially precipitation changes and is also a sensitive indictor that indirectly reflects enso keywords carbon isotopes karst hydrology el niño southern oscillation extreme drought events modern speleothems 1 introduction cave speleothems formed by water rock interactions are a rare and important source of information for the study of paleoclimate evolution in karst areas wang et al 2001 shopov et al 2004 yuan et al 2004 banner et al 2007 cheng et al 2009 2016 cai et al 2010 the stalagmite δ18o is the most widely used environmental proxy and has been extensively used to reconstruct paleoclimates yuan et al 2004 cobb et al 2007 tan et al 2009 2018 2020a 2020b pausata et al 2011 maher and thompson 2012 tan 2014 zhao et al 2019 liu et al 2020 nevertheless the interpretation of stalagmite δ18o is still debated in general previous interpretations of speleothem δ18o have primarily focused on the rainfall amount effect hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 goldsmith et al 2017 temperature effect paulsen et al 2003 feng et al 2014 monsoon intensity yuan

not as widely used as δ18o previous studies suggested that carbon isotopes are more sensitive to changes in the local climate and ecological environment than oxygen isotopes frappier 2013 li et al 2020 and the δ13c time series can be used as a valuable supplement to δ18o compositions lambert and aharon 2011 lechleitner et al 2017 many scholars have discussed the climate and environment information recorded by carbon isotopes fairchild et al 2000 tan et al 2013 li et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and used δ13c as an important proxy in paleoclimate and paleoenvironment reconstruction dorale et al 1992 coplen et al 1994 bar matthews et al 1999 genty et al 2003 woo et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 tan et al 2020a 2020b however the migration process of δ13c signals in the entire cave system is affected by diverse complex factors including climatic and non climatic factors which pose a significant challenge in explaining and interpreting the carbon isotope compositions of stalagmites the types and density of vegetation overlying the cave and soil respiration rate affect the δ13c of soil air co2 and indirectly reflect the changes of external climatic conditions cerling 1984 bar matthews et al 1997 dorale et al 1998 mcdermott 2004 fleitmann et al 2009 speleothem δ13c values are also influenced by the inorganic processes operating in the soil zone deeper within the unsaturated zone and during calcite reprecipitation in the cave cosford et al 2009 the degree of open versus closed system dissolution of the carbonate bedrock affects speleothem δ13c values by controlling the proportions of carbon from different sources hendy 1971 genty et al 2003 fairchild et al 2006a rudzka et al 2011 in addition prior carbonate precipitation pcp in the vadose zone cave ventilation and the degassing of co2 from the drip water also influence the final δ13c values recorded in the speleothems baker et al 1997 verheyden et al 2000 spötl et al 2005 fairchild et al 2006a baldini et al 2008 pu et al 2017 due to the complexity of the above factors the application of speleothem δ13c to reconstruct environmental changes has been limited the hydrological information provided by the trace element compositions of the cave water is an important proxy for reconstructing climate changes fairchild and treble 2009 chen and li 2018 zhang and li 2019 multiple mechanisms control the trace elements composition of drip water including the composition of the local soil and bedrock the types of flow paths the residence time of underground water water rock interaction the extent and intensity of pcp incongruent calcite dissolution and the mixing of old and fresh water tooth and fairchild 2003 fairchild and treble 2009 sherwin and baldini 2011 wong et al 2011 these factors which may affect the trace element ratios of drip water have direct or indirect links to the precipitation zhang and li 2019 the combination of carbon isotope and trace element compositions can be used to rule out several possible mechanisms for the changes in stalagmite δ13c hellstrom and mcculloch 2000 mcdermott 2004 zhang et al 2015 moreover applying a multi proxy approach such as δ18o and trace elements can better constrain speleothem δ13c variability and shed light on the dominant processes that influence δ13c variability in a given cave system oster et al 2010 fohlmeister et al 2017 2020 cave monitoring can provide the opportunity to explore the transmission processes of δ13c signals and quantify the effects of the seasonal and multi year changes in the cave environment on the δ13c record and finally to evaluate the roles of various factors on speleothem δ13c values genty and massault 1999 baker and brunsdon 2003 spötl et al 2005 fairchild et al 2006a fuller et al 2008 lambert and aharon 2011 in this study a 10 year monitoring program 2010 2019 was conducted in jiguan cave which is located in an area of central china that is sensitive to variations in the asian monsoon and the western pacific subtropical high wpsh previous monitoring results have shown that the interannual δ18o of precipitation correspond to the variations in the el niño southern oscillation enso which supports the interpretation of the circulation effect sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 found that the changes in the δ18o values of drip water and modern calcite are correlated with the shifts of wpsh and they used a high resolution δ18o record from dongshiya cave which is near jiguan cave to reconstruct the variations of the wpsh western boundary however interpretations of the carbon isotope in cave system are rarely reported here we present a 10 year study on carbon isotope and trace element compositions of the jiguan cave system and compare with the high resolution δ13c speleothem dsy 1201 record that reported in dongshiya cave zhao et al 2019 this study mainly focuses on the following questions 1 the factors affecting the carbon isotope records in karst cave on different time scales e g seasonal annual and decadal 2 the responses of trace elements ratios and carbon isotopes in cave water to the external environment 3 the responses of karst hydrology δ13c values to enso and their implications for the use of δ13c records in paleoclimate reconstruction 2 study area jiguan cave 33 46 n 111 34 e and dongshiya cave are located in the north slope of funiu

the northern part of the qinling mountains huaihe river line in the northern part of the yangtze river and yellow river watershed the study area is in the transition zone between the humid region and the semiarid region and it is sensitive to the asian summer monsoon the mean annual temperature and precipitation recorded at the meteorological station in luanchuan were 12 4 c and 838 mm 1957 2019 respectively supplementary table s1 owing to the influence of the monsoon more than 50 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in summer the overlying bedrock is relatively thin and mainly

mountain is brown soil with a thickness of 10 60 cm the elevation of the entrance of jiguan cave is approximately 900 m the length is approximately 5600 m and one third of the cave has been developed for tourism sun et al 2018 during the monitoring period the temperature in the cave ranged from 13 5 to 17 0 averaged of 15 5 and the relative humidity was remained higher than 90 all year round indicating that the internal environment of jiguan cave is relatively closed 3 sample collection and data analysis 3 1 sample collection soil profile was excavated at altitudes of 900 920 m from the roof of jiguan cave fig 1c to avoid potential cross contamination of the subsamples of soil profile the soil subsamples were collected from bottom to top at intervals of 5 cm leaf branch and root samples were collected from the dominant plants near each soil section five cave water sampling sites were monitored in jiguan cave fig 1d including one underground river dth dong tian he two drip water sites lyxs li yu xi shui and tgbd tian gong bing deng and two pool sites yzt yu zhu tan and ycg yao chi gong the polypropylene bottles that were used to collect the water samples were rinsed in 1 1 hcl and deionized water prior to the sample collection pre washed 0 45 μm millipore nitrocellulose filters were used to filter the water samples before the samples were added to the sample bottles a pre cleaned container not acid washed was left for 1 3 h to collect the drip water and then aliquots were poured into acid cleaned polypropylene sample bottles the trace level ultrapure hno3 1 1 was added to achieve the ph value of 2 for cation samples to avoid isotope fractionation caused by microorganisms 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution was added to the dissolved inorganic carbon dic samples all of the samples were sealed transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analyzed the cave water sites were sampled at two month intervals starting in 2010 and at one month intervals starting in april 2019 two circular glass plates were placed under the drip sites to collect modern deposits the glass plates were replaced every two months and were dried naturally at room temperature after being rinsed with deionized water powder subsamples were scraped from the modern sediment sample on the glass plate using a clean steel knife if no deposits were found the retrieval was temporarily paused 3 2 sample analyses the methods used to measure the oxygen isotopes of the water samples 2009 2016 have been described by sun et al 2018 the samples collected from 2017 to 2019 were analyzed using the picarro l2140 icrds liquid water isotope analyzer at the stable isotope laboratory school of geographical sciences fujian normal university the measurement accuracy was typically 0 08 and the results supplementary table s2 are reported relative to v smow vienna standard mean ocean water the δ13cdic analyses were conducted in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environments at southwest university and in the isotope laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences the analyses were performed using a delta v plus mass spectrometer connected to a gas bench pre treatment apparatus the analysis precision was better than 0 2 1σ the δ18o and δ13c values of the modern speleothems supplementary table s3 were measured using a finnigan delta v plus gas isotope mass spectrometer combined with a kiel iv automated carbonate device each sample was analyzed 8 times and the long term 1σ precision is 0 1 for δ18o and 0 06 for δ13c the methods used to measure the carbon isotopes of the plant and soil organic matter have been described by li et al 2012 the analyses were conducted in the geochemistry and isotope laboratory at southwest university all of the carbon isotopic results supplementary table s4 obtained in this study are reported relative to v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite the ca ba sr and mg concentrations of the samples were measured using an optima 2100dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer usa in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environments at southwest university the detection limit was 0 001 mg l 1 and the relative uncertainty of the measurements is less than 2 the data is presented in supplementary table s5 3 3 cave monitoring and meteorological data we installed co2 monitoring devices between the bedrock and soil on the southern slope above jiguan cave in may 2019 fig 1c the ranges of the gmm221 soil co2 concentration sensor vaisala finland the av 10t soil temperature sensor usa and the av ec5 soil moisture sensor are 0 20000 10 6 40 140 0 100 respectively with precisions of 1 0 1 and 0 1 respectively a testo 535 infrared co2 tester produced in germany with range of 0 9999 ppmv was used to monitor the cave air co2 at five monitoring sites the soil air pco2 and cave air pco2 data are presented in supplementary tables s6 and s7 respectively the temperature and precipitation data supplementary table s1 collected before april 2019 were obtained from the meteorological station in luanchuan county henan province in april 2019 a vantage pro field meteorologicalstation produced by davis was installed near the soil monitoring site to automatically log the temperature and precipitation data every 15 min with precisions of 0 1 and 0 01 mm respectively fig 1c the precipitation anomaly percentage was used to classify the extremely dry and wet years the calculation formula is as follows p a p p p 100 where pa is the percentage of precipitation anomaly p is the annual precipitation in a year and p is the average multi year precipitation generally the wet and dry years are distinguished by pa values of 15 and 15 respectively in particular a year with a pa value of less than or equal to 40 was defined as an extremely drought year and that with the pa value of greater than or equal to 40 was defined as an extremely wet year wei et al 2017 the niño 3 4 sea surface temperature anomaly ssta data http www cpc ncep noaa gov data indices sstoi indices were downloaded from the climate prediction center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 4 results 4 1 local temperature and precipitation as is showed in fig 3 d the monthly mean temperature data varied with season it was lower in winter mean t 1 8 1 0 and higher in summer mean t 23 3 1 5 all of in this paper represent the standard deviations the local precipitation exhibited obvious seasonal changes and was mainly concentrated in the summer however the highest monthly precipitation occurred in different months each year the total annual precipitation reached its peak 1105 mm in 2010 and then it gradually decreased reaching its lowest point 435 mm in 2013 the total amount of precipitation gradually increased from 2013 to 2015 and then it decreased after 2015 according to the 10 year percentage of precipitation anomaly supplementary table s8 the pa values in 2010 2011 and 2015 were 50 29 and 24 respectively thus these years were classified as wet years the pa values in 2013 and 2019 were 41 and 27 respectively thus they were classified as dry years in particular the pa values in 2010 and 2013 were higher than 40 and lower than 40 classifying them as extremely wet and extremely dry years respectively in 2010 the precipitation on july 24 alone was as high as 155 mm this high rainfall event led to severe flooding in study area from july 2013 to june 2014 the weather was extremely dry the precipitation gradually increased after july 2014 and reached a peak of 242 mm in september in the autumn of 2017 a relative severe drought event occurred the precipitation was as high as 192 mm in september and sharply decreasedto 62 mm in october fig 3d we also analyzed the percentage of precipitation anomaly data supplementary table s1 for the past 60 years and found that the extremely wet years included 1964 65 and 1973 43 and the relatively wet years included 1967 1983 1984 1996 2005 and 2010 the dry years included 1966 1969 1972 1976 1978 1986 1991 1997 1999 2012 and 2016 to 2019 among them 2013 48 was an extremely drought year 4 2 δ13cdic values of cave water the δ13cdic values of the drip water pool water and the underground river are presented in table 1 the δ13cdic values of both drip sites and the pool sites exhibited seasonal variations but the drip water δ13cdic values exhibited more variable time series than the pool water fig 3a and c the δ13cdic values of the pool water exhibited clear seasonal signals with summer fall months having lower δ13cdic values than the winter early spring months when the δ13cdic was substantially more 13c enriched fig 3c on the annual scale the δ13cdic values of the cave water were the most negative in 2010 and then they gradually increased the δ13cdic values were the most positive in 2014 and then they decreased fig 3 4 3 pco2 of the soil and cave air the soil air pco2 overlying jiguan cave exhibited significant seasonal variations from may to december with higher values in the summer and lower values in the winter this variation pattern was quite consistent with that of the precipitation fig 4 b the cave air pco2 exhibited a significant seasonal variation pattern that was higher in the summer and lower in the winter fig 4c however the pco2 of the four sites varied within different ranges from 2017 to 2019 the pco2 of the four monitoring sites in the cave ranged from 347 ppmv to 1782 ppmv for yzt 335 ppmv to 2503 ppmv for dth 429 ppmv to 4520 ppmv for ycg and 462 ppmv to 4980 ppmv for lyxs with averages of 743 1028 1727 and 2096 ppmv respectively the trends and amplitudes of the variations of drip water site lyxs and the nearby pool water site ycg were similar and both were significantly higher than those of sites dth and yzt fig 4c 4 4 the trace element compositions of cave water the trace element compositions and ratios of the three types of cave water are summarized in table 2 mg ca values range from 0 29 to 0 50 mg l sr ca values range from 0 85 to 2 36 mg l and ba ca values range from 0 19 to 0 66 mg l table 2 the mg ca sr ca and ba ca values of the pool water and the underground river exhibited similar trends with obvious seasonal characteristics i e higher values in the dry season and lower values in the rainy season although the trace element ratios of the drip water lyxs were relatively stable overall and did not exhibit seasonal variations all three types of cave water showed significantly similar fluctuations in 2014 and 2017 fig 5 4 5 δ18o values of the drip water and δ13c values of the modern deposits plants and soils the δ18o values of drip water fluctuated from 10 2 to 6 5 although there was no seasonal variation in drip water δ18o it showed dramatic changes with a rapid decrease of 3 55 from 2009 to 2010 and a rapid increase of 2 23 in 2015 fig 6 a the δ13c values of modern speleothems ranged from 12 0 to 5 2 average of 9 0 1 7 for lyxs and from 9 0 to 12 5 average of 10 9 1 0 for tgbd the modern speleothems δ13c values exhibited seasonal variations in 2010 and 2011 negative in summer and positive in winter the severe drought led to a hiatus in the depositional record in 2013 and carbonate recovered in november 2014 since drought was released by the increasing rainfall and drips were oversaturated for precipitation sun et al 2017 obviously the variations in modern speleothem δ13c values were synchronous with the δ18o variations fig 6d and e the δ13c values of the plant subsamples ranged from 23 3 to 28 1 with an average of 26 0 1 1 the average δ13c value of the organic matter in the soil subsamples collected from the soil profile was 16 7 2 2 which is 9 higher than that of the plants 4 6 dsy 1201 carbon isotope time series the δ13c records from stalagmite dsy 1201 in dongshiya cave cover the last 200 years with an average resolution of 1 5 months zhao et al 2019 the δ13c values range from 5 6 to 11 6 average of 9 7 the large amplitude of the δ13c record is consistent with the range of the modern calcite δ13c values 5 2 to 12 0 obtained from the monitoring and sample collection conducted between 2010 and 2019 for this study here we only discuss the time period after 1950 i e 1950 2012 5 discussions 5 1 factors affecting the cave water δ13cdic on the seasonal scale in general the δ13cdic values of cave waterare effected by complex factors including the co2 released by the respiration of vegetation roots the decomposition of soil organic matter bedrock carbonate dissolution pcp and within cave processes such as co2 degassing genty et al 2001 mickler et al 2004 spötl et al 2005 fairchild et al 2006a frisia et al 2011 all of these processes above are driven by the fractionation of the carbon isotopic where co2 degassing from drip water causes the fractionation the co2 degassing of the cave drip water depends on the cave air pco2 which is mainly controlled by the overlying soil co2 and cave ventilation spötl et al 2005 baldini et al 2008 lambert and aharon 2011 pu et al 2017 on the one hand precipitation and consequently vegetation and soil activity microbial activity and root respiration are maximized during the wet season lechleitner et al 2017 resulting in the highest relative humidity and soil pco2 during this period fig 4 in principle the enhanced respiration of plant roots and the decomposition of microbes in the soil result in more 12c co2 gas being dissolved in the soil water and eventually entering the cave li et al 2012 which contributes to the negative values of δ13cdic conversely the decrease of temperature and rainfall and biomass dormancy accounts for impoverishment of soil derived co2 fluxes in winter fig 4b the amount of co2 dissolved in the groundwater decreases resulting in a reduction of the air pco2 in jiguan cave fig 4c which leads to enhanced degassing of co2 from the solution and enriches drip water in 13c it seems that the variations in δ13cdic values of cave water can be attribute to the variations of soil air co2 derived by local temperature and humid conditions however the seasonal variations in the temperate and moist conditions are not completely synchronized with cave air co2 fig 4a and c this may be caused by the cave ventilation in summer the temperature of the cave air is lower than that of the external air which causes a negative pressure gradient the air stagnation in cave results in relatively weak ventilation effect and co2 build up in cave thus increasing the cave air pco2 fig 4c and restricting the degassing of co2 from drip water spötl et al 2005 frisia et al 2011 dreybrodt et al 2016 as a result the drip water has more negative δ13c values in summer and vice versa in winter fig 3a our results are consistent with the results of previous studies conducted in other caves such obir cave spötl et al 2005 the desoto caverns lambert and aharon 2011 furong cave li et al 2011 and mawmluh cave breitenbach et al 2015 actually the timing and degree of degassing also affect the δ13c values of cave water li et al 2012 given the longer degassing time of the pool water compared to that of the drip water the δ13cdic values of the pool water are more positive and the seasonal changes are more obvious than those of the drip water fig 3 therefore we conclude that the seasonal variability of cave air pco2 caused by soil air co2 and cave ventilation are the major controlling factors for cave water δ13c in jiguan cave 5 2 factors affecting the δ13cdic values and trace element compositions of the cave water on the annual scale the variation of cave water δ13cdic responded to the changes of dry and wet conditions on interannual scales fig 3 generally the precipitation infiltrates from the surface to a cave is usually accompanied by damping and the lag times of the preserved climate signal tooth and fairchild 2003 fairchild et al 2006b treble et al 2013 hu et al 2020 lyu et al 2020a as reported by sun et al 2018 the drips in jiguan cave mainly reflect the latest rainy precipitation in ordinary years and the lag time from precipitation to drips is about 2 months liang et al 2017 that means the residence time of seepage water from surface to cave is relative shorter which may not affect the interannual signal of drip water δ13c the wet years 2010 and 2015 experienced increased precipitation in particular in july and august 2010 the rainfall amounts successively reached the maximum monthly precipitation for that year fig 3d large amounts of precipitation in a short period of time resulted in the groundwater move rapidly in the epikarst zone which shortened the water rock interaction time the drip rate of cave water increased pcp and co2 degassing were weakened resulting in lower cave water δ13cdic values fairchild et al 2006a after 2010 the climate became dry the precipitation decreased year by year and the δ13cdic values of cave water became increasingly positive fig 3 in the extremely dry year 2013 the rainy precipitation was significantly less than usual and partly lost by evaporation in the soil it is likely that cave water δ13c values will reached to the heaviest as the severe drought actually the most positive cave water δ13cdic values and the highest trace element ratios appeared in 2014 fig 5a suggesting that a significant residence time of the water in the epikarst and the drips δ13c reflect the combination of corresponding rainy precipitation and previous water in the overlying aquifer riechelmann et al 2011 our speculation is consistent with the results calculated by the bivariate model of oxygen isotope in sun et al 2018 the precipitation in 2013 was not directly converted into drip water and contributed to less than 10 the contribution of 2014 to drips increased to 40 which corresponded to the rainfall recovery in the rainy season in 2014 therefore although before september 2014 the drip water in the cave was a mixture of young precipitation water provided by fracture flow and old water it still reflects the arid climate conditions given the decrease in precipitation caused by the drought during this period the migration rate of atmospheric precipitation in the karst surface zone slowed down the residence time of groundwater was prolonged the water rock interaction were strong the time available for the cave water to dissolve the bedrock was long huang and fairchild 2001 musgrove and banner 2004 zhao et al 2015 all of these factors combined together led to the higher δ13cdic values of drip water the variability in trace elements ratios of drip water related to hydrological conditions is consistent with interannual drip water δ13cdic variations fig 5 notably significant peaks valleys in trace element ratios usually occurred during the extreme dry wet transition events indicating that trace element ratios may be sensitive to hydrological changes from dry to wet conditions fig 5 because the drought lasted for more than a year 2013 2014 the pathway of groundwater may have been relatively open in the epikarst zone which facilitated the degassing of co2 and the deposition of carbonate along the flow path wong et al 2011 as the water rock interaction increased more bedrock was dissolved and more mg2 was released into the groundwater fairchild et al 2000 moreover the preferential deposition of ca2 over mg2 and sr2 caused by pcp resulted in higher mg ca ratios karmann et al 2007 wong et al 2011 tremaine and froelich 2013 casteel and banner 2015 in contrast the precipitation increased after the long period of drought fig 5e the groundwater penetrated the soil and bedrock more rapidly shortening the water rock interaction time the increased rate of bedrock dissolution caused the higher metal ions concentrations in drip water leading to a decrease of the ba ca sr ca and mg ca fig 5b c and d the cave air pco2 is also an important factor affecting the trace element ratios of cave water banner et al 2007 sherwin and baldini 2011 wong et al 2011 treble et al 2015 the monitoring results revealed that the average cave air pco2 values exhibited obvious variations which were consistent with the temperature and precipitation variations in particular in 2019 a drought year there was a sharp decrease fig 4c on the one hand the variations in the cave air pco2 were mainly affected by the natural environment outside the cave and were controlled by the changes in the co2 content of the overlying soil whereas the soil co2 concentration was affected by the root respiration and the biological activity in the overlying soil knorr et al 2005 davidson et al 2006 on the other hand the changes of cave air pco2 may be caused by cave ventilation spötl et al 2005 lyu et al 2020b however the ventilation type of stagnant in summer and flowing in winter in jiguan cave had little influence on the interannual variation of cave air pco2 therefore temperature and precipitation may be significant factors affecting the air pco2 in jiguan cave on interannual scales after the extreme drought biological activity increased as the recovery of precipitation recovered starting in june 2014 resulting in a large amount of soil co2 entering the cave through the groundwater and cracks increasing the co2 content of the cave air which inhibited co2 degassing from the cave water baldini et al 2008 and finally caused a decrease in the sr ca ba ca and mg ca ratios fig 5 therefore we suspect that the variations in the δ13cdic values and trace element ratios of the cave water were consistent with the changes in the local hydrological conditions 5 3 the response of carbon isotope composition of the drip water to enso the 10 year monitoring period experienced two complete enso cycles from el niño in 2010 to la niña in 2011 and from strong el niño in 2015 to la niña in 2017 and a weaker el niño that resumed in 2018 the δ13cdic values of the drip water were quite consistent with the enso fig 6b and c the average δ13cdic values of drip water were continuously enriched from the most negative value in 2010 12 7 to 4 8 in 2014 then they gradually became more negative after 2014 and enriched again after 2018 table 3 moreover the δ13cdic values of two drip water sites correlated well with the nino 3 4 sst anomaly table 4 indicating that the cave drip water δ13cdic may respond to the transformation of enso the interannual variations of precipitation δ18o values at jiguan cave were influenced by enso which is derived by circulation effect sun et al 2018 sun et al 2018 suggested that el niño years are more influenced by moisture from the proximal source i e the west pacific whereas la niña years are more affected by moisture from the remote source i e the indian ocean although there was no seasonal variation in drip water δ18o it exhibited dramatic changes in 2010 and 2015 fig 6a interestingly the variation in the δ13cdic values of the drip water was opposite to the variation in the δ18o values during these two periods a rapid increase was observed after june 2010 and a rapid decrease was observed in 2015 fig 6b previous studies have suggested that there may be more precipitation in eastern asia during el niño decay years ju and slingo 1995 zheng and zhu 2015 the year 2010 was an el niño decay year and the el niño event in 2015 was the most powerful in this century the precipitation increased significantly fig 6f owing to the higher precipitation the microbial activity in the soil was stronger the soil co2 production rate was higher li and li 2018 the atmospheric precipitation dissolved more soil co2 that contains partial negative 13c into the epikarst zone and the δ13cdic value of drip water was significantly lower fig 6b therefore the rainfall amount is responsible for the δ13cdic of the drip water in summary the δ13cdic and δ18o values exhibit opposite trends but both indirectly respond to the large scale atmospheric circulation conditions 5 4 transportation of carbon isotope signals within the karst cave system in general all of the δ13c values of the plants 28 1 to 23 3 above jiguan cave fall within the range of modern c3 vegetation i e 20 to 35 deines 1980 cerling 1984 staddon 2004 therefore the plants overlying jiguan cave are typical c3 plants characterized by distinct negative δ13c values the isotope fractionation that occurs during the decomposition of soil organic matter by microbes results in an unequal distribution of 13c and 12c carbon isotopes in the different carbon phases trumbore 2000 relatively more light isotopes 12c would transform into the released co2 and more 13c enters the organic matter of microbes and eventually returns to the soil organic matter luo and wang 2009 li et al 2012 the wet and hot season promotes the decomposition of microorganisms in the soil resulting in higher δ13c of soil organic matter than the overlying plants fig 7 the enrichment from the soil layer to the drip water approximately 5 indicates a sufficient isotopic exchange between the dic in soil water and the co2 in soil baker et al 1997 fairchild et al 2006a the process of soil water migrating through the fracture pipes to form cave drip water is influenced by water rock interaction and pcp tooth and fairchild 2003 karst water dissolved more bedrock with heavier 13c during the migration of the epikarst zone because of co2 degassing from seepage water and the promotion of calcite precipitation resulting in more positive δ13cdic values of the drip water when the drip water dripped due to the lower pco2 within cave and supersaturated drip water to calcite co2 escaped from drip water resulting in the precipitation of speleothems caco3 hendy 1971 luo and wang 2009 thus the δ13c values of the modern speleothem are more positive than drip water fig 7 a previous study in jiguan cave suggested that the speleothems inherited the signal of drip water and the enso driven precipitation δ18o variations can be transferred to modern speleothems by drips sun et al 2018 according to the analysis in section 5 3 δ13c and δ18o values of drip water can response to enso the synchronous changes in the δ13c and δ18o values of the modern speleothems especially significant decreases in the δ13c and δ18o values in 2013 extremely drought year fig 6d and e indicating that the δ13c signal of speleothem also is affected by temperature and precipitation which may be related to enso 5 5 implications for paleoclimate reconstruction from stalagmite record the processes and factors governing the δ13cdic variability of cave water have important implications for the interpretation of δ13c time series in speleothems as proxy records of climate driven carbon transport changes in cave environments lambert and aharon 2011 speleothem δ13c values have a large biogenic component originating from vegetation and soil activity above the cave which are strongly dependent on the amount of precipitation and local air temperature fohlmeister et al 2020 although the δ13c signal may be disturbed by many inorganic factors these factors are also mainly driven by the changes of local climate and environment mcdermott 2004 fairchild et al 2006a li et al 2018 2020 tan et al 2020a 2020b the δ13c record of stalagmite dsy 1201 and the precipitation record for this area show obvious synchronous changes over the past 60 years with lower δ13c values in wet years and higher values in drought years fig 8 the changes of vegetation types above the cave can be ruled out as the primary cause of the variation in stalagmite δ13c since these changes would occur on a longer time scale rather than on decadal scale vegetation density and karst processes are more suitable explanations for the observed variations in dsy 1201 δ13c values during the dry period lower levels of precipitation reduced vegetation cover and density and the higher temperature enhanced evaporation which can quickly reduce the water stored in soils and decrease the plant root respiration and soil organic matter content cosford et al 2009 kennett et al 2012 lechleitner et al 2017 fohlmeister et al 2020 resulting in more positive δ13c values in drip water and speleothems moreover a dry climate would increase residence time of the seepage water and favor more bedrock dissolution mcdermott 2004 rudzka et al 2011 tan et al 2013 in addition enhanced pcp in the vadose zone above the cave prolongs the co2 degassing within the cave bar matthews et al 1996 baker et al 1997 tan et al 2020a all these factors taken together result in the positive δ13c values on the contrary wet climate conditions benefit vegetation growth and biological productivity resulting in higher soil activity more input of isotopically light organic carbon into soil water and weaker the water rack interaction and co2 degassing which may contribute to the relatively low δ13c values genty et al 2003 mcdermott 2004 therefore stalagmite δ13c are tightly connected to local climate conditions there may be more precipitation in eastern asia during el niño decay years ju and slingo 1995 zheng and zhu 2015 thus the wet years correspond to enso conversion years i e the transition of el niño events to la niña events fig 8a and c our observations argue in favor of that a climate driven shift in hydrogeochemical effects as the dominant factor governing the long term changes of speleothem δ13c on the decadal scale therefore we suggest that stalagmite δ13c can be a potential proxy that reflects the changes of precipitation and indirectly responds to the transformation of enso 6 conclusions based on the continuous monitoring of jiguan cave from 2010 to 2019 we reached the following conclusions 1 the δ13cdic values of cave water exhibited both the seasonal and interannual variations the relatively high humidity and soil pco2 and air stagnation in cave caused more negative δ13c values of cave water during summer and vice versa in winter the carbon isotopes and trace element ratios of the cave water reflect the wet dry conditions and are sensitive to extreme drought events caused by the decrease in summer monsoon precipitation on the interannual scales 2 the carbon isotope compositions in karst cave systems are continuously enriched when migrating from the vegetation to the soil to the cave drip water to the modern deposits although both δ13c and δ18o of the drip water respond to enso the δ13c is mainly affected by local precipitation induced by enso while the δ18o drip water can record the variation of precipitation δ18o by circulation effect the enso indirectly drives the interannual pattern of drip water δ13c which can be transferred to speleothems 3 precipitation is the dominant factor controlling the residence time of the seepage water future affect the bedrock dissolution pcp in the unsaturated zone above the cave and the degassing of co2 within the cave which finally influenced the δ13c values of stalagmite dsy 1201 on the decadal scale carbon isotopes in stalagmite can be a potential proxy related to local hydrological climate and indirectly reflect enso credit authorship contribution statement yidong li writing original draft formal analysis investigation yan yang formal analysis investigation writing

5016,cave monitoring is crucial to unraveling the factors controlling carbon isotope compositions and their transportation in karst systems here we report a 10 year 2010 2019 cave monitoring of carbon isotopes from the plants soil cave water and speleothems in jiguan cave central china located on the chinese north south divide in an area that is sensitive to the asian monsoon the results show that the cave ventilation and soil air co2 controlled by the local temperature and humidity conditions are responsible for the seasonal variability in the δ13cdic values the variation in the δ13cdic values and trace element ratios of the cave water are sensitive to the local hydrological conditions although there is the lag time from precipitation to cave water in drought year the δ13cdic and trace element ratios mg ca ba ca and sr ca of cave water are strongly coupled and reflect the extreme drought due to the influence of prior calcite precipitation pcp and water rock interaction the 10 year monitoring period covered two complete el niño southern oscillation enso cycles during the two strong el niño years 2010 and 2015 the cave drip water δ13cdic values were negative but the δ18o values were positive this opposite trend is mainly due to their different controlling mechanisms the rainfall amount and moisture sources are responsible for the δ13cdic and δ18o values of the drip water respectively throughout the karst cave system the carbon isotopes in jiguan cave are continuously enriched when migrating from the vegetation to the soil to the cave drip water to the modern speleothems comparisons with the stalagmite δ13c records for the nearby jiguan cave suggest that stalagmite carbon isotopes may reflect the regional precipitation changes induced by the enso on the decadal scale overall we demonstrate that the δ13c is a potentially reliable proxy that records the changes in the regional environment especially precipitation changes and is also a sensitive indictor that indirectly reflects enso keywords carbon isotopes karst hydrology el niño southern oscillation extreme drought events modern speleothems 1 introduction cave speleothems formed by water rock interactions are a rare and important source of information for the study of paleoclimate evolution in karst areas wang et al 2001 shopov et al 2004 yuan et al 2004 banner et al 2007 cheng et al 2009 2016 cai et al 2010 the stalagmite δ18o is the most widely used environmental proxy and has been extensively used to reconstruct paleoclimates yuan et al 2004 cobb et al 2007 tan et al 2009 2018 2020a 2020b pausata et al 2011 maher and thompson 2012 tan 2014 zhao et al 2019 liu et al 2020 nevertheless the interpretation of stalagmite δ18o is still debated in general previous interpretations of speleothem δ18o have primarily focused on the rainfall amount effect hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 goldsmith et al 2017 temperature effect paulsen et al 2003 feng et al 2014 monsoon intensity yuan et al 2004 wang et al 2005 cheng et al 2016 moisture source change cobb et al 2007 maher 2008 maher and thompson 2012 and circulation effect tan 2014 2016 sun et al 2018 although stalagmite δ13c are not as widely used as δ18o previous studies suggested that carbon isotopes are more sensitive to changes in the local climate and ecological environment than oxygen isotopes frappier 2013 li et al 2020 and the δ13c time series can be used as a valuable supplement to δ18o compositions lambert and aharon 2011 lechleitner et al 2017 many scholars have discussed the climate and environment information recorded by carbon isotopes fairchild et al 2000 tan et al 2013 li et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and used δ13c as an important proxy in paleoclimate and paleoenvironment reconstruction dorale et al 1992 coplen et al 1994 bar matthews et al 1999 genty et al 2003 woo et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 tan et al 2020a 2020b however the migration process of δ13c signals in the entire cave system is affected by diverse complex factors including climatic and non climatic factors which pose a significant challenge in explaining and interpreting the carbon isotope compositions of stalagmites the types and density of vegetation overlying the cave and soil respiration rate affect the δ13c of soil air co2 and indirectly reflect the changes of external climatic conditions cerling 1984 bar matthews et al 1997 dorale et al 1998 mcdermott 2004 fleitmann et al 2009 speleothem δ13c values are also influenced by the inorganic processes operating in the soil zone deeper within the unsaturated zone and during calcite reprecipitation in the cave cosford et al 2009 the degree of open versus closed system dissolution of the carbonate bedrock affects speleothem δ13c values by controlling the proportions of carbon from different sources hendy 1971 genty et al 2003 fairchild et al 2006a rudzka et al 2011 in addition prior carbonate precipitation pcp in the vadose zone cave ventilation and the degassing of co2 from the drip water also influence the final δ13c values recorded in the speleothems baker et al 1997 verheyden et al 2000 spötl et al 2005 fairchild et al 2006a baldini et al 2008 pu et al 2017 due to the complexity of the above factors the application of speleothem δ13c to reconstruct environmental changes has been limited the hydrological information provided by the trace element compositions of the cave water is an important proxy for reconstructing climate changes fairchild and treble 2009 chen and li 2018 zhang and li 2019 multiple mechanisms control the trace elements composition of drip water including the composition of the local soil and bedrock the types of flow paths the residence time of underground water water rock interaction the extent and intensity of pcp incongruent calcite dissolution and the mixing of old and fresh water tooth and fairchild 2003 fairchild and treble 2009 sherwin and baldini 2011 wong et al 2011 these factors which may affect the trace element ratios of drip water have direct or indirect links to the precipitation zhang and li 2019 the combination of carbon isotope and trace element compositions can be used to rule out several possible mechanisms for the changes in stalagmite δ13c hellstrom and mcculloch 2000 mcdermott 2004 zhang et al 2015 moreover applying a multi proxy approach such as δ18o and trace elements can better constrain speleothem δ13c variability and shed light on the dominant processes that influence δ13c variability in a given cave system oster et al 2010 fohlmeister et al 2017 2020 cave monitoring can provide the opportunity to explore the transmission processes of δ13c signals and quantify the effects of the seasonal and multi year changes in the cave environment on the δ13c record and finally to evaluate the roles of various factors on speleothem δ13c values genty and massault 1999 baker and brunsdon 2003 spötl et al 2005 fairchild et al 2006a fuller et al 2008 lambert and aharon 2011 in this study a 10 year monitoring program 2010 2019 was conducted in jiguan cave which is located in an area of central china that is sensitive to variations in the asian monsoon and the western pacific subtropical high wpsh previous monitoring results have shown that the interannual δ18o of precipitation correspond to the variations in the el niño southern oscillation enso which supports the interpretation of the circulation effect sun et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 found that the changes in the δ18o values of drip water and modern calcite are correlated with the shifts of wpsh and they used a high resolution δ18o record from dongshiya cave which is near jiguan cave to reconstruct the variations of the wpsh western boundary however interpretations of the carbon isotope in cave system are rarely reported here we present a 10 year study on carbon isotope and trace element compositions of the jiguan cave system and compare with the high resolution δ13c speleothem dsy 1201 record that reported in dongshiya cave zhao et al 2019 this study mainly focuses on the following questions 1 the factors affecting the carbon isotope records in karst cave on different time scales e g seasonal annual and decadal 2 the responses of trace elements ratios and carbon isotopes in cave water to the external environment 3 the responses of karst hydrology δ13c values to enso and their implications for the use of δ13c records in paleoclimate reconstruction 2 study area jiguan cave 33 46 n 111 34 e and dongshiya cave are located in the north slope of funiu mountain which is approximately 4 km southwest of luanchuan county henan province central china fig 1 a and b the two caves are about 300 m away from each other zhao et al 2019 the site is located in the northern part of the qinling mountains huaihe river line in the northern part of the yangtze river and yellow river watershed the study area is in the transition zone between the humid region and the semiarid region and it is sensitive to the asian summer monsoon the mean annual temperature and precipitation recorded at the meteorological station in luanchuan were 12 4 c and 838 mm 1957 2019 respectively supplementary table s1 owing to the influence of the monsoon more than 50 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in summer the overlying bedrock is relatively thin and mainly consists of sinian chloritization marble with a thickness of 30 40 m fig 2 the surface vegetation has mainly been a secondary deciduous broad leaved forest since about 1993 the soil overlying the mountain is brown soil with a thickness of 10 60 cm the elevation of the entrance of jiguan cave is approximately 900 m the length is approximately 5600 m and one third of the cave has been developed for tourism sun et al 2018 during the monitoring period the temperature in the cave ranged from 13 5 to 17 0 averaged of 15 5 and the relative humidity was remained higher than 90 all year round indicating that the internal environment of jiguan cave is relatively closed 3 sample collection and data analysis 3 1 sample collection soil profile was excavated at altitudes of 900 920 m from the roof of jiguan cave fig 1c to avoid potential cross contamination of the subsamples of soil profile the soil subsamples were collected from bottom to top at intervals of 5 cm leaf branch and root samples were collected from the dominant plants near each soil section five cave water sampling sites were monitored in jiguan cave fig 1d including one underground river dth dong tian he two drip water sites lyxs li yu xi shui and tgbd tian gong bing deng and two pool sites yzt yu zhu tan and ycg yao chi gong the polypropylene bottles that were used to collect the water samples were rinsed in 1 1 hcl and deionized water prior to the sample collection pre washed 0 45 μm millipore nitrocellulose filters were used to filter the water samples before the samples were added to the sample bottles a pre cleaned container not acid washed was left for 1 3 h to collect the drip water and then aliquots were poured into acid cleaned polypropylene sample bottles the trace level ultrapure hno3 1 1 was added to achieve the ph value of 2 for cation samples to avoid isotope fractionation caused by microorganisms 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution was added to the dissolved inorganic carbon dic samples all of the samples were sealed transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analyzed the cave water sites were sampled at two month intervals starting in 2010 and at one month intervals starting in april 2019 two circular glass plates were placed under the drip sites to collect modern deposits the glass plates were replaced every two months and were dried naturally at room temperature after being rinsed with deionized water powder subsamples were scraped from the modern sediment sample on the glass plate using a clean steel knife if no deposits were found the retrieval was temporarily paused 3 2 sample analyses the methods used to measure the oxygen isotopes of the water samples 2009 2016 have been described by sun et al 2018 the samples collected from 2017 to 2019 were analyzed using the picarro l2140 icrds liquid water isotope analyzer at the stable isotope laboratory school of geographical sciences fujian normal university the measurement accuracy was typically 0 08 and the results supplementary table s2 are reported relative to v smow vienna standard mean ocean water the δ13cdic analyses were conducted in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environments at southwest university and in the isotope laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences the analyses were performed using a delta v plus mass spectrometer connected to a gas bench pre treatment apparatus the analysis precision was better than 0 2 1σ the δ18o and δ13c values of the modern speleothems supplementary table s3 were measured using a finnigan delta v plus gas isotope mass spectrometer combined with a kiel iv automated carbonate device each sample was analyzed 8 times and the long term 1σ precision is 0 1 for δ18o and 0 06 for δ13c the methods used to measure the carbon isotopes of the plant and soil organic matter have been described by li et al 2012 the analyses were conducted in the geochemistry and isotope laboratory at southwest university all of the carbon isotopic results supplementary table s4 obtained in this study are reported relative to v pdb vienna pee dee belemnite the ca ba sr and mg concentrations of the samples were measured using an optima 2100dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer usa in the chongqing key laboratory of karst environments at southwest university the detection limit was 0 001 mg l 1 and the relative uncertainty of the measurements is less than 2 the data is presented in supplementary table s5 3 3 cave monitoring and meteorological data we installed co2 monitoring devices between the bedrock and soil on the southern slope above jiguan cave in may 2019 fig 1c the ranges of the gmm221 soil co2 concentration sensor vaisala finland the av 10t soil temperature sensor usa and the av ec5 soil moisture sensor are 0 20000 10 6 40 140 0 100 respectively with precisions of 1 0 1 and 0 1 respectively a testo 535 infrared co2 tester produced in germany with range of 0 9999 ppmv was used to monitor the cave air co2 at five monitoring sites the soil air pco2 and cave air pco2 data are presented in supplementary tables s6 and s7 respectively the temperature and precipitation data supplementary table s1 collected before april 2019 were obtained from the meteorological station in luanchuan county henan province in april 2019 a vantage pro field meteorologicalstation produced by davis was installed near the soil monitoring site to automatically log the temperature and precipitation data every 15 min with precisions of 0 1 and 0 01 mm respectively fig 1c the precipitation anomaly percentage was used to classify the extremely dry and wet years the calculation formula is as follows p a p p p 100 where pa is the percentage of precipitation anomaly p is the annual precipitation in a year and p is the average multi year precipitation generally the wet and dry years are distinguished by pa values of 15 and 15 respectively in particular a year with a pa value of less than or equal to 40 was defined as an extremely drought year and that with the pa value of greater than or equal to 40 was defined as an extremely wet year wei et al 2017 the niño 3 4 sea surface temperature anomaly ssta data http www cpc ncep noaa gov data indices sstoi indices were downloaded from the climate prediction center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 4 results 4 1 local temperature and precipitation as is showed in fig 3 d the monthly mean temperature data varied with season it was lower in winter mean t 1 8 1 0 and higher in summer mean t 23 3 1 5 all of in this paper represent the standard deviations the local precipitation exhibited obvious seasonal changes and was mainly concentrated in the summer however the highest monthly precipitation occurred in different months each year the total annual precipitation reached its peak 1105 mm in 2010 and then it gradually decreased reaching its lowest point 435 mm in 2013 the total amount of precipitation gradually increased from 2013 to 2015 and then it decreased after 2015 according to the 10 year percentage of precipitation anomaly supplementary table s8 the pa values in 2010 2011 and 2015 were 50 29 and 24 respectively thus these years were classified as wet years the pa values in 2013 and 2019 were 41 and 27 respectively thus they were classified as dry years in particular the pa values in 2010 and 2013 were higher than 40 and lower than 40 classifying them as extremely wet and extremely dry years respectively in 2010 the precipitation on july 24 alone was as high as 155 mm this high rainfall event led to severe flooding in study area from july 2013 to june 2014 the weather was extremely dry the precipitation gradually increased after july 2014 and reached a peak of 242 mm in september in the autumn of 2017 a relative severe drought event occurred the precipitation was as high as 192 mm in september and sharply decreasedto 62 mm in october fig 3d we also analyzed the percentage of precipitation anomaly data supplementary table s1 for the past 60 years and found that the extremely wet years included 1964 65 and 1973 43 and the relatively wet years included 1967 1983 1984 1996 2005 and 2010 the dry years included 1966 1969 1972 1976 1978 1986 1991 1997 1999 2012 and 2016 to 2019 among them 2013 48 was an extremely drought year 4 2 δ13cdic values of cave water the δ13cdic values of the drip water pool water and the underground river are presented in table 1 the δ13cdic values of both drip sites and the pool sites exhibited seasonal variations but the drip water δ13cdic values exhibited more variable time series than the pool water fig 3a and c the δ13cdic values of the pool water exhibited clear seasonal signals with summer fall months having lower δ13cdic values than the winter early spring months when the δ13cdic was substantially more 13c enriched fig 3c on the annual scale the δ13cdic values of the cave water were the most negative in 2010 and then they gradually increased the δ13cdic values were the most positive in 2014 and then they decreased fig 3 4 3 pco2 of the soil and cave air the soil air pco2 overlying jiguan cave exhibited significant seasonal variations from may to december with higher values in the summer and lower values in the winter this variation pattern was quite consistent with that of the precipitation fig 4 b the cave air pco2 exhibited a significant seasonal variation pattern that was higher in the summer and lower in the winter fig 4c however the pco2 of the four sites varied within different ranges from 2017 to 2019 the pco2 of the four monitoring sites in the cave ranged from 347 ppmv to 1782 ppmv for yzt 335 ppmv to 2503 ppmv for dth 429 ppmv to 4520 ppmv for ycg and 462 ppmv to 4980 ppmv for lyxs with averages of 743 1028 1727 and 2096 ppmv respectively the trends and amplitudes of the variations of drip water site lyxs and the nearby pool water site ycg were similar and both were significantly higher than those of sites dth and yzt fig 4c 4 4 the trace element compositions of cave water the trace element compositions and ratios of the three types of cave water are summarized in table 2 mg ca values range from 0 29 to 0 50 mg l sr ca values range from 0 85 to 2 36 mg l and ba ca values range from 0 19 to 0 66 mg l table 2 the mg ca sr ca and ba ca values of the pool water and the underground river exhibited similar trends with obvious seasonal characteristics i e higher values in the dry season and lower values in the rainy season although the trace element ratios of the drip water lyxs were relatively stable overall and did not exhibit seasonal variations all three types of cave water showed significantly similar fluctuations in 2014 and 2017 fig 5 4 5 δ18o values of the drip water and δ13c values of the modern deposits plants and soils the δ18o values of drip water fluctuated from 10 2 to 6 5 although there was no seasonal variation in drip water δ18o it showed dramatic changes with a rapid decrease of 3 55 from 2009 to 2010 and a rapid increase of 2 23 in 2015 fig 6 a the δ13c values of modern speleothems ranged from 12 0 to 5 2 average of 9 0 1 7 for lyxs and from 9 0 to 12 5 average of 10 9 1 0 for tgbd the modern speleothems δ13c values exhibited seasonal variations in 2010 and 2011 negative in summer and positive in winter the severe drought led to a hiatus in the depositional record in 2013 and carbonate recovered in november 2014 since drought was released by the increasing rainfall and drips were oversaturated for precipitation sun et al 2017 obviously the variations in modern speleothem δ13c values were synchronous with the δ18o variations fig 6d and e the δ13c values of the plant subsamples ranged from 23 3 to 28 1 with an average of 26 0 1 1 the average δ13c value of the organic matter in the soil subsamples collected from the soil profile was 16 7 2 2 which is 9 higher than that of the plants 4 6 dsy 1201 carbon isotope time series the δ13c records from stalagmite dsy 1201 in dongshiya cave cover the last 200 years with an average resolution of 1 5 months zhao et al 2019 the δ13c values range from 5 6 to 11 6 average of 9 7 the large amplitude of the δ13c record is consistent with the range of the modern calcite δ13c values 5 2 to 12 0 obtained from the monitoring and sample collection conducted between 2010 and 2019 for this study here we only discuss the time period after 1950 i e 1950 2012 5 discussions 5 1 factors affecting the cave water δ13cdic on the seasonal scale in general the δ13cdic values of cave waterare effected by complex factors including the co2 released by the respiration of vegetation roots the decomposition of soil organic matter bedrock carbonate dissolution pcp and within cave processes such as co2 degassing genty et al 2001 mickler et al 2004 spötl et al 2005 fairchild et al 2006a frisia et al 2011 all of these processes above are driven by the fractionation of the carbon isotopic where co2 degassing from drip water causes the fractionation the co2 degassing of the cave drip water depends on the cave air pco2 which is mainly controlled by the overlying soil co2 and cave ventilation spötl et al 2005 baldini et al 2008 lambert and aharon 2011 pu et al 2017 on the one hand precipitation and consequently vegetation and soil activity microbial activity and root respiration are maximized during the wet season lechleitner et al 2017 resulting in the highest relative humidity and soil pco2 during this period fig 4 in principle the enhanced respiration of plant roots and the decomposition of microbes in the soil result in more 12c co2 gas being dissolved in the soil water and eventually entering the cave li et al 2012 which contributes to the negative values of δ13cdic conversely the decrease of temperature and rainfall and biomass dormancy accounts for impoverishment of soil derived co2 fluxes in winter fig 4b the amount of co2 dissolved in the groundwater decreases resulting in a reduction of the air pco2 in jiguan cave fig 4c which leads to enhanced degassing of co2 from the solution and enriches drip water in 13c it seems that the variations in δ13cdic values of cave water can be attribute to the variations of soil air co2 derived by local temperature and humid conditions however the seasonal variations in the temperate and moist conditions are not completely synchronized with cave air co2 fig 4a and c this may be caused by the cave ventilation in summer the temperature of the cave air is lower than that of the external air which causes a negative pressure gradient the air stagnation in cave results in relatively weak ventilation effect and co2 build up in cave thus increasing the cave air pco2 fig 4c and restricting the degassing of co2 from drip water spötl et al 2005 frisia et al 2011 dreybrodt et al 2016 as a result the drip water has more negative δ13c values in summer and vice versa in winter fig 3a our results are consistent with the results of previous studies conducted in other caves such obir cave spötl et al 2005 the desoto caverns lambert and aharon 2011 furong cave li et al 2011 and mawmluh cave breitenbach et al 2015 actually the timing and degree of degassing also affect the δ13c values of cave water li et al 2012 given the longer degassing time of the pool water compared to that of the drip water the δ13cdic values of the pool water are more positive and the seasonal changes are more obvious than those of the drip water fig 3 therefore we conclude that the seasonal variability of cave air pco2 caused by soil air co2 and cave ventilation are the major controlling factors for cave water δ13c in jiguan cave 5 2 factors affecting the δ13cdic values and trace element compositions of the cave water on the annual scale the variation of cave water δ13cdic responded to the changes of dry and wet conditions on interannual scales fig 3 generally the precipitation infiltrates from the surface to a cave is usually accompanied by damping and the lag times of the preserved climate signal tooth and fairchild 2003 fairchild et al 2006b treble et al 2013 hu et al 2020 lyu et al 2020a as reported by sun et al 2018 the drips in jiguan cave mainly reflect the latest rainy precipitation in ordinary years and the lag time from precipitation to drips is about 2 months liang et al 2017 that means the residence time of seepage water from surface to cave is relative shorter which may not affect the interannual signal of drip water δ13c the wet years 2010 and 2015 experienced increased precipitation in particular in july and august 2010 the rainfall amounts successively reached the maximum monthly precipitation for that year fig 3d large amounts of precipitation in a short period of time resulted in the groundwater move rapidly in the epikarst zone which shortened the water rock interaction time the drip rate of cave water increased pcp and co2 degassing were weakened resulting in lower cave water δ13cdic values fairchild et al 2006a after 2010 the climate became dry the precipitation decreased year by year and the δ13cdic values of cave water became increasingly positive fig 3 in the extremely dry year 2013 the rainy precipitation was significantly less than usual and partly lost by evaporation in the soil it is likely that cave water δ13c values will reached to the heaviest as the severe drought actually the most positive cave water δ13cdic values and the highest trace element ratios appeared in 2014 fig 5a suggesting that a significant residence time of the water in the epikarst and the drips δ13c reflect the combination of corresponding rainy precipitation and previous water in the overlying aquifer riechelmann et al 2011 our speculation is consistent with the results calculated by the bivariate model of oxygen isotope in sun et al 2018 the precipitation in 2013 was not directly converted into drip water and contributed to less than 10 the contribution of 2014 to drips increased to 40 which corresponded to the rainfall recovery in the rainy season in 2014 therefore although before september 2014 the drip water in the cave was a mixture of young precipitation water provided by fracture flow and old water it still reflects the arid climate conditions given the decrease in precipitation caused by the drought during this period the migration rate of atmospheric precipitation in the karst surface zone slowed down the residence time of groundwater was prolonged the water rock interaction were strong the time available for the cave water to dissolve the bedrock was long huang and fairchild 2001 musgrove and banner 2004 zhao et al 2015 all of these factors combined together led to the higher δ13cdic values of drip water the variability in trace elements ratios of drip water related to hydrological conditions is consistent with interannual drip water δ13cdic variations fig 5 notably significant peaks valleys in trace element ratios usually occurred during the extreme dry wet transition events indicating that trace element ratios may be sensitive to hydrological changes from dry to wet conditions fig 5 because the drought lasted for more than a year 2013 2014 the pathway of groundwater may have been relatively open in the epikarst zone which facilitated the degassing of co2 and the deposition of carbonate along the flow path wong et al 2011 as the water rock interaction increased more bedrock was dissolved and more mg2 was released into the groundwater fairchild et al 2000 moreover the preferential deposition of ca2 over mg2 and sr2 caused by pcp resulted in higher mg ca ratios karmann et al 2007 wong et al 2011 tremaine and froelich 2013 casteel and banner 2015 in contrast the precipitation increased after the long period of drought fig 5e the groundwater penetrated the soil and bedrock more rapidly shortening the water rock interaction time the increased rate of bedrock dissolution caused the higher metal ions concentrations in drip water leading to a decrease of the ba ca sr ca and mg ca fig 5b c and d the cave air pco2 is also an important factor affecting the trace element ratios of cave water banner et al 2007 sherwin and baldini 2011 wong et al 2011 treble et al 2015 the monitoring results revealed that the average cave air pco2 values exhibited obvious variations which were consistent with the temperature and precipitation variations in particular in 2019 a drought year there was a sharp decrease fig 4c on the one hand the variations in the cave air pco2 were mainly affected by the natural environment outside the cave and were controlled by the changes in the co2 content of the overlying soil whereas the soil co2 concentration was affected by the root respiration and the biological activity in the overlying soil knorr et al 2005 davidson et al 2006 on the other hand the changes of cave air pco2 may be caused by cave ventilation spötl et al 2005 lyu et al 2020b however the ventilation type of stagnant in summer and flowing in winter in jiguan cave had little influence on the interannual variation of cave air pco2 therefore temperature and precipitation may be significant factors affecting the air pco2 in jiguan cave on interannual scales after the extreme drought biological activity increased as the recovery of precipitation recovered starting in june 2014 resulting in a large amount of soil co2 entering the cave through the groundwater and cracks increasing the co2 content of the cave air which inhibited co2 degassing from the cave water baldini et al 2008 and finally caused a decrease in the sr ca ba ca and mg ca ratios fig 5 therefore we suspect that the variations in the δ13cdic values and trace element ratios of the cave water were consistent with the changes in the local hydrological conditions 5 3 the response of carbon isotope composition of the drip water to enso the 10 year monitoring period experienced two complete enso cycles from el niño in 2010 to la niña in 2011 and from strong el niño in 2015 to la niña in 2017 and a weaker el niño that resumed in 2018 the δ13cdic values of the drip water were quite consistent with the enso fig 6b and c the average δ13cdic values of drip water were continuously enriched from the most negative value in 2010 12 7 to 4 8 in 2014 then they gradually became more negative after 2014 and enriched again after 2018 table 3 moreover the δ13cdic values of two drip water sites correlated well with the nino 3 4 sst anomaly table 4 indicating that the cave drip water δ13cdic may respond to the transformation of enso the interannual variations of precipitation δ18o values at jiguan cave were influenced by enso which is derived by circulation effect sun et al 2018 sun et al 2018 suggested that el niño years are more influenced by moisture from the proximal source i e the west pacific whereas la niña years are more affected by moisture from the remote source i e the indian ocean although there was no seasonal variation in drip water δ18o it exhibited dramatic changes in 2010 and 2015 fig 6a interestingly the variation in the δ13cdic values of the drip water was opposite to the variation in the δ18o values during these two periods a rapid increase was observed after june 2010 and a rapid decrease was observed in 2015 fig 6b previous studies have suggested that there may be more precipitation in eastern asia during el niño decay years ju and slingo 1995 zheng and zhu 2015 the year 2010 was an el niño decay year and the el niño event in 2015 was the most powerful in this century the precipitation increased significantly fig 6f owing to the higher precipitation the microbial activity in the soil was stronger the soil co2 production rate was higher li and li 2018 the atmospheric precipitation dissolved more soil co2 that contains partial negative 13c into the epikarst zone and the δ13cdic value of drip water was significantly lower fig 6b therefore the rainfall amount is responsible for the δ13cdic of the drip water in summary the δ13cdic and δ18o values exhibit opposite trends but both indirectly respond to the large scale atmospheric circulation conditions 5 4 transportation of carbon isotope signals within the karst cave system in general all of the δ13c values of the plants 28 1 to 23 3 above jiguan cave fall within the range of modern c3 vegetation i e 20 to 35 deines 1980 cerling 1984 staddon 2004 therefore the plants overlying jiguan cave are typical c3 plants characterized by distinct negative δ13c values the isotope fractionation that occurs during the decomposition of soil organic matter by microbes results in an unequal distribution of 13c and 12c carbon isotopes in the different carbon phases trumbore 2000 relatively more light isotopes 12c would transform into the released co2 and more 13c enters the organic matter of microbes and eventually returns to the soil organic matter luo and wang 2009 li et al 2012 the wet and hot season promotes the decomposition of microorganisms in the soil resulting in higher δ13c of soil organic matter than the overlying plants fig 7 the enrichment from the soil layer to the drip water approximately 5 indicates a sufficient isotopic exchange between the dic in soil water and the co2 in soil baker et al 1997 fairchild et al 2006a the process of soil water migrating through the fracture pipes to form cave drip water is influenced by water rock interaction and pcp tooth and fairchild 2003 karst water dissolved more bedrock with heavier 13c during the migration of the epikarst zone because of co2 degassing from seepage water and the promotion of calcite precipitation resulting in more positive δ13cdic values of the drip water when the drip water dripped due to the lower pco2 within cave and supersaturated drip water to calcite co2 escaped from drip water resulting in the precipitation of speleothems caco3 hendy 1971 luo and wang 2009 thus the δ13c values of the modern speleothem are more positive than drip water fig 7 a previous study in jiguan cave suggested that the speleothems inherited the signal of drip water and the enso driven precipitation δ18o variations can be transferred to modern speleothems by drips sun et al 2018 according to the analysis in section 5 3 δ13c and δ18o values of drip water can response to enso the synchronous changes in the δ13c and δ18o values of the modern speleothems especially significant decreases in the δ13c and δ18o values in 2013 extremely drought year fig 6d and e indicating that the δ13c signal of speleothem also is affected by temperature and precipitation which may be related to enso 5 5 implications for paleoclimate reconstruction from stalagmite record the processes and factors governing the δ13cdic variability of cave water have important implications for the interpretation of δ13c time series in speleothems as proxy records of climate driven carbon transport changes in cave environments lambert and aharon 2011 speleothem δ13c values have a large biogenic component originating from vegetation and soil activity above the cave which are strongly dependent on the amount of precipitation and local air temperature fohlmeister et al 2020 although the δ13c signal may be disturbed by many inorganic factors these factors are also mainly driven by the changes of local climate and environment mcdermott 2004 fairchild et al 2006a li et al 2018 2020 tan et al 2020a 2020b the δ13c record of stalagmite dsy 1201 and the precipitation record for this area show obvious synchronous changes over the past 60 years with lower δ13c values in wet years and higher values in drought years fig 8 the changes of vegetation types above the cave can be ruled out as the primary cause of the variation in stalagmite δ13c since these changes would occur on a longer time scale rather than on decadal scale vegetation density and karst processes are more suitable explanations for the observed variations in dsy 1201 δ13c values during the dry period lower levels of precipitation reduced vegetation cover and density and the higher temperature enhanced evaporation which can quickly reduce the water stored in soils and decrease the plant root respiration and soil organic matter content cosford et al 2009 kennett et al 2012 lechleitner et al 2017 fohlmeister et al 2020 resulting in more positive δ13c values in drip water and speleothems moreover a dry climate would increase residence time of the seepage water and favor more bedrock dissolution mcdermott 2004 rudzka et al 2011 tan et al 2013 in addition enhanced pcp in the vadose zone above the cave prolongs the co2 degassing within the cave bar matthews et al 1996 baker et al 1997 tan et al 2020a all these factors taken together result in the positive δ13c values on the contrary wet climate conditions benefit vegetation growth and biological productivity resulting in higher soil activity more input of isotopically light organic carbon into soil water and weaker the water rack interaction and co2 degassing which may contribute to the relatively low δ13c values genty et al 2003 mcdermott 2004 therefore stalagmite δ13c are tightly connected to local climate conditions there may be more precipitation in eastern asia during el niño decay years ju and slingo 1995 zheng and zhu 2015 thus the wet years correspond to enso conversion years i e the transition of el niño events to la niña events fig 8a and c our observations argue in favor of that a climate driven shift in hydrogeochemical effects as the dominant factor governing the long term changes of speleothem δ13c on the decadal scale therefore we suggest that stalagmite δ13c can be a potential proxy that reflects the changes of precipitation and indirectly responds to the transformation of enso 6 conclusions based on the continuous monitoring of jiguan cave from 2010 to 2019 we reached the following conclusions 1 the δ13cdic values of cave water exhibited both the seasonal and interannual variations the relatively high humidity and soil pco2 and air stagnation in cave caused more negative δ13c values of cave water during summer and vice versa in winter the carbon isotopes and trace element ratios of the cave water reflect the wet dry conditions and are sensitive to extreme drought events caused by the decrease in summer monsoon precipitation on the interannual scales 2 the carbon isotope compositions in karst cave systems are continuously enriched when migrating from the vegetation to the soil to the cave drip water to the modern deposits although both δ13c and δ18o of the drip water respond to enso the δ13c is mainly affected by local precipitation induced by enso while the δ18o drip water can record the variation of precipitation δ18o by circulation effect the enso indirectly drives the interannual pattern of drip water δ13c which can be transferred to speleothems 3 precipitation is the dominant factor controlling the residence time of the seepage water future affect the bedrock dissolution pcp in the unsaturated zone above the cave and the degassing of co2 within the cave which finally influenced the δ13c values of stalagmite dsy 1201 on the decadal scale carbon isotopes in stalagmite can be a potential proxy related to local

5017,with increasing aridity in many regions dew is likely to play an increasingly important role in the ecohydrological processes in many ecosystems especially in arid and semiarid regions few studies investigated the role of evaporation during dew formation and how it varies under different climate settings 17o excess as a new tracer could be used to extract information of evaporation dynamics from natural water samples e g precipitation river and lake therefore to fill the knowledge gap in evaporation mechanisms during dew formation we report the isotopic variation δ2h δ18o δ17o and 17o excess of dew and precipitation from three distinct climatic regions i e gobabeb in the central namib desert nice in france with mediterranean climate and indianapolis in the central united states with humid continental climate we examined whether dew formed in different climate settings was affected by different degree of evaporation using observed isotopic values and evaporation models during the formation processes and modeled the effects of key meteorological variables i e temperature and relative humidity on 17o excess variations the results showed that dew in gobabeb experienced kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation under non steady state conditions during dew formation with enriched δ18o and low 17o excess values dew formations with temperatures over 14 7 c in indianapolis were also influenced by evaporation under non steady state conditions however dew formation in nice did not experience significant evaporation evaporation processes equilibrium or kinetic fractionation occurring during nights with heavy dew under three climate settings were mainly related to the variation of atmosphere relative humidity the 17o excess tracer provides a new method to distinguish the different evaporation processes equilibrium or kinetic fractionation during dew formation and our result provides an improved understanding of dew formation keywords drylands ecohydrology equilibrium fractionation kinetic fractionation stable isotopes 1 introduction dew is the condensation of water vapor into liquid droplets on a substrate when the substrate surface temperature drops below the dew point beysens 2018 monteith and unsworth 2013 it usually occurs at night or in early morning when reduced input of shortwave radiation results in a negative net radiation balance at the substrate dew occurs in most climate zones it is an important source of moisture for epiphytes and lichens with special physical features absorbing atmospheric moisture gerlein safdi et al 2018 dew can reach and even exceed annual rainfall and serve as a sustainable and stable water source to maintain plant and small animal survival in arid and semiarid environments kidron et al 2011 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 especially during periods of drought dew could even be the only water source in a continental semiarid grassland aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 it is also viewed as a small but important part of the water balance in humid areas ritter et al 2019 tuller and chilton 1973 dew significantly increased soil water potential such as in namib desert wang et al 2019 it can be directly absorbed by plant roots from soil and can reduce the evaporation loss of soil moisture to mediate water status in water stressed plants aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 munné bosch and alegre 1999 as a water source dew can also be directly absorbed through leaves and then alter leaf level energy balance reduce transpiration rate and improve photosynthesis grammatikopoulos and manetas 1994 guo et al 2016 rao et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 air temperature and relative humidity rh the environmental determinants of dew deposition are expected to change rapidly with climate change and may affect the frequency and amount of dew deposition cook et al 2014 nepstad et al 2008 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 vuollekoski et al 2015 previous studies showed that nocturnal temperatures increase with climate change implying a lower rh and lower dew amounts in the future donat and alexander 2012 martín et al 2012 in a continental scale study it is found that the frequency of dew formation at night in the grasslands is between 15 and 95 during the study period and dew formation has a strong linear relationship with nocturnal rh ritter et al 2019 generally when dew forms the rh of ambient air should be high enough 70 and the substrate surface temperature should drop below the dew point due to radiative cooling lekouch et al 2010 however recent study showed that dew may form at lower rh as long as vapor saturation occur at the air substrate interface kidron and starinsky 2019 for instance a study in the semi arid region of loess plateau of china indicated that dew can form when rh is around 30 wang and zhang 2011 therefore rh controls on dew formation may differ among climate regions most previous research does not consider evaporation during dew formation because it occurs during night or in early morning and evaporation is considered minimum as a result the role of evaporation during dew formation is not well understood however evaporation during dew formation has been observed in the past for instance evaporation during dew formation is observed during 2 00 to 4 00 am in the loess plateau of china leading to a decreasing dew amount wang and zhang 2011 it is also observed in linze inland river basin fang and ding 2005 the knowledge gaps in dew evaporation during formation hinder our understanding of dew formation mechanisms and an accurate prediction of dew formation changes under future climates although the dew amount collected traditional method at sequential times at night or in early morning can be used to indicate evaporation process continuous dew recording is logistically challenging and difficult to implement due to intensive labor requirement stable isotopes of traditional hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o are natural tracers to diagnose changes in different hydrometeorological processes undergoing equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during water phase change crawford et al 2013 cui et al 2020 soderberg et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 the equilibrium fractionation is determined by the saturation vapor pressure the kinetic fractionation is attributed to different diffusivities of different isotopes generally dew is one type of liquid condensation supposedly dominated by equilibrium fractionation to the best of our knowledge there is no effort examining the two fractionation processes equilibrium and kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation during dew formation condensation can be considered as the inverse of evaporation with similar fractionation mechanisms between vapor and liquid as such isotope studies on dew condensation mechanism can be used to better understand the two fractionation processes associated with evaporation during dew formation process for instance the δ18o values in surface dew in brazil consistently tracked atmospheric vapor δ18o values which is generally regarded as the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation process zhang et al 2009 wen et al 2012 point out that the effect of equilibrium fractionation on the δ2h and δ18o of dew is greater than that of the kinetic fractionation although humidity deviated from the saturation conditions by up to 120 on the leaf surface in a cropland and a grassland in china deshpande et al 2013 recognize that dew could involve a certain degree of kinetic fractionation in super saturated environments at a coastal village of india these dew formation studies based on δ2h and δ18o can distinguish equilibrium and kinetic fractionation processes however these studies are either based on the assumption of equilibrium fractionation during condensation zhang et al 2009 or require measuring atmospheric water vapor isotopes and dew isotopes simultaneously deshpande et al 2013 wen et al 2012 recent advance in spectroscopy have now enabled to obtain high precision measurements of δ17o with low natural abundance a new hydrological tracer 17o excess became available to provide additional constraints on the mechanisms of water phase changes barkan and luz 2007 the major advantage of 17o excess over the conventional isotopes is its sole rh dependence between 10 c and 45 c barkan and luz 2005 cao and liu 2011 which is confirmed by field observations landais et al 2010 li et al 2017 uechi and uemura 2019 winkler et al 2012 recent studies also show that the relationship between δ 18o and δ 17o can be used to better reveal tap water and precipitation formation mechanisms tian et al 2020 2019 differentiate synoptic drought and local drought kaseke et al 2018 and distinguish fog and dew kaseke et al 2017 according to the conceptual evaporation model 17o excess and the relationships between different isotopic parameters e g δ 18o vs δ 17o 17o excess vs δ 18o or d excess can be used to infer whether water is affected by equilibrium fractionation or kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation under steady state or non steady state barkan and luz 2005 2007 criss 1999 the evaporation model under steady state condition was based on traditional rayleigh fractionation model rayleigh distillation assumes that water vapor evaporates in isotopic equilibrium condition with no additional sources or vapor recycling processes e g evaporative recharge or atmospheric transport characteristics fiorella et al 2019 winnick et al 2014 however most natural evaporation under non steady state condition depends on external atmospheric vapor therefore the significant difference of boundary conditions between steady state and non steady state models is the existence of atmospheric water vapor resulting in differently shaped evaporation trajectories li et al 2015 the relationships between different isotopic parameters have been used to estimate precipitation evaporation processes in africa and in the central u s landais et al 2010 tian et al 2018 the relationships have also been used to analyze evaporation loss of natural water bodies in the sistan oasis iran surma et al 2015 in central atacama desert chile surma et al 2018 and in western u s passey and ji 2019 overall 17o excess and the relationships between different isotopic parameters are effective to explore the detailed evaporation processes dew research has been largely confined to arid and semiarid environments beysens 2018 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 uclés et al 2015 therefore a large knowledge gap exists to study dew variability among different climatic regions e g arid and humid regions in the inland and near ocean especially for evaporation it is important to understand the environmental factors influencing dew formation in different climate regions and this will better inform us how these factors will affect dew formation under climate change here we investigate dew and precipitation isotopic variations to explore the evaporation mechanisms of dew formation in three different climate settings including gobabeb research and training center hereafter gobabeb in the central namib desert with desert climate nice in france with mediterranean climate and indianapolis in the central united states with humid continental climate we used 17o excess and the relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess to characterize evaporation dynamics under different climate settings and examined the influence of meteorological factors e g temperature and rh on isotopes additionally two evaporation models under steady state i e rayleigh model and non steady state conditions were also used to verify whether dew was affected by evaporation during its formation furthermore the sensitivity of temperature and rh the two important meteorological parameters in evaporation model and the most susceptible to climate change were also analyzed to examine their influence on dew evaporation processes under various environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in different climatic regions table 1 gobabeb

detailed meteorological characteristics in indianapolis have been described in our previous study tian et al 2018 in brief mean annual temperature mean annual relative humidity and precipitation are 10 2 c 69 and 953 mm respectively https www wunderground com to evaluate the degree of dryness in the three sites aridity index values were extracted from the global aridity index dataset https cgiarcsi community data global aridity and pet database the gobabeb was hyper arid site with aridity index of 0 01 the nice and indianapolis were both humid sites with aridity index of 0 98 and 0 96 respectively according to the köppen climate classification geiger 1961 koppen 1936 the climate in gobabeb nice and indianapolis belongs to desert climate mediterranean climate and humid continental climate respectively 2 2 sample collections and isotope analysis event based dew and precipitation samples were collected at each site to reduce evaporation effects on isotopes all of dew samples were collected before dawn at each site and stored in sealed glass vials 15 ml for the samples in gobabeb and indianapolis or polyethylene bottles for the dew samples in nice all of the precipitation samples were collected immediately after each event or at the earliest possible time in the morning if the precipitation event was finished after midnight twenty two dew samples were collected from july 2014 to june 2017 in gobabeb five rainfall samples were collected in january february september 2014 and february 2016 four shallow groundwaters and two deep groundwaters were also collected twenty three dew samples were collected in nice from december 2017 to april 2018 sixty nine dew samples and 109 precipitation samples including 99 rainfalls and 10 snowfalls were collected in indianapolis from january 2017 to october 2017 and throughout 2017 respectively all dew and precipitation samples were delivered to the iupui ecohydrology lab to measure isotopic variations using a triple water vapor isotope analyzer t wvia 45 ep los gatos research inc lgr mountain view ca usa coupled to a water vapor isotope standard source wviss lgr mountain view ca usa the detailed operation and calibration procedures were described in details by tian et al 2016 and wang et al 2009 the main isotopic parameters reported here are δ 18o 1000 ln δ18o 1 δ 17o 1000 ln δ17o 1 λ δ 18o δ 17o 17o excess ln δ17o 1 0 528 ln δ18o 1 d excess δ2h 8 δ18o barkan and luz 2007 meijer and li 1998 additionally all of the isotope ratios were normalized using two international water standards vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and standard light antarctic precipitation slap following the procedure described by steig et al 2014 and schoenemann et al 2013 furthermore to ensure the accuracy of 17o excess measurements 17o excess values were filtered through the methods of tian et al 2018 and tian and wang 2019 based on the detection criterion the precision of our instrument was 0 80 0 06 0 03 and 12 per meg 1 per meg 0 001 for δ2h δ18o δ17o and 17o excess respectively which was comparable with previous studies berman et al 2013 luz and barkan 2010 schoenemann et al 2013 steig et al 2014 2 3 meteorological variables to examine dew formation mechanisms under different climate settings nocturnal temperature and rh were used for analysis associated with 17o excess variations the meteorological data were available at the different meteorological stations gobabeb http www sasscalweathernet org nice https www infoclimat fr indianapolis https www wunderground com the download date was about october 26th november 30th and october 23th in 2018 for the above three websites respectively the nocturnal data in this study were screened and averaged to hourly data from 12 00 am to 6 00 am 2 4 evaporation model description to examine whether dew under different climate settings are affected by evaporation during formation two types of evaporation models steady state and non steady state conditions were used in this study simulated isotopic values were compared with the measured values if most of the simulated isotopic values matched with the measured values at temperature and rh conditions close to the measurements the model was considered as the optimal one the choice of steady state or non steady state evaporation model was also verified by the observed relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess 2 4 1 evaporation simulation without external moisture sources the atomic ratio of the residual water rend under steady state condition can be calculated by the rayleigh fractionation model as a function of αevap criss 1999 1 r e n d r start f 1 α evap 1 where rend and rstart are the isotopic ratios h2 17o h2 16o or h2 18o h2 16o of the residual water and initial water respectively f is the residual fraction of liquid water αevap is evaporation fractionation factor a function of the rh during evaporation process barkan and luz 2007 2 α evap r w r e α diff α eq 1 r h 1 α eq r h r a r w where αeq and αdiff are liquid vapor equilibrium fractionation factor and the diffusion fractionation factor for 17o 16o or 18o 16o respectively rw re and ra are the isotopic ratios of liquid evaporating water and air moisture respectively under the steady state experimental setup all of the water vapor comes from the evaporating water body i e no external moisture source which means ra re therefore the above eq 2 can be simplified to barkan and luz 2007 3 α evap α eq α diff 1 r h r h 18αeq and 2αeq are controlled by temperature horita and wesolowski 1994 4 α eq 18 exp 7 685 6 7123 10 3 t 1 6664 10 6 t 2 0 35041 10 9 t 3 10 3 5 α eq 2 exp 1158 8 t 3 10 9 1620 1 t 2 10 6 794 84 t 10 3 161 04 2 9992 10 9 t 3 10 3 17αeq was estimated using 17αeq 18αeq 0 529 based on liquid vapor equilibrium experiments barkan and luz 2005 the 18αdiff was 1 0283 and 17αdiff was 18αdiff 0 518 based on molecular diffusivities of water vapor in air during evaporation experiments barkan and luz 2007 2αdiff was estimated using 2αdiff 18αdiff 0 88 from merlivat 1978 and confirmed by luz et al 2009 therefore in our study the 18αdiff 2αdiff and 17αdiff were 1 0283 1 02486 and 1 01456 respectively 2 4 2 evaporation simulation with external moisture sources the isotopic ratios of residual water rw under non steady state condition can be calculated by the following eq 6 criss 1999 6 r w f u r w i r w s r w s where f is the residual fraction of liquid water the exponent u is the fractionation factor as a function of rh 7 u 1 α evap 0 1 r h α evap 0 1 r h where α evap 0 is the effective evaporation fractionation factor at 0 rh which could be calculated by eq 2 r w i is the isotopic ratio of initial water r w s is the predicted isotopic ratio of residual water under steady exchange with atmospheric vapor rv 8 r w s α eq r h r v 1 α evap 0 1 r h rv was not directly measured in our study it was determined either from literature value or calculated using precipitation isotopic composition and the equilibrium fractionation factor between liquid and vapor as shown in eq 9 barkan and luz 2005 9 α l v δ o l 1 δ o v 1 where αl v is a temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation factor calculated by the eqs 4 and 5 δ o rs rref 1 and rs and rref are the isotope ratios e g 18o 16o or 17o 16o of the sample and reference respectively according to the relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess all of the dew in gobabeb and some of the dew in indianapolis were affected by evaporation while those in nice were not affected by evaporation the evaporated dew in indianapolis were the dew that occurred when the temperature was more than 14 7 c thirty three events hereafter the dewt 14 7 c as for the dewt 14 7 c there were significant relationships between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess with higher correlation coefficients r 0 54 or 0 48 p 0 01 than the ones under lower temperature therefore dew in gobabeb and indianapolis were simulated separately using the above two evaporation models under steady state and non steady state conditions while the dew evaporation in nice was not simulated for each evaporation model different boundary conditions including different variables and parameters were simulated to search for the optimal model in terms of temperature rh residual fraction of liquid water f and isotopic values of both initial water i e rstart or r w i for steady state or non steady state and atmospheric water vapor rv different models of dew were simulated through fixed mean nocturnal temperature parameter and adjusted rh during the observation period if the adjusted rh value was close to the observed mean rh value corresponding to the similarity between the simulated and observed isotopic values including relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess the model would be considered as the optimal one generally isotopic value of the initial water in the model was the minimum value of all the observed values for one particular site e g dew in gobabeb under non steady state condition table 2 however not all models followed the above criterion because some dew with minimum values might not be affected by evaporation if the ideal model cannot be obtained using the minimum value the relatively low value will be considered as isotopic value of the initial water e g dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis under non steady state condition with the decreasing of residual fraction of liquid water f the evaporation processes increased associated with the enriched δ18o and decreasing 17o excess which means that f also played an important role in simulating evaporation the equilibrium fractionation factors αeq were calculated by eqs 4 and 5 using average nocturnal temperature and not daily temperature as mentioned later on because dew occurs at night the isotopic value of atmospheric water vapor was another important variable in non steady state model the data can be deduced from previous study e g dew in gobabeb uemura et al 2010 they can also be calculated by the equilibrium relationship between precipitation and water vapor following eq 9 due to the lack of direct observational vapor data the equilibrium relationship has been applied in previous studies such as for a prolonged rain event and for monthly precipitation in beijing china wen et al 2010 fiorella et al 2019 also point out that the equilibrium assumption gives relatively accurate estimates of the isotope ratios of evaporating waters in low latitudes equatorward of 30 it is noteworthy that to obtain the isotopic values of water vapor compared with using average nocturnal temperature as mentioned above the average daily temperature was used to calculate the equilibrium fractionation factor αl v as shown in table 2 this is because the process of converting precipitation into water vapor occurs during both day and night for the isotopic values of precipitation some of them were from the directly collected samples and others were from empirical online isotopes in precipitation calculator hereafter oipc model both of them were used to calculate the water vapor to further obtain optimal models in gobabeb and indianapolis the 17o excess of local atmospheric vapor was assumed to be 33 per meg based on the global meteoric water luz and barkan 2010 because the oipc data only include δ2h and δ18o additionally for dew in gobabeb the mean isotopic values of measured meteoric water included not only local rainfall but also the shallow groundwater and deep groundwater 2 5 temperature and rh sensitivity analysis to further explore the role of temperature and rh on 17o excess variations of dew we used the evaporation model under non steady state mentioned above to simulate the effects of temperature and rh on 17o excess in gobabeb and indianapolis only dewt 14 7 c was used for the indianapolis site since they are affected by evaporation for the sensitivity of temperature for both of the sites the temperature from 1 4 c the minimum nocturnal value to 30 0 c including the maximum nocturnal value 21 4 c were used to include all of the conditions for dew formation for each site the average nocturnal temperature and the observed minimum and maximum values for dew were also simulated to test the temperature sensitivity for the sensitivity of rh rh ranging from 18 to 98 with every 10 interval was used in the two sites which include the optimal rh 78 in gobabeb and 98 in indianapolis as stated in the above optimal model the other boundary conditions were assumed constant by using parameters e g r w i rv and f from the optimal model 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics of dew days there were different nocturnal temperature and rh ranges under three different climate settings during the observation periods fig 1 the average temperature in nice was the lowest 9 1 c with the smallest range 3 6 c to 15 3 c and the average in indianapolis was the highest 13 9 c with the largest range 1 4 c to 21 4 c the temperature in gobabeb varied from 3 5 c to 16 9 c with an average of 11 8 c it is notable that the average rh in gobabeb was the lowest 78 with the largest range values 35 to 98 and the average in indianapolis was the highest 92 with the smallest range values 66 to 100 the rh in nice varied from 55 to 94 with an average of 80 additionally for the days with dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the temperature varied from 14 7 c to 21 4 c with an average of 17 4 c and the rh varied from 66 to 99 with an average of 93 3 2 dew isotope variations a largest range of dew δ18o values was observed in nice during the study period 16 7 to 0 7 fig 2 it was close to the range in indianapolis 13 4 to 0 5 while the smallest range was in gobabeb 6 8 to 3 2 the average δ18o value in gobabeb was more enriched 1 4 2 6 than the other two sites the average δ18o value in nice 7 0 3 8 was almost similar to the one in indianapolis 6 5 3 1 while lower than those for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis 5 1 2 6 the δ2h and δ17o variations showed similar trends to δ18o in the three sites fig 2 more variable dew 17o excess values were observed in gobabeb 40 to 45 per meg fig 2 the range in nice 7 to 54 per meg was close to the one in indianapolis 5 to 64 per meg the average 17o excess value in gobabeb 9 22 per meg was the lowest and the one in nice 34 12 per meg was almost identical to the ones in indianapolis for all dew events 35 11 per meg and for dews with dewt 14 7 c 34 14 per meg fig 2 the largest range of d excess values was observed in gobabeb 19 9 to 26 5 and the smallest range was in nice 0 1 to 32 3 fig 2 the range in indianapolis was from 5 0 to 32 1 the average d excess value in gobabeb was the lowest 6 4 10 0 the average in nice was the highest 18 1 8 8 the average for all dew events and for dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis were 12 7 7 2 and 10 3 5 6 respectively the slope of δ 18o δ 17o λ in gobabeb 0 5202 was smaller than that in nice and indianapolis 0 5268 and 0 5271 fig 3 the slope of all the samples in the three sites was 0 5253 the 17o excess was negatively correlated with δ 18o in gobabeb r 0 93 p 0 001 and for all the samples r 0 61 p 0 001 fig 4 a the 17o excess was positively correlated with d excess r 0 74 p 0 001 and the slope between 17o excess and d excess was 1 61 per meg in gobabeb fig 4b the 17o excess was positively correlated with d excess r 0 50 p 0 001 and the slope between 17o excess and d excess was 0 96 per meg for all the samples there was no relationship between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess in nice p 0 05 for all dew events in indianapolis there was a low negative correlation between 17o excess and δ 18o r 0 25 p 0 037 to probe dew evaporation in indianapolis dew occurring under different temperature groups were used to analyze their relationships among different isotopic variables the results showed that λ for the dewt 14 7 c was 0 5252 the 17o excess was negatively correlated with δ 18o r 0 54 p 0 001 and positively correlated with d excess r 0 48 p 0 004 associated with a slope of 1 18 per meg fig 5 c d dew with temperature below 14 7 c had the higher λ 0 5280 and there was no correlation between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess p 0 05 in order to further reveal the dew formation mechanisms the relationships between the 17o excess and both temperature and rh were analyzed in the three sites and for all the samples the results showed that there was no relationship between temperature and 17o excess while positive correlation was observed between rh and 17o excess for all of the samples r 0 34 p 0 001 fig 6 therefore the difference in dew 17o excess among the three sites was mainly driven by rh differences 3 3 dew evaporation simulation hundreds of dew evaporation simulations were conducted under various boundary conditions in gobabeb and indianapolis under steady state and non steady state conditions the optimal evaporation models in gobabeb and in indianapolis for the dewt 14 7 c were both attained under non steady state condition the detailed variables and parameters are shown in table 2 note that the isotopic values of atmospheric water vapor were both calculated on the basis of the equilibrium fractionation between precipitation and vapor barkan and luz 2005 as for dew in gobabeb the δ18o δ17o δ2h and 17o excess of vapor were 13 305 7 047 102 898 and 0 per meg respectively these values produced better simulation results than those from the directly observed vapor data from the south indian and the southern oceans 15 5 2 7 8 2 1 5 and 16 per meg for δ18o δ17o and 17o excess respectively uemura et al 2010 for precipitation in gobabeb comparing with the isotopic values from empirical online isotopes in precipitation calculator model 2 6 0 4 and 13 4 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the mean isotopic values of measured local precipitation including rainfall and groundwater 3 5 6 0 and 25 7 41 7 for δ18o and δ2h respectively were used to estimate δ18ov and δ2hv because it could get a better match with measured values in the model as a result the temperature and rh of optimal model for dew in gobabeb were identical with those of the measured average nocturnal values during the observation period 11 8 c and 78 the simulated λ 0 5199 was almost the same with the observed λ 0 5202 fig 5a b the negative correlations between 17o excess and δ 18o were similar for simulated and measured values slope 8 10 and 7 76 per meg for both fig 5a the positive correlation between 17o excess and d excess for the model slope 1 58 per meg was similar with the observed value 1 61 per meg fig 5b as for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the δ18o δ17o δ2h and 17o excess of the vapor were 14 950 7 902 109 725 and 20 per meg respectively the isotopic values of precipitation were from the observed value during dew observation 5 25 and 33 79 for δ18o and δ2h using the observed precipitation values could get better simulated values than using the oipc values 3 20 and 15 40 with these parameters table 2 rh of optimal model in indianapolis 98 was found close to the measured average nocturnal values 93 fig 5c d the modeled λ 0 5250 was close to the observed one 0 5252 the negative correlations between 17o excess and δ 18o were similar for simulated and measured values slope 3 01 and 2 84 per meg for both fig 5c the positive correlation between 17o excess and d excess for the model slope 1 17 per meg was almost identical to the observed value slope 1 18 per meg fig 5d 3 4 the sensitivity of temperature and rh on dew 17o excess in order to assess the dew 17o excess sensitivity to temperature and rh the evaporation models mentioned above were also used to simulate the dew 17o excess responses to different environmental conditions in gobabeb and indianapolis the dew 17o excess sensitivity with respect to temperature and rh is shown in fig 7 the results indicated the 17o excess were more sensitive to changes in rh regardless the formation sites for instance for dew in gobabeb negative correlations were observed between 17o excess and δ 18o modeled by the non steady evaporation model the values of λ 0 5183 to 0 5208 varied slightly with large changes in temperature 1 4 c to 30 0 c when rh was 78 the optimal model parameter however the λ values 0 5187 to 0 5252 changed more significantly with large changes in rh 18 to 98 when temperature was 11 8 c the average value during the study period fig 7a b similarly for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis λ only varied from 0 5238 to 0 5260 with large changes in temperature 1 4 c to 30 0 c when rh was 98 while λ varied from 0 5227 to 0 5255 with large changes in rh 18 to 98 when temperature was 17 4 c fig 7c d it was worth noting that λ decreased with increasing temperature 1 4 c to 30 0 c for dew in gobabeb and indianapolis with dewt 14 7 c while there was no significant linear relationship between λ and rh regardless the dew formation sites 4 discussion 4 1 dew evaporation mechanisms dew is recognized as an important contribution to the annual water balance in arid and semiarid ecosystems aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 kidron et al 2011 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 even in humid region ritter et al 2019 tuller and chilton 1973 the importance of dew may be magnified in arid regions to alleviate water stress on natural ecosystems under changing climate rahimi et al 2013 dew formation obeys relatively complex phase change processes in different environments in reality dew formation does not always occur within a short time window but often lasts for several hours during the night or in early morning dew is often collected before dawn for many dew researches but evaporation is likely to be unavoidable during dew formation evaporation can occur when the conditions for dew formation are not fulfilled any more e g with lower relative humidity which decreases the dew point temperature with respect to air temperature during wind gusts where heat exchange with air is enhanced or rise of cloud cover decreasing radiative cooling in the previous studies on dew evaporation the different fractionation processes equilibrium or kinetic fractionation are speculated based on the dew isotopic variations of condensation since evaporation and condensation are inverse phase change processes deshpande et al 2013 wen et al 2012 however these studies did not provide direct evidence of different fractionation processes due to the lack of real time monitoring of vapor isotopic variation in addition because real time monitoring of vapor isotopic variation needs intensive labor and other logistics e g instrument purchase deployment and power consumption it is difficult to test dew formation mechanism at long time scale and no research has been conducted to examine the different degrees of evaporation in the current study to alleviate these constraints we used 17o excess and its relationships with other isotopic parameters e g δ 18o vs δ 17o 17o excess vs δ 18o or d excess to probe whether dew is affected by equilibrium fractionation or kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation using dew from three distinct climate settings the largest range of dew 17o excess values was observed in arid gobabeb with lowest average 17o excess value 9 22 per meg and the most enriched δ18o value 1 4 2 6 than observed in other two humid regions in nice and indianapolis fig 2 the λ value 0 5202 was the lowest in gobabeb which was close to the diffusive fractionation of atmospheric water vapor 0 5185 barkan and luz 2007 and close to previous study result at the same site 0 516 kaseke et al 2017 there were significant correlations between 17o excess and both δ 18o and d excess in gobabeb the slope between 17o excess and d excess in gobabeb 1 61 per meg is similar to the values predicted by re evaporation model in african monsoon rainfall 1 6 to 2 0 per meg landais et al 2010 these indicated that the dew in gobabeb might be more susceptible to kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation at non steady state than the other two humid regions in nice and indianapolis which exerts a stronger impact on the isotopic exchange process leading to the more enriched δ18o values and lower 17o excess values for gobabeb dew this has been confirmed by the detailed evaporation modeling as described in section 4 2 fig 5 the λ value of dew in nice 0 5268 is close to the equilibrium fractionation exponent 0 529 of the liquid vapor equilibrium and global meteoric water line 0 528 barkan and luz 2005 luz and barkan 2010 it appears that rayleigh distillation which usually limits to the equilibrium processes was the main mechanism explaining the temporal variations in the dew isotope values li et al 2015 wen et al 2010 for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the positive correlation between 17o excess and δ 18o and the negative correlation between 17o excess and d excess 1 18 per meg was comparable with the results of tap water in the united states 0 7 to 2 0 per meg li et al 2015 additionally the λ value 0 5252 of the dewt 14 7 c was lower than the equilibrium fractionation exponent 0 529 with relatively high rh 93 according to the evaporation models mentioned by li et al 2015 if the evaporation process occurred under steady state with high rh the λ would be high and close to the equilibrium fractionation exponent this demonstrated that the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis likely go through evaporation at non steady state conditions which is consistent with the theoretical evaporation model predictions as further discussed below 4 2 data evaporation model comparison to validate whether dew is influenced by evaporation as expected with 17o excess and δ18o observations two evaporation models under steady state based on rayleigh model and non steady state model were used to reproduce the observed results which reflects different degrees of equilibrium or kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation to evaluate the quality of model fitting a series of the evaporation controlled evolution of 17o excess over δ 18o or d excess had been simulated with variable boundary conditions in our study dew in gobabeb and the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis both experienced kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation under non steady state condition the initial water isotopic values were the observed minimum isotopic values in gobabeb while they were not the minimum values in indianapolis these indicated that all of the dew samples in gobabeb could be included in the evaporation model and were susceptible to the evaporation while not all of the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis were affected by evaporation compared with simulated values under rayleigh evaporation process isotopic variation of residual water was significantly enriched during kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation process under non steady state conditions as for dew in gobabeb the observed δ18o and δ17o values were better matched with the simulated values under non steady state than those under steady state to facilitate the comparison with previous studies the slope between 17o excess and d excess or δ 18o for the observed and simulated dew in gobabeb were calculated based on linear correlations although the significance of quadratic relationship between 17o excess and d excess was a little higher than that of the linear relationship the similar positive correlation between 17o excess and d excess for the model and the observed value 1 58 per meg vs 1 61 per meg indicated that the isotopic variations of dew in gobabeb should mainly occur under non steady state evaporation condition 17o excess of water vapor in the optimal model in gobabeb was 0 per meg as calculated from the relationship between δ17o and δ18o this is a value that fits better with the observed data than using the mean value of global meteoric water 33 per meg luz and barkan 2010 which is commonly used when direct observational data are lacking e g in the sistan oasis iran surma et al 2015 and in central atacama desert chile surma et al 2018 note that our study is the first to use the calculated 17o excess values of water vapor to predict the evaporation model it demonstrates that the mean value of global meteoric waters does not apply anywhere especially in arid region where other water resources other than precipitation e g groundwater have also an important impact on the local water cycle the optimal model temperature and rh values in gobabeb are found identical to the mean nocturnal temperature and rh during the observation period 11 8 c and 78 as for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the optimal simulated δ18o and δ17o values under non steady state condition are closer to the observation than those under steady state resulting in a simulated λ 0 5250 similar to the observed value 0 5252 fig 5c d thus suggesting that evaporation under non steady state condition is more appropriate during the study period the positive relationship between 17o excess and d excess of the optimal model closely coincides with the measured relationship slopes 1 17 per meg vs 1 18 per meg fig 5d which indicates that dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis with high rh 93 experiences a certain degree of evaporation at non steady state condition therefore if rh is close to saturation i e for nearly saturated air 100 relative humidity and λ not close to the equilibrium fractionation exponent 0 529 the evaporation process is more likely to occur under non steady state this means that if there are two evaporation processes with same rh the lower λ indicates that water is more susceptible to evaporation under non steady state a result also verified by the evaporation processes of tap waters in the u s li et al 2015 during the process of evaporation simulation for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the isotopic values of atmospheric water vapor without direct measurements were also inferred based on the assumption that vapor and precipitation condensation is an equilibrium fractionation process barkan and luz 2005 for the isotopic values of precipitation the precipitation events between may and september were selected and their mean value was calculated because the dewt 14 7 c mainly occurred during the period the isotopic values of the measured precipitations were lower than those from the oipc model and could give better prediction additionally the 17o excess of water vapor in optimal model in indianapolis was 20 per meg which is a better value than using the mean value of global meteoric waters 33 per meg luz and barkan 2010 this further provides data on water vapor isotopes in indianapolis during may and september in consequence the rh of optimal model in indianapolis 98 was close to the observed average nocturnal value 93 which indicates that the optimal model at non steady state condition can basically simulate the observed values the reason is that during the late spring summer and early fall long nights and high temperature with low rh makes evaporation more likely to occur 4 3 sensitivity of temperature and rh although dew formation is included in many global climate models rosenzweig and abramopoulos 1997 the role of evaporation during dew formation in different climatic regions especially under climate change is not well understood the isotope evaporation models include two important meteorological parameters temperature and rh and both are changing rapidly under climate change with increasing temperature and decreasing rh lower air temperature and higher rh are favorable meteorological conditions for the formation of dew beysens 1995 li 2002 ye et al 2007 but the sensitivity of the effects of temperature and rh on evaporation processes indicated by 17o excess during the dew formation is not clear to this end the 17o excess sensitivity analysis to temperature and rh were performed based on the different evaporation processes under non steady state conditions in gobabeb and indianapolis with the dewt 14 7 c the evaporation lines curved under non steady states in both gobabeb and indianapolis fig 7 for the sensitivity of temperature the range of slope λ varied slightly by 0 0025 and 0 0022 in gobabeb and indianapolis respectively there were negative relationships between temperature and λ at both sites the evaporation lines at both sites were clustered together and changes slightly with the increasing of temperature from 1 4 c to 30 c at the two sites these indicated that the 17o excess and δ 18o were less sensitive to temperature from 1 4 c to 30 c especially for 17o excess variations which were also observed for groundwater evaporation with no detectable change in 17o excess from 18 c to 28 c in central atacama desert chile surma et al 2018 surma et al 2015 also showed that air temperature from 10 c to 30 c play a minor role for the isotopic composition of evaporating water of natural water bodies in the sistan oasis iran notably all of the λ ranging from 0 5183 to 0 5208 in gobabeb were the low close to the diffusion fractionation kinetic factor for water vapor 0 518 barkan and luz 2007 however the λ in indianapolis ranging from 0 5238 to 0 5260 were higher and had less departure from the global meteoric waters line 0 528 luz and barkan 2010 and equilibrium fractionation factor for water 0 529 barkan and luz 2005 the difference is possibly due to rh difference 78 vs 98 at two sites this indirectly confirms the importance of the rh in evaporation as further discussed below in the sensitivity analysis concerning the sensitivity of rh from 18 to 98 under fixed temperature with the decreasing of rh evaporation curves tend to be more stretched fig 7 this is similar to what was observed for groundwater evaporation in central atacama desert chile rh from 25 to 65 surma et al 2018 the slope λ range of simulated dew varied widely by 0 0065 and 0 0028 for the two sites these demonstrated that the dew 17o excess values were more sensitive to the changes in rh than that in temperature regardless the location this strengthened the view that 17o excess is principally influenced by rh during 10 c to 45 c which has been confirmed by theoretical experiments barkan and luz 2005 cao and liu 2011 and previous field observations landais et al 2010 li et al 2017 uechi and uemura 2019 winkler et al 2012 meanwhile this confirms that rh is the principal drivers of dew formation in the evaporation model under non steady state furthermore the 17o excess for all of the dew data in our study was positively correlated with rh which is consistent with the observations in african monsoon rainfall landais et al 2010 however 17o excess has no relationship with temperature meaning that the local rh exerts an important influence on 17o excess during dew evaporation under the different climate settings 5 conclusions dew plays an increasing important role in the ecohydrological processes in many ecosystems especially under climate change the present report is the first to study and analyze whether dew is influenced by different degree of evaporation by means of 17o excess and the relationships between different isotopic parameters e g δ 18o vs δ 17o 17o excess vs δ 18o or d excess the study has been carried out in three different sites with various climate settings gobabeb desert climate nice mediterranean climate and indianapolis humid continental climate mean value 17o excess of dew in hyper arid gobabeb 9 22 per meg was the lowest with the largest range while they were similar in other two humid regions nice 34 12 per meg and indianapolis 35 11 per meg based on observed data and simulations we conclude that dew formation in gobabeb experienced kinetic fractionation processes associated with evaporation under non steady state as well as for some of the dew events with temperature over 14 7 c in indianapolis while the dew formation in nice did not experience significant evaporation the local rh difference is responsible for the evaporation difference equilibrium or kinetic fractionation of dew formation which is also supported by the sensitivity analysis informed by these results 17o excess can be considered as a useful tracer to reveal the different evaporation process equilibrium or kinetic fractionation during

5017,with increasing aridity in many regions dew is likely to play an increasingly important role in the ecohydrological processes in many ecosystems especially in arid and semiarid regions few studies investigated the role of evaporation during dew formation and how it varies under different climate settings 17o excess as a new tracer could be used to extract information of evaporation dynamics from natural water samples e g precipitation river and lake therefore to fill the knowledge gap in evaporation mechanisms during dew formation we report the isotopic variation δ2h δ18o δ17o and 17o excess of dew and precipitation from three distinct climatic regions i e gobabeb in the central namib desert nice in france with mediterranean climate and indianapolis in the central united states with humid continental climate we examined whether dew formed in different climate settings was affected by different degree of evaporation using observed isotopic values and evaporation models during the formation processes and modeled the effects of key meteorological variables i e temperature and relative humidity on 17o excess variations the results showed that dew in gobabeb experienced kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation under non steady state conditions during dew formation with enriched δ18o and low 17o excess values dew formations with temperatures over 14 7 c in indianapolis were also influenced by evaporation under non steady state conditions however dew formation in nice did not experience significant evaporation evaporation processes equilibrium or kinetic fractionation occurring during nights with heavy dew under three climate settings were mainly related to the variation of atmosphere relative humidity the 17o excess tracer provides a new method to distinguish the different evaporation processes equilibrium or kinetic fractionation during dew formation and our result provides an improved understanding of dew formation keywords drylands ecohydrology equilibrium fractionation kinetic fractionation stable isotopes 1 introduction dew is the condensation of water vapor into liquid droplets on a substrate when the substrate surface temperature drops below the dew point beysens 2018 monteith and unsworth 2013 it usually occurs at night or in early morning when reduced input of shortwave radiation results in a negative net radiation balance at the substrate dew occurs in most climate zones it is an important source of moisture for epiphytes and lichens with special physical features absorbing atmospheric moisture gerlein safdi et al 2018 dew can reach and even exceed annual rainfall and serve as a sustainable and stable water source to maintain plant and small animal survival in arid and semiarid environments kidron et al 2011 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 especially during periods of drought dew could even be the only water source in a continental semiarid grassland aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 it is also viewed as a small but important part of the water balance in humid areas ritter et al 2019 tuller and chilton 1973 dew significantly increased soil water potential such as in namib desert wang et al 2019 it can be directly absorbed by plant roots from soil and can reduce the evaporation loss of soil moisture to mediate water status in water stressed plants aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 munné bosch and alegre 1999 as a water source dew can also be directly absorbed through leaves and then alter leaf level energy balance reduce transpiration rate and improve photosynthesis grammatikopoulos and manetas 1994 guo et al 2016 rao et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 air temperature and relative humidity rh the environmental determinants of dew deposition are expected to change rapidly with climate change and may affect the frequency and amount of dew deposition cook et al 2014 nepstad et al 2008 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 vuollekoski et al 2015 previous studies showed that nocturnal temperatures increase with climate change implying a lower rh and lower dew amounts in the future donat and alexander 2012 martín et al 2012 in a continental scale study it is found that the frequency of dew formation at night in the grasslands is between 15 and 95 during the study period and dew formation has a strong linear relationship with nocturnal rh ritter et al 2019 generally when dew forms the rh of ambient air should be high enough 70 and the substrate surface temperature should drop below the dew point due to radiative cooling lekouch et al 2010 however recent study showed that dew may form at lower rh as long as vapor saturation occur at the air substrate interface kidron and starinsky 2019 for instance a study in the semi arid region of loess plateau of china indicated that dew can form when rh is around 30 wang and zhang 2011 therefore rh controls on dew formation may differ among climate regions most previous research does not consider evaporation during dew formation because it occurs during night or in early morning and evaporation is considered minimum as a result the role of evaporation during dew formation is not well understood however evaporation during dew formation has been observed in the past for instance evaporation during dew formation is observed during 2 00 to 4 00 am in the loess plateau of china leading to a decreasing dew amount wang and zhang 2011 it is also observed in linze inland river basin fang and ding 2005 the knowledge gaps in dew evaporation during formation hinder our understanding of dew formation mechanisms and an accurate prediction of dew formation changes under future climates although the dew amount collected traditional method at sequential times at night or in early morning can be used to indicate evaporation process continuous dew recording is logistically challenging and difficult to implement due to intensive labor requirement stable isotopes of traditional hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o are natural tracers to diagnose changes in different hydrometeorological processes undergoing equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during water phase change crawford et al 2013 cui et al 2020 soderberg et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 the equilibrium fractionation is determined by the saturation vapor pressure the kinetic fractionation is attributed to different diffusivities of different isotopes generally dew is one type of liquid condensation supposedly dominated by equilibrium fractionation to the best of our knowledge there is no effort examining the two fractionation processes equilibrium and kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation during dew formation condensation can be considered as the inverse of evaporation with similar fractionation mechanisms between vapor and liquid as such isotope studies on dew condensation mechanism can be used to better understand the two fractionation processes associated with evaporation during dew formation process for instance the δ18o values in surface dew in brazil consistently tracked atmospheric vapor δ18o values which is generally regarded as the rayleigh equilibrium fractionation process zhang et al 2009 wen et al 2012 point out that the effect of equilibrium fractionation on the δ2h and δ18o of dew is greater than that of the kinetic fractionation although humidity deviated from the saturation conditions by up to 120 on the leaf surface in a cropland and a grassland in china deshpande et al 2013 recognize that dew could involve a certain degree of kinetic fractionation in super saturated environments at a coastal village of india these dew formation studies based on δ2h and δ18o can distinguish equilibrium and kinetic fractionation processes however these studies are either based on the assumption of equilibrium fractionation during condensation zhang et al 2009 or require measuring atmospheric water vapor isotopes and dew isotopes simultaneously deshpande et al 2013 wen et al 2012 recent advance in spectroscopy have now enabled to obtain high precision measurements of δ17o with low natural abundance a new hydrological tracer 17o excess became available to provide additional constraints on the mechanisms of water phase changes barkan and luz 2007 the major advantage of 17o excess over the conventional isotopes is its sole rh dependence between 10 c and 45 c barkan and luz 2005 cao and liu 2011 which is confirmed by field observations landais et al 2010 li et al 2017 uechi and uemura 2019 winkler et al 2012 recent studies also show that the relationship between δ 18o and δ 17o can be used to better reveal tap water and precipitation formation mechanisms tian et al 2020 2019 differentiate synoptic drought and local drought kaseke et al 2018 and distinguish fog and dew kaseke et al 2017 according to the conceptual evaporation model 17o excess and the relationships between different isotopic parameters e g δ 18o vs δ 17o 17o excess vs δ 18o or d excess can be used to infer whether water is affected by equilibrium fractionation or kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation under steady state or non steady state barkan and luz 2005 2007 criss 1999 the evaporation model under steady state condition was based on traditional rayleigh fractionation model rayleigh distillation assumes that water vapor evaporates in isotopic equilibrium condition with no additional sources or vapor recycling processes e g evaporative recharge or atmospheric transport characteristics fiorella et al 2019 winnick et al 2014 however most natural evaporation under non steady state condition depends on external atmospheric vapor therefore the significant difference of boundary conditions between steady state and non steady state models is the existence of atmospheric water vapor resulting in differently shaped evaporation trajectories li et al 2015 the relationships between different isotopic parameters have been used to estimate precipitation evaporation processes in africa and in the central u s landais et al 2010 tian et al 2018 the relationships have also been used to analyze evaporation loss of natural water bodies in the sistan oasis iran surma et al 2015 in central atacama desert chile surma et al 2018 and in western u s passey and ji 2019 overall 17o excess and the relationships between different isotopic parameters are effective to explore the detailed evaporation processes dew research has been largely confined to arid and semiarid environments beysens 2018 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 uclés et al 2015 therefore a large knowledge gap exists to study dew variability among different climatic regions e g arid and humid regions in the inland and near ocean especially for evaporation it is important to understand the environmental factors influencing dew formation in different climate regions and this will better inform us how these factors will affect dew formation under climate change here we investigate dew and precipitation isotopic variations to explore the evaporation mechanisms of dew formation in three different climate settings including gobabeb research and training center hereafter gobabeb in the central namib desert with desert climate nice in france with mediterranean climate and indianapolis in the central united states with humid continental climate we used 17o excess and the relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess to characterize evaporation dynamics under different climate settings and examined the influence of meteorological factors e g temperature and rh on isotopes additionally two evaporation models under steady state i e rayleigh model and non steady state conditions were also used to verify whether dew was affected by evaporation during its formation furthermore the sensitivity of temperature and rh the two important meteorological parameters in evaporation model and the most susceptible to climate change were also analyzed to examine their influence on dew evaporation processes under various environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in different climatic regions table 1 gobabeb

meteorological data were available at the different meteorological stations gobabeb http www sasscalweathernet org nice https www infoclimat fr indianapolis https www wunderground com the download date was about october 26th november 30th and october 23th in 2018 for the above three websites respectively the nocturnal data in this study were screened and averaged to hourly data from 12 00 am to 6 00 am 2 4 evaporation model description to examine whether dew under different climate settings are affected by evaporation during formation two types of evaporation models steady state and non steady state conditions were used in this study simulated isotopic values were compared with the measured values if most of the simulated isotopic values matched with the measured values at temperature and rh conditions close to the measurements the model was considered as the optimal one the choice of steady state or non steady state evaporation model was also verified by the observed relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess 2 4 1 evaporation simulation without external moisture sources the atomic ratio of the residual water rend under steady state condition can be calculated by the rayleigh fractionation model as a function of αevap criss 1999 1 r e n d r start f 1 α evap 1 where rend and rstart are the isotopic ratios h2 17o h2 16o or h2 18o h2 16o of the residual water and initial water respectively f is the residual fraction of liquid water αevap is evaporation fractionation factor a function of the rh during evaporation process barkan and luz 2007 2 α evap r w r e α diff α eq 1 r h 1 α eq r h r a r w where αeq and αdiff are liquid vapor equilibrium fractionation factor and the diffusion fractionation

vapor comes from the evaporating water body i e no external moisture source which means ra re therefore the above eq 2 can be simplified to barkan and luz 2007 3 α evap α eq α diff 1 r h r h 18αeq and

molecular diffusivities of water vapor in air during evaporation experiments barkan and luz 2007 2αdiff was estimated using 2αdiff 18αdiff 0 88 from merlivat 1978 and confirmed by luz et al 2009 therefore in our study the 18αdiff 2αdiff and 17αdiff were 1 0283 1 02486 and 1 01456 respectively 2 4 2 evaporation simulation with external moisture sources the isotopic ratios of residual water rw

2005 9 α l v δ o l 1 δ o v 1 where αl v is a temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation factor calculated by the eqs 4 and 5 δ o rs rref 1 and rs and rref are the isotope ratios e g 18o 16o or 17o 16o of the sample and reference respectively according to the relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess all of the dew in gobabeb and some of the dew in indianapolis were affected by evaporation while those in nice were not affected by evaporation the evaporated dew in indianapolis were the dew that occurred when the temperature was more than 14 7 c thirty three events hereafter the dewt 14 7 c as for the dewt 14 7 c there were significant relationships between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess with higher correlation coefficients r 0 54 or 0 48 p 0 01 than the ones under lower temperature therefore dew in gobabeb and indianapolis were simulated separately using the above two evaporation models under steady state and non steady state conditions while the dew evaporation in nice was not simulated for each evaporation model different boundary conditions including different variables and parameters were simulated to search for the optimal model in terms of temperature rh residual fraction of liquid water f and isotopic values of both initial water i e rstart or r w i for steady state or non steady state and atmospheric water vapor rv different models of dew were simulated through fixed mean nocturnal temperature parameter and adjusted rh during the observation period if the adjusted rh value was close to the observed mean rh value corresponding to the similarity between the simulated and observed isotopic values including relationships between δ 18o and δ 17o as well as between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess the model would be considered as the optimal one generally isotopic value of the initial water in the model was the minimum value of all the observed values for one particular site e g dew in gobabeb under non steady state condition table 2 however not all models followed the above criterion because some dew with minimum values might not be affected by evaporation if the ideal model cannot be obtained using the minimum value the relatively low value will be considered as isotopic value of the initial water e g dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis under non steady state condition with the decreasing of residual fraction of liquid water f the evaporation processes increased associated with the enriched δ18o and decreasing 17o excess which means that f also played an important role in simulating evaporation the equilibrium fractionation factors αeq were calculated by eqs 4 and 5 using average nocturnal temperature and not daily temperature as mentioned later on because dew occurs at night the isotopic value of atmospheric water vapor was another important variable in non steady state model the data can be deduced from previous study e g dew in gobabeb uemura et al 2010 they can also be calculated by the equilibrium relationship between precipitation and water vapor following eq 9 due to the lack of direct observational vapor data the equilibrium relationship has been applied in previous studies such as for a prolonged rain event and for monthly precipitation in beijing china wen et al 2010 fiorella et al 2019 also point out that the equilibrium assumption gives relatively accurate estimates of the isotope ratios of evaporating waters in low latitudes equatorward of 30 it is noteworthy that to obtain the isotopic values of water vapor compared with using average nocturnal temperature as mentioned above the average daily temperature was used to calculate the equilibrium fractionation factor αl v as shown in table 2 this is because the process of converting precipitation into water vapor occurs during both day and night for the isotopic values of precipitation some of them were from the directly collected samples and others were from empirical online isotopes in precipitation calculator hereafter oipc model both of them were used to calculate the water vapor to further obtain optimal models in gobabeb and indianapolis the 17o excess of local atmospheric vapor was assumed to be 33 per meg based on the global meteoric water luz and barkan 2010 because the oipc data only include δ2h and δ18o additionally for dew in gobabeb the mean isotopic values of measured meteoric water included not only local rainfall but also the shallow groundwater and deep groundwater 2 5 temperature and rh sensitivity analysis to further explore the role of temperature and rh on 17o excess variations of dew we used the evaporation model under non steady state mentioned above to simulate the effects of temperature and rh on 17o excess in gobabeb and indianapolis only dewt 14 7 c was used for the indianapolis site since they are affected by evaporation for the sensitivity of temperature for both of the sites the temperature from 1 4 c the minimum nocturnal value to 30 0 c including the maximum nocturnal value 21 4 c were used to include all of the conditions for dew formation for each site the average nocturnal temperature and the observed minimum and maximum values for dew were also simulated to test the temperature sensitivity for the sensitivity of rh rh ranging from 18 to 98 with every 10 interval was used in the two sites which include the optimal rh 78 in gobabeb and 98 in indianapolis as stated in the above optimal model the other boundary conditions were assumed constant by using parameters e g r w i rv and f from the optimal model 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics of dew days there were different nocturnal temperature and rh ranges under three different climate settings during the observation periods fig 1 the average temperature in nice was the lowest 9 1 c with the smallest range 3 6 c to 15 3 c and the average in indianapolis was the highest 13 9 c with the largest range 1 4 c to 21 4 c the temperature in gobabeb varied from 3 5 c to 16 9 c with an average of 11 8 c it is notable that the average rh in gobabeb was the lowest 78 with the largest range values 35 to 98 and the average in indianapolis was the highest 92 with the smallest range values 66 to 100 the rh in nice varied from 55 to 94 with an average of 80 additionally for the days with dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the temperature varied from 14 7 c to 21 4 c with an average of 17 4 c and the rh varied from 66 to 99 with an average of 93 3 2 dew isotope variations a largest range of dew δ18o values was observed in nice during the study period 16 7 to 0 7 fig 2 it was close to the range in indianapolis 13 4 to 0 5 while the smallest range was in gobabeb 6 8 to 3 2 the average δ18o value in gobabeb was more enriched 1 4 2 6 than the other two sites the average δ18o value in nice 7 0 3 8 was almost similar to the one in indianapolis 6 5 3 1 while lower than those for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis 5 1 2 6 the δ2h and δ17o variations showed similar trends to δ18o in the three sites fig 2 more variable dew 17o excess values were observed in gobabeb 40 to 45 per meg fig 2 the range in nice 7 to 54 per meg was close to the one in indianapolis 5 to 64 per meg the average 17o excess value in gobabeb 9 22 per meg was the lowest and the one in nice 34 12 per meg was almost identical to the ones in indianapolis for all dew events 35 11 per meg and for dews with dewt 14 7 c 34 14 per meg fig 2 the largest range of d excess values was observed in gobabeb 19 9 to 26 5 and the smallest range was in nice 0 1 to 32 3 fig 2 the range in indianapolis was from 5 0 to 32 1 the average d excess value in gobabeb was the lowest 6 4 10 0 the average in nice was the highest 18 1 8 8 the average for all dew events and for dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis were 12 7 7 2 and 10 3 5 6 respectively the slope of δ 18o δ 17o λ in gobabeb 0 5202 was smaller than that in nice and indianapolis 0 5268 and 0 5271 fig 3 the slope of all the samples in the three sites was 0 5253 the 17o excess was negatively correlated with δ 18o in gobabeb r 0 93 p 0 001 and for all the samples r 0 61 p 0 001 fig 4 a the 17o excess was positively correlated with d excess r 0 74 p 0 001 and the slope between 17o excess and d excess was 1 61 per meg in gobabeb fig 4b the 17o excess was positively correlated with d excess r 0 50 p 0 001 and the slope between 17o excess and d excess was 0 96 per meg for all the samples there was no relationship between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess in nice p 0 05 for all dew events in indianapolis there was a low negative correlation between 17o excess and δ 18o r 0 25 p 0 037 to probe dew evaporation in indianapolis dew occurring under different temperature groups were used to analyze their relationships among different isotopic variables the results showed that λ for the dewt 14 7 c was 0 5252 the 17o excess was negatively correlated with δ 18o r 0 54 p 0 001 and positively correlated with d excess r 0 48 p 0 004 associated with a slope of 1 18 per meg fig 5 c d dew with temperature below 14 7 c had the higher λ 0 5280 and there was no correlation between 17o excess and δ 18o or d excess p 0 05 in order to further reveal the dew formation mechanisms the relationships between the 17o excess and both temperature and rh were analyzed in the three sites and for all the samples the results showed that there was no relationship between temperature and 17o excess while positive correlation was observed between rh and 17o excess for all of the samples r 0 34 p 0 001 fig 6 therefore the difference in dew 17o excess among the three sites was mainly driven by rh differences 3 3 dew evaporation simulation hundreds of dew evaporation simulations were conducted under various boundary conditions in gobabeb and indianapolis under steady state and non steady state conditions the optimal evaporation models in gobabeb and in indianapolis for the dewt 14 7 c were both attained under non steady state condition the detailed variables and parameters are shown in table 2 note that the isotopic values of atmospheric water vapor were both calculated on the basis of the equilibrium fractionation between precipitation and vapor barkan and luz 2005 as for dew in gobabeb the δ18o δ17o δ2h and 17o excess of vapor were 13 305 7 047 102 898 and 0 per meg respectively these values produced better simulation results than those from the directly observed vapor data from the south indian and the southern oceans 15 5 2 7 8 2 1 5 and 16 per meg for δ18o δ17o and 17o excess respectively uemura et al 2010 for precipitation in gobabeb comparing with the isotopic values from empirical online isotopes in precipitation calculator model 2 6 0 4 and 13 4 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the mean isotopic values of measured local precipitation including rainfall and groundwater 3 5 6 0 and 25 7 41 7 for δ18o and δ2h respectively were used to estimate δ18ov and δ2hv because it could get a better match with measured values in the model as a result the temperature and rh of optimal model for dew in gobabeb were identical with those of the measured average nocturnal values during the observation period 11 8 c and 78 the simulated λ 0 5199 was almost the same with the observed λ 0 5202 fig 5a b the negative correlations between 17o excess and δ 18o were similar for simulated and measured values slope 8 10 and 7 76 per meg for both fig 5a the positive correlation between 17o excess and d excess for the model slope 1 58 per meg was similar with the observed value 1 61 per meg fig 5b as for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the δ18o δ17o δ2h and 17o excess of the vapor were 14 950 7 902 109 725 and 20 per meg respectively the isotopic values of precipitation were from the observed value during dew observation 5 25 and 33 79 for δ18o and δ2h using the observed precipitation values could get better simulated values than using the oipc values 3 20 and 15 40 with these parameters table 2 rh of optimal model in indianapolis 98 was found close to the measured average nocturnal values 93 fig 5c d the modeled λ 0 5250 was close to the observed one 0 5252 the negative correlations between 17o excess and δ 18o were similar for simulated and measured values slope 3 01 and 2 84 per meg for both fig 5c the positive correlation between 17o excess and d excess for the model slope 1 17 per meg was almost identical to the observed value slope 1 18 per meg fig 5d 3 4 the sensitivity of temperature and rh on dew 17o excess in order to assess the dew 17o excess sensitivity to temperature and rh the evaporation models mentioned above were also used to simulate the dew 17o excess responses to different environmental conditions in gobabeb and indianapolis the dew 17o excess sensitivity with respect to temperature and rh is shown in fig 7 the results indicated the 17o excess were more sensitive to changes in rh regardless the formation sites for instance for dew in gobabeb negative correlations were observed between 17o excess and δ 18o modeled by the non steady evaporation model the values of λ 0 5183 to 0 5208 varied slightly with large changes in temperature 1 4 c to 30 0 c when rh was 78 the optimal model parameter however the λ values 0 5187 to 0 5252 changed more significantly with large changes in rh 18 to 98 when temperature was 11 8 c the average value during the study period fig 7a b similarly for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis λ only varied from 0 5238 to 0 5260 with large changes in temperature 1 4 c to 30 0 c when rh was 98 while λ varied from 0 5227 to 0 5255 with large changes in rh 18 to 98 when temperature was 17 4 c fig 7c d it was worth noting that λ decreased with increasing temperature 1 4 c to 30 0 c for dew in gobabeb and indianapolis with dewt 14 7 c while there was no significant linear relationship between λ and rh regardless the dew formation sites 4 discussion 4 1 dew evaporation mechanisms dew is recognized as an important contribution to the annual water balance in arid and semiarid ecosystems aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 kidron et al 2011 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 even in humid region ritter et al 2019 tuller and chilton 1973 the importance of dew may be magnified in arid regions to alleviate water stress on natural ecosystems under changing climate rahimi et al 2013 dew formation obeys relatively complex phase change processes in different environments in reality dew formation does not always occur within a short time window but often lasts for several hours during the night or in early morning dew is often collected before dawn for many dew researches but evaporation is likely to be unavoidable during dew formation evaporation can occur when the conditions for dew formation are not fulfilled any more e g with lower relative humidity which decreases the dew point temperature with respect to air temperature during wind gusts where heat exchange with air is enhanced or rise of cloud cover decreasing radiative cooling in the previous studies on dew evaporation the different fractionation processes equilibrium or kinetic fractionation are speculated based on the dew isotopic variations of condensation since evaporation and condensation are inverse phase change processes deshpande et al 2013 wen et al 2012 however these studies did not provide direct evidence of different fractionation processes due to the lack of real time monitoring of vapor isotopic variation in addition because real time monitoring of vapor isotopic variation needs intensive labor and other logistics e g instrument purchase deployment and power consumption it is difficult to test dew formation mechanism at long time scale and no research has been conducted to examine the different degrees of evaporation in the current study to alleviate these constraints we used 17o excess and its relationships with other isotopic parameters e g δ 18o vs δ 17o 17o excess vs δ 18o or d excess to probe whether dew is affected by equilibrium fractionation or kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation using dew from three distinct climate settings the largest range of dew 17o excess values was observed in arid gobabeb with lowest average 17o excess value 9 22 per meg and the most enriched δ18o value 1 4 2 6 than observed in other two humid regions in nice and indianapolis fig 2 the λ value 0 5202 was the lowest in gobabeb which was close to the diffusive fractionation of atmospheric water vapor 0 5185 barkan and luz 2007 and close to previous study result at the same site 0 516 kaseke et al 2017 there were significant correlations between 17o excess and both δ 18o and d excess in gobabeb the slope between 17o excess and d excess in gobabeb 1 61 per meg is similar to the values predicted by re evaporation model in african monsoon rainfall 1 6 to 2 0 per meg landais et al 2010 these indicated that the dew in gobabeb might be more susceptible to kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation at non steady state than the other two humid regions in nice and indianapolis which exerts a stronger impact on the isotopic exchange process leading to the more enriched δ18o values and lower 17o excess values for gobabeb dew this has been confirmed by the detailed evaporation modeling as described in section 4 2 fig 5 the λ value of dew in nice 0 5268 is close to the equilibrium fractionation exponent 0 529 of the liquid vapor equilibrium and global meteoric water line 0 528 barkan and luz 2005 luz and barkan 2010 it appears that rayleigh distillation which usually limits to the equilibrium processes was the main mechanism explaining the temporal variations in the dew isotope values li et al 2015 wen et al 2010 for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the positive correlation between 17o excess and δ 18o and the negative correlation between 17o excess and d excess 1 18 per meg was comparable with the results of tap water in the united states 0 7 to 2 0 per meg li et al 2015 additionally the λ value 0 5252 of the dewt 14 7 c was lower than the equilibrium fractionation exponent 0 529 with relatively high rh 93 according to the evaporation models mentioned by li et al 2015 if the evaporation process occurred under steady state with high rh the λ would be high and close to the equilibrium fractionation exponent this demonstrated that the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis likely go through evaporation at non steady state conditions which is consistent with the theoretical evaporation model predictions as further discussed below 4 2 data evaporation model comparison to validate whether dew is influenced by evaporation as expected with 17o excess and δ18o observations two evaporation models under steady state based on rayleigh model and non steady state model were used to reproduce the observed results which reflects different degrees of equilibrium or kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation to evaluate the quality of model fitting a series of the evaporation controlled evolution of 17o excess over δ 18o or d excess had been simulated with variable boundary conditions in our study dew in gobabeb and the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis both experienced kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation under non steady state condition the initial water isotopic values were the observed minimum isotopic values in gobabeb while they were not the minimum values in indianapolis these indicated that all of the dew samples in gobabeb could be included in the evaporation model and were susceptible to the evaporation while not all of the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis were affected by evaporation compared with simulated values under rayleigh evaporation process isotopic variation of residual water was significantly enriched during kinetic fractionation associated with evaporation process under non steady state conditions as for dew in gobabeb the observed δ18o and δ17o values were better matched with the simulated values under non steady state than those under steady state to facilitate the comparison with previous studies the slope between 17o excess and d excess or δ 18o for the observed and simulated dew in gobabeb were calculated based on linear correlations although the significance of quadratic relationship between 17o excess and d excess was a little higher than that of the linear relationship the similar positive correlation between 17o excess and d excess for the model and the observed value 1 58 per meg vs 1 61 per meg indicated that the isotopic variations of dew in gobabeb should mainly occur under non steady state evaporation condition 17o excess of water vapor in the optimal model in gobabeb was 0 per meg as calculated from the relationship between δ17o and δ18o this is a value that fits better with the observed data than using the mean value of global meteoric water 33 per meg luz and barkan 2010 which is commonly used when direct observational data are lacking e g in the sistan oasis iran surma et al 2015 and in central atacama desert chile surma et al 2018 note that our study is the first to use the calculated 17o excess values of water vapor to predict the evaporation model it demonstrates that the mean value of global meteoric waters does not apply anywhere especially in arid region where other water resources other than precipitation e g groundwater have also an important impact on the local water cycle the optimal model temperature and rh values in gobabeb are found identical to the mean nocturnal temperature and rh during the observation period 11 8 c and 78 as for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the optimal simulated δ18o and δ17o values under non steady state condition are closer to the observation than those under steady state resulting in a simulated λ 0 5250 similar to the observed value 0 5252 fig 5c d thus suggesting that evaporation under non steady state condition is more appropriate during the study period the positive relationship between 17o excess and d excess of the optimal model closely coincides with the measured relationship slopes 1 17 per meg vs 1 18 per meg fig 5d which indicates that dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis with high rh 93 experiences a certain degree of evaporation at non steady state condition therefore if rh is close to saturation i e for nearly saturated air 100 relative humidity and λ not close to the equilibrium fractionation exponent 0 529 the evaporation process is more likely to occur under non steady state this means that if there are two evaporation processes with same rh the lower λ indicates that water is more susceptible to evaporation under non steady state a result also verified by the evaporation processes of tap waters in the u s li et al 2015 during the process of evaporation simulation for the dewt 14 7 c in indianapolis the isotopic values of atmospheric water vapor without direct measurements were also inferred based on the assumption that vapor and precipitation condensation is an equilibrium fractionation process barkan and luz 2005 for the isotopic values of precipitation the precipitation events between may and september were selected and their mean value was calculated because the dewt 14 7 c mainly occurred during the period the isotopic values of the measured precipitations were lower than those from the oipc model and could give better prediction additionally the 17o excess of water vapor in optimal model in indianapolis was 20 per meg which is a better value than using the mean value of global meteoric waters 33 per meg luz and barkan 2010 this further provides data on water vapor isotopes in indianapolis during may and september in consequence the rh of optimal model in indianapolis 98 was close to the observed average nocturnal value 93 which indicates that the optimal model at non steady state condition can basically simulate the observed values the reason is that during the late spring summer and early fall long nights and high temperature with low rh makes evaporation more likely to occur 4 3 sensitivity of temperature and rh although dew formation is included in many global climate models rosenzweig and abramopoulos 1997 the role of evaporation during dew formation in different climatic regions especially under climate change is not well understood the isotope evaporation models include two important meteorological parameters temperature and rh and both are changing rapidly under climate change with increasing temperature and decreasing rh lower air temperature and higher rh are favorable meteorological conditions for the formation of dew beysens 1995 li 2002 ye et al 2007 but the sensitivity of the effects of temperature and rh on evaporation processes indicated by 17o excess during the dew formation is not clear to this end the 17o excess sensitivity analysis to temperature and rh were performed based on the different evaporation processes under non steady state conditions in gobabeb and indianapolis with the dewt 14 7 c the evaporation lines curved under non steady states in both gobabeb and indianapolis fig 7 for the sensitivity of temperature the range of slope λ varied slightly by 0 0025 and 0 0022 in gobabeb and indianapolis respectively there were negative relationships between temperature and λ at both sites the evaporation lines at both sites were clustered together and changes slightly with the increasing of temperature from 1 4 c to 30 c at the two sites these indicated that the 17o excess and δ 18o were less sensitive to temperature from 1 4 c to 30 c especially for 17o excess variations which were also observed for groundwater evaporation with no detectable change in 17o excess from 18 c to 28 c in central atacama desert chile surma et al 2018 surma et al 2015 also showed that air temperature from 10 c to 30 c play a minor role for the isotopic composition of evaporating water of natural water bodies in the sistan oasis iran notably all of the λ ranging from 0 5183 to 0 5208 in gobabeb were the low close to the diffusion fractionation kinetic factor for water vapor 0 518 barkan and luz 2007 however the λ in indianapolis ranging from 0 5238 to 0 5260 were higher and had less departure from the global meteoric waters line 0 528 luz and barkan 2010 and equilibrium fractionation factor for water 0 529 barkan and luz 2005 the difference is possibly due to rh difference 78 vs 98 at two sites this indirectly confirms the importance of the rh in evaporation as further discussed below in the sensitivity analysis concerning the sensitivity of rh from 18 to 98 under fixed temperature with the decreasing of rh evaporation curves tend to be more stretched fig 7 this is similar to what was observed for groundwater evaporation in central atacama desert chile rh from 25 to 65 surma et al 2018 the slope λ range of simulated dew varied widely by 0 0065 and 0 0028 for the two sites these demonstrated that the dew 17o excess values were more sensitive to the changes in rh than that in temperature regardless the location this strengthened the view that 17o excess is principally influenced by rh during 10 c to 45 c which has been confirmed by theoretical experiments barkan and luz 2005 cao and liu 2011 and previous field observations landais et al 2010 li et al 2017 uechi and uemura 2019 winkler et al 2012 meanwhile this confirms that rh is the principal drivers of dew formation in the evaporation model under non steady state furthermore the 17o excess for all of the dew data in our study was positively correlated with rh which is consistent with the observations in african monsoon rainfall landais et al 2010 however 17o excess has no relationship with temperature meaning that the local rh exerts an important influence on 17o excess during dew evaporation under the different climate settings 5 conclusions dew plays an increasing important role in the ecohydrological processes in many ecosystems especially under climate change the present report is the first to study and analyze whether dew is influenced by different degree of evaporation by means of 17o excess and the relationships between different isotopic parameters e g δ 18o vs δ 17o 17o excess vs δ 18o or d excess the study has been carried out in three different sites with various climate settings gobabeb desert climate nice mediterranean climate and indianapolis humid continental climate mean value 17o excess of dew in hyper arid gobabeb 9 22 per meg was the lowest with the largest range while they were similar in other two humid regions nice 34 12 per meg and indianapolis 35 11 per meg based on observed data and simulations we conclude that dew formation in gobabeb experienced kinetic fractionation processes associated with evaporation under non steady state as well as for some of the dew events with temperature over 14 7 c in indianapolis while the dew formation in nice did not experience significant evaporation the local rh difference is responsible for the evaporation difference equilibrium or kinetic fractionation of dew formation which is also supported by the sensitivity analysis informed by these results 17o excess can be considered as a useful tracer to reveal the different evaporation process equilibrium or kinetic fractionation during dew formation under different climate settings credit authorship contribution statement chao tian data curation methodology writing original draft wenzhe jiao data curation methodology daniel beysens

5018,the reported wide change in natural vegetation growth in the northern hemisphere could have altered hydrological cycles in the past 30 years however it is hard to understand the underlying mechanisms for substantial variations in the magnitude and direction of runoff response to vegetation change models fail to clearly identify the underlying mechanisms due to limitations in accommodating all the driving factors of the extremely complex reality this study used a data driven approach to determine the linkages between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and runoff in the spring and summer seasons of 1982 2015 in 3600 northern mid high latitude 30 n catchments the results suggested that a significant p 0 05 negative correlation existed between spring ndvi and summer runoff in the rocky mountains the great lakes region the northern scandinavia and the alps in the southern rocky mountains there was a significant increase in spring ndvi and a decrease in summer runoff due to loss of snowpack in the great lakes region significant decrease in spring ndvi was accompanied by increase in summer runoff earlier spring onset and consequent withering vegetation in late spring significantly reduced spring ndvi while slightly increased summer runoff in northern rocky mountain the warmer and wetter winter could have increased spring ndvi owning to better water energy environment and insignificantly reduced summer runoff in northern scandinavia and the alps both anthropogenic warming and arctic amplification might influence the patterns of vegetation runoff in the region our findings can help improving the understanding on how vegetation change affects runoff and enhancing the forecasting abilities of hydrological models keywords vegetation runoff pattern northern hemisphere underlying mechanism arctic amplification hydrological process 1 introduction a significant change in natural vegetation growth has been detected in the northern hemisphere since the early 1980s myneni et al 1997 nemani et al 2003 piao et al 2006 mao et al 2013 pan et al 2018 a major concern related to the vegetation change is how it impacts runoff however it is hard to understand the underlying mechanisms for substantial variation in the magnitude and even direction of runoff response to the change in vegetation goulden and bales 2014 feng et al 2016 groß et al 2018 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 to date vegetation runoff relationships have been interpreted by different mechanisms including increasing co2 concentration gedney et al 2006 betts et al 2007 ukkola et al 2016 fowler et al 2019 vegetation cover change piao et al 2007 evaristo and mcdonnell 2019 amplification of photosynthesis mankin et al 2019 the limitations in these studies can be put into two broad groups firstly a single mechanism cannot explain all the vegetation runoff relationships across the globe the hydrological impact of stomatal closure due to co2 concentration is limited largely to the tropics and extremely high latitudes with rich water resources and less competing water demand mankin et al 2019 for much of the middle latitudes a general reduction of stomatal conductance is not supported by a 30 year tree ring based isotope measurement showing that the limiting effect of moisture outweighs the enhancing effect of co2 concentration on stomatal conductance guerrieri et al 2019 it is also worth to note that over 50 of global vegetation cover increase is caused by anthropogenic land use management including afforestation and agricultural intensification in northern middle latitudes especially in china and india song et al 2018 chen et al 2019 irrigation replenishes lost water and supports non native trees and dense crop growth causing the impact of vegetation cover on evapotranspiration et to outweigh that of stomata closure thus there is a significant decrease in runoff in response to increase in vegetation cover in regions with intensive human intervention seifert and lobell 2015 feng et al 2016 jin et al 2017 zastrow 2019 secondly most studies have focused on the relationships between vegetation and et rather than the relationships between et and runoff the et runoff relationships are generally nonlinear because runoff is influenced not only by et but by many other factors including precipitation soil moisture groundwater storage basin characteristics snow accumulation and hydrometeorology from adjacent regions increasing et due to vegetation cover can increase humidity and decrease temperature in ambient environment this in turn limits further vegetation growth and et increase all of which have been observed in the southern hemisphere and tropical rainforest jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 zhanget al 2017 lemordant et al 2018 numerical simulations without climatic adaptation could exaggerate the influence of et on runoff thus some recent simulations either include corresponding changes in climatic factors such as precipitation feedback to the increase in vegetation cover lemordant et al 2018 li et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 or cautiously connect et to its related factors such as soil moisture samaniego et al 2018 lian et al 2020 solving the two weaknesses stated here could deepen existing understanding about vegetation runoff relationship and increase our ability to forecast future hydrological changes in short the contradiction in predicting runoff response to vegetation change using one mechanism reveals that there still exist many unknowns in our understanding in vegetation runoff relationship for natural ecosystems in the northern mid high latitude regions current model driven approaches are insufficient to answer the unknowns because 1 models are simplifications of the real world complexities that reflect our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that build up that complex reality singh and woolhiser 2002 singhet al 2006 although models are an important tool to describe processes for which the driving factors are well understood in this case models are insufficient because the underlying mechanisms of vegetation runoff relationships are still unclear 2 the current simulations of hydrological responses to vegetation change are carried out at annual scale rather than at seasonal scale gedney et al 2006 piao et al 2007 however increase in vegetation cover in natural ecosystems mainly occurs in spring during which season warming induces earlier leaf emergence and higher leaf cover peñuelas and filella 2001 schwartz et al 2006 peñuelas et al 2009 thus runoff could be more influenced by increase in vegetation cover at seasonal spring summer than annual scale data driven approaches however have the capacity to reflect the combined impacts of all driving factors including vegetation cover change atmospheric warming co2 fertilization amplification of photosynthesis precipitation feedback solomatine 2005 piao et al 2015 here in this study a data driven approach regression was used to link spring summer runoff response to spring vegetation change in 3600 catchments the objectives of the study were to i determine the relationships between spring vegetation and spring summer runoff in natural ecosystems across northern mid high latitudes using data driven approaches ii use appropriate region grouping to simplify the pattern of the complex vegetation runoff relationships and iii discuss the possible underlying mechanisms of vegetation runoff relationships at the region specific scale the data driven approach provides the key for understanding the mechanisms behind vegetation runoff relationship at seasonal scale spring and summer and is critical for identifying the driving factors and improving future hydrological model predictions 2 data and methods 2 1 research area and data a total of 3670 catchments were selected in mid high latitude region in the northern hemisphere 30 n for the period 1982 2015 this region was selected because of the large increase in global vegetation cover during that period zeng 2016 zhu et al 2016 song et al 2018 chen et al 2019 three criteria were used for the catchment selection 1 reservoir capacity less than 10 of annual runoff to avoid intense anthropogenic influence 2 catchment area less than 10 000 km2 to rule out scale effect of very large basins on the results and 3 missing daily discharge data for each catchment and each month less than 10 ensuring that the missing data is less than three days in a month zhang and post 2018 the missing data were interpolated using the mean value observed in adjacent days catchment attributes catchment area reservoir influence and snow fraction and the corresponding daily discharge in m3 s were obtained from beck et al 2020 all the selected catchments are located in north america and europe and the catchments in other continents were excluded due to either intensive anthropogenic impact or low data availability the main input data included precipitation temperature and ndvi the 0 1 resolution daily precipitation p mm day for 1981 2015 was obtained from multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 2 mswep v2 2 beck et al 2019 then the 0 1 resolution daily mean air temperature t for the same time period in unit of c was obtained from the reanalysis based merged datasets msmet the latest version of global inventory monitoring and modeling system gimms 0 083 resolution bi weekly ndvi was used for foliar cover https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms the choice of mswep and msmet datasets was due to their finer spatial resolution developed by multi source merging of gauge satellite and reanalyzed estimates beck et al 2019 furthermore gimms ndvi dataset is good for temporal change analysis beck et al 2011 2 2 methods 2 2 1 data driven approach multiple linear regression is a widely used model to predict responses from multiple predictors here three key variables were selected for predicting streamflow variability including precipitation water availability temperature energy availability and ndvi surface vegetation condition as spring summer runoff can be highly influenced by accumulated snowpack in winter and spring seasons especially in high latitudes and montane areas variables for previous seasons were also used in order to increase the accuracy of regression analysis the two regression equations built are as follows 1 q spring β 1 p w int e r β 2 t w int e r β 3 p spring β 4 t spring β 5 n d v i spring 2 q summer β 1 p spring β 2 t spring β 3 n d v i spring β 4 p summer β 5 t summer β 6 n d v i summer where qspring and qsummer are the sum of runoff in spring march to may and summer june to august pwinter pspring and psummer are the sum of precipitation in winter december to february spring and summer twinter tspring and tsummer are the average temperature respectively for winter spring and summer ndvispring and ndvisummer are the average ndvi for spring and summer all the predictors were standardized by subtracting the mean value and then dividing by standard deviation x mean x std x βi is the regression coefficient the gridded data were averaged into single value in each catchment based on the catchment boundary it is insufficient to interpret the relative contribution of each individual predictor using regression coefficient when the predictors are correlated judd et al 2009 a predictor could be highly correlated with a response variable but have a low regression coefficient because another predictor receives the credit for explaining the variation gromping 2007 techniques beta weights bw structure coefficients sc commonality coefficients cc and relative contribution ratio rcr were used to identify the maximal influential factor mif of each catchment defining as the predictor with the highest weight coefficient relative contribution kraha et al 2012 luo et al 2015 the four techniques showed highly consistent results with the consistent mif identified for 80 of catchments fig 1 in the following vegetation runoff analysis the mif from rcr technique was used because of its reliability and suitability for examining the relative contribution of each predictor rather than regression coefficients 2 2 2 vegetation runoff pattern identification two independent methods were used to show where runoff change was related to vegetation change and what type of relationship existed first the correlation between spring ndvi and spring summer runoff was analyzed and the spatial distribution of catchments with significant vegetation runoff relationship identified second to recognize the spatial distribution of catchment that has strong vegetation runoff relationships and to identify the likely driving mechanisms the catchments were grouped based on the following three criteria 1 maximal influential factor for spring runoff catchments were classified into four groups the winter precipitation dominant the winter temperature dominant the spring precipitation dominant and the spring temperature dominant for summer runoff catchments were also classified into four groups the spring precipitation dominant the spring temperature dominant the summer precipitation dominant and the summer temperature dominant 2 snow fraction catchments were classified into three groups snow fraction being 0 2 0 2 0 5 and 0 5 here precipitation at temperature below 0 c was regarded as snowfall 3 ndvi trend in spring catchments were classified into four groups according to spring ndvi trend significant increase insignificant increase significant decrease insignificant decrease the non parametric mann kendall method was used to determine whether or not a monotonic trend existed in the time series data once the p value was less than 0 05 the null hypothesis was rejected as a statistical significance was present in the time series data in this study the trend in the time series data was detected and each time series data standardized x mean x std x before trend analysis in each group the correlation and significance p 0 05 between spring ndvi and spring summer runoff were analyzed using the least square method and the student s t test fig 2 3 results 3 1 key factors of spring summer runoff change runoff change in most of the catchments in both spring and summer seasons was well predicted using eqs 1 and 2 this was particularly so for the united kingdom uk and eastern usa fig 3 where in seasonal precipitation dominated runoff change fig 5b it was weaker for the rocky mountains and some high latitudes where in season precipitation was less closely linked with runoff generally while precipitation was positively related temperature and ndvi negatively related with runoff fig 4 for spring runoff spring precipitation was the most influential factor in 70 of the catchments most of these catchments were located at the eastern and western coastal north america and europe fig 5 in addition winter precipitation drove spring runoff in 20 of the catchments and most of these catchments located in the southern rocky mountains the effect of the other factors winter temperature spring temperature and spring ndvi on spring runoff was less than that of winter and spring precipitation dominating spring runoff in just 10 of the catchments summer precipitation was superior to other factors in terms of the extent of influence on summer runoff this was the dominant factor driving summer runoff in 70 of the catchments mainly located in the eastern north america and northern europe fig 5 spring precipitation spring ndvi and spring temperature were respectively the dominant factors driving summer runoff in 11 8 6 and 7 5 of the catchments with most the catchment located in the western north america and southern europe summer temperature and ndvi were the dominant driving factors of summer runoff in only 5 4 of the catchments 3 2 significant vegetation runoff relationship identification based on two independent analysis the spatial distribution of the catchments with significant spring vegetation runoff relationship was determined first significant negative correlation existed between spring ndvi and summer runoff for the rocky mountains great lakes region northern scandinavia and the alps region fig 6 a coincidentally the spatial distribution of these catchments had much overlap with those determined by the other method using catchment classification significant negative correlation also existed between spring ndvi and summer runoff in the two catchment groups spring temperature dominant and high snow fraction snow fraction 0 5 fig 2 while spring temperature dominant catchments mainly existed in the rocky mountains high snow fraction catchments were in the high latitudes 50 n and the great lakes region fig 6b also spring ndvi dominant catchments for summer runoff occurred in the stated regions although with smaller spatial range fig 6c the spatial overlap was probably driven by the temperature snow and vegetation analysis of the trends and significance in spring ndvi and summer runoff was used to determine vegetation runoff patterns in the above mentioned regions contrary to the general understanding our results showed that spring ndvi did not always have an increasing trend fig 7 it significantly increased in most of europe eastern north america and southern rocky mountains but decreased in the northern rocky mountains great lakes region and western scandinavia summer runoff significantly increased in the great lakes region and decreased in the southern rocky mountains in the european alps where summer drought was frequently documented in recent two decades mastrotheodoros et al 2020 summer runoff was only insignificant for the decreasing trend figs 6 and 7 together show four divergent negative vegetation runoff patterns in the four regions significant spring ndvi increase and summer runoff decrease in the southern rocky mountains significant spring ndvi decrease and summer runoff increase in the great lakes region significant spring ndvi decrease and insignificant summer runoff increase in the northern rocky mountains and the significant spring ndvi increase and insignificant summer runoff decrease in northern scandinavia and the alps both spring and summer runoff changes in these regions were well captured in the two regression equations fig 8 a while in the alps spring precipitation had the most influence on summer runoff summer precipitation had the highest impact on summer runoff in the great lakes region fig 8b spring temperature dominated summer runoff in the southern rocky mountains and both spring ndvi and summer precipitation contributed to summer runoff in northern scandinavia and northern rocky mountains the driving mechanisms were analyzed and discussed accordingly 4 discussions while snowpack was critical in runoff generation in the southern rocky mountains spring mountain snowpack declined over a large area in the past decades hamlet et al 2007 this was due to warmer temperatures and decreasing precipitation induced by weakening westerly winds this has resulted in changing hydrological cycle in cool seasons such as less snow precipitation earlier snow melt more runoff in cool seasons and less warm season water availability luce et al 2014 these phenomena were evident in the data from both in situ observations and model driven simulations liu et al 2018 jepsen et al 2016 as vegetation developed in locations where snowpack is disappearing the increase in vegetation cover was indirectly related to decreasing runoff mote et al 2018 our analysis is consistent with other studies in this region where temperature is the dominant driving factor of runoff fig 9 a as temperature partially controls snowpack and snowmelt in cold season for the northern rocky mountains earlier spring onset increased soil moisture depletion leading to diminished greenness in late spring and summer buermann et al 2013 in western scandinavia exposure of vegetation to extreme warm winter damaged sub arctic plant communities leading to a significant decline in leaf area bokhorst et al 2009 despite different mechanisms actual evapotranspiration decreased in summer whereas runoff subsequently increased slightly in the two regions fig 9b our analysis also showed that ndvi in late spring had a significant effect on summer runoff the driven factors behind summer drought in northern scandinavia and the european alps were widely documented mastrotheodoros et al 2020 lian et al 2020 earlier vegetation growth caused larger et increase than the precipitation increase in summer fig 9d the higher vegetation cover in summer could be supported by the higher water input in winter and spring which requires further investigation the driving mechanism of negative vegetation runoff relationship in the three regions is widely investigated however there was little documentation on vegetation runoff change in the great lakes region chen et al 2015 and the driving mechanisms for the northern high latitudes was also not clear zhang et al 2001 peterson et al 2002 labat et al 2004 rawlins et al 2006 dai 2016 model driven approaches treat the northern high latitudes as a whole and attribute the increasing runoff to increasing temperature precipitation co2 concentration and landuse change gedney et al 2006 betts et al 2007 gerten et al 2008 lemordant et al 2018 we speculate that the driving mechanism in the great lakes region and some regions of the northern high latitudes was probably the faster warming of the arctic compared to the rest of world the so called arctic amplification and the negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao this is because the geographic range of influenced of arctic amplification and nao highly overlapped in the northern scandinavia and the great lakes region in our study cohen et al 2014 when nao was negative storm tracks shifted towards the equator resulting in colder winter in northern eurasia and eastern us but warmer winter in the arctic region cohen et al 2014 this phenomenon is often called warm arctic cold continents some recent studies note that nao was increasingly negative in the last two decades because of dwindling arctic sea ice cover suggesting that cold winters were recently more common in northern middle latitudes cohen et al 2014 screen 2014 kug et al 2015 consistent with other studies our data here also showed decreasing winter temperature in mid latitude north america and europe fig 10 in these regions winter was snowier and colder hampering spring vegetation growth and bring more snowmelt runoff in summer fig 9c our analysis also showed that summer precipitation was the most dominant factor on summer runoff this would require further studies to separate the contribution of snowmelt and summer precipitation to runoff in the study area this work can contribute to ecohydrology in the following aspects 1 the generalization of location specific mechanisms driving different vegetation runoff patterns in different geographic regions by dividing complex variations to several groups and 2 the opening of a new window of view of hydrological response to vegetation change in the great lakes and other northern latitude regions using the data driven approach this study only qualitatively attempted to answer the questions about what are vegetation runoff patterns and where these patterns exist however a model driven approach that accommodates various driving factors is also needed to test whether certain mechanisms such as precipitation feedbacks to vegetation change and arctic amplification could account for the observed patterns currently there are only few models that connect arctic amplification to severe middle latitude weather conditions cohen et al 2020 which obscures a clear understanding of runoff response to vegetation change under resilient climate 5 conclusions how summer runoff responds to spring vegetation change in the northern hemisphere is a hot but unsolved issue attempts to attribute substantial variations to a single mechanism are inappropriate because the overgeneralization ignores particularity of specific space and time model driven approaches insufficiently resolve the issues due to lack of thorough knowledge of catchment complexities this study offers a data driven approach which identifies four divergent spring vegetation summer runoff patterns and provides potential explanations for the 1982 2015 study period spring ndvi increased and summer runoff significantly decreased in the southern rocky mountains likely due to snowpack loss there was a significant decrease in spring ndvi and increase in summer runoff in the great lakes region likely due to colder winter spring ndvi significantly decreased and summer runoff increased though insignificantly in the northern rocky mountain due to earlier spring onset finally warmer and wetter winter could have led to an increase in spring ndvi and a decrease although insignificant in summer runoff in the northern scandinavia

vegetation runoff pattern northern hemisphere underlying mechanism arctic amplification hydrological process 1 introduction a significant change in natural vegetation growth has been detected in the northern hemisphere since the early 1980s myneni et al 1997 nemani et al 2003 piao et al 2006 mao et al 2013 pan et al 2018 a major concern related to the vegetation change is how it impacts runoff however it is hard to understand the underlying mechanisms for substantial variation in the magnitude and even direction of runoff response to the change in vegetation goulden and bales 2014 feng et

can be put into two broad groups firstly a single mechanism cannot explain all the vegetation runoff relationships across the globe the hydrological impact of stomatal closure due to co2 concentration is limited largely to the tropics and extremely high latitudes with rich water resources and less competing water demand mankin et al 2019 for much of the middle latitudes a general reduction of stomatal conductance is not supported by a 30 year tree ring based isotope measurement showing that the limiting effect of moisture outweighs the enhancing effect of co2 concentration on stomatal conductance guerrieri et al 2019 it is also worth to note that over 50 of global vegetation cover increase is caused by anthropogenic land use management including afforestation and agricultural intensification in northern middle latitudes especially in china and india song et al 2018 chen et al 2019 irrigation replenishes lost water and supports non native trees and dense crop growth causing the impact of vegetation cover on evapotranspiration et to outweigh that of stomata closure thus there is a significant decrease in runoff in response to increase in vegetation cover in regions with intensive human intervention seifert and lobell 2015 feng et al 2016 jin et al 2017 zastrow 2019 secondly most studies have focused on the relationships between vegetation and et rather than the relationships between et and runoff the et runoff relationships are generally nonlinear because runoff is influenced not only by et but by many other factors including precipitation soil moisture groundwater storage basin characteristics snow accumulation and hydrometeorology from adjacent regions increasing et due to vegetation cover can increase humidity and decrease temperature in ambient

2017 lemordant et al 2018 numerical simulations without climatic adaptation could exaggerate the influence of et on runoff thus some recent simulations either include corresponding changes in climatic factors such as precipitation feedback to the increase in vegetation cover lemordant et al 2018 li et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 or cautiously connect et to its related factors such as soil moisture samaniego et al 2018 lian et al 2020 solving the two weaknesses stated here could deepen existing understanding about vegetation runoff relationship and increase our ability to forecast future hydrological changes in short the contradiction in predicting runoff response to vegetation change using one mechanism reveals that there still exist many unknowns in our understanding in vegetation

predictions 2 data and methods 2 1 research area and data a total of 3670 catchments were selected in mid high latitude region in the northern hemisphere 30 n for the period 1982 2015 this region was selected because of the large increase in global vegetation cover during that period zeng 2016 zhu et al 2016 song et al 2018 chen et al 2019 three criteria were used for the catchment selection 1 reservoir capacity less than 10 of annual runoff to avoid intense anthropogenic influence 2 catchment area less than 10 000 km2 to rule out scale effect of very large basins on the results and 3 missing daily discharge data for each catchment and each month less than 10 ensuring that the missing data is less than three days in a month zhang and post 2018 the missing data were interpolated

streamflow variability including precipitation water availability temperature energy availability and ndvi surface vegetation condition as spring summer runoff can be highly influenced by accumulated snowpack in winter and spring seasons especially in high latitudes and montane areas variables for previous seasons were also used in order to increase the accuracy of regression analysis the two

summer all the predictors were standardized by subtracting the mean value and then dividing by standard deviation x mean x std x βi is the regression coefficient the gridded data were averaged into single value in each catchment based on the catchment boundary it is insufficient to interpret the relative contribution of each individual predictor using regression coefficient when the predictors are correlated judd et al 2009 a predictor could be highly correlated with a response variable but have a low regression coefficient because another predictor receives the credit for explaining the

consistent mif identified for 80 of catchments fig 1 in the following vegetation runoff analysis the mif from rcr technique was used because of its reliability and suitability for examining the relative contribution of each predictor rather than regression coefficients 2 2 2 vegetation runoff pattern identification two independent methods were used to show where runoff change was related to vegetation change and what type of relationship existed first the correlation between spring ndvi and spring summer runoff was analyzed and the spatial distribution of catchments with significant vegetation runoff relationship identified second to recognize the spatial distribution of catchment that has strong vegetation runoff relationships and to identify the likely driving mechanisms the catchments were grouped based on the following three criteria 1 maximal influential factor for spring runoff catchments were classified into four groups the winter precipitation dominant the winter temperature dominant the spring precipitation dominant and the spring temperature dominant for summer runoff catchments were also classified into four groups the spring precipitation dominant the spring temperature dominant the summer precipitation dominant and the summer temperature dominant 2 snow fraction catchments were classified into three groups snow fraction being 0 2 0 2 0 5 and 0 5 here precipitation at temperature below 0 c was regarded as snowfall 3 ndvi trend in spring catchments were classified into four groups according to spring ndvi trend significant increase insignificant increase significant decrease insignificant decrease the non parametric mann kendall method was used to determine whether or not a monotonic trend existed in the time series data once the p value was less than 0 05 the null hypothesis was rejected as a statistical significance was present in the time series data in this study the trend in the time series data was detected and each time series data standardized x mean x std x before trend analysis in each group the correlation and significance p 0 05 between spring ndvi and spring summer runoff were analyzed using the least square method and the student s t test fig 2 3 results 3 1 key factors of spring summer runoff change runoff change in most of the catchments in both spring and summer seasons was well predicted using eqs 1 and 2 this was particularly so for the united kingdom uk and eastern usa fig 3 where in seasonal precipitation dominated runoff change fig 5b it was weaker for the rocky mountains and some high latitudes where in season precipitation was less closely linked with runoff generally while precipitation was positively related temperature and ndvi negatively related with runoff fig 4 for spring runoff spring precipitation was the most influential factor in 70 of the catchments most of these catchments were located at the eastern and western coastal north america and europe fig 5 in addition winter precipitation drove spring runoff in 20 of the catchments and most of these catchments located in the southern rocky mountains the effect of the other factors winter temperature spring temperature and spring ndvi on spring runoff was less than that of winter and spring precipitation dominating spring runoff in just 10 of the catchments summer precipitation was superior to other factors in terms of the extent of influence on summer runoff this was the dominant factor driving summer runoff in 70 of the catchments mainly located in the eastern north america and northern europe fig 5 spring precipitation spring ndvi and spring temperature were respectively the dominant factors driving summer runoff in 11 8 6 and 7 5 of the catchments with most the catchment located in the western north america and southern europe summer temperature and ndvi were the dominant driving factors of summer runoff in only 5 4 of the catchments 3 2 significant vegetation runoff relationship identification based on two independent analysis the spatial distribution of the catchments with significant spring vegetation runoff relationship was determined first significant negative correlation existed between spring ndvi and summer runoff for the rocky mountains great lakes region northern scandinavia and the alps region fig 6 a coincidentally the spatial distribution of these catchments had much overlap with those determined by the other method using catchment classification significant negative correlation also existed between spring ndvi and summer runoff in the two catchment groups spring temperature dominant and high snow fraction snow fraction 0 5 fig 2 while spring temperature dominant catchments mainly existed in the rocky mountains high snow fraction catchments were in the high latitudes 50 n and the great lakes region fig 6b also spring ndvi dominant catchments for summer runoff occurred in the stated regions although with smaller spatial range fig 6c the spatial overlap was probably driven by the temperature snow and vegetation analysis of the trends and significance in spring ndvi and summer runoff was used to determine vegetation runoff patterns in the above mentioned regions contrary to the general understanding our results showed that spring ndvi did not always have an increasing trend fig 7 it significantly increased in most of europe eastern north america and southern rocky mountains but decreased in the northern rocky mountains great lakes region and western scandinavia summer runoff significantly increased in the great lakes region and decreased in the southern rocky mountains in the european alps where summer drought was frequently documented in recent two decades mastrotheodoros et al 2020 summer runoff was only insignificant for the decreasing trend figs 6 and 7 together show four divergent negative vegetation runoff patterns in the four regions significant spring ndvi increase and summer runoff decrease in the southern rocky mountains significant spring ndvi decrease and summer runoff increase in the great lakes region significant spring ndvi decrease and insignificant summer runoff increase in the northern rocky mountains and the significant spring ndvi increase and insignificant summer runoff decrease in northern scandinavia and the alps both spring and summer runoff changes in these regions were well captured in the two regression equations fig 8 a while in the alps spring precipitation had the most influence on summer runoff summer precipitation had the highest impact on summer runoff in the great lakes region fig 8b spring temperature dominated summer runoff in the southern rocky mountains and both spring ndvi and summer precipitation contributed to summer runoff in northern scandinavia and northern rocky mountains the driving mechanisms were analyzed and discussed accordingly 4 discussions while snowpack was critical in runoff generation in the southern rocky mountains spring mountain snowpack declined over a large area in the past decades hamlet et al 2007 this was due to warmer temperatures and decreasing precipitation induced by weakening westerly winds this has resulted in changing hydrological cycle in cool seasons such as less snow precipitation earlier snow melt more runoff in cool seasons and less warm season water availability luce et al 2014 these phenomena were evident in the data from both in situ observations and model driven simulations liu et al 2018 jepsen et al 2016 as vegetation developed in locations where snowpack is disappearing the increase in vegetation cover was indirectly related to decreasing runoff mote et al 2018 our analysis is consistent with other studies in this region where temperature is the dominant driving factor of runoff fig 9 a as temperature partially controls snowpack and snowmelt in cold season for the northern rocky mountains earlier spring onset increased soil moisture depletion leading to diminished greenness in late spring and summer buermann et al 2013 in western scandinavia exposure of vegetation to extreme warm winter damaged sub arctic plant communities leading to a significant decline in leaf area bokhorst et al 2009 despite different mechanisms actual evapotranspiration decreased in summer whereas runoff subsequently increased slightly in the two regions fig 9b our analysis also showed that ndvi in late spring had a significant effect on summer runoff the driven factors behind summer drought in northern scandinavia and the european alps were widely documented mastrotheodoros et al 2020 lian et al 2020 earlier vegetation growth caused larger et increase than the precipitation increase in summer fig 9d the higher vegetation cover in summer could be supported by the higher water input in winter and spring which requires further investigation the driving mechanism of negative vegetation runoff relationship in the three regions is widely investigated however there was little documentation on vegetation runoff change in the great lakes region chen et al 2015 and the driving mechanisms for the northern high latitudes was also not clear zhang et al 2001 peterson et al 2002 labat et al 2004 rawlins et al 2006 dai 2016 model driven approaches treat the northern high latitudes as a whole and attribute the increasing runoff to increasing temperature precipitation co2 concentration and landuse change gedney et al 2006 betts et al 2007 gerten et al 2008 lemordant et al 2018 we speculate that the driving mechanism in the great lakes region and some regions of the northern high latitudes was probably the faster warming of the arctic compared to the rest of world the so called arctic amplification and the negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao this is because the geographic range of influenced of arctic amplification and nao highly overlapped in the northern scandinavia and the great lakes region in our study cohen et al 2014 when nao was negative storm tracks shifted towards the equator resulting in colder winter in northern eurasia and eastern us but warmer winter in the arctic region cohen et al 2014 this phenomenon is often called warm arctic cold continents some recent studies note that nao was increasingly negative in the last two decades because of dwindling arctic sea ice cover suggesting that cold winters were recently more common in northern middle latitudes cohen et al 2014 screen 2014 kug et al 2015 consistent with other studies our data here also showed decreasing winter temperature in mid latitude north america and europe fig 10 in these regions winter was snowier and colder hampering spring vegetation growth and bring more snowmelt runoff in summer fig 9c our analysis also showed that summer precipitation was the most dominant factor on summer runoff this would require further studies to separate the contribution of snowmelt and summer precipitation to runoff in the study area this work can contribute to ecohydrology in the following aspects 1 the generalization of location specific mechanisms driving different vegetation runoff patterns in different geographic regions by dividing complex variations to several groups and 2 the opening of a new window of view of hydrological response to vegetation change in the great lakes and other northern latitude regions using the data driven approach this study only qualitatively attempted to answer the questions about what are vegetation runoff patterns and where these patterns exist however a model driven approach that accommodates various driving factors is also needed to test whether certain mechanisms such as precipitation feedbacks to vegetation change and arctic amplification could account for the observed patterns currently there are only few models that connect arctic amplification to severe middle latitude weather conditions cohen et al 2020 which obscures a clear understanding of runoff response to vegetation change under resilient climate 5 conclusions how summer runoff responds to spring vegetation change in the northern hemisphere is a hot but unsolved issue attempts to attribute substantial variations to a single mechanism are inappropriate because the overgeneralization ignores particularity of specific space and time model driven approaches insufficiently resolve the issues due to lack of thorough knowledge of catchment complexities this study offers a data driven approach which identifies four divergent spring vegetation summer runoff patterns and provides potential explanations for the 1982 2015 study period spring ndvi increased and summer runoff significantly decreased in the southern rocky mountains likely due to snowpack loss there was a significant decrease in spring ndvi and increase in summer runoff in the great lakes region likely due to colder winter spring ndvi significantly decreased and summer runoff increased though insignificantly in the northern rocky mountain due to earlier spring onset finally warmer and wetter winter could have led to an increase in spring ndvi and a decrease although insignificant in summer runoff in the northern scandinavia

5019,a reliable flood loss assessment in city is the basis of efficient flood risk management however it is difficult to fit empirical functions with typical case data for most of the world s arid or semi arid cities that lack or even have no historical flood loss data under the background of frequent global extreme weather events and high speed urbanization urban flood loss assessment has become increasingly important to support urban flood risk management at present few researches have focused on the modeling of flood loss ratio function flrf for cities lacking loss data therefore based on the improved analogy principle a dynamic proportional substitution dps method in this paper was proposed to transfer large sample data from multiple quoted cities into a sample matrix of loss ratios in the study city to address the lack of data then according to the hierarchical data structure characteristics of the loss ratio matrix a hierarchical bayesian model hbm of flrf with unknown parameters was constructed based on the prior distribution of parameters finally taking the city lacking data zhengzhou china as the study area the water depth loss ratio functions of four land types industry commerce residence and public utilities were calculated the results showed that 1 the combined feature schemes achieved dynamic selectivity 2 the parameters gradually converged after a certain number of iterations 3 the error of flrf solved by hbm was less than that of the least square method lsm 4 the dps hbm model had good performance in transplantation verification this study is expected to provide a reference for the establishment of flood loss functions in cities lacking data 1 introduction under the background of rapid urbanization the urban population and assets density have been increasing compared with the traditional agricultural society under the same scale of flooding conditions the losses of floods will increase significantly creutin et al 2013 löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 to ensure the safety of urban flood risk control people are striving to build a comprehensive flood control engineering system including engineering measures juan et al 2017 rehan 2018 fiori and volpi 2020 and non engineering measures van ootegem et al 2015 ravazzani et al 2016 corral et al 2019 so as to reduce flood losses effectively however once an over standard flood occurs the flood losses will increase sharply ercolani et al 2018 amadio et al 2019 wu et al 2020a ge et al 2021 as a non engineering measure accurate quantification assessment of flood losses in a changing urban environmental and societal system is essential for urban flood adaptation planning and risk management van ootegem et al 2015 by constructing a reasonable flood loss function to assess losses it is more helpful to rationally grasp the evolution trend of flood risk and provide a reference for the preparation of flood control planning also for insurance applications more precise assessment of flood losses is required wagenaar et al 2017 affected by multiple factors such as rainfall geographic conditions flood control standards and economic development the flood loss assessment has the characteristics of multi dimensional and disciplinary integration jongman et al 2012 sairam et al 2019 a standard assessment system has not yet been formed but there are many existing flood loss assessment methods such as standard assessment function developed by city or regional government unsw 1981 davis 1985 usace 1996 penning rowsell et al 2005 messner et al 2007 and empirical models based on typical flood case data merz et al 2013 dottori et al 2016 wagenaar et al 2017 carisi et al 2018 vogel et al 2018 amadio et al 2019 most cities lack sufficient data to support the construction of such models or functions flood loss ratio relative loss is defined as the ratio of the potential damage value to the total risky assets at a certain inundated depth the flrf considered as an internationally accepted general method for assessing direct flood loss is formed by taking water depth as an independent variable and the loss ratio as a dependent variable smith 1994 but the construction of such a function requires the support of a large amount of historical disaster loss data however for most of the arid and semi arid regions of the world s inland plain cities there is little or even no sample data of historical flood losses gerl et al 2016 with the explosion of extreme climates and the expansion of the scale of urban construction the vulnerability of urban floods has increased and the economic losses caused by floods for those cities cannot be ignored löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 gori et al 2018 therefore it is urgent to establish a method of solving the flrf for different cities lacking flood data to support urban flood risk management for areas with few or even no flood data some studies have been tried on the one hand the loss function is directly transferred between cities cammerer et al 2013 scorzini and frank 2015 these spatial dependent empirical models do not perform well in spatial transference schröter et al 2014 on the other hand the analogy principle is used for indirect transfer for example shi 2010 and chen et al 2019 used characteristic indicators based on the static analogy principle to carry out spatial transfer of loss functions between cities based on the optimization principle of variation coefficient and beta distribution wu et al 2021 also established a static analogy principle to realize the transfer of disaster loss data from multiple cities to the study area the analogy principle provides a feasible idea for the filling of the lost sample data in cities or areas lacking flood sample data but the static contingency problems caused by its single conversion factor need to be considered after several loss ratio data will be filled under the multistage water depth in cities lacking flood data it has a hierarchical data structure since the flrf is a monotone function the function mapping relationship makes each independent variable have only one dependent variable y corresponding to it without discarding any sample data the hierarchical data structure of the sample makes direct regression analysis difficult however in general studies multiple dependent variables are first transformed into a single characteristic value such as the average value before regression fitting leading to the loss of sample characteristic information caused by the assumption of hydrological consistency katz et al 2002 asgharzadeh and sanjari farsipour 2008 shi 2010 bañuls et al 2016 moreover making full use of the existing general understanding of loss function parameters prior distribution will also effectively improve the accuracy of function fitting lima et al 2016 however how to take full advantage of the samples with hierarchical data structure and prior knowledge to construct the loss function is an urgent problem to be solved the purpose of this study is as follows 1 to solve the lack of flood loss ratio sample in cities lacking flood data 2 to solve the problem of hierarchical data structure in the sample data of loss ratio after filling first the large sample data are used to consider quoted cities as much as possible and the feature indicator is transformed from a single feature indicator to a comprehensive scheme set of different combinations then the single loss ratio at each water depth is expanded into a loss ratio transfer matrix thereby filling the sample data of the flood loss ratio section 2 3 a double layer bayesian model was constructed based on the prior distribution of parameters and likelihood function and the filled sample data were used to estimate the parameters of the flrf section 2 4 finally taking the city lacking flood data zhengzhou china as the study area the water depth loss ratio functions of four land types were calculated and the rationality and accuracy of the dps hbm mode was analyzed this study is expected to supplement the existing flood loss assessment modeling methods for cities or areas with limited data 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study zhengzhou city the capital of henan province is located in the southern part of the north china plain fig 1 the urban area of the city is 1010 3 km2 with a population of 10 35 million and its urbanization ratio reaches 74 6 in 2020 similar to most arid and semi arid inland plains cities the rainfall of zhengzhou varied greatly both in annual and inter annual years the flood season spans from july to september every year during which the rainfall accounts for 60 70 of the total annual rainfall wu et al 2020b the government departments have not conducted a systematic and comprehensive investigation and data storage for the flood losses because the frequency of flood is high due to the imperfect urban infrastructure but the intensity of disaster is small resulting in less economic losses however with the explosion of extreme weather and the expansion of the scale of urban construction the vulnerability of urban floods has increased löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 amadio et al 2019 and the economic losses caused by floods cannot be ignored so it is urgent to put forward the diagnosis method of flood losses in cities with insufficient data to control the risk of urban flood 3 research framework the research framework is to solve the problem of constructing the flrf of the city lacking loss data as shown in fig 2 the proposed framework reflecting the workflow contains three major steps 1 filling flood loss ratio sample data based on dps in cities lacking loss data 2 estimating the parameter of the flrf based on hbm 3 collecting the data and applying the constructed model in the study area 3 1 filling in flood loss ratio sample data based on dps 1 establishing the optional loss ratio matrix in cities lacking flood loss data the flood loss ratio is usually obtained by hydrological analogy shi 2010 chen et al 2019 that is given the loss ratio of the quoted city r 0 the loss ratio of the study city r is deduced and the loss ratio of the quoted city can be converted into the loss ratio of the study city through the characteristic indicator i study city and i 0 quoted city affecting the flood losses which is shown in eq 1 at present only a single quoted city is considered as an analogy object secondly the selected indicators are too single focusing on the level of urban economy and ignoring the influence of other factors such as the disaster bearing environment and the ability to prevent and mitigate disasters löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 the low representativeness and contingency of a single object led to the increase of uncertainty in the process of determining the loss ratio 1 r r 0 i i 0 r r 0 i i 0 r 0 λ where λ is the transfer coefficient therefore in order to reduce the uncertainty in the spatial transfer of loss ratio this study first increased the number of quoted objects and then expanded it into multiple schemes through the combination of multiple indicators and finally the single loss ratio results were transformed into optional loss ratio matrix r the basic steps are as follows step1 if m quoted cities are considered i e r i 0 i 1 m the loss ratio matrix r0 of m quoted cities can be obtained as follows 2 r 0 r 1 0 r 2 0 r m 0 step2 in order to reduce the subjectivity and contingency of indicator selection and plan construction k characteristic indicators are arranged and combined to form n j 1 n different combination schemes eq 3 to achieve the purpose of reducing uncertainty and c k k k 1 k represents the number of schemes combining k indicators selected by k characteristic indicators 3 n c k 1 c k 2 c k k c k k step3 the characteristic comprehensive values of n combined schemes in the study city and the quoted cities were calculated respectively assuming that cij represents the characteristic comprehensive value of the study city under the jth j 1 n scheme c i ij 0 indicates the characteristic comprehensive value of the ith i 1 m quoted city under the jth scheme among them the value of single indicator scheme j 1 k is the comprehensive value the multi indicators scheme j k 1 n needs to be converted into the comprehensive value through the projection pursuit model with chaotic particle swarm optimization zhang et al 2018 step4 assuming that λ ij is the transfer coefficient of the jth scheme of the ith quoted city and λ ij c i j c i ij 0 so the transfer coefficient matrix λ of m n combination schemes can be obtained 4 λ c i 1 c i 11 0 c i 2 c i 12 0 c i n c i 1 n 0 c i 1 c i 21 0 c i 2 c i 22 0 c i n c i 2 n 0 c i 1 c i m 1 0 c i 2 c i m 2 0 c i n c i mn 0 λ 11 λ 12 λ 1 n λ 21 λ 22 λ 2 n λ m 1 λ m 2 λ mn step5 in summary it can be transformed into the m n loss ratio matrix r of the study area as follows 5 r r 0 λ r 1 0 r 2 0 r m 0 λ 11 λ 12 λ 1 n λ 21 λ 22 λ 2 n λ m 1 λ m 2 λ mn r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r mn 2 filling in loss ratio sample data based on the minimum variation coefficient to reduce the uncertainty multiple feature schemes were set to obtain the optimal scheme r j under the same flood depth although the regional losses of different economic levels varied greatly the loss ratio should show a relatively consistent or very similar trend tennessee valley authority 1969 grigg and helweg 1975 moreover under the mathematical principle of analogy eq 1 all analogy results should be equal in the most ideal state therefore under the same scheme the data dispersion of the loss ratio set in different quoted cities after conversion should be as low as possible and the variation coefficient vc can better represent the dispersion degree of data niu et al 2018 therefore the optimization principle of the minimum vc is established to extract the optimal characteristic scheme step6 the loss ratio set of each characteristic scheme corresponds to the column vector of matrix r vcj of each column vector of matrix r is calculated to form vc of variation coefficient set as follows 6 v c j σ j u j 7 vc v c 1 v c 2 v c j v c n t where uj is the average value of the jth column vector u j r 1 j r 2 j r mj n σj is the variance of the jth column vector σ j j 1 n r mj u j n 1 step7 the scheme corresponding to the column vector vct with the minimum vc is the optimal scheme r c suppose the tth scheme is the optimal as follows 8 v c t min v c j j 1 ñ r c r 1 c r 2 c r mc step8 assuming that d represents flood depth value d 1 d r dc is only an optimal sample vector at the dth flood depth an optimal loss ratio matrix r is formed under dth optimal sample vector r dc of a land type as follows 9 r r 1 c r dc r dc r 11 c r 1 i c r 1 m c r d 1 c r dic r dmc r d 1 c r dic r dmc where rdic is the ith loss ratio of the r dc at the dth water depth 3 2 construction of flrf based on hbm the flood water depth loss ratio function f d follows an exponential form eq 10 which has been proved to be reasonable by flood loss assessment studies merz et al 2013 wagenaar et al 2017 rözer et al 2019 due to the mapping relationship of the function each independent variable has only one dependent variable y corresponding to it however the optimal sample matrix r at each water depth d has m loss ratios according to eq 9 thus the loss ratio sample matrix r has a hierarchical data structure and the accuracy of data fitting can be improved in loss model modeling by using bayesian model with general understanding of parameters lima et al 2016 a hbm is a multi level probabilistic regression model that estimates a set of coefficients for each data group while the predictors are used to model the outcomes sairam et al 2019 therefore this study uses multidimensional sample data and prior distribution of parameters to refer hbm to the construction of flood loss function to solve the problem of hierarchical data structure and improve the fitting accuracy in summary a hierarchical bayesian model hbm for flrf based on the prior distribution and likelihood function of parameters was constructed and the flrf was estimated by filled matrix r finally the solution was obtained by using markov chain monte carlo method mcmc 10 f d e k d b where f d is a function of flood water depth loss ratio k and b are the parameters to be solved rather than assuming a deterministic loss ratio at each water depth the probability model represented the uncertainty in the model structure parameters and noise in the data through a prior distribution random variables and probability distributions were introduced into hbm to estimate the flrf since the flood loss ratio was bounded to be between 0 and 1 and a regression model with unbounded distribution for prediction would lead to unreliable values chen et al 2019 therefore the dth loss ratio vector r c was modeled as a beta distribution between 0 and 1 eq 11 because the beta distribution is chosen to process the fraction motivated by the fact that the beta distribution can be concentrated on the narrow intervals and possess low probability in the tail rözer et al 2019 sairam et al 2019 11 beta α β γ α β γ α γ β r α 1 1 r β 1 where γ is the gamma function α and β are the dual parameters of the beta distribution α 0 and β 0 according to the parameter estimation properties of the beta distribution egorova et al 2008 α and β can be estimated by the following formulas 12 α μ d φ d 13 β 1 μ d φ d where μ d is the average value of r c at the dth water depth φ d is the corresponding variance the basic idea of function parameter estimation according to the hbm is that based on sample data prior distribution of parameters and likelihood function a hierarchical probability model of parameter posterior distribution eq 14 is established for the studied object or problem 14 p a b p b a p a p b p b a p a where a is the parameter to be solved b is the sample data p a b is the posterior probability density of the unknown parameter p b a is the likelihood function p a is the prior probability density of the parameter to be solved and p b is the normalization factor therefore the steps to build the hbm are as follows step9 assume that the average value of r c at the dth water depth is μ d which approximately follows eq 15 and the rdic is set to follow the beta distribution by eq 16 15 u d f d k b 16 r dic b e t a α β to satisfy the hbm to estimate the parameters to be solved it is necessary to establish the relationship between the beta distribution and μ d the α and β in above eq 16 are obtained from eqs 12 and 13 and the μ d in eqs 12 and 13 is given by eq 15 and φ d is the variance value of r c at dth water depth step10 when the parameters are not strictly restricted a general prior distribution can be provided for shared parameters gelman et al 2017 and the parameters k and b to be solved are set to follow the general prior distribution 17 k ñ o r m a l τ σ 18 b c a u c h y ε φ where τ σ ε φ are all super parameters and according to the general prior distribution study sairam et al 2019 k ñ o r m a l 0 1 and b c a u c h y 0 10 step11 combining eqs 15 and 16 a likelihood function was constructed by eq 19 substitute eqs 17 19 into eq 14 the joint posterior distribution of the parameter vector a to be solved is shown by eq 20 19 p b a d 1 d i 1 m beta α di β di f d k i b i φ d 20 p a b d 1 d i 1 m beta α di β di f d k i b i φ d p k τ σ p b ε φ step12 the mcmc sampling assumes markov property during an iteration gaume et al 2010 lima et al 2016 if the current state of the estimated parameter representing the data generation process was better than that of the previous state it was added to the parameter value chain monte carlo simulations create a large number of replications of these parameters that represent the loss process which results in approximate posterior distributions for μ d finally when a large number of iterations are run the parameter values are not influenced by where the sampling began initially to form the stable parameter k and b 3 3 prepared data according to the above the urban land types determine the number of the final flrf to be calculated the characteristic indicators and the quoted urban loss ratio are the conversion factors of eq 1 and the basis of data in this research they were determined as follows 1 division of urban land types in order to highlight the fine features of the city the calculated types of urban construction land were divided into industry commerce residence and public utilities public utilities land includes government management departments schools hospitals etc for details please see the article lv et al 2020 on urban land value classification and calculation written by the authors ultimately the flrf for these four property types were constructed in this study 2 collection of quoted flood loss ratio functions at present under the background of big data taking chinese cities as the search scope all urban flood loss ratio functions in all studies were collected and the data of 11 cities that could be quoted were obtained including jinan puyang harbin shenyang changchun shanghai zhuhai guangzhou wuxi tianjin shenzhen wenzhou ding 2004 li 2007 shi 2010 wang et al 2013 ke 2014 wu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 however the sample size m 9 11 of different property types was different and the flood depth ranges from 0 1 m to 4 0 m d 0 1 4 0 m d 4 0 m 3 establishment of characteristic indicators flood loss ratio are defined as the ratio of the potential damage value to the total risky assets at a certain inundated depth smith 1994 there is no fixed pattern for the characteristic indicators that affect the flood loss ratio shi 2010 chen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 such as per capita gdp per capita disposable income pcdi regional gdp then according to its definition the factors that affect the flood loss ratio are divided into two categories one is the economic level the other is the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity then the characteristic indicator system will be developed around these two aspects per capita gdp i1 and pcdi i2 represent the degree of economic development of a city which are the embodiment of total risky assets under some disaster prevention measures flood loss is the possible result of floods acting on the disaster bearing body of the disaster pregnant environment dottori et al 2016 then the elements of the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity will affect the loss ratio density of urban river network i3 density of urban pipe network i4 and pervious area ratio i5 are representative features of urban rainfall storage and prevention of waterlogging therefore a characteristic indicator system table 1 affecting the flood loss ratio was established in this study so 31 characteristic schemes were obtained among which the combination schemes were 5 c 5 1 10 c 5 2 10 c 5 3 5 c 5 4 and 1 c 5 5 respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 the filling results of urban flood loss ratio sample 4 1 1 analysis of sample data optimization results after establishing an optional loss ratio matrix r based on the analogy principle the optimal loss ratio matrix r under different land types was filled in according to the minimum vc taking 6 water depths 0 6 m 1 2 m 1 8 m 2 4 m 3 0 m 3 6 m under the residence as an example the results of 31 kinds of schemes for selecting the optimal sample vector r dc were shown in fig 3 the optimal schemes r dc were a234 a234 a234 a2354 a2354 and a345 respectively and the corresponding coefficients of variation were 0 433 0 383 0 298 0 365 0 399 and 0 416 different from the optimal sample other sample in some scheme sets was obviously dispersed which violated the principle that the loss ratio set under the same water depth in the area should show a more consistent or very similar trend tennessee valley authority 1969 grigg and helweg 1975 so it was necessary to optimize the scheme set moreover the contingency of the sample data formed by using a single scheme for proportional substitution increased the uncertainty of the loss assessment results 4 1 2 dynamic variability analysis of optimal scheme with the goal of the lowest dispersion the optimization principle of the minimum vc was established to realize the corresponding optimal scheme for each land type with all water depths fig 4 and there were four kinds of optimal schemes for industry three kinds for commerce four kinds for residence and three kinds for public utilities among them single double three and four indicators combination schemes were all used a24 and a245 schemes were used most often 3 times while indicator i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 were used among which indicator i4 density of urban pipe network was used the most 14 times which also confirmed the important role of urban pipe network in urban flood reduction in summary in addition to the different characteristics of the optimal scheme change under different water depths of a land type different scheme sets also had different water depth ranges fig 4 and the optimal schemes of different land types also showed different combination properties as a result the dynamic change feature in the proportional replacement of flood sample data was realized and the uncertainty of a single scheme based on proportional replacement was also reduced or eliminated to a certain extent 4 2 the flrf construction results 4 2 1 hierarchical bayesian modeling estimates parameter results after obtaining sample matrix r a multi level bayesian model was constructed to estimate the function parameters k and b which could be calculated by mcmc based on metropolis hasting m h taking the parameter solution of the commercial flrf as an example when different sampling times were selected the posterior statistical values of parameters k and b were shown in table 2 taking the number of iterations 2000 5000 and 10 000 as an example the iterative process of the two parameters to be estimated was shown in fig 5 from which we could see that the parameters to be estimated fluctuated significantly in a certain range for example when the number of iterations was 10000 the confidence interval α 0 05 of k was 1 562 1 880 and b was 0 922 1 109 according to the convergence discrimination of ergodic mean method monteiro and svaiter 2010 after the number of iterations reached 2000 table 2 the change range of the k and b to be estimated was relatively small the change ratio was only 0 7 and it could be assumed that the sampling status had basically converged therefore the sampling estimated value sev of the model parameters k and b obtained by the m h sampling algorithm was reliable to reduce the uncertainty of multi estimate selection to improve the fitting accuracy the estimated value of unknown parameters could be expressed by the ergodic mean of the sev at the time of convergence and thereafter zhu 2018 therefore the ergodic mean value was calculated according to sev when the number of iterations in table 2 reached 2000 and later the sev of k and b of the commercial flrf were 1 721 and 1 015 respectively and the parameters for all flrf were shown in table 3 all parameters met the 95 confidence interval and passed the significance test 4 2 2 all flrf results according to the parameter sampling estimation values k and b solved in table 3 four corresponding flood depth loss ratio functions were drawn respectively as shown in fig 6 the industrial and commercial flrf remained at a relatively high level whose property was characterized by vulnerability poor transferability and high value ke 2014 resulting in a faster and more severe degree of disaster damage they also presented a crossover phenomenon that was the industrial loss ratio was larger than that of the commercial in the 0 1 2 7 m and was the opposite in the 2 7 4 0 m since the value of major industrial assets tends to be concentrated at low heights commercial values tend to be more homogeneous the residential flrf is lower than that of industry and commerce and higher than that of public utilities the reason is that the change range of asset value with height is lower than that of industry and commerce compared with the amount of industrial and commercial assets it has a relatively strong transferability under the emergency disaster scenario but its disaster prevention ability is lower than that of the public utilities sector public utilities are characterized by sound early warning mechanism and strong disaster prevention and reduction ability which results in the lowest flrf 4 3 comparative analysis of flrf results 4 3 1 comparative analysis with the quoted data to illustrate the rationality of the flrf results the comparison between the boxplot based on the loss ratio sample data collected from all quoted city average value of each box and flrf was shown in fig 7 except for part of water depth all the function values were near the median and average values of each box among the 11 quoted cities zhengzhou s economic level population density disaster prevention and mitigation construction were all in the middle level consistent with the results of this study among them the flrf of the residence was the closest to the average value fig 7 c and the mean absolute error mae was only 1 01 showing good consistency second the flrf and average value of commerce 1 83 public utilities 1 93 and industry 1 967 all showed good inclination the above results were also subject to the general rule of the average value as a result in traditional studies asgharzadeh and sanjari farsipour 2008 shi 2010 bañuls et al 2016 but it lacked scientific explanation thus a reasonable framework was constructed by dps hbm in this study providing a new idea for cities lacking disaster information to draw up flrf since it was difficult to directly use case data to verify the method for cities lacking flood data the above also indirectly showed that the results of this study are reasonable to some extent 4 3 2 comparative analysis with the least square method in order to show the advantages of the hbm fitting it was proposed to be compared with the least square method lsm to analyze the difference between their closeness to the optimal sample matrix r fig 8 it could be found that the hbm of this study is closer to matrix r than the lsm the difference between the flrf fitted by the lsm using the average value under dth vector r dc the flrf by hbm of this study and the optimal sample matrix r is compared table 4 taking industry as an example compared with lsm the relative error of hbm decreases by 0 02 the absolute error decreases by 2 56 and the root mean square error decreases by 0 0001 and residence show similar results the superiority of function fitting is reflected in the high degree of incorporation with sample data or small errors the results show that the flrf constructed by hbm is closer to all sample data which is significantly better than the traditional mean model of lsm it also provides a reference for function fitting with hierarchical data structure 4 3 3 the spatial transplantation performance of dps hbm model in order to verify the transplantation effect of dps hbm model on flood loss model between cities jinan city which has similar geographical and economic conditions as the study area and guangzhou an economically developed city along the southern coast were selected as the verification city they were assumed to be cities lacking flood data and the industrial flrf was selected as the test example from fig 9 the simulation results were closer to the measured data in particular the fitting effect of guangzhou was better with three errors of 0 0203 mae 11 43 mre and 0 0243 mrmse and the correlation coefficient was even 0 975 fig 9 b the correlation coefficient of jinan was 0 945 and the simulation results also showed the same good effect fig 9 a however both showed poor fitting in the late stage of the water depth after about 3 3 m the choice of exponential form eq 10 needs further discussion in the future but in general the dps hbm model has a better performance in constructing flrf of cities lacking flood data 5 conclusions considering the problem of the lack of loss sample data in cities lacking flood data and the hierarchical structure of sample data at graded water depth a method for building loss ratio functions based on dps hbm was proposed in this study based on the extension of the quoted object data layer the traditional single data was transformed into the sample data matrix by dps then the flrf was obtained by hbm based on the prior distribution of parameters and filled data the following conclusions were drawn 1 after processing the sample data of multiple cities the vc between groups of data to be fitted differed greatly which indicated that the traditional single city sample data led to the existence of contingency therefore it was necessary to determine the optimal fitting data set to reduce the uncertainty caused by the contingency of a single data set and in this study the dynamic change feature in the proportional replacement of sample data was realized based on dps and the uncertainty of proportional replacement by a single scheme was also reduced to a certain extent 2 when the sample data had a hierarchical data structure it was usually studied to transform a single eigenvalue and then to fit the assumed function through regression analysis by comparison it was found that the parameter error of the hbm constructed in this study was significantly smaller than that of the lsm which was closer to all the sample data the study results showed that when the sample data had a hierarchical data structure the consistency assumption would cause the problem of loss of feature information the hbm constructed in this study had certain advantages in solving hierarchical data finally a dps hbm model structure taking the characteristic indicator value i1 i5 as the input parameter and flrf as the output result was formed from this the flrf is parameterized which provides a broad reference for the loss function construction of any city lacking data in the world however there were still some improvements to be made for example the selected conversion indicator could not make the sample data in an ideal state of consistency the fixed function fitting model which pursued the overall effect resulted in poor local phenomena the problem of spatial heterogeneity of flood loss ratio in a city was ignored these need further

5019,a reliable flood loss assessment in city is the basis of efficient flood risk management however it is difficult to fit empirical functions with typical case data for most of the world s arid or semi arid cities that lack or even have no historical flood loss data under the background of frequent global extreme weather events and high speed urbanization urban flood loss assessment has become increasingly important to support urban flood risk management at present few researches have focused on the modeling of flood loss ratio function flrf for cities lacking loss data therefore based on the improved analogy principle a dynamic proportional substitution dps method in this paper was proposed to transfer large sample data from multiple quoted cities into a sample matrix of loss ratios in the study city to address the lack of data then according to the hierarchical data structure characteristics of the loss ratio matrix a hierarchical bayesian model hbm of flrf with unknown parameters was constructed based on the prior distribution of parameters finally taking the city lacking data zhengzhou china as the study area the water depth loss ratio functions of four land types industry commerce residence and public utilities were calculated the results showed that 1 the combined feature schemes achieved dynamic selectivity 2 the parameters gradually converged after a certain number of iterations 3 the error of flrf solved by hbm was less than that of the least square method lsm 4 the dps hbm model had good performance in transplantation verification this study is expected to provide a reference for the establishment of flood loss functions in cities lacking data 1 introduction under the background of rapid urbanization the urban population and assets density have been increasing compared with the traditional agricultural society under the same scale of flooding conditions the losses of floods will increase significantly creutin et al 2013 löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 to ensure the safety of urban flood risk control people are striving to build a comprehensive flood control engineering system including engineering measures juan et al 2017 rehan 2018 fiori and volpi 2020 and non engineering measures van ootegem et al 2015 ravazzani et al 2016 corral et al 2019 so as to reduce flood losses effectively however once an over standard flood occurs the flood losses will increase sharply ercolani et al 2018 amadio et al 2019 wu et al 2020a ge et al 2021 as a non engineering measure accurate quantification assessment of flood losses in a changing urban environmental and societal system is essential for urban flood adaptation planning and risk management van ootegem et al 2015 by constructing a reasonable flood loss function to assess losses it is more helpful to rationally grasp the evolution trend of flood risk and provide a reference for the preparation of flood control planning also for insurance applications more precise assessment of flood losses is required wagenaar et al 2017 affected by multiple factors such as rainfall geographic conditions flood control standards and economic development the flood loss assessment has the characteristics of multi dimensional and disciplinary integration jongman et al 2012 sairam et al 2019 a standard assessment system has not yet been formed but there are many existing flood loss assessment methods such as standard assessment function developed by city or regional government unsw 1981 davis 1985 usace 1996 penning rowsell et al 2005 messner et al 2007 and empirical models based on typical flood case data merz et al 2013 dottori et al 2016 wagenaar et al 2017 carisi et al 2018 vogel et al 2018 amadio et al 2019 most cities lack sufficient data to support the construction of such models or functions flood loss ratio relative loss is defined as the ratio of the potential damage value to the total risky assets at a certain inundated depth the flrf considered as an internationally accepted general method for assessing direct flood loss is formed by taking water depth as an independent variable and the loss ratio as a dependent variable smith 1994 but the construction of such a function requires the support of a large amount of historical disaster loss data however for most of the arid and semi arid regions of the world s inland plain cities there is little or even no sample data of historical flood losses gerl et al 2016 with the explosion of extreme climates and the expansion of the scale of urban construction the vulnerability of urban floods has increased and the economic losses caused by floods for those cities cannot be ignored löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 gori et al 2018 therefore it is urgent to establish a method of solving the flrf for different cities lacking flood data to support urban flood risk management for areas with few or even no flood data some studies have been tried on the one hand the loss function is directly transferred between cities cammerer et al 2013 scorzini and frank 2015 these spatial dependent empirical models do not perform well in spatial transference schröter et al 2014 on the other hand the analogy principle is used for indirect transfer for example shi 2010 and chen et al 2019 used characteristic indicators based on the static analogy principle to carry out spatial transfer of loss functions between cities based on the optimization principle of variation coefficient and beta distribution wu et al 2021 also established a static analogy principle to realize the transfer of disaster loss data from multiple cities to the study area the analogy principle provides a feasible idea for the filling of the lost sample data in cities or areas lacking flood sample data but the static contingency problems caused by its single conversion factor need to be considered after several loss ratio data will be filled under the multistage water depth in cities lacking flood data it has a hierarchical data structure since the flrf is a monotone function the function mapping relationship makes each independent variable have only one dependent variable y corresponding to it without discarding any sample data the hierarchical data structure of the sample makes direct regression analysis difficult however in general studies multiple dependent variables are first transformed into a single characteristic value such as the average value before regression fitting leading to the loss of sample characteristic information caused by the assumption of hydrological consistency katz et al 2002 asgharzadeh and sanjari farsipour 2008 shi 2010 bañuls et al 2016 moreover making full use of the existing general understanding of loss function parameters prior distribution will also effectively improve the accuracy of function fitting lima et al 2016 however how to take full advantage of the samples with hierarchical data structure and prior knowledge to construct the loss function is an urgent problem to be solved the purpose of this study is as follows 1 to solve the lack of flood loss ratio sample in cities lacking flood data 2 to solve the problem of hierarchical data structure in the sample data of loss ratio after filling first the large sample data are used to consider quoted cities as much as possible and the feature indicator is transformed from a single feature indicator to a comprehensive scheme set of different combinations then the single loss ratio at each water depth is expanded into a loss ratio transfer matrix thereby filling the sample data of the flood loss ratio section 2 3 a double layer bayesian model was constructed based on the prior distribution of parameters and likelihood function and the filled sample data were used to estimate the parameters of the flrf section 2 4 finally taking the city lacking flood data zhengzhou china as the study area the water depth loss ratio functions of four land types were calculated and the rationality and accuracy of the dps hbm mode was analyzed this study is expected to supplement the existing flood loss assessment modeling methods for cities or areas with limited data 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study zhengzhou city the capital of henan province is located in the southern part of the north china plain fig 1 the urban area of the city is 1010 3 km2 with a population of 10 35 million and its urbanization ratio reaches 74 6 in 2020 similar to most arid and semi arid inland plains cities the rainfall of zhengzhou varied greatly both in annual and inter annual years the flood season spans from july to september every year during which the rainfall accounts for 60 70 of the total annual rainfall wu et al 2020b the government departments have not conducted a systematic and comprehensive investigation and data storage for the flood losses because the frequency of flood is high due to the imperfect urban infrastructure but the intensity of disaster is small resulting in less economic losses however with the explosion of extreme weather and the expansion of the scale of urban construction the vulnerability of urban floods has increased löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 amadio et al 2019 and the economic losses caused by floods cannot be ignored so it is urgent to put forward the diagnosis method of flood losses in cities with insufficient data to control the risk of urban flood 3 research framework the research framework is to solve the problem of constructing the flrf of the city lacking loss data as shown in fig 2 the proposed framework reflecting the workflow contains three major steps 1 filling flood loss ratio sample data based on dps in cities lacking loss data 2 estimating the parameter of the flrf based on hbm 3 collecting the data and applying the constructed model in the study area 3 1 filling in flood loss ratio sample data based on dps 1 establishing the optional loss ratio matrix in cities lacking flood loss data the flood loss ratio is usually obtained by hydrological analogy shi 2010 chen et al 2019 that is given the loss ratio of the quoted city r 0 the loss ratio of the study city r is deduced and the loss ratio of the quoted city can be converted into the loss ratio of the study city through the characteristic indicator i study city and i 0 quoted city affecting the flood losses which is shown in eq 1 at present only a single quoted city is considered as an analogy object secondly the selected indicators are too single focusing on the level of urban economy and ignoring the influence of other factors such as the disaster bearing environment and the ability to prevent and mitigate disasters löwe et al 2017 ercolani et al 2018 the low representativeness and contingency of a single object led to the increase of uncertainty in the process of determining the loss ratio 1 r r 0 i i 0 r r 0 i i 0 r 0 λ where λ is the transfer coefficient therefore in order to reduce the uncertainty in the spatial transfer of loss ratio this study first increased the number of quoted objects and then expanded it into multiple schemes through the combination of multiple indicators and finally the single loss ratio results were transformed into optional loss ratio matrix r the basic steps are as follows step1 if m quoted cities are considered i e r i 0 i 1 m the loss ratio matrix r0 of m quoted cities can be obtained as follows 2 r 0 r 1 0 r 2 0 r m 0 step2 in order to reduce the subjectivity and contingency of indicator selection and plan construction k characteristic indicators are arranged and combined to form n j 1 n different combination schemes eq 3 to achieve the purpose of reducing uncertainty and c k k k 1 k represents the number of schemes combining k indicators selected by k characteristic indicators 3 n c k 1 c k 2 c k k c k k step3 the characteristic comprehensive values of n combined schemes in the study city and the quoted cities were calculated respectively assuming that cij represents the characteristic comprehensive value of the study city under the jth j 1 n scheme c i ij 0 indicates the characteristic comprehensive value of the ith i 1 m quoted city under the jth scheme among them the value of single indicator scheme j 1 k is the comprehensive value the multi indicators scheme j k 1 n needs to be converted into the comprehensive value through the projection pursuit model with chaotic particle swarm optimization zhang et al 2018 step4 assuming that λ ij is the transfer coefficient of the jth scheme of the ith quoted city and λ ij c i j c i ij 0 so the transfer coefficient matrix λ of m n combination schemes can be obtained 4 λ c i 1 c i 11 0 c i 2 c i 12 0 c i n c i 1 n 0 c i 1 c i 21 0 c i 2 c i 22 0 c i n c i 2 n 0 c i 1 c i m 1 0 c i 2 c i m 2 0 c i n c i mn 0 λ 11 λ 12 λ 1 n λ 21 λ 22 λ 2 n λ m 1 λ m 2 λ mn step5 in summary it can be transformed into the m n loss ratio matrix r of the study area as follows 5 r r 0 λ r 1 0 r 2 0 r m 0 λ 11 λ 12 λ 1 n λ 21 λ 22 λ 2 n λ m 1 λ m 2 λ mn r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r mn 2 filling in loss ratio sample data based on the minimum variation coefficient to reduce the uncertainty multiple feature schemes were set to obtain the optimal scheme r j under the same flood depth although the regional losses of different economic levels varied greatly the loss ratio should show a relatively consistent or very similar trend tennessee valley authority 1969 grigg and helweg 1975 moreover under the mathematical principle of analogy eq 1 all analogy results should be equal in the most ideal state therefore under the same scheme the data dispersion of the loss ratio set in different quoted cities after conversion should be as low as possible and the variation coefficient vc can better represent the dispersion degree of data niu et al 2018 therefore the optimization principle of the minimum vc is established to extract the optimal characteristic scheme step6 the loss ratio set of each characteristic scheme corresponds to the column vector of matrix r vcj of each column vector of matrix r is calculated to form vc of variation coefficient set as follows 6 v c j σ j u j 7 vc v c 1 v c 2 v c j v c n t where uj is the average value of the jth column vector u j r 1 j r 2 j r mj n σj is the variance of the jth column vector σ j j 1 n r mj u j n 1 step7 the scheme corresponding to the column vector vct with the minimum vc is the optimal scheme r c suppose the tth scheme is the optimal as follows 8 v c t min v c j j 1 ñ r c r 1 c r 2 c r mc step8 assuming that d represents flood depth value d 1 d r dc is only an optimal sample vector at the dth flood depth an optimal loss ratio matrix r is formed under dth optimal sample vector r dc of a land type as follows 9 r r 1 c r dc r dc r 11 c r 1 i c r 1 m c r d 1 c r dic r dmc r d 1 c r dic r dmc where rdic is the ith loss ratio of the r dc at the dth water depth 3 2 construction of flrf based on hbm the flood water depth loss ratio function f d follows an exponential form eq 10 which has been proved to be reasonable by flood loss assessment studies merz et al 2013 wagenaar et al 2017 rözer et al 2019 due to the mapping relationship of the function each independent variable has only one dependent variable y corresponding to it however the optimal sample matrix r at each water depth d has m loss ratios according to eq 9 thus the loss ratio sample matrix r has a hierarchical data structure and the accuracy of data fitting can be improved in loss model modeling by using bayesian model with general understanding of parameters lima et al 2016 a hbm is a multi level probabilistic regression model that estimates a set of coefficients for each data group while the predictors are used to model the outcomes sairam et al 2019 therefore this study uses multidimensional sample data and prior distribution of parameters to refer hbm to the construction of flood loss function to solve the problem of hierarchical data structure and improve the fitting accuracy in summary a hierarchical bayesian model hbm for flrf based on the prior distribution and likelihood function of parameters was constructed and the flrf was estimated by filled matrix r finally the solution was obtained by using markov chain monte carlo method mcmc 10 f d e k d b where f d is a function of flood water depth loss ratio k and b are the parameters to be solved rather than assuming a deterministic loss ratio at each water depth the probability model represented the uncertainty in the model structure parameters and noise in the data through a prior distribution random variables and probability distributions were introduced into hbm to estimate the flrf since the flood loss ratio was bounded to be between 0 and 1 and a regression model with unbounded distribution for prediction would lead to unreliable values chen et al 2019 therefore the dth loss ratio vector r c was modeled as a beta distribution between 0 and 1 eq 11 because the beta distribution is chosen to process the fraction motivated by the fact that the beta distribution can be concentrated on the narrow intervals and possess low probability in the tail rözer et al 2019 sairam et al 2019 11 beta α β γ α β γ α γ β r α 1 1 r β 1 where γ is the gamma function α and β are the dual parameters of the beta distribution α 0 and β 0 according to the parameter estimation properties of the beta distribution egorova et al 2008 α and β can be estimated by the following formulas 12 α μ d φ d 13 β 1 μ d φ d where μ d is the average value of r c at the dth water depth φ d is the corresponding variance the basic idea of function parameter estimation according to the hbm is that based on sample data prior distribution of parameters and likelihood function a hierarchical probability model of parameter posterior distribution eq 14 is established for the studied object or problem 14 p a b p b a p a p b p b a p a where a is the parameter to be solved b is the sample data p a b is the posterior probability density of the unknown parameter p b a is the likelihood function p a is the prior probability density of the parameter to be solved and p b is the normalization factor therefore the steps to build the hbm are as follows step9 assume that the average value of r c at the dth water depth is μ d which approximately follows eq 15 and the rdic is set to follow the beta distribution by eq 16 15 u d f d k b 16 r dic b e t a α β to satisfy the hbm to estimate the parameters to be solved it is necessary to establish the relationship between the beta distribution and μ d the α and β in above eq 16 are obtained from eqs 12 and 13 and the μ d in eqs 12 and 13 is given by eq 15 and φ d is the variance value of r c at dth water depth step10 when the parameters are not strictly restricted a general prior distribution can be provided for shared parameters gelman et al 2017 and the parameters k and b to be solved are set to follow the general prior distribution 17 k ñ o r m a l τ σ 18 b c a u c h y ε φ where τ σ ε φ are all super parameters and according to the general prior distribution study sairam et al 2019 k ñ o r m a l 0 1 and b c a u c h y 0 10 step11 combining eqs 15 and 16 a likelihood function was constructed by eq 19 substitute eqs 17 19 into eq 14 the joint posterior distribution of the parameter vector a to be solved is shown by eq 20 19 p b a d 1 d i 1 m beta α di β di f d k i b i φ d 20 p a b d 1 d i 1 m beta α di β di f d k i b i φ d p k τ σ p b ε φ step12 the mcmc sampling assumes markov property during an iteration gaume et al 2010 lima et al 2016 if the current state of the estimated parameter representing the data generation process was better than that of the previous state it was added to the parameter value chain monte carlo simulations create a large number of replications of these parameters that represent the loss process which results in approximate posterior distributions for μ d finally when a large number of iterations are run the parameter values are not influenced by where the sampling began initially to form the stable parameter k and b 3 3 prepared data according to the above the urban land types determine the number of the final flrf to be calculated the characteristic indicators and the quoted urban loss ratio are the conversion factors of eq 1 and the basis of data in this research they were determined as follows 1 division of urban land types in order to highlight the fine features of the city the calculated types of urban construction land were divided into industry commerce residence and public utilities public utilities land includes government management departments schools hospitals etc for details please see the article lv et al 2020 on urban land value classification and calculation written by the authors ultimately the flrf for these four property types were constructed in this study 2 collection of quoted flood loss ratio functions at present under the background of big data taking chinese cities as the search scope all urban flood loss ratio functions in all studies were collected and the data of 11 cities that could be quoted were obtained including jinan puyang harbin shenyang changchun shanghai zhuhai guangzhou wuxi tianjin shenzhen wenzhou ding 2004 li 2007 shi 2010 wang et al 2013 ke 2014 wu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 however the sample size m 9 11 of different property types was different and the flood depth ranges from 0 1 m to 4 0 m d 0 1 4 0 m d 4 0 m 3 establishment of characteristic indicators flood loss ratio are defined as the ratio of the potential damage value to the total risky assets at a certain inundated depth smith 1994 there is no fixed pattern for the characteristic indicators that affect the flood loss ratio shi 2010 chen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 such as per capita gdp per capita disposable income pcdi regional gdp then according to its definition the factors that affect the flood loss ratio are divided into two categories one is the economic level the other is the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity then the characteristic indicator system will be developed around these two aspects per capita gdp i1 and pcdi i2 represent the degree of economic development of a city which are the embodiment of total risky assets under some disaster prevention measures flood loss is the possible result of floods acting on the disaster bearing body of the disaster pregnant environment dottori et al 2016 then the elements of the disaster prevention and mitigation capacity will affect the loss ratio density of urban river network i3 density of urban pipe network i4 and pervious area ratio i5 are representative features of urban rainfall storage and prevention of waterlogging therefore a characteristic indicator system table 1 affecting the flood loss ratio was established in this study so 31 characteristic schemes were obtained among which the combination schemes were 5 c 5 1 10 c 5 2 10 c 5 3 5 c 5 4 and 1 c 5 5 respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 the filling results of urban flood loss ratio sample 4 1 1 analysis of sample data optimization results after establishing an optional loss ratio matrix r based on the analogy principle the optimal loss ratio matrix r under different land types was filled in according to the minimum vc taking 6 water depths 0 6 m 1 2 m 1 8 m 2 4 m 3 0 m 3 6 m under the residence as an example the results of 31 kinds of schemes for selecting the optimal sample vector r dc were shown in fig 3 the optimal schemes r dc were a234 a234 a234 a2354 a2354 and a345 respectively and the corresponding coefficients of variation were 0 433 0 383 0 298 0 365 0 399 and 0 416 different from the optimal sample other sample in some scheme sets was obviously dispersed which violated the principle that the loss ratio set under the same water depth in the area should show a more consistent or very similar trend tennessee valley authority 1969 grigg and helweg 1975 so it was necessary to optimize the scheme set moreover the contingency of the sample data formed by using a single scheme for proportional substitution increased the uncertainty of the loss assessment results 4 1 2 dynamic variability analysis of optimal scheme with the goal of the lowest dispersion the optimization principle of the minimum vc was established to realize the corresponding optimal scheme for each land type with all water depths fig 4 and there were four kinds of optimal schemes for industry three kinds for commerce four kinds for residence and three kinds for public utilities among them single double three and four indicators combination schemes were all used a24 and a245 schemes were used most often 3 times while indicator i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 were used among which indicator i4 density of urban pipe network was used the most 14 times which also confirmed the important role of urban pipe network in urban flood reduction in summary in addition to the different characteristics of the optimal scheme change under different water depths of a land type different scheme sets also had different water depth ranges fig 4 and the optimal schemes of different land types also showed different combination properties as a result the dynamic change feature in the proportional replacement of flood sample data was realized and the uncertainty of a single scheme based on proportional replacement was also reduced or eliminated to a certain extent 4 2 the flrf construction results 4 2 1 hierarchical bayesian modeling estimates parameter results after obtaining sample matrix r a multi level bayesian model was constructed to estimate the function parameters k and b which could be calculated by mcmc based on metropolis hasting m h taking the parameter solution of the commercial flrf as an example when different sampling times were selected the posterior statistical values of parameters k and b were shown in table 2 taking the number of iterations 2000 5000 and 10 000 as an example the iterative process of the two parameters to be estimated was shown in fig 5 from which we could see that the parameters to be estimated fluctuated significantly in a certain range for example when the number of iterations was 10000 the confidence interval α 0 05 of k was 1 562 1 880 and b was 0 922 1 109 according to the convergence discrimination of ergodic mean method monteiro and svaiter 2010 after the number of iterations reached 2000 table 2 the change range of the k and b to be estimated was relatively small the change ratio was only 0 7 and it could be assumed that the sampling status had basically converged therefore the sampling estimated value sev of the model parameters k and b obtained by the m h sampling algorithm was reliable to reduce the uncertainty of multi estimate selection to improve the fitting accuracy the estimated value of unknown parameters could be expressed by the ergodic mean of the sev at the time of convergence and thereafter zhu 2018 therefore the ergodic mean value was calculated according to sev when the number of iterations in table 2 reached 2000 and later the sev of k and b of the commercial flrf were 1 721 and 1 015 respectively and the parameters for all flrf were shown in table 3 all parameters met the 95 confidence interval and passed the significance test 4 2 2 all flrf results according to the parameter sampling estimation values k and b solved in table 3 four corresponding flood depth loss ratio functions were drawn respectively as shown in fig 6 the industrial and commercial flrf remained at a relatively high level whose property was characterized by vulnerability poor transferability and high value ke 2014 resulting in a faster and more severe degree of disaster damage they also presented a crossover phenomenon that was the industrial loss ratio was larger than that of the commercial in the 0 1 2 7 m and was the opposite in the 2 7 4 0 m since the value of major industrial assets tends to be concentrated at low heights commercial values tend to be more homogeneous the residential flrf is lower than that of industry and commerce and higher than that of public utilities the reason is that the change range of asset value with height is lower than that of industry and commerce compared with the amount of industrial and commercial assets it has a relatively strong transferability under the emergency disaster scenario but its disaster prevention ability is lower than that of the public utilities sector public utilities are characterized by sound early warning mechanism and strong disaster prevention and reduction ability which results in the lowest flrf 4 3 comparative analysis of flrf results 4 3 1 comparative analysis with the quoted data to illustrate the rationality of the flrf results the comparison between the boxplot based on the loss ratio sample data collected from all quoted city average value of each box and flrf was shown in fig 7 except for part of water depth all the function values were near the median and average values of each box among the 11 quoted cities zhengzhou s economic level population density disaster prevention and mitigation construction were all in the middle level consistent with the results of this study among them the flrf of the residence was the closest to the average value fig 7 c and the mean absolute error mae was only 1 01 showing good consistency second the flrf and average value of commerce 1 83 public utilities 1 93 and industry 1 967 all showed good inclination the above results were also subject to the general rule of the average value as a result in traditional studies asgharzadeh and sanjari farsipour 2008 shi 2010 bañuls et al 2016 but it lacked scientific explanation thus a reasonable framework was constructed by dps hbm in this study providing a new idea for cities lacking disaster information to draw up flrf since it was difficult to directly use case data to verify the method for cities lacking flood data the above also indirectly showed that the results of this study are reasonable to some extent 4 3 2 comparative analysis with the least square method in order to show the advantages of the hbm fitting it was proposed to be compared with the least square method lsm to analyze the difference between their closeness to the optimal sample matrix r fig 8 it could be found that the hbm of this study is closer to matrix r than the lsm the difference between the flrf fitted by the lsm using the average value under dth vector r dc the flrf by hbm of this study and the optimal sample matrix r is compared table 4 taking industry as an example compared with lsm the relative error of hbm decreases by 0 02 the absolute error decreases by 2 56 and the root mean square error decreases by 0 0001 and residence show similar results the superiority of function fitting is reflected in the high degree of incorporation with sample data or small errors the results show that the flrf constructed by hbm is closer to all sample data which is significantly better than the traditional mean model of lsm it also provides a reference for function fitting with hierarchical data structure 4 3 3 the spatial transplantation performance of dps hbm model in order to verify the transplantation effect of dps hbm model on flood loss model between cities jinan city which has similar geographical and economic conditions as the study area and guangzhou an economically developed city along the southern coast were selected as the verification city they were assumed to be cities lacking flood data and the industrial flrf was selected as the test example from fig 9 the simulation results were closer to the measured data in particular the fitting effect of guangzhou was better with three errors of 0 0203 mae 11 43 mre and 0 0243 mrmse and the correlation coefficient was even 0 975 fig 9 b the correlation coefficient of jinan was 0 945 and the simulation results also showed the same good effect fig 9 a however both showed poor fitting in the late stage of the water depth after about 3 3 m the choice of exponential form eq 10 needs further discussion in the future but in general the dps hbm model has a better performance in constructing flrf of cities lacking flood data 5 conclusions considering the problem of the lack of loss sample data in cities lacking flood data and the hierarchical structure of sample data at graded water depth a method for building loss ratio functions based on dps hbm was proposed in this study based on the extension of the quoted object data layer the traditional single data was transformed into the sample data matrix by dps then the flrf was obtained by hbm based on the prior distribution of parameters and filled data the following conclusions were drawn 1 after processing the sample data of multiple cities the vc between groups of data to be fitted differed greatly which indicated that the traditional single city sample data led to the existence of contingency therefore it was necessary to determine the optimal fitting data set to reduce the uncertainty caused by the contingency of a single data set and in this study the dynamic change feature in the proportional replacement of sample data was realized based on dps and the uncertainty of proportional replacement by a single scheme was also reduced to a certain extent 2 when the sample data had a hierarchical data structure it was usually studied to transform a single eigenvalue and then to fit the assumed function through regression analysis by comparison it was found that the parameter error of the hbm constructed in this study was significantly smaller than that of the lsm which was closer to all the sample data the study results showed that when the sample data had a hierarchical data structure the consistency assumption would cause the problem of loss of feature information the hbm constructed in this study had certain advantages in solving hierarchical data finally a dps hbm model structure taking the characteristic indicator value i1 i5 as the input parameter and flrf as the output result was formed from this the flrf is parameterized which provides a broad reference for the loss function construction of any city lacking data in the world however there were still some improvements to be made for example the selected conversion indicator could not make the sample data in an ideal state of consistency the fixed function fitting model which pursued the overall effect resulted in poor local phenomena the problem of spatial heterogeneity of flood loss ratio in a city was ignored these need further
