25125,located on the same river the degree of eutrophication in the upper and middle reaches of the qu appelle river in saskatchewan are different while the upper qu appelle is eutrophic the middle qu appelle river is hypereutrophic to manage the river sustainably there is a need to understand key processes governing eutrophication in both systems in this study a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis technique variogram analysis of response surface vars was applied to gain insights to the functioning of the two systems eutrophication in both systems was modelled using the water quality analysis simulation program wasp 7 52 the performance of the model to predict key variables of eutrophication was measured using relative root mean square error the global sensitivity analyses showed that although diffuse loading has significant influence on the systems prevailing processes governing eutrophic state in the upper qu appelle river include nutrient and phytoplankton cycles meanwhile in the middle qu appelle river a number of processes including phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle diffuse loading and do balance together sustain its hypereutrophic state keywords global sensitivity

for extrapolation is founded on the ability to complement them with causal hypotheses that are based on prevailing views of how internal limnologic processes of aquatic systems function despite their usefulness in providing a rational basis for understanding freshwater aquatic systems mechanistic models are often criticized on the issue of parameter identifiability beck 1987 dietzel and reichert 2014 her and chaubey 2015 han and zheng 2016 in the bid to represent internal processes of a system for a foreseeable future scenario the models end up being complex and poorly identified brun et al 2001 however addressing identifiability of complex models is well treated in the literature brun et al 2001 anh et al 2006 de pauw and de baets 2008 arhonditsis et al 2008 rode et al 2008 wagener et al 2009 otero muras et al 2010 cibin et al 2010 parslow et al 2013 ghasemizade et al 2017 it has been argued that since field measurements rarely provide enough information to quantify most model parameters ascertaining practical parameters that represent the variability in field measurements and conducting sensitivity analysis to unravel most important model parameters and how they interact are the most reasonable means to gaining insights into the aquatic systems behaviours brun et al 2001 regional sensitivity analysis of water quality models with an efficient algorithm has been proposed by spear 1997 to determine reasonable parameter values using the monte carlo sampling scheme this bayesian method together with other methods such as generalized likelihood uncertainty

recently developed variogram analysis of response surface vars based global sensitivity analysis gsa was used to explore the behaviours of reaches of the same river with different trophic states vars comprehensively assigns the variability of model responses to governing factors at a low computational cost number of model runs using directional variogram and covariogram functions razavi and gupta 2016a vars which has recently been used predominantly as a diagnostic tool in hydrological haghnegahdar et al 2017 and hydrodynamic models sheikholeslami et al 2017 will now be used to understand the aquatic ecosystem functioning of water quality models of the upper and middle reaches of the qu appelle river understanding the dominant processes influencing the behaviours of these two unique systems is key to managing eutrophication the qu appelle river qr is naturally eutrophic but water quality has further degraded due to anthropogenic influences smol 2009 the soils of the qu appelle river basin qrb are nutrient rich resulting in lakes with high background trophic states barica 1987 smol 2009 this highly productive river is characterized by frequent macrophyte growth in select parts of the river algal blooms in the lakes and periodic fish kills smol 2009 studies by hall et al 1999a b and dixit et al 2000 show how the lakes on the qr are naturally eutrophic but nutrients have increased since the commencement of agriculture and urbanization in the basin it is therefore the goal of this study to identify the major processes either catchment based nutrient export or in stream biogeochemistry controlling eutrophication in the upper qu appelle river uqr which is eutrophic and the middle qu appelle river mqr which is hypereutrophic using a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis technique the approach is versatile and can be transferred to other modelling applications of aquatic systems 2 study site the qr fig 1 flows eastward from the qu appelle dam at lake diefenbaker to its confluence with the assiniboine river in manitoba canada seven lakes are situated in series along the river with flow contributions from several creeks from west to east the lakes are buffalo pound pasqua echo mission katepwa crooked and round a large off channel lake last mountain lake connects to the qr through last mountain creek major tributaries in the flow direction are ridge iskwao wascana last mountain jumping deer and loon creeks buffalo pound lake has an average depth of about 3 m hall et al 1999a b thermal stratification can occur for brief periods hours to days in this polymictic lake hall et al 1999a b the annual water level fluctuation in buffalo pound lake is small 0 25 m the lake provides drinking water for the cities of regina and moose jaw and surrounding communities and water for industrial uses such as potash mines it is known as a naturally eutrophic prairie lake with frequent algal blooms and low secchi depth readings around 0 9 m hammer 1971 it is nutrient rich and historically the main source of external nutrient loads was from runoff within its watershed bpwab 2010 warm temperatures high ph and low dissolved oxygen concentrations have been identified as major factors influencing lake sediment releases of phosphorus high phosphorus release in turn can stimulate cyanobacteria blooms dösilva 2017 orihel et al 2015 the middle reach of the qr lumsden to craven receives treated wastewater effluent from the two major cities in the watershed moose jaw and regina hall et al 1999a b leavitt et al 2006 fig 2 over the long term around 50 of the effluent from moose jaw is diverted and lost to evaporation or used for irrigation although this varies in any given year a concrete control structure with timber stop logs and lift gate at echo lake regulates the water levels in pasqua and echo lakes water levels at mission and katepwa lakes are maintained by regulation through a control structure at the outlet of katepwa lake the lake water levels are managed to desired levels which generally accounts for various uses such as domestic municipal and industrial water supplies irrigation recreation flood and drought protection wild life and fish habitat christiansen et al 1977 wsa 2005 flow on the qr downstream of the last mountain creek confluence is controlled by a control structure under certain conditions the structure can be used to divert flow from the qr into last mountain lake or pass water from both the qr and last mountain creek downstream along the qr wsa 2005 january has the coldest

1999a b leavitt et al 2006 3 methods 3 1 upper and middle qu appelle wasp models the advanced eutrophication module in wasp 7 52 fig 3 was used to simulate eutrophication in the uqr and mqr wasp is a dynamic finite difference program designed for the simulation of contaminant fate and transport in aquatic ecosystems wool et al 2006 fundamentally routines of the program are based on the principles of conservation of mass momentum and energy materials enter and leave a surface water control volume through emissions and abstraction and are transformed through processes of advection dispersion sedimentation and resuspension and chemical and biological transformations the second order runge kutta finite difference numerical approximations are employed to solve the derivatives of wasp s mass balance equation toro et al 1983 the eutrophication module in wasp simulates the kinetic reactions of up to eight state variables phytoplankton carbon represented by chlorophyll a chl a total ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod dissolved oxygen do organic nitrogen on organic phosphorus op and inorganic phosphorus ip are the model s state variables the main oxygen sources for the system include aeration and phytoplankton growth the sinks of oxygen are algal respiration oxidation of detrital carbon nitrification and biological and sediment oxygen demands central to the eutrophication module is phytoplankton kinetics which affects all other systems wool et al 2006 the kinetics represent processes that characterize algae sources and sinks within the studied system phytoplankton is computed as the difference between algal growth death and settling rates the model s algorithm also includes nitrogen fixation and denitrification the close link between algae processes and nutrients dissolved oxygen and ph make algae a central component of eutrophication models model development included the identification of appropriate spatial and temporal scales of the studied system and its boundary conditions the uqr has 165 longitudinal segments ranging in length from 600 to 800 m the hydrodynamic data including segment depth width velocity and volume were calculated from river morphology that was surveyed at approximately 770 locations along the 97 km stretch from the qu appelle dam at lake diefenbaker to buffalo pound lake for the mqr river and lake discretization resulted in 175 segments with up to 2800 m intervals in the lake wool et al 2006 model boundary conditions included meteorological climatic and water quality data that were sampled from 2013 to 2016 details on general model development calibration and validation can be found in mbuh et al 2018 and of the two models used for this study in hosseini et al 2018 and akomeah et al 2018 submitted the calibrated and validated advanced eutrophication model of the mqr was used for this study 3 2 global sensitivity analyses with vars framework to identify key eutrophication processes in the uqr and mqr a global sensitivity analysis was conducted for each system fig 4 key model variables included total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp proxy forcings table 1 the proxy forcings include nh4 n no3 n and on for tn and inorganic phosphate ip and organic phosphorus op for tp the analysis was completed using the recently developed vars framework razavi and gupta 2016a the framework is used to compute the global sensitivity of input parameters and model forcings or performance metrics across entire factor ranges and scales directional variograms and covariograms which vars functions are used to quantify the variance and covariance structures along each factor course representing the full continuum of the factors possible space ivars metrics provide the means of defining the global sensitivity of a factor under consideration by integrating directional variograms over a particular scale the utility of vars is thus its ability to assess scale dependent sensitivities based on the variogram concept the sensitivity γ h of a factor on a one dimensional isotropic function y is given by 1 γ h 1 2 v y x h y x where γ h one factor directional variogram v variance y model response state variable or performance metric x location in parameter space and h distance vector of any two points in the parameter space under an intrinsic stationary process y x is sampled at a number of locations x across the factor domain to solve the equation classically factor sensitivity is high when the value of γ h is high the directional variogram estimated this way thus represents the morris approach to sensitivity analysis at small scales and sobol s at large scales razavi and gupta 2016b the area under the variogram which represents vars based global sensitivity metric ivars for the ith factor and scale zero to hi is computed as 2 γ h i 0 h i γ h d h i integrating the directional variogram over 50 of a factor range ivars50 gives the most comprehensive global sensitivity metric for non interacting factors of a model ivars provides the means for identifying and prioritizing factors for eutrophic rivers and lakes

cycle and the do balance through nutrient uptake and algae death ji 2017 algal kinetics influences diurnal and seasonal do variations through photosynthesis and respiration different kinetic processes can control the behavior of these variables and invariably eutrophication for instance eq 2 represents the do balance and phytoplankton kinetic interaction in wasp the rate of do concentration change

perturbed through a time series multiplier in wasp within the range of 0 8 1 2 3 3 sampling strategy a star based sampling scheme star was used to provide the entire set of response surface information required for the estimation of vars sensitivity indices a population of m factors are first randomly selected using latin hypercube sampling at m star centers in the parameter space equally spaced points are then generated based on selected distance resolution between any two factors sensitivity indices including directional variogram ivars and other vars products are then computed for the sampled points razavi and gupta 2016a vars implements a bootstrapping strategy to estimate the level of confidence and reliability in the sensitivity results for each factor and sensitivity metric a confidence interval is estimated by initially generating a parameter population from the original sample size by resampling from respective star centers sensitivity indices are then calculated for the bootstrapped sample and the factors are subsequently ranked the procedure is repeated a thousand times with the metrics and ranking stored for each iteration the confidence interval is then calculated on this distribution the reliability of factor ranking is calculated as the ratio of the rank factor being the same as the original rank obtained and the estimated population since this study focused on the identification of key processes driving eutrophication in the two systems the level of confidence for factors where not implemented 3 4 numerical experiment design setup model factors related to eutrophication table 1 were sampled within their respective ranges and used to run the uqr and mqr wasp setups to glean as much information as possible that is related to each system s behaviour from field sampling data the upper and lower boundaries together with vars parameters were specified in the vars main input file selected factors relate to processes including dissolved oxygen balance nutrient cycle phytoplankton cycle tn export and tp export vars samples each factor space via the star sampling technique and determines the number of model configurations to run vars employs the latin hypercube sampling lhs technique to randomly generate star centers from which star points are sampled using structured sampling a vars resolution of 0 1 and 20 star centers were selected this resulted in a total of 4160 and 4520 configurations for the uqr and mqr respectively once the number of model runs were completed the performance of the model in predicting do nh4 n no3 n opo4 and chl a based on the vars based factor samples was measured using the relative root mean square error rre for each model configuration rre is the ratio of root mean

directional variogram and ivars were calculated in vars 4 results and discussion 4 1 factor sensitivity in uqr the degree of influence and relative importance of all factors up to 50 of the factor range considered for the uqr experiment at all the monitoring stations are presented in figs 5 6 9 and 10 global sensitivity was measured using ivars50 razavi and gupta 2016b the plots also shed light on major processes driving key variables and eutrophication dynamics figs 9 and 10 do is predominantly sensitive to sediment oxygen demand temperature sod temp in both river and lake fig 5 this is closely followed by sediment oxygen demand sod and inorganic phosphate ip at tugaske and highway 2 organic phosphorus op at buffalo pound lake and nitrate no3 n at marquis sod temp and sod together explain about 71 69 59 and 55 of overall do variability at tugaske marquis highway 2 and buffalo pound respectively ip plus op tp account for up to 13 of do variability in the system where as nh4 n no3 n plus on tn have up to 12 5 influence on do at uqr k1r pcrb nh3 fon fop kmpg1 k1c cchl and k1d all have less than 5 of factor influence on do at all the stations for the most part degree of factor sensitivity increased downstream from tugaske to buffalo pound lake except for sod temp and sod in essence sod temp sod tn tp and phytoplankton parameters are key to the tuning of the eutrophication model at uqr a study by kuriata potasznik et al 2018 demonstrated how river lake systems can have higher nutrient and sediment concentrations than riverine sections sediment trapping efficiency and longer residence time in the lake aid the higher concentrations oxidation of settled organic matter from surrounding the catchment or re suspension from the benthic layer respiration of benthic organism phytoplankton growth and death are thus the main processes driving do balance in uqr organic nitrogen mineralization rate constant k71c nitrification rate constant k12c phytoplankton respiration constant k1r sod temp and tn are the 5 most influential factors on nh4 n variability at tugaske and marquis fig 5 meanwhile k12c k12 t op sod temp and k1r dominant the nh4 n variability at highway 2 and buffalo pound lake the remaining factors have up to 5 influence on nh4 n at marquis highway 2 and buffalo pound lake with the exception of tugaske where ncrb k83c sod k20c pcrb cchl k1c and k1r have less than 1 influence the primary driving force of the variation in nh4 n within the system are thus mineralization of on into nh4 n nitrification of nh4 n into no3 n respiration of aquatic plants tp and tn loading and temperature fluctuations in the sediment in a similar study of an upstream nearby catchment hosseini et al 2017 also identified on mineralization and nitrification as the most influential processes on nh4 n concentrations the sensitivity of no3 n to examined factors is rather spatially heterogeneous along the uq river system fig 5 at the upstream station tugaske tn k71c k12c fon tp fop k1r pcrb k20c and sod temp are the priority factors the sensitivity of the other factors considered for the experiment have only between 2 to 3 influence the next downstream station marquis has k71c k12c sod sod temp and tn as the most important factors with the remaining factors also having between 2 to 3 variability k71c k1r no3 n k12c and sod temp mainly govern no3 n dynamics at highway 2 which is upstream of buffalo pound lake at buffalo pound lake influential factors include sod temp k1r tn k71c sod kmng1 fop and tp with less than 5 degree of influence from the other factor sets consequently dominant processes affecting no3 n variation in the system are nitrogen loading decomposition of on and dead phytoplankton to nh4 n nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n denitrification of no3 n into no2 variation in benthic temperature dissolution of detrital phosphorus and primary production tp k1r k1c fop and k83c cumulatively explain 64 of the behavior of opo4 dynamics at tugaske and 36 by the other factors fig 5 mineralization of op to ip uptake of opo4 by phytoplankton for growth phytoplankton respiration phytoplankton death to detrital carbon and recycling to organic phosphorus are some of the prevailing processes influencing opo4 at tugaske influential factors at marquis include tp k1r k83c k1c tn and fop which account for 74 of opo4 variation highway 2 on the other hand has k1c k1r k83c pcrb and tp as the top 6 most significant factors while buffalo pound lake has k1r k1c k1d and ncrb as the priority factors phytoplankton death and respiration mainly regulate chl a levels in the river and lake fig 6 more so in the river than in the lake from the foregoing the main driver of eutrophication in the uqr is thus inorganic phosphorus release from sediments which is utilized by phytoplankton for growth during the growing season rising levels of phosphorus in the buffalo pound lake during the summer has been linked to internal loading søndergaard et al 2003 the prevalence of naturally occurring phosphorus and low concentration of iron in the sediments enhance the phosphorus mobilization in the summer d silva 2017 through photosynthesis and reaeration do becomes available to the water column when conditions are not favourable the phytoplankton dies bacterial decomposition of dead phytoplankton results in remobilizing op and on back to the water column and through mineralization inorganic nutrients are made available again for uptake this cycling sustains eutrophication in the system and it appears that the phosphorus cycle dominates the process in the river system 4 2 factor sensitivity in mqr unlike the uqr the sensitivity of do to the experimental factors and ensuing processes were different in the river reach and lake figs 7 8 9 and 11 of the mqr do balance is still the main driver of do variation in the river while phytoplankton cycle governs do in the lake figs 7 8 9 kinetic parameters of do balance explained 60 53 and 39 of the main processes influencing do at the station upstream of pasqua highway 6 and lumsden with an increasing degree of governance in the flow direction lumsden to upstream of pasqua fig 7 reaeration nitrification phytoplankton growth and sod are the key do sensitive processes in the river consequently oxygen becomes available in the river through the transfer of atmospheric gaseous oxygen and primary production in the river oxidation of ammonia to nitrate during organic matter decomposition and utilization of water column oxygen for respiration and decomposition by benthic organisms are the main oxygen sinks the higher do flux at the downstream reaches of the river spurs nitrification microorganisms have high affinity for oxygen as oxidant birgand et al 2007 productivity reaeration and sod are the dominant processes controlling do dynamics in the lake key do sensitive parameters in the lake are k1c 44 k2 24 sod 6 with the remaining parameters less than 1 k2 k12c k1c and sod are the main parameters affecting the river water quality diffuse tn loading from the catchment had the greatest influence on nh4 n variation in the river figs 7 and 9 this is followed by do balance nutrient cycle phytoplankton cycle and tp loading at hw6 and upstream of pasqua and do balance phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle and tn loading at lumsden agriculture and urbanization are thus having a toll on nh4 n variation in the mqr reaches with organic matter mineralization being the key process do balance nutrient cycle tn loading phytoplankton cycle and tp loading are the ranked main processes in the lake fig 9 the degree of influence of tn loading on nh4 n concentration in the river decreased in the flow direction in a range from 23 to 47 tn loading k71c k83c cchl k1c k1r k12c kdt and knit are the governing factors in the river fig 7 while k12c k12 t k71c kdt knit sod temp k1c k2 and sod are the main factors having influence on the lake s response to nh4 n variation fig 7 the nutrient cycle and do balance have the greatest influence on the response to no3 n variation in the river and lake fig 9 specifically organic matter mineralization and nitrification at oxygen dependent rate govern no3 n in the mqr tn loading phytoplankton cycle and tp loading are the other processes governing the response at lumsden and hwy6 while phytoplankton cycle tn loading and tp loading are the others at the stations upstream of pasqua and pasqua lake priority factors in the river include k12c k71c k1c sod temp sod k12 t tp loading knit and tn loading in the lake k71c k1c k12c k12 t tn loading kmng1 k83c k1r and knit are the key factors major processes governing the dynamics of chl a in the river include phytoplankton cycle do balance nutrient cycle and tn export fig 9 in the lake phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle tn export do balance and tp export are the major processes k1c cchl k71c k12 t kmng1 and kdt are the influential factors in the lake whereas k1c k12 t k20c k83c k1r kdt knit tp loading and k2 those in the river fig 8 nutrients and other instream factors were identified as the main drivers of river eutrophication kim et al 2017 bae and seo 2018 only kinetic processes of phytoplankton and nutrients were considered in their setup 4 3 influence of seasonality and external contributions on eutrophication in the uqr and mqr the influence of seasonality and external nutrient mechanisms on the uqr and mqr are summarized in figs 10 and 11 although in stream processes mainly regulate the degree of eutrophication in both systems catchment processes however have a more important role in the trophic state of the mqr than the uqr external nitrogen contributions control ammonium concentrations in the lumsden to hwy6 reach fig 11 a study by clifton associates ltd 2012 shows how the stretch is noted for frequent algal blooms at a workshop held in january 2018 the presumption then was instream processes overwhelmed catchment processes but results from this study show otherwise the higher external nutrients received at the mqr could be what is rendering it as hypereutrophic compared to the uqr in a related regional study vogt et al 2017 also found that in lake processes rather than external factors regulated water quality in the canadian prairies the internal processes however correlated with regional factors including land use 5 conclusion the ecosystem functioning of the uqr and mqr are very different although eutrophication is impacting both systems factors and processes governing their levels are unique to each system do variation in the uqr is dominated by do balance accounting for over 50 of influence with phytoplankton cycle and diffuse loading as subsidiary processes do gradient decreases from upstream to downstream whereas primary production is greatest in the lake and decreases upstream do balance phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle and tn loading from the catchment are the main drivers of mqr response to do variation do balance predominantly governs do levels at upstream of pasqua hwy 6 and lumsden whereas phytoplankton cycle regulates levels in the lake unlike the uqr the mqr do levels are highest as you move downstream in the river an indication of more oxygenated contributions from the tributaries the response of the uqr to inorganic nutrient variation is mainly governed by nutrient and phytoplankton cycles whereas in the mqr this is mainly by nutrient cycle phytoplankton cycle and do balance chl a variation in the buffalo pound lake is mainly by the phytoplankton cycle in pasqua lake however phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle tn loading and do balance influence chl a variation the influence of diffuse loading on the mqr is more pronounced than the uqr figs 10 and 11 although diffuse loading has significant impact on eutrophication of both systems the degree of eutrophication is however sustained mainly by in stream processes figs 10 and 11 this study highlighted the importance of instream processes to eutrophication compared to exogenous factors other studies have shown the greater influence of catchment processes on river water quality barten and de la crétaz 2007 chen et al 2013 xia et al 2018 mccullough et al 2018 the need to assess the relative importance of different sources of nutrients for each catchment is therefore paramount for a nutrient reduction program especially in agricultural catchments with legacy nutrients conflict of interest we acknowledge that there is no

dynamic finite difference program designed for the simulation of contaminant fate and transport in aquatic ecosystems wool et al 2006 fundamentally routines of the program are based on the principles of conservation of mass momentum and energy materials enter and leave a surface water control volume through emissions and abstraction and are transformed through processes of advection dispersion sedimentation and resuspension and chemical and biological transformations the second order runge kutta finite difference numerical approximations are employed to solve the derivatives of wasp s mass balance equation toro et al 1983 the eutrophication module in wasp simulates the kinetic reactions of up to eight state variables phytoplankton carbon represented by chlorophyll a chl a total ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod dissolved oxygen do organic nitrogen on organic phosphorus op and inorganic phosphorus ip are the model s state variables the main oxygen sources for the system include aeration and phytoplankton growth the sinks of oxygen are algal respiration oxidation of detrital carbon nitrification and biological and sediment oxygen demands central to the eutrophication module is phytoplankton kinetics which affects all other systems wool et al 2006 the kinetics represent processes that characterize algae sources and sinks within the studied system phytoplankton is computed as the difference between algal growth death and settling rates the model s algorithm also includes nitrogen fixation and denitrification the close link between algae processes and nutrients dissolved oxygen and ph make algae a central component of eutrophication models model development included the identification of appropriate spatial and temporal scales of the studied system and its boundary conditions the uqr has 165 longitudinal segments ranging in length from 600 to 800 m the hydrodynamic data including segment depth width velocity and volume were calculated from river morphology that was surveyed at approximately 770 locations along the 97 km stretch from the qu appelle dam at lake diefenbaker to buffalo pound lake for the mqr river and lake discretization resulted in 175 segments with up to 2800 m intervals in the lake wool et al 2006 model boundary conditions included meteorological climatic and water quality data that were sampled from 2013 to 2016 details on general model development calibration and validation can be found in mbuh et al 2018 and of the two models used for this study in hosseini et al 2018 and akomeah et al 2018 submitted the calibrated and validated advanced eutrophication model of the mqr was used for this study 3 2 global sensitivity analyses with vars framework to identify key eutrophication processes in the uqr and mqr a global sensitivity analysis was conducted for each system fig 4 key model variables included total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp proxy forcings table 1 the proxy forcings include nh4 n no3 n and on for tn and inorganic phosphate ip and organic phosphorus op for tp the analysis was completed using the recently developed vars framework razavi and gupta 2016a the framework is used to compute the global sensitivity of input parameters and model forcings or performance metrics across entire factor ranges and scales directional variograms and covariograms which vars functions are used to quantify the variance and covariance structures along each factor course representing the full continuum of the factors possible space ivars metrics provide the means of defining the global sensitivity of a factor under consideration by integrating directional variograms over a particular scale the utility of vars is thus its ability to assess scale dependent sensitivities based on the variogram concept the sensitivity γ h of a factor on a one dimensional isotropic function y is given by 1 γ h 1 2 v y x h y x where γ h one factor directional variogram v variance y model response state variable or performance metric x location in parameter space and h distance vector of any two points in the parameter space under an intrinsic stationary process y x is sampled at a number of locations x across the factor domain to solve the equation classically factor sensitivity is high when the value of γ h is high the directional variogram estimated this way thus represents the morris approach to sensitivity analysis at small scales and sobol s at large scales razavi and gupta 2016b the area under the variogram which represents vars based global sensitivity metric ivars for the ith factor and scale zero to hi is computed as 2 γ h i 0 h i γ h d h i integrating the directional variogram over 50 of a factor range ivars50 gives the most comprehensive global sensitivity metric for non interacting factors of a model ivars provides the means for identifying and prioritizing factors for eutrophic rivers and lakes

perturbed through a time series multiplier in wasp within the range of 0 8 1 2 3 3 sampling strategy a star based sampling scheme star was used to provide the entire set of response surface information required for the estimation of vars sensitivity indices a population of m factors are first randomly selected using latin hypercube sampling at m star centers in the parameter space equally spaced points are then generated based on selected distance resolution between any two factors sensitivity indices including directional variogram ivars and other vars products are then computed for the sampled points razavi and gupta 2016a vars implements a bootstrapping strategy to estimate the level of confidence and reliability in the sensitivity results for each factor and sensitivity metric a confidence interval is estimated by initially generating a parameter population from the original sample size by resampling from respective star centers sensitivity indices are then calculated for the bootstrapped sample and the factors are subsequently ranked the procedure is repeated a thousand times with the metrics and ranking stored for each iteration the confidence interval is then calculated on this distribution the reliability of factor ranking is calculated as the ratio of the rank factor being the same as the original rank obtained and the estimated population since this study focused on the identification of key processes driving eutrophication in the two systems the level of confidence for factors where not implemented 3 4 numerical experiment design setup model factors related to eutrophication table 1 were sampled within their respective ranges and used to run the uqr and mqr wasp setups to glean as much information as possible that is related to each system s behaviour from field sampling data the upper and lower boundaries together with vars parameters were specified in the vars main input file selected factors relate to processes including dissolved oxygen balance nutrient cycle phytoplankton cycle tn export and tp export vars samples each factor space via the star sampling technique and determines the number of model configurations to run vars employs the latin hypercube sampling lhs technique to randomly generate star centers from which star points are sampled using structured sampling a vars resolution of 0 1 and 20 star centers were selected this resulted in a total of 4160 and 4520 configurations for the uqr and mqr respectively once the number of model runs were completed the performance of the model in predicting do nh4 n no3 n opo4 and chl a based on the vars based factor samples was measured using the relative root mean square error rre for each model configuration rre is the ratio of root mean

the observations omin minimum value of the observations and p predictions results of the rre estimation were then written to a vars input file star in smp from which sensitivity metrics including directional variogram and ivars were calculated in vars 4 results and discussion 4 1 factor sensitivity in uqr the degree of influence and relative importance of all factors up to 50 of the factor range considered for the uqr experiment at all the monitoring stations are presented in figs 5 6 9 and 10 global sensitivity was measured using ivars50 razavi and gupta 2016b the plots also shed light on major processes driving key variables and eutrophication dynamics figs 9 and 10 do is predominantly sensitive to sediment oxygen demand temperature sod temp in both river and lake fig 5 this is closely followed by sediment oxygen demand sod and inorganic phosphate ip at tugaske and highway 2 organic phosphorus op at buffalo pound lake and nitrate no3 n at marquis sod temp and sod together explain about 71 69 59 and 55 of overall do variability at tugaske marquis highway 2 and buffalo pound respectively ip plus op tp account for up to 13 of do variability in the system where as nh4 n no3 n plus on tn have up to 12 5 influence on do at uqr k1r pcrb nh3 fon fop kmpg1 k1c cchl and k1d all have less than 5 of factor influence on do at all the stations for the most part degree of factor sensitivity increased downstream from tugaske to buffalo pound lake except for sod temp and sod in essence sod temp sod tn tp and phytoplankton parameters are key to the tuning of the eutrophication model at uqr a study by kuriata potasznik et al 2018 demonstrated how river lake systems can have higher nutrient and sediment concentrations than riverine sections sediment trapping efficiency and longer residence time in the lake aid the higher concentrations oxidation of settled organic matter from surrounding the catchment or re suspension from the benthic layer respiration of benthic organism phytoplankton growth and death are thus the main processes driving do balance in uqr organic nitrogen mineralization rate constant k71c nitrification rate constant k12c phytoplankton respiration constant k1r sod temp and tn are the 5 most influential factors on nh4 n variability at tugaske and marquis fig 5 meanwhile k12c k12 t op sod temp and k1r dominant the nh4 n variability at highway 2 and buffalo pound lake the remaining factors have up to 5 influence on nh4 n at marquis highway 2 and buffalo pound lake with the exception of tugaske where ncrb k83c sod k20c pcrb cchl k1c and k1r have less than 1 influence the primary driving force of the variation in nh4 n within the system are thus mineralization of on into nh4 n nitrification of nh4 n into no3 n respiration of aquatic plants tp and tn loading and temperature fluctuations in the sediment in a similar study of an upstream nearby catchment hosseini et al 2017 also identified on mineralization and nitrification as the most influential processes on nh4 n concentrations the sensitivity of no3 n to examined factors is rather spatially heterogeneous along the uq river system fig 5 at the upstream station tugaske tn k71c k12c fon tp fop k1r pcrb k20c and sod temp are the priority factors the sensitivity of the other factors considered for the experiment have only between 2 to 3 influence the next downstream station marquis has k71c k12c sod sod temp and tn as the most important factors with the remaining factors also having between 2 to 3 variability k71c k1r no3 n k12c and sod temp mainly govern no3 n dynamics at highway 2 which is upstream of buffalo pound lake at buffalo pound lake influential factors include sod temp k1r tn k71c sod kmng1 fop and tp with less than 5 degree of influence from the other factor sets consequently dominant processes affecting no3 n variation in the system are nitrogen loading decomposition of on and dead phytoplankton to nh4 n nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n denitrification of no3 n into no2 variation in benthic temperature dissolution of detrital phosphorus and primary production tp k1r k1c fop and k83c cumulatively explain 64 of the behavior of opo4 dynamics at tugaske and 36 by the other factors fig 5 mineralization of op to ip uptake of opo4 by phytoplankton for growth phytoplankton respiration phytoplankton death to detrital carbon and recycling to organic phosphorus are some of the prevailing processes influencing opo4 at tugaske influential factors at marquis include tp k1r k83c k1c tn and fop which account for 74 of opo4 variation highway 2 on the other hand has k1c k1r k83c pcrb and tp as the top 6 most significant factors while buffalo pound lake has k1r k1c k1d and ncrb as the priority factors phytoplankton death and respiration mainly regulate chl a levels in the river and lake fig 6 more so in the river than in the lake from the foregoing the main driver of eutrophication in the uqr is thus inorganic phosphorus release from sediments which is utilized by phytoplankton for growth during the growing season rising levels of phosphorus in the buffalo pound lake during the summer has been linked to internal loading søndergaard et al 2003 the prevalence of naturally occurring phosphorus and low concentration of iron in the sediments enhance the phosphorus mobilization in the summer d silva 2017 through photosynthesis and reaeration do becomes available to the water column when conditions are not favourable the phytoplankton dies bacterial decomposition of dead phytoplankton results in remobilizing op and on back to the water column and through mineralization inorganic nutrients are made available again for uptake this cycling sustains eutrophication in the system and it appears that the phosphorus cycle dominates the process in the river system 4 2 factor sensitivity in mqr unlike the uqr the sensitivity of do to the experimental factors and ensuing processes were different in the river reach and lake figs 7 8 9 and 11 of the mqr do balance is still the main driver of do variation in the river while phytoplankton cycle governs do in the lake figs 7 8 9 kinetic parameters of do balance explained 60 53 and 39 of the main processes influencing do at the station upstream of pasqua highway 6 and lumsden with an increasing degree of governance in the flow direction lumsden to upstream of pasqua fig 7 reaeration nitrification phytoplankton growth and sod are the key do sensitive processes in the river consequently oxygen becomes available in the river through the transfer of atmospheric gaseous oxygen and primary production in the river oxidation of ammonia to nitrate during organic matter decomposition and utilization of water column oxygen for respiration and decomposition by benthic organisms are the main oxygen sinks the higher do flux at the downstream reaches of the river spurs nitrification microorganisms have high affinity for oxygen as oxidant birgand et al 2007 productivity reaeration and sod are the dominant processes controlling do dynamics in the lake key do sensitive parameters in the lake are k1c 44 k2 24 sod 6 with the remaining parameters less than 1 k2 k12c k1c and sod are the main parameters affecting the river water quality diffuse tn loading from the catchment had the greatest influence on nh4 n variation in the river figs 7 and 9 this is followed by do balance nutrient cycle phytoplankton cycle and tp loading at hw6 and upstream of pasqua and do balance phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle and tn loading at lumsden agriculture and urbanization are thus having a toll on nh4 n variation in the mqr reaches with organic matter mineralization being the key process do balance nutrient cycle tn loading phytoplankton cycle and tp loading are the ranked main processes in the lake fig 9 the degree of influence of tn loading on nh4 n concentration in the river decreased in the flow direction in a range from 23 to 47 tn loading k71c k83c cchl k1c k1r k12c kdt and knit are the governing factors in the river fig 7 while k12c k12 t k71c kdt knit sod temp k1c k2 and sod are the main factors having influence on the lake s response to nh4 n variation fig 7 the nutrient cycle and do balance have the greatest influence on the response to no3 n variation in the river and lake fig 9 specifically organic matter mineralization and nitrification at oxygen dependent rate govern no3 n in the mqr tn loading phytoplankton cycle and tp loading are the other processes governing the response at lumsden and hwy6 while phytoplankton cycle tn loading and tp loading are the others at the stations upstream of pasqua and pasqua lake priority factors in the river include k12c k71c k1c sod temp sod k12 t tp loading knit and tn loading in the lake k71c k1c k12c k12 t tn loading kmng1 k83c k1r and knit are the key factors major processes governing the dynamics of chl a in the river include phytoplankton cycle do balance nutrient cycle and tn export fig 9 in the lake phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle tn export do balance and tp export are the major processes k1c cchl k71c k12 t kmng1 and kdt are the influential factors in the lake whereas k1c k12 t k20c k83c k1r kdt knit tp loading and k2 those in the river fig 8 nutrients and other instream factors were identified as the main drivers of river eutrophication kim et al 2017 bae and seo 2018 only kinetic processes of phytoplankton and nutrients were considered in their setup 4 3 influence of seasonality and external contributions on eutrophication in the uqr and mqr the influence of seasonality and external nutrient mechanisms on the uqr and mqr are summarized in figs 10 and 11 although in stream processes mainly regulate the degree of eutrophication in both systems catchment processes however have a more important role in the trophic state of the mqr than the uqr external nitrogen contributions control ammonium concentrations in the lumsden to hwy6 reach fig 11 a study by clifton associates ltd 2012 shows how the stretch is noted for frequent algal blooms at a workshop held in january 2018 the presumption then was instream processes overwhelmed catchment processes but results from this study show otherwise the higher external nutrients received at the mqr could be what is rendering it as hypereutrophic compared to the uqr in a related regional study vogt et al 2017 also found that in lake processes rather than external factors regulated water quality in the canadian prairies the internal processes however correlated with regional factors including land use 5 conclusion the ecosystem functioning of the uqr and mqr are very different although eutrophication is impacting both systems factors and processes governing their levels are unique to each system do variation in the uqr is dominated by do balance accounting for over 50 of influence with phytoplankton cycle and diffuse loading as subsidiary processes do gradient decreases from upstream to downstream whereas primary production is greatest in the lake and decreases upstream do balance phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle and tn loading from the catchment are the main drivers of mqr response to do variation do balance predominantly governs do levels at upstream of pasqua hwy 6 and lumsden whereas phytoplankton cycle regulates levels in the lake unlike the uqr the mqr do levels are highest as you move downstream in the river an indication of more oxygenated contributions from the tributaries the response of the uqr to inorganic nutrient variation is mainly governed by nutrient and phytoplankton cycles whereas in the mqr this is mainly by nutrient cycle phytoplankton cycle and do balance chl a variation in the buffalo pound lake is mainly by the phytoplankton cycle in pasqua lake however phytoplankton cycle nutrient cycle tn loading and do balance influence chl a variation the influence of diffuse loading on the mqr is more pronounced than the uqr figs 10 and 11 although diffuse loading has significant impact on eutrophication of both systems the degree of eutrophication is however sustained mainly by in stream processes figs 10 and 11 this study highlighted the importance of instream processes to eutrophication compared to exogenous factors other studies have shown the greater influence of catchment processes on river water quality barten and de la crétaz 2007 chen et al 2013 xia et al 2018 mccullough et al 2018 the need to assess the relative importance of different sources of

25126,clonal populations in which after switching to sexual reproduction simultaneous hermaphrodites may coexist with variable proportions of hermaphrodites functioning only as male or female provide an opportunity to test sex ratio bias and sex investment within a simultaneous hermaphrodite which are collectively referred to as the modular reproductive effect in this study an individual based model ibm was used to determine how sex investment and sex ratio bias affect the cnidarian hydra circumcincta s fitness its clone mates represent a genet and after switching to sexual reproduction they can be simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females or hermaphrodites functioning as males depending on their body size the results of the model indicated that under low competition among polyps to fertilize eggs hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males coexist with the numerical superiority of the latter being more successful than simultaneous hermaphroditism independently of male biased allocation of sex functions when mate competition increases the coexistence of hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males with the fundamental sex ratio 1 1 and females able to change their investment in eggs is the most successful when there is strong mate competition simultaneous hermaphroditism with strongly female biased allocation of sex functions is the optimal strategy except in scenarios with constrained investment in eggs in such scenarios various strategies observed in natural populations of hydras become successful keywords sex allocation simultaneous hermaphrodites sex ratio reproductive investment 1 introduction modular species in contrast to unitary ones have multiple development of modules which are genetically identical and can be considered a single specimen gattsuk 2008 notov 2010 modules or clone mates represent a genet and all of them contribute to the genet s fitness as measured by the reproductive success of the clone e g the number of zygotes from this perspective the clone allows for a unique analysis of sex allocation after switching to sexual reproduction the analysis may include changes in the allocation of female and male functions within the hermaphroditic clone mates as well as bias in the sex ratio i e the ratio of clone mates with only female gonads to those with only male gonads and to simultaneous hermaphrodites within the genet diverse reproductive modes provide a wide range of possibilities to study sex ratios and sex allocation sex allocation in hermaphroditic animals with an emphasis on investment in female and male reproductive components has been studied recently johnston et al 1998 angeloni 2003 schärer 2009 wong and michiels 2011 janicke et al 2013 cannarsa and meconcelli 2017 previously this aspect of sex allocation theory has been applied mostly to plants among them hermaphroditic species dominate and represent 94 of the known species goldman and willson 1986 wright and barrett 1998 vamosi and vamosi 2004 in contrast hermaphroditic animals represent 5 6 of all species jarne and auld 2006 however if only aquatic animals are considered it appears that hermaphroditic species can be found in any systematic group from porifera to pisces and in many cases they dominate e g porifera cnidaria oligochaeta bryozoa and tunicata hoare and hughes 2001 jarne and auld 2006 thorp and covich 2010 kaliszewicz and uchmański 2009 among these taxa cnidarians especially hydras hydridae exhibit an extraordinary diversity of life history variation and reproductive strategies siebert and juliano 2017 hydras can be dioecious or either simultaneously or sequentially hermaphroditic and all of them are capable of asexual proliferation through budding moreover in populations of hermaphroditic species such as h vulgaris h circumcincta and h viridissima hermaphrodites coexist with males females or both depending on the species duration of the sexual season and environmental conditions particularly temperature kaliszewicz 2011 kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 hydras exhibit a unique form of sexual polymorphism hydras have an additional interesting feature their gonad production depends on the polyp s body size many previous studies have indicated there is a positive correlation between fecundity and body size in numerous organisms harvell and grosberg 1988 including modular invertebrates for example ascidians ritzmann et al 2009 however in hermaphroditic hydras gonad type is related to body size small polyps are functionally either male or female and larger polyps are simultaneous hermaphrodites kaliszewicz 2011 the freshwater cnidarian hydra circumcincta cnidaria hydridae is a species that fits this description well and can be used as a model organism like other hydra species h circumcincta is not a colonial cnidarian it reproduces mainly asexually through budding and produces clonal free living polyps when conditions became unfavourable e g temperature changes lack of food they switch to sexual reproduction within a single clone simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and hermaphrodites functioning as males can be observed kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 variation in h circumcincta s reproductive strategies and its modular non colonial structure enables the study of the effect referred to as the modular reproductive effect in this paper on the strategies that increase hydra clones reproductive success the modular reproductive effect concerns two aspects of sex allocation in the clone 1 unequal investment in sex functions in hermaphroditic clone mates and 2 a biased sex ratio fig 1 in this study an individual based model ibm was used to analyse which aspect has a greater impact on the reproductive success of the h circumcincta clone when considered as a single specimen this approach has not yet been studied in modular non colonial animals 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological background of the model 2 1 1 model organism the species selected for the model was the simultaneously hermaphroditic hydra circumcincta schulze 1914 hydridae cnidaria this small hydra species inhabits small ponds canals lakes and even groundwater in europe kanaev 1952 schuchert 2010 knight and johns 2012 asexual budding resulting in the formation of clones

to sexual reproduction initially by developing gonads kanaev 1952 burnett 1973 the whole process took 7 days at a temperature of 20 c fertilization in h circumcincta is external and there is no larval stage under favourable conditions zygotes develop into small polyps that grow and begin asexual budding in natural populations simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and hermaphrodites functioning as males are observed similar to other hydra species for example h viridissima kaliszewicz 2011 2 2 the model the individual based model ibm is presented according to a standard protocol odd grimm et al 2016 2 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to assess which aspect of the modular reproductive effect 1 unequal investment in sex functions in hermaphroditic clone mates or 2 a biased sex ratio has a greater impact on the reproductive success of the hydra circumcincta clone under different levels of mate competition the hydra clone is considered as a single modular specimen 2 2 2 state variables and scales the model describes the increase in the number of h circumcincta polyps belonging to one clone genet over one season of asexual reproduction then the switch to sexual reproduction and finally clone fitness expressed as the number of zygotes each hydra polyp has defined traits age a size s lifespan ts table 1 and growth rate rp based on eq 1 submodel the model operates on daily time steps the updating of the state variables is synchronous the model is not spatially explicit 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the effect of reproductive strategies on the clone fitness was analysed in different scenarios in each scenario clonal polyps of hydra grow and reproduce asexually until they either die at tm or the sexual reproduction season begins sexual maturation in hydras usually involves ceasing asexual reproduction increasing in size and developing gonads in the model polyps stop asexual budding and begin to develop gonads the type and number of gonads was related to the body size of polyps and this relation differentiated the model scenarios to simplify the model it was assumed no food limitation the model was programmed in delphi 7 borland software corporation and each run was repeated 100 times 2 2 4 design concepts emergence the successful reproductive strategies of the clone emerged as a result of component strategies of its clone mates the number of gonad was in relation to the body size of the clone mate polyps tables 2 5 fitness clone fitness is expressed as the number of zygotes at the end of the sexual reproduction season interaction stable demographic conditions without competition between clone mates or density dependent growth rate were simulated in the model the model scenarios differed in mate competition mate competition was expressed as the number of fertilized oocytes cf per male gonad stochasticity the growth rate of the hydra polyps were differentiated randomly in the range of

model are the clone abundances and the number of zygotes to identify the most successful strategy of the hydra clone under different levels of mate competition the reproductive success of the hydra clone obtained from simulations based on the relationship between body size and the number of gonads of the polyps collected from the natural population table 2 were compared to reproductive success in scenarios based on modifications of this relationship tables 3 5 2 2 5 initialization at the start of each simulation the hydra clone originates from one polyp developed from a zygote the polyp grows and when achieves the threshold age of 10 days it begins budding and produces a new polyp every 4 days budding interval ib the daughter polyps also grow and produce new polyps ib 4 days until their death at tm or the beginning of the sexual reproduction season the maturation time tm 7 days includes the cessation of asexual budding increasing polyps body size and developing gonads the number of female and male gonads was calculated based on real data from a field study of h circumcincta table 2 and the modifications of real data concerned the number of gonads in hermaphrodites functioning as males females or in simultaneous hermaphrodites table 3 5 the duration of the whole season of growth and reproduction of the hydra clone was tw 60 days 2 2 6 input the growth rate of hydra polyps was calculated in the laboratory experiment the gonad number in relation to the body size of the hydra polyps was based on real data from a field study and modifications of these data table 2 5 2 2 7 submodels 2 2 7 1 the growth rate of polyps asexual hydras collected from the field were used in the laboratory to determine the growth and asexual reproductive rate of h circumcincta the polyps n 39 were placed separately in 80 ml containers filled with lake water prepared according to the standard procedure kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 the conditions were optimal for asexual reproduction a temperature of 20 c and a 12l 12d photoperiod hydras were fed brine shrimp artemia salina nauplii three times per week this feeding rate is optimal for asexual reproduction previous experiments have indicated that a lower feeding rate decreased the asexual reproductive rate while a higher feeding rate did not significantly increase budding kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013

functions under different levels of mate competition the results of the model simulations revealed that reproductive success sc depended on the mate competition level and sexual reproductive strategy of the clone mates when mate competition were low i e 1 2 oocytes fertilized by a male gonad the optimal strategy was when hermaphrodites functioning as males and those functioning as females were present with a sex ratio of 9 1 fig 2 a the presence of simultaneous hermaphroditic polyps with increased male functions was less beneficial for the success of the clone than the coexistence of hermaphrodites functioning as males and those functioning as females with an equal sex ratio of 1 1 in the scenario with the increased mate competition the strategy of the equal sex ratio with hermaphrodites functioning as females enable to increase their investment in the number of eggs table 3 version ii becomes most successful fig 2b furthermore the presence of hermaphrodites functioning

successful reproductive strategy fig 2c 3 2 successful reproductive strategies of the hydra clone with clone mates were unable to increase their allocation of female functioning under different levels of mate competition in a situation in which hermaphrodites functioning as females and simultaneous hermaphroditic polyps were unable to increase their investment in eggs the clones optimal strategy did not change when competition was low fig 3 a but differed when competition increased the coexistence of hermaphrodites functioning as males and simultaneous hermaphrodites and the strategy based on real data i e the coexistence of hermaphrodites functioning as males hermaphrodites functioning as females and simultaneous hermaphrodites appeared to be successful strategies in the scenario in which

variations in 2 parameters defining clone mates lifespan and growth rate these analyses showed that despite the differences in the number of clone mates affecting sc fig 4 the successful reproductive strategies were similar independently of varying parameters there was consistently low sensitivity of the successful reproductive strategies to other input parameters ib tm tw except for mate competition cf and body size s analysed in the model figs 2 and 3 4 discussion the simulations of real and hypothetical scenarios of reproductive strategies of hydra circumcincta under different levels of mate competition allowed the differentiation of which aspect of the modular reproductive effect i e investment in sex functions within hermaphroditic clone mates or biased sex ratios in the clone had a greater effect on reproductive success the results indicated that under low male mating competition conditions hermaphrodites functioning as males and those functioning as females with an equal sex ratio or numerical superiority of hermaphrodites functioning as males in the clone were the most successful strategies if male success is higher than female success in terms of the number of fertilized zygotes then sex investment should be adjusted to the male function however this situation does not seem to be stable in natural populations increasing competition between clone mates reduces the reproductive success of males sooner or later local sperm competition lsc schärer 2009 the results of the model also revealed that simultaneous hermaphroditism with increased investment in male functions is less beneficial for the success of the hydra clone than sex ratios with male biased or even equal ratios of hermaphrodites functioning only as males and those functioning only as females this finding is interesting in light of fitness and reflects the fact that simultaneous hermaphrodites produce proportionally fewer male gonads than males of the same size another possible aspect which was not included in the model is male sperm superiority over the sperm of selfing hermaphrodites in fertilizing ova e g observed for plants and nematodes hodgkin and barnes 1991 morand prieur et al 2003 alternatively males may benefit from earlier maturation compared to hermaphrodites reported for barnacles zardus and hadfield 2004 both of these factors may favour males and dioecy over simultaneous hermaphrodites under low mate competition conditions the results of the model presented here indicate that the situation changes when competition between polyps to fertilize eggs increases when the sex ratio of clone mates functioning as males and females is equal and the latter are able to increase their investment in eggs they become the most successful however increased allocation to egg production cannot be unlimited in natural populations and depends on the resource supply and physiological constraints it indicates that the fundamental 1 1 sex ratio can be favoured under specific conditions of plentiful food and the benefits to fitness can explain in addition to fisher s theory fisher 1930 the mechanisms that maintain an equal sex ratio the simulations of further increases in mate competition leads to the highest reproductive success when simultaneous hermaphrodites with strongly female biased sex allocation are present sex allocation theory predicts that simultaneous hermaphrodites will allocate more resources to female functions if the number of mating partners is small charnov 1980 fischer 1981 a small mating group can lead to self sperm competition or competition between clone mates and causes reduced allocation to the male function however the increase in allocation to female functions is limited investment in female functions in a hermaphrodite is usually more costly than allocation to male functions and may depend on resource availability and individual size petersen and fischer 1996 st mary 1997 moore and pannell 2011 an increase in individual size may correspond to an increase in allocation to female functions or a threshold size may be needed for female gonad development this phenomenon has been reported for corals sea anemones barnacles sea slugs and fish crisp 1983 petersen and fischer 1996 angeloni 2003 loya and sakai 2008 armoza zvuloni et al 2014 and seems to be present in hydras the results of the model presented here revealed that the success of the clone under high competition among polyps to fertilize eggs is elevated by strongly female biased allocation in simultaneous hermaphrodites this situation was simulated using hypothetical data of increased ova production by hermaphrodites of h circumcincta however if investment constraints are considered and only real data based on field observations of the number of gonads in each size class of hydra polyps are used then various strategies appeared to be successful the coexistence of simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as males coexistence of simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as females hermaphrodites functioning as either females or males with female biased sex ratios and finally the coexistence of simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males these strategies favour the reproductive success of the genet if an increase in investment in egg production is limited interestingly similar to the results of the model variations in reproductive strategies have been noted in natural and laboratory populations of hydra these populations of hydras after switching to sexual reproduction can consist of simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as females simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as males or simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males coexisting kaliszewicz 2011 kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 the confirmation of the model results by real data suggests that high mating competition may exist in populations of h circumcincta many different reproductive strategies arising from model simulations based on the modular reproductive effect are close to having the highest reproductive success under several sets of scenarios and could be expected to evolve and maintain a clonal population it is likely that the unique variation of strategies observed in modular cnidarians e g hydras sea anemones and corals is a result of comparable effects of these strategies on the fitness of genets the model results presented here indicate that changing sex ratios in the clone as an aspect of the modular reproductive effect are more successful strategies than different allocations of sex functions in simultaneous hermaphrodites with the exception of strongly increased investment in female functions further studies of sex allocation and its effect on the fitness of a genet are needed to gain a comprehensive

25126,clonal populations in which after switching to sexual reproduction simultaneous hermaphrodites may coexist with variable proportions of hermaphrodites functioning only as male or female provide an opportunity to test sex ratio bias and sex investment within a simultaneous hermaphrodite which are collectively referred to as the modular reproductive effect in this study an individual based model ibm was used to determine how sex investment and sex ratio bias affect the cnidarian hydra circumcincta s fitness its clone mates represent a genet and after switching to sexual reproduction they can be simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females or hermaphrodites functioning as males depending on their body size the results of the model indicated that under low competition among polyps to fertilize eggs hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males coexist with the numerical superiority of the latter being more successful than simultaneous hermaphroditism independently of male biased allocation of sex functions when mate competition increases the coexistence of hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males with the fundamental sex ratio 1 1 and females able to change their investment in eggs is the most successful when there is strong mate competition simultaneous hermaphroditism with strongly female biased allocation of sex functions is the optimal strategy except in scenarios with constrained investment in eggs in such scenarios various strategies observed in natural populations of hydras become successful keywords sex allocation simultaneous hermaphrodites sex ratio reproductive investment 1 introduction modular species in contrast to unitary ones have multiple development of modules which are genetically identical and can be considered a single specimen gattsuk 2008 notov 2010 modules or clone mates represent a genet and all of them contribute to the genet s fitness as measured by the reproductive success of the clone e g the number of zygotes from this perspective the clone allows for a unique analysis of sex allocation after switching to sexual reproduction the analysis may include changes in the allocation of female and male functions within the hermaphroditic clone mates as well as bias in the sex ratio i e the ratio of clone mates with only female gonads to those with only male gonads and to simultaneous hermaphrodites within the genet diverse reproductive modes provide a wide range of possibilities to study sex ratios and sex allocation sex allocation in hermaphroditic animals with an emphasis on investment in female and male reproductive components has been studied recently johnston et al 1998 angeloni 2003 schärer 2009 wong and michiels 2011 janicke et al 2013 cannarsa and meconcelli 2017 previously this aspect of sex allocation theory has been applied mostly to plants among them hermaphroditic species dominate and represent 94 of the known species goldman and willson 1986 wright and barrett 1998 vamosi and vamosi 2004 in contrast hermaphroditic animals represent 5 6 of all species jarne and auld 2006 however if only aquatic animals are considered it appears that hermaphroditic species can be found in any systematic group from porifera to pisces and in many cases they dominate e g porifera cnidaria oligochaeta bryozoa and tunicata hoare and hughes 2001 jarne and auld 2006 thorp and covich 2010 kaliszewicz and uchmański 2009 among these taxa cnidarians especially hydras hydridae exhibit an extraordinary diversity of life history variation and reproductive strategies siebert and juliano 2017 hydras can be dioecious or either simultaneously or sequentially hermaphroditic and all of them are capable of asexual proliferation through budding moreover in populations of hermaphroditic species such as h vulgaris h circumcincta and h viridissima hermaphrodites coexist with males females or both depending on the species duration of the sexual season and environmental conditions particularly temperature kaliszewicz 2011 kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 hydras exhibit a unique form of sexual polymorphism hydras have an additional interesting feature their gonad production depends on the polyp s body size many previous studies have indicated there is a positive correlation between fecundity and body size in numerous organisms harvell and grosberg 1988 including modular invertebrates for example ascidians ritzmann et al 2009 however in hermaphroditic hydras gonad type is related to body size small polyps are functionally either male or female and larger polyps are simultaneous hermaphrodites kaliszewicz 2011 the freshwater cnidarian hydra circumcincta cnidaria hydridae is a species that fits this description well and can be used as a model organism like other hydra species h circumcincta is not a colonial cnidarian it reproduces mainly asexually through budding and produces clonal free living polyps when conditions became unfavourable e g temperature changes lack of food they switch to sexual reproduction within a single clone simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and hermaphrodites functioning as males can be observed kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 variation in h circumcincta s reproductive strategies and its modular non colonial structure enables the study of the effect referred to as the modular reproductive effect in this paper on the strategies that increase hydra clones reproductive success the modular reproductive effect concerns two aspects of sex allocation in the clone 1 unequal investment in sex functions in hermaphroditic clone mates and 2 a biased sex ratio fig 1 in this study an individual based model ibm was used to analyse which aspect has a greater impact on the reproductive success of the h circumcincta clone when considered as a single specimen this approach has not yet been studied in modular non colonial animals 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological background of the model 2 1 1 model organism the species selected for the model was the simultaneously hermaphroditic hydra circumcincta schulze 1914 hydridae cnidaria this small hydra species inhabits small ponds canals lakes and even groundwater in europe kanaev 1952 schuchert 2010 knight and johns 2012 asexual budding resulting in the formation of clones

to sexual reproduction initially by developing gonads kanaev 1952 burnett 1973 the whole process took 7 days at a temperature of 20 c fertilization in h circumcincta is external and there is no larval stage under favourable conditions zygotes develop into small polyps that grow and begin asexual budding in natural populations simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and hermaphrodites functioning as males are observed similar to other hydra species for example h viridissima kaliszewicz 2011 2 2 the model the individual based model ibm is presented according to a standard protocol odd grimm et al 2016 2 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to assess which aspect of the modular reproductive effect 1 unequal investment in sex functions in hermaphroditic clone mates or 2 a biased sex ratio has a greater impact on the reproductive success of the hydra circumcincta clone under different levels of mate competition the hydra clone is considered as a single modular specimen 2 2 2 state variables and scales the model describes the increase in the number of h circumcincta polyps belonging to one clone genet over one season of asexual reproduction then the switch to sexual reproduction and finally clone fitness expressed as the number of zygotes each hydra polyp has defined traits age a size s lifespan ts table 1 and growth rate rp based on eq 1 submodel the model operates on daily time steps the updating of the state variables is synchronous the model is not spatially explicit 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the effect of reproductive strategies on the clone fitness was analysed in different scenarios in each scenario clonal polyps of hydra grow and reproduce asexually until they either die at tm or the sexual reproduction season begins sexual maturation in hydras usually involves ceasing asexual reproduction increasing in size and developing gonads in the model polyps stop asexual budding and begin to develop gonads the type and number of gonads was related to the body size of polyps and this relation differentiated the model scenarios to simplify the model it was assumed no food limitation the model was programmed in delphi 7 borland software corporation and each run was repeated 100 times 2 2 4 design concepts emergence the successful reproductive strategies of the clone emerged as a result of component strategies of its clone mates the number of gonad was in relation to the body size of the clone mate polyps tables 2 5 fitness clone fitness is expressed as the number of zygotes at the end of the sexual reproduction season interaction stable demographic conditions without competition between clone mates or density dependent growth rate were simulated in the model the model scenarios differed

model are the clone abundances and the number of zygotes to identify the most successful strategy of the hydra clone under different levels of mate competition the reproductive success of the hydra clone obtained from simulations based on the relationship between body size and the number of gonads of the polyps collected from the natural population table 2 were compared to reproductive success in scenarios based on modifications of this relationship tables 3 5 2 2 5 initialization at the start of each simulation the hydra clone originates from one polyp developed from a zygote the polyp grows and when achieves the threshold age of 10 days it begins budding and produces a new polyp every 4 days budding interval ib the daughter polyps also grow and produce new polyps ib 4 days until their death at tm or the beginning of the sexual reproduction season the maturation time tm 7 days includes the cessation of asexual budding increasing polyps body size and developing gonads the number of female and male gonads was calculated based on real data from a field study of h circumcincta table 2 and the modifications of real data concerned the number of gonads in hermaphrodites

reproduction a temperature of 20 c and a 12l 12d photoperiod hydras were fed brine shrimp artemia salina nauplii three times per week this feeding rate is optimal for asexual reproduction previous experiments have indicated that a lower feeding rate decreased the asexual reproductive rate while a higher feeding rate did not significantly increase budding kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013

strategies were similar independently of varying parameters there was consistently low sensitivity of the successful reproductive strategies to other input parameters ib tm tw except for mate competition cf and body size s analysed in the model figs 2 and 3 4 discussion the simulations of real and hypothetical scenarios of reproductive strategies of hydra circumcincta under different levels of mate competition allowed the differentiation of which aspect of the modular reproductive effect i e investment in sex functions within hermaphroditic clone mates or biased sex ratios in the clone had a greater effect on reproductive success the results indicated that under low male mating competition conditions hermaphrodites functioning as males and those functioning as females with an equal sex ratio or numerical superiority of hermaphrodites functioning as males in the clone were the most successful strategies if male success is higher than female success in terms of the number of fertilized zygotes then sex investment should be adjusted to the male function however this situation does not seem to be stable in natural populations increasing competition between clone mates reduces the reproductive success of males sooner or later local sperm competition lsc schärer 2009 the results of the model also revealed that simultaneous hermaphroditism with increased investment in male functions is less beneficial for the success of the hydra clone than sex ratios with male biased or even equal ratios of hermaphrodites functioning only as males and those functioning only as females this finding is interesting in light of fitness and reflects the fact that simultaneous hermaphrodites produce proportionally fewer male gonads than males of the same size another possible

situation was simulated using hypothetical data of increased ova production by hermaphrodites of h circumcincta however if investment constraints are considered and only real data based on field observations of the number of gonads in each size class of hydra polyps are used then various strategies appeared to be successful the coexistence of simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as males coexistence of simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as females hermaphrodites functioning as either females or males with female biased sex ratios and finally the coexistence of simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males these strategies favour the reproductive success of the genet if an increase in investment in egg production is limited interestingly similar to the results of the model variations in reproductive strategies have been noted in natural and laboratory populations of hydra these populations of hydras after switching to sexual reproduction can consist of simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as females simultaneous hermaphrodites and hermaphrodites functioning as males or simultaneous hermaphrodites hermaphrodites functioning as females and those functioning as males coexisting kaliszewicz 2011 kaliszewicz and lipińska 2013 the confirmation of the model results by real data suggests that high mating competition may exist in populations of h circumcincta many different reproductive strategies arising from model simulations based on the modular reproductive effect are close to having the highest reproductive success under several sets of scenarios and could be expected to evolve and maintain a clonal population it is likely that the unique variation of strategies observed in modular cnidarians e g hydras sea anemones and corals is a result of comparable effects of these strategies on the fitness of genets the model results presented here indicate that changing sex ratios in the clone as an aspect of the modular reproductive effect are more successful strategies than different allocations of sex functions in simultaneous hermaphrodites with the exception of strongly increased investment in female functions further studies of sex allocation and its effect on the fitness of a genet are needed to gain a comprehensive

25127,the proposed elementary mathematical model of formation and decomposition of soil organic matter som is based on using equations of chemical kinetics to describe the multistage process of som transformation the model both describes each step of transformation in accordance with the law of mass action and postulates the trend of increasing stability of the matter towards further transformation which is common for all steps analysis of the model demonstrates that it is extremely difficult to construct a realistic model of som dynamics by assembling elementary models of the type presented in this study into the full description of som transformation processes keywords soil organic matter model of soil organic matter transformations kinetics of soil organic matter transformations 1 introduction we have previously developed a simple continuous model of som transformations bartsev and pochekutov 2015 2016 2017 to keep the model as simple as possible the principle underlying the construction of that model was to reflect only the most general basic notions of these processes a gradual increase in som stability towards transformation that occurs simultaneously with decomposition of some part of som these notions were presented in the model phenomenologically as the general trends of these processes with no detailed description of their inherent microbiological and biochemical mechanisms the increase in som stability and som transformation into more stable forms was described as continuous movement of the matter along the scale representing the stability of the matter towards further transformation this scale was represented by the coefficient of the rate of som transformation into a more stable form h we also proposed a way to map this rather abstract scale one to one onto the depth of the matter s location in the soil profile which was more convenient scale for observation and measurements in the basic version of the model bartsev and pochekutov 2015 som movement along scale h is described by the transport equation hence all som in the model characterized at this time point by a given value of h will move along the scale simultaneously and at the same velocity this description appears too simplified as it misses the fact that according to the laws of chemical kinetics at any instant of time only part of the matter is undergoing the reaction of transformation to the next form while another part of this matter has not been involved in this reaction yet moreover some part of som may be physically inaccessible to decomposing microorganisms and their enzymes and may remain so for some time to include this in the model we had to complicate it by introducing additional terms into its basic equation and by adding another equation which expressed dynamics of the part of the matter that had not been involved in the reaction in that form the model equations had an accurate analytical solution only in the stationary case by using that complicated form of model equations we managed to obtain a good quantitative fit between model calculations of stationary distributions of som and the distributions actually observed in the soil bartsev and pochekutov 2017 in this study we have attempted to construct the simplest possible model of the gradual transformation of som to more stable forms occurring simultaneously with decomposition of some part of som in this model to describe the multistage transformation of som we initially use explicit equations of chemical kinetics as basic equations of the model to reveal advantages and disadvantages of this approach over the description of som transformation by the transport equation which we used previously the model of transformation is derived and discussed in the simplest possible schematic form 2 basic model equations however complex som composition is it consists of definite chemical compounds organic matter transformation in soil is a succession of transformations of these chemical compounds each reaction of transformation of one substance into another is described by the law of mass action the model derived below is intended to provide an elementary demonstration of how the law of mass action works when som stability increases during the course of multistage chemical transformations for this we model the process of stability increase using an elementary example of one substance the entire process of organic matter transformation is described as passing through a discrete succession of transformations each of the transformations is characterized by its own value of reaction rate coefficient h j index j 0 1 2 numbers transformations the succession of transformations is generally directed towards increasing som stability although less stable som compounds can be transformed into more stable ones in different ways for the elementary model we consider one chain of chemical transformations of one organic compound which enters the soil as a component of plant litter then each jth organic compound in soil will be matched by a definite value of h j of its transformation into the next compound thus a discrete set of h j values placed along the common continuous scale h will describe the succession of som transformations let us remind you that h corresponds to stability of the matter towards further transformation then the general process of som transformation will be described in the model as the succession of reactions of transformation of the jth organic compound into the j 1 th with h j h j 1 for each j the model should also take into account that while part of the matter is being transformed into a more stable compound another part of this matter is undergoing mineralization decomposition to co2 which leaves the soil the assumption that som stability gradually increases also means that the coefficient of mineralization rate k j decreases with increasing j then som transformation dynamics will be described by a system of ordinary differential equations 1 d m 0 t d t d h 0 m 0 t k 0 m 0 t d m j t d t h j 1 m j 1 t h j m j t k j m j t for j 1 where m j t is the amount of som in the form of the jth compound with the matter that directly enters the soil as litter taken as the 0th compound t is time and d is the litter input rate all equations of system 1 have analytical solution by solving them sequentially beginning with the 0th and inserting the solution into the following equation we obtain a set of m j t functions which are generalized for the arbitrary j as 2 m j t 1 j d i 0 j 1 h i l 0 j 1 exp h l t h l i 0 i l j h l h i where h i h i k i setting all derivatives in 1 equal to zero we obtain a system of algebraic equations describing som in the stationary state for an arbitrary number of j it has the following solution 3 m j d i 0 j 1 h i i 0 j h i note that m j t is not an alternating sequence multiplier 1 in the odd degree compensates the sign of the odd number of negative cofactors in the denominator all m j t are positive increase monotonically with increasing t and m j t m j at t the total amount of som formed from this substance will be expressed as the following series 4 s j 0 m j 3 general pattern of the transformation rate decrease to make calculations using formulas 2 3 or 4 one should determine the values of h j and k j for each number of the transformation stage j as there are very many som transformation stages and it is hard to determine even the exact chemical structure of som formed at each stage it is impossible to measure kinetic coefficients for every stage for this reason and striving to keep the model as simple as possible we try to set common for all som compounds and all transformation stages empirical dependencies of changes in som stability based on some general considerations each step of som transformation is one chemical reaction it changes the value of h by some quantity which cannot be infinitely small that is why the change of h from stage to stage must be discrete the fundamental discreteness of the h j h j 1 intervals which must be considered as finite quantities is determined by the differences between chemical kinetic properties of the compounds in these stages one chemical reaction changes only one bond supposing that as som stability increases its structure becomes more complex and a change in one bond in the more complex som molecule in the later transformation stage leads to a less considerable change in its kinetic properties than a change in one bond in the less complex molecule in an earlier stage we reach the conclusion that the interval between h j and h j 1 must decrease with an increase in the number of j the type of this decrease must ensure the convergence of series 4 and at the same time be mathematically simple and its parameters are adjustable parameters in the model as the simplest function that as we will show below satisfies these requirements we use 5 h j 1 h j 1 1 j ρ whence it follows that 6 h j h 0 ρ 1 ρ j 1 here ρ is an adjustable parameter and ρ 1 note that for different substances of plant litter which are characterized by different values of h 0 the sequences of h j values for all subsequent transformation stages in the general case will not be the same as is clear from 6 as the empirical dependence of the relationship between h j and k j we use the function k h bh p which was previously used in the continuous model bartsev and pochekutov 2015 2016 2017 7 k j bh j p where b and p are adjustable parameters b 0 0 p 1 inserting 6 and 7 into 2 or 3 we can determine the amount of som at each jth stage of transformation and the total som from eq 4 note that the ratio 8 m j 1 m j 1 1 j ρ 1 1 j 1 ρ 1 1 b h 0 1 p 1 j 1 ρ 1 p at small j may be either above or below 1 but at j 1 it is always below 1 this suggests that m j may either decrease or increase with an increase in j when j is small but at large j m j necessarily decreases monotonically setting in 8 j 1 j at large j the m j 1 m j ratio decreases monotonically with an increase in j 9 lim j m j 1 m j 0 that is series 4 converges according to d alembert s test note that if instead of 5 we use a simpler relation h j 1 h j 1 q where q const 0 q 1 then lim j m j 1 m j i e series 4 is divergent according to d alembert s test therefore relation 5 can be considered as the simplest ensuring series 4 convergence to describe real soils it makes sense to use only the first n terms of the sequence m j limiting n so as to make the remainder of the series r n j n m j negligibly small r n at n 1 can be quantified by using the inequality ensuing from the series convergence according to d alembert s test and the monotonicity of the decrease in m j 1 m j with the increase in j at j 1 10 r n m n 2 m n m n 1 then evaluation of the total som with any required degree of accuracy depending on the choice of n can be calculated as 11 s n j 0 n 1 m j fig 1 shows an example of the dynamics of accumulation of compounds formed in different stages of transformation of one plant litter substance m j t for several different j fig 2 shows stocks of all products of transformation of one litter substance formed at different time points 4 discussion to be able to use the model to describe actual processes one should know the values of its parameters determination of parameters b p and ρ which are specific for the entire ecosystem could be realized as an experiment with a sample of pure substance e g cellulose decomposed in soil having measured the curve of the sample mass loss with time one can choose the values of b p and ρ to achieve the smallest possible discrepancy between the model curve s t m j t and the actual curve of the sample mass loss to be able to use the model to describe transformations of real plant litter one should know values of d and h 0 for all significant chemical compounds constituting the litter taking into account 7 h 0 can be determined using the value of the initial mineralization rate of chemical compound k 0 found experimentally however the k 0 value of even the same chemical compound must differ in different litter components such as leaves roots or wood as the availability of this compound to microorganisms enzymes and other factors causing som transformation is not the same theoretically determination of k 0 values of different chemical compounds could be performed as litterbag experiment which involves chemical analysis of the composition of each litter component and measurement of the mass loss of each relevant chemical compound in fact however some of the compounds in the litter sample may both decrease and increase because they may be synthesized by microorganisms decomposing other compounds which was experimentally found for cellulose talbot and treseder 2012 hemicellulose may be expected to behave in a similar fashion as it can be synthesized by bacteria as part of their cell walls thus litterbag experiment is not a reliable way to obtain accurate k 0 values of individual compounds the model described above is knowingly oversimplified as it is intended to be a starting point for constructing a more realistic model for the model to be closer to the description of real transformations of organic matter in soil it should take into account interactions between chemical compounds during transformations these are primarily the well known interactions between polysaccharides and lignin in which polysaccharides are co substrate for lignin decomposition and lignin protects cellulose and hemicellulose against decomposition both physically and chemically talbot et al 2012 talbot and treseder 2012 even better approximation could be achieved by taking into account that lignin may consist of various monomer types which differ in both the effectiveness of the chemical protection of polysaccharides and their own stability talbot et al 2012 then the model can be presented as a combination of transformation chains of various substances that intricately interact with each other this model will consist of both first order and second order equations of chemical kinetics taking into consideration the difficulty of determining parameters even for the elementary model mentioned above it seems questionable that such a model could be constructed and used nevertheless the model equations derived above demonstrate realism of the basic properties of model behavior namely the model with any values of the parameters that fall within the limits specified when it was derived predicts accumulation of some stationary nonzero and finite amount of som caused by transformation of plant litter asymptotic approaching of nonstationary values of the amounts of som components to their stationary values and accumulation of som which is more stable than the litter matter fig 2 the presented model demonstrates only the minimum level of requirements of detail in litter description which arise when the model is based on an explicit description of the multistage litter transformation by the equations of chemical kinetics but this minimum level is already too high when we try to describe the real plant litter transformation processes since the model is a simplified idealization which reflects only one elementary fragment of the real som transformations process then it is necessary to use also chemically simplified system for an experimental testing of the model in these experiments chemically homogeneous samples consisting of one organic chemical compound which can be decomposed but cannot be synthesized by soil micro and mesoorganisms should be exposed in the soil instead of samples of real plant litter an observation of mass loss dynamics of the samples would make possible to evaluate the parameter h 0 required for the model calculation as a primary test of the model a comparison between experimental and model calculated total amounts of new accumulated som can be proposed a more advanced test of the model can be carried out by a mass spectrometric analysis detecting an appearance of new organic compounds in the soil and measuring their quantities and molecular masses according the model som compounds following each other in the order of increasing their numbers j analogously follow in order of increasing molecular mass it would make possible to determine experimentally a sequence of m j values and to compare them with the model calculations an integrated approach which takes into account all organic compounds in the litter appears to be a better choice for using this approach it is enough to have experimental data on the litter namely the measured litter input rates percentages of its major components such as leaves roots and wood and their mass losses in the early phase of transformation as the basis for estimating the average coefficients of mineralization rate for each component integrated approach in combination with equations of chemical kinetics is used to construct multi compartment models in these models the entire som as well as litter is divided into a discrete set of compartments each of them comprising a large class of compounds then som transformation is described by kinetic equations of transmission of the substance between compartments with reaction rate constants being average for all substances in the compartment e g chertov et al 2001 these models are rightly criticized for the rough description of som by using a small discrete set of compartments and for the arbitrary subdivision of the substances into the compartments these drawbacks can be avoided by using the continuous approach where the passing through all stages of multistage som transformation is described as som movement along the continuous scale which by some means or other reflects decomposability or stability of the matter carpenter 1981 agren and bosatta 1998 continuous models differ in the choice of the scale and formulation of the principle of the substance movement along the scale which is common for the entire scale this approach underlies the continuous model that we proposed previously bartsev and pochekutov 2017 if the unit of the transformed substance in it is represented not by an individual molecule but rather by a certain elementary portion aliquot of a litter component or som at a certain transformation stage the movement of this aliquot along the stability scale must be thought of as a combination of all changes occurring in it chemical transformations of some of the molecules of its constituent substances changes in the proportions of the more stable and less stable substances in the sample and changes in its availability for decomposing organisms and enzymes the intrinsic discreteness of chemical transformations is not an obstacle to the continuous description of transformation of the entire som as all som components are transformed simultaneously and under continuously varying environmental conditions for instance initial rates of transformation of the same substances must differ between each other depending on their availability for decomposing organisms which in turn depends on how close the substance is to the surface of the plant parts in the litter this dependence is continuous as the distance from some point in the midst of plant litter to the surface contacting with the environment can be regarded as continuously changing value depending on what point has been chosen continuousness of differences between initial transformation rates entails continuousness of differences in transformation rates in each following step thus the integrated process becomes actually continuous 5 conclusion this work is primarily a methodological study we propose a model of the basic process in formation of som an elementary transformation chain of one compound the study shows that it gives qualitatively correct results demonstrating accumulation of som which is more stable than the litter matter but not infinitely stable asymptotic approaching of som amounts in all transformation stages to stationary values with litter input being continuous and accumulation of the nonzero finite total amount of som thus the notions included in the model are accurate science generally uses elementary models as starting points to construct complex models which describe real objects elementary models are usually extremely simple and they describe nonexistent ideal objects such as material point ideal gas perfect black body etc in spite of their perfect simplicity they provide an adequate approximate description of a number of physical systems rashevsky 1938 pp 1 3 unfortunately for even a simplified description of complex biochemical systems such as soil a large number of elementary models should be used simultaneously the contradiction between the need for a simple and transparent description of the som dynamics and the need to describe the transformation of a large number of compounds even in the elementary model can be resolved by a phenomenological description of the system dynamics as a whole this description should empirically reflect the final result of the soil processes without detailed description of internal mechanisms thus the present study is another argument in favor of using integrated continuous models to describe som dynamics

integrated approach in combination with equations of chemical kinetics is used to construct multi compartment models in these models the entire som as well as litter is divided into a discrete set of compartments each of them comprising a large class of compounds then som transformation is described by kinetic equations of transmission of the substance between compartments with reaction rate constants being average for all substances in the compartment e g chertov et al 2001 these models are rightly criticized for the rough description of som by using a small discrete set of compartments and for the arbitrary subdivision of the substances into the compartments these drawbacks can be avoided by using the continuous approach where the passing through all stages of multistage som transformation is described as som movement along the continuous scale which by some means or other reflects decomposability or stability of the matter carpenter 1981 agren and bosatta 1998 continuous models differ in the choice of the scale and formulation of the principle of the substance movement along the scale which is common for the entire scale this approach underlies the continuous model that we proposed previously bartsev and pochekutov 2017 if the unit of the transformed substance in it is represented not by an individual molecule but rather by a certain elementary portion aliquot of a litter component or som at a certain transformation stage the movement of this aliquot along the stability scale must be thought of as a combination of all changes occurring in it chemical transformations of some of the molecules of its constituent substances changes in the proportions of the more stable and less stable substances in the sample and changes in its availability for decomposing organisms and enzymes the intrinsic discreteness of chemical transformations is not an obstacle to the continuous description of transformation of the entire som as all som components are transformed simultaneously and under continuously varying environmental conditions for instance initial rates of transformation of the same substances must differ between each other depending on their availability for decomposing organisms which in turn depends on how close the substance is to the surface of the plant parts in the litter this dependence is continuous as the distance from some point in the midst of plant litter to the surface contacting with the environment can be regarded as continuously changing value depending on what point has been chosen continuousness of differences between initial transformation rates entails continuousness of differences in transformation rates in each following step thus the integrated process becomes actually continuous 5 conclusion this work is primarily a methodological study we propose a model of the basic process in formation of som an elementary transformation chain of one compound the study shows that it gives qualitatively correct results demonstrating accumulation of som which is more stable than the litter matter but not infinitely stable asymptotic approaching of som amounts in all transformation stages to stationary values with litter input being continuous and accumulation of the nonzero finite total amount of som thus the notions included in the model are accurate science generally uses elementary models as starting points to construct complex models which describe real objects elementary models are usually extremely simple and they describe nonexistent ideal objects such as material point ideal gas perfect black body etc in spite of their perfect simplicity they provide an adequate approximate description of a number of physical systems rashevsky 1938 pp 1 3 unfortunately for even a simplified description of complex biochemical systems such as soil a large number of elementary models should be used simultaneously the contradiction between the need for a simple and transparent description of the som dynamics and the need to describe the transformation of a large number of compounds even in the elementary model can be resolved by a phenomenological description of the system dynamics as a whole this description should empirically reflect the final result of the soil processes without detailed description of internal mechanisms thus the present study is another argument in favor of using integrated continuous models to describe som dynamics 
25128,pest eradication conducted over the years 2010 to 2014 at macquarie island successfully eradicated introduced rabbits rats and mice from this sub antarctic island the initial aerial baiting phase in the winters of 2010 and 2011 resulted in significant mortality of several native seabird species through primary and secondary ingestion of brodifacoum bait a species of key concern is the northern giant petrel macronectes halli which although relatively abundant and increasing on macquarie island is listed as threatened under australian legislation and was one of the species most affected by poisoning we use a bayesian approach to estimate the total mortality and the response of the population to the poisoning event over the short to medium term we then considered how population abundance might respond over the ensuing years projections of population trajectories suggest a greater than 50 probability of recovery to the pre poisoning levels of 2009 breeding pairs by 2017 this modelling approach could be applied to future planned eradications to quantify the mortality and recovery of incidentally affected populations keywords macronectes halli non target poisoning recovery time population response bayesian model 1 introduction macquarie island 54 30 s 158 57 e is a world heritage site located approximately 1500 km south east of tasmania australia fig 1 the island is uninhabited except for a permanent research base it is under tasmanian state jurisdiction and is recognised for its wildlife including numerous populations of seabirds and marine mammals parks and wildlife service 2006 rats and mice flourished on the island soon after their inadvertent introduction from european ships in the early 1800 s and rabbits were introduced on the island as a food source for sealers around 1870 terauds et al 2014 the increasingly destructive impact of rabbits on the native vegetation scott and kirkpatrick 2013 and the consequent impacts on seabird nesting habitat combined with direct predation by rodents of burrowing seabird eggs and chicks e g brothers and bone 2008 led to a joint tasmanian and australian government program the macquarie island pest eradication project mipep at 12 785 ha this was to be the largest eradication program for rabbits rats and mice attempted anywhere in the world at the time parks and wildlife service 2014 the operational phase of the mipep commenced in june 2010 and was declared successful in april 2014 springer 2016 describes the full technical and chronological account of the mipep implementation the initial helicopter aerial baiting phase in which brodifacoum poison was to be spread across the island via two whole of island bait drops was specifically timed for the austral winter when the majority of the islands wildlife had departed to minimise non target impacts parks and wildlife service 2009a b a delayed arrival to the island coupled with sustained inclement weather resulted in limited flying opportunities in 2010 only a small proportion of the island 8 had been baited by the end of june 2010 and a decision was made to suspend activity until the following winter parks and wildlife service 2014 in the months that followed large numbers of native seabirds including kelp gulls larus dominicus black duck anas superciliosa subantarctic skua catharacta skua northern giant petrel macronectes halli and southern giant petrel m giganteus were reported as killed depending upon species poisoning occurred through direct ingestion of toxic baits and or in the case of scavenging species through secondary ingestion by feeding on toxic rabbit and seabird carcasses giant petrels are scavengers and thus it took a period of weeks to months depending upon the composition of individual birds diet before lethal doses of brodifacoum accumulated in their systems as both giant petrel species are listed as threatened under the australian environmental protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 epbc act the mortality associated with the 2010 secondary poisoning was considered a matter of national environmental significance and triggered a review of the eradication by the australian commonwealth government anon 2010 given the clear ecosystem benefits of a successful eradication to the island the review recommended that the eradication proceed with additional measures aimed at reducing the volume of toxic carcasses available to scavenging seabirds the principal mitigation measure was the introduction of rabbit calici virus rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in the summer months to reduce the rabbit numbers on the island prior to baiting cooke et al 2017 this measure was extremely effective and was estimated to have reduced the rabbit numbers by 80 90 parks and wildlife service 2014 prior to the second attempt at aerial baiting a second mitigation measure was the allocation of additional staff time to conduct thorough ground searches and dispose of poisoned target and non target carcasses before they could be ingested by scavenging seabirds the second season of baiting occurred throughout may and june of 2011 over may to november 2011 ground teams recovered approximately 1 450 individual dead birds this represented an approximately 50 increase in documented non target native seabird mortality compared to the previous baiting attempt in 2010 n 960 it should however be noted that significantly more poison bait was broadcast in 2011 with 100 of target bait volume delivered compared to 5 in 2010 in addition there was increased search effort dedicated to locating and estimating non target mortality in 2011 so estimates for that year are more reliable whereas the number killed in 2010 is likely underestimated the baiting was followed by an on ground hunting phase during which teams of hunters and specifically trained dogs conducted comprehensive ground searches for any remaining rabbits and rodents the ground team found the last rabbit in november 2011 and the tasmanian government declared the island free of rabbits and rodents in april 2014 parks and wildlife service 2014 the vegetation has been recovering ever since whinham and alderman 2016 despite the mitigating actions the combined observed non target mortality across the two baiting periods was substantial for several native seabird species particularly for kelp gulls northern giant petrels and skuas observed mortalities of 989 692 and 512 respectively across the two winters noting that the observed mortalities are minima as many birds will have died at sea or been otherwise undetected by ground personnel while the true scale of the mass mortality event is unknown it is likely to have been detrimental to many of the affected seabird populations here we focus on estimating the scale and impact of this mortality event on one of the most affected species the northern giant petrel given the conservation status of the species vulnerable and rare under commonwealth and state legislation respectively and the global significance of this population with an estimated 1 500 1 800 annual breeding pairs prior to the mortality event representing approximately 15 of the global population the large number of individuals killed was of concern both nationally and internationally acap 2016 phillips et al 2016 single or rare mass mortality events have been documented for fish seabirds and other wildlife occurring as a result of both human activities and as natural events these have included mortality due to algal blooms fire flood sea ice expansion changes in ocean conditions pollution and poisoning winters et al 1986 baduini et al 2001 lyon and o connor 2008 richlen et al 2010 if the species impacted by a mass mortality event has threatened population status either before or potentially after the event or some commercial value then an assessment of their post event status and projected recovery time may be valuable for the responsible managers for example punt and wade 2012 considered the consequences of a catastrophic mortality event on population abundance for the eastern north pacific stock of gray whales over the years 1999 2000 this population experienced an unusually large number of strandings of emaciated adult whales and a marked reduction in calf production possibly due to heavy ice cover in those years punt and wade 2012 explicitly included an additional mortality parameter in a population model for this population to account for the mass mortality event and applied a bayesian approach to parameter estimation to predict stock status relative to management reference points assessments of seabird population status have largely been driven by the need to understand the impacts of additional anthropogenic mortality through bycatch associated with industrial scale fishing industrial fishing by longline and trawl gear has been implicated in numerous seabird population declines e g weimerskirch et al 1997 gales 1998 phillips et al 2006 tuck et al 2011 assessments of bycatch often assume that annual fishing mortality is a function of fishing effort numbers of hooks set or trawl hours and as such is an ongoing mortality source rather than a single event tuck et al 2001 2015 zador et al 2008 robinson et al 2015 thomson et al 2015 for example zador et al 2008 consider the impacts of the alaskan trawl fishery on the endangered short tailed albatross phoebastria albatrus and provide probabilities of achieving management goals such as population recovery according to assumptions regarding future fishing activity and uncertainty in growth rates following zador et al 2008 we use a bayesian approach to quantify parameter uncertainty the advantage of quantifying uncertainty in this manner and providing probabilistic decision tables for managers is that a more honest and informed assessment of the uncertainty inherent in the biological and management systems is provided thereby allowing managers the opportunity to debate potential risk trade offs and learn more about their system zador et al 2008 bunnefeld et al 2011 robinson et al 2015 we use a bayesian approach to estimate the population consequences of the major mortality event on the macquarie island population of northern giant petrels that occurred over 2010 and 2011 the true scale of the mortality is not known as observations of mortality are minima therefore our objectives were to 1 use known or inferred population parameters and observations of annual breeding pairs within a population model that can predict a time series of population size 2 estimate a probability distribution for the magnitude of mortality as a consequence of the non target poisoning and 3 evaluate the most likely future population trajectories to inform conservation management decisions we show how a model like this can be used to evaluate the potential scale and impacts of mortality events such as island pest eradications that may result in secondary mortality of threatened species both prior to and after the event this can assist managers in decisions regarding threatened status and recovery planning 2 material and methods 2 1 population monitoring northern giant petrels nest singly or in small loose groups on most coastal areas of macquarie island a small number breed inland including on ridgelines and headlands and occasionally on the highland plateau egg laying commences in mid august and chicks fledge throughout february giant petrel populations on macquarie island have been studied sporadically since the 1950s these studies have mostly focused on banding individuals to investigate distribution at sea with occasional population estimates reported many of which are of unknown accuracy e g downes et al 1954 johnstone 1974 woehler and johnstone 1988 a consistent monitoring program for this species was established in the 1994 95 breeding season here after referred to by the year of egg laying i e 1994 a long term study area on the north west coastal terraces representing 25 of the total annual breeding population has been monitored in most years thorough ground searches of this study area are conducted during the first two weeks of september to estimate the total number of breeding pairs nest locations are recorded with a handheld gps unit accurate to 10 m and revisited in january to count and band pre fledging chicks and estimate annual breeding success comparable estimates of breeding pairs and breeding success for this study area have been obtained in all seasons between 1994 and 2014 inclusive with the exception of 1999 2004 and 2006 and two earlier estimates of breeding pairs in the study area are also available 1976 and 1979 whole of island censuses of breeding pairs have been undertaken less frequently with nine estimates available between 1996 and 2014 both before and after the mass mortality events of 2010 and 2011 very high correlation between the whole of island numbers and the sample population r 0 985 t3 10 04 p 0 002 confirm that the study area is representative of island trends while there has been a consistent program of banding pre fledging chicks there has been limited and inconsistent band re resighting of breeding adults therefore we do not obtain our survival estimates or breeding frequency estimates from in situ data but they do inform age at first breeding and age of first return to the colony through prior distributions bait drops commenced on the 5th june 2010 and 4th may 2011 and in both years were completed by the end of june the first non target mortalities were detected within the first few weeks of the commencement of baiting and continued to be detected into october however the majority of mortalities 90 had been detected by the commencement of the laying period i e the first week of september 2 2 analytic framework we develop an age and sex structured population model of northern giant petrels values for those parameters not estimated by fitting the model to the data were chosen either directly from macquarie island northern giant petrel datasets or if not available from other published studies on populations of this species or similarly sized annual breeding procellariforms see table 1 the macquarie island population was increasing in size prior to the poisoning event with increases attributed to an increase in food availability similar to other populations of northern giant petrel gonzalez solis et al 2000 patterson et al 2008 this increase in population size was exponential and meant that initial models that included density dependence were not able to estimate density related parameters well the population is thus assumed to grow independent of density during the period of interest this is a reasonable assumption as the main model objectives are to estimate the mortality rate due to secondary poisoning and consider the short term post poisoning recovery dynamics of the population fishing mortality from incidental bycatch has been recorded for giant petrels gandini and frere 2006 and banding data confirm that the macquarie island populations of giant petrels are vulnerable to fisheries related mortality trebilco et al 2008 small scale tracking studies have provided some insight into the at sea distribution for these populations and have demonstrated that considerable time is spent foraging in the australian exclusive economic zone surrounding macquarie island and in ccamlr commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources waters trebilco et al 2008 however because commercial fisheries in both of these key areas are tightly regulated and bycatch of this species is consequently negligible we do not consider fishing mortality to be substantial enough for inclusion in a model likewise some studies have shown that giant petrels can benefit from the discards of fishing vessels copello and quintana 2009 however these interactions are not considered here because regulations require nil discards around macquarie island the initial numbers of birds of each sex of age a 1 in

poisoning in 2010 table 2 following the poisoning events the number of breeding pairs declined to 386 in 2011 and has since slowly increased the accuracy of the annual breeding pair survey depends upon a range of factors including timing number of person days dedicated to the survey experience of the personnel and weather conditions to capture this uncertainty a relative qualitative score based upon expert knowledge was assigned based on the above factors with the most reliable estimates having an observation error equal to the estimated error σ ˆ 1 σ ˆ those estimates with intermediate

based on the metropolis hastings algorithm gelman and rubin 1992 gelman et al 2004 haddon 2011 were used to construct posterior distributions for the four parameters so as to characterize their uncertainty the mcmc sampling process was started at the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters which were found using the optimx function within r nash and varadhan 2011 r core team 2016 samples from the posterior distributions for the four parameters were used to develop a posterior distribution for other model outcomes such as the predicted time series of breeding pairs across the years independent uniform priors across the full range of positive values for each parameter were assumed for each parameter table 1 three chains were each begun using the maximum likelihood estimates as the starting parameter set they were run for 1 000 000 iterations each with values accepted every 50 iterations the thinning rate the results from the first 2000 stored iterations from each chain were ignored as a burn in the posterior marginal distributions were constructed by combining results from all three chains resulting in 54 000 parameter vectors an evaluation of the performance of the model to mimic the available data was conducted using posterior predictive checks gelman et al 2004 for a data point during year y this involved sampling a set of 1 000 parameter vectors each consisting of values for the four parameters from the posterior distribution at random and computing the number of breeding pairs during year y then for each of the numbers of breeding pairs adding observation error based on the value for σ with associated relative uncertainty for the parameter vector concerned to generate a distribution for the data point in year y accounting for both parameter and observation uncertainty 3 results the marginal posterior distributions for the four estimated parameters showed that the data substantially updated the uniform priors with the posterior modes well determined for each of the parameters fig 2 table 3 the three chains overlap considerably indicating support for the conclusion that the mcmc sampling process has converged to the posterior distribution the correlation plots fig 3 show a strong positive correlation between the initial number of age 1 birds and juvenile mortality this is not surprising as the greater the initial population the greater the juvenile mortality that is needed to balance and match the annual breeding pair observations table 2 there is also a negative correlation between the initial numbers of age 1 birds and the poisoning mortality rate parameter k this is because the rate of mortality that is needed to produce the same approximate magnitude of kill can be smaller if the population size at the time of the poisoning is larger posterior predictive distributions fig 4 are used to check whether the model is consistent with the data by generating replicate unobserved data that can be compared with actual observations these distributions capture both the uncertainty in the data and the uncertainty in the trajectory time series fig 4 differs from the posterior distributions fig 2 that describe the probability distributions of a parameter given the data observations the distributions of fig 4 indicate that the model is consistent with the data because all but one of the 20 observations are within the 95 posterior predictive intervals for each set of breeding pair observations and corresponding observation error the posterior for the time trajectory of the number of breeding pairs based upon 54 000 parameter vectors from the posterior distribution fig 5 illustrates the relative confidence in the estimate of the time series of breeding pairs and the varying widths of the credibility intervals reflect the availability of data points widest when there are few data and into the future the consequence of the secondary poisoning events in 2010 and 2011 on the number of breeding pairs is clearly evident resulting in a median decline in breeding pairs of approximately 120 the model predicts an immediate decline in breeding pairs due to the poisoning that occurred in 2010 however this is not evident in the observations which exhibit a one year delay prior to a decline table 2 following the poisoning observations of breeding pair numbers stabilised before showing a marked increase in 2015 and 2016 these observations correspond very well to the model predicted median number of breeding pairs over this period the mean is not shown as it is very similar to the median the posterior distribution of the number of males and females killed from the study population over both 2010 and 2011 shows a broad distribution for males and a much narrower distribution for females fig 6 a table 3 this reflects the relative availability to poisoning of the sexes with females being less available than males due to being at sea for longer periods of time during the winters when poisoning occurred furthermore using the base model predictions of 262 posterior median males 95 credibility intervals 121 406 and 92 posterior median females 95 credibility intervals 41 145 killed from within the sample population and extrapolating up to the total population plausible estimates suggests up to 1 400 birds were killed across the two years the time for the population to recover to the pre poisoning number of breeding pairs in 2009 is quantified by the cumulative probability distribution of recovery times the predicted year with a 50 probability of recovery of breeding pairs to levels at or beyond pre poisoning is approximately 2017 and a 95 probability of recovery by 2021 fig 6b a retrospective of the model fits that sequentially remove annual breeding pair values from the full data set the base case with data to 2016 back to 2011 the final year of the poisoning shows that the median trajectory of breeding pairs is relatively consistent with the observations fig 7 even the fit to breeding pair data that excluded breeding pair observations after 2011 shows a remarkably good fit to the more recent breeding pair values this analysis provides confidence in the model s predictive ability and shows no concerning retrospective patterns that may reflect any mis specification in the model s design e g hurtado ferro et al 2015 model results were not overly sensitive to the value of adult mortality table 3 the signal in the breeding pair observations tends to constrain variation in parameters and any change in adult mortality is compensated by a change in juvenile mortality as a consequence the number of estimated birds killed and recovery times do not vary greatly among values for adult natural mortality table 3 similarly alternative values for the proportion breeding and proportion of females available to poisoning while key unknowns for the population changed the posteriors for the numbers killed between males and females but did not alter the estimated year at 50 probability of recovery 2017 4 discussion a primary motivation for developing this model was to quantify the impact of the macquarie island pest eradication project operations on the status and trends of the islands northern giant petrel population our analyses suggest that the mass mortality resulting from secondary poisoning during the baiting operations in 2010 and 2011 had a considerable immediate impact killing up to 1 400 individuals over two years resulting in a decline in breeding pairs by approximately 33 posterior median 95 credibility interval 29 37 however the population is estimated to have a high probability of recovering to pre poisoning levels over the ensuing 10 years fig 6b given this result which is conditional on the model structure and parameters applied there is no strong evidence for increasing the conservation status of macquarie island s northern giant petrels which was a valid concern at the time anon 2010 post eradication monitoring to document ecosystem responses to mipep was not specifically funded parks and wildlife service 2009b this is a situation common to many island eradications jones et al 2016 instead the mipep was largely reliant upon the continuation of existing monitoring programs that may not have been specifically designed to address questions around post eradication response in addition the continuation of these programs may have been uncertain as they themselves depended upon ongoing resourcing and logistic support for example in 2016 the commonwealth government announced it would close the permanent research station on macquarie island http www antarctica gov au news 2016 change in operations on macquarie island while that decision has since been reversed it was entirely plausible that our understanding of giant petrel population responses to the mortality event in the short to medium term would rely on ex situ modelling approaches fortunately however continued field observations of breeding pairs post baiting were available to validate the model in general the annual breeding population abundance estimated by the model matches the field observations reasonably well however of note is the apparent delay in the decline of observed breeding pairs following the initial year of poisoning in 2010 despite the initial confirmed mortality event the observed number of breeding pairs in the study site was 525 this represented an increase over the previous breeding season 2009 and maintained the increasing population trajectory observed since 1995 table 2 it was not until after the second winter baiting regime in 2011 that a decline in breeding pairs was observed we are confident this effect was not due to timing of the surveys since 90 of bird mortalities had been detected by early september 2010 which is the start of the incubation period and when counts of breeding pairs were made it is also possible that this apparent delay may simply be a result of observation error in the measure of breeding pairs however this is considered unlikely since search effort was higher during the mipep years as there were additional personnel on the island for the eradication thus these estimates are among the most accurate of the time series dpipwe unpublished a plausible scenario for the continued increase in the breeding population after the initial poisoning in 2010 is that the mortality event served to reduce intra specific breeding competition due to the disruption to established breeding pair bonds and more male birds being killed than females the population may have experienced compensatory recruitment with younger birds particularly males having an increased opportunity to partner with newly widowed birds and enter the breeding population e g muths et al 2011 alternatively established breeding birds that would normally have undertaken a sabbatical were able to breed due to reduced competition for resources e g reynolds et al 2017 ryan et al 2006 disentangling these scenarios requires finer scale analyses of the age structure of the breeding population from known age banded birds and such data are not available at this time further refinements to the population dynamics model could consider these suggested mechanisms for the population to buffer and absorb the additional mortality however this is unlikely to greatly change conclusions regarding recovery times which have been shown to match the observations well in the current model formulation fig 5 the bayesian modelling approach taken here explicitly accounts for parameter uncertainty this differs from other models that have dealt with single mass mortality events for example due to the complexity of the macquarie island ecosystem raymond et al 2011 use a qualitative simulation approach to explore the likely outcomes from the macquarie island pest eradication giant petrels were not a focus of their model and predictions did not match observations for this community finkelstein et al 2010 use a stochastic simulation approach to consider the impacts on short tailed albatross phoebastria albatrus of sudden catastrophic volcanism and more chronic threats such as fishery bycatch their model also does not fit to census data unlike zador et al 2008 but instead selects from alternative sets of demographic parameter values in order to match the observed high growth rate in these examples the approaches taken may be suitable to answer broader ecosystem questions in the first instance and deal with a data poor situation in the latter by contrast our model has focussed specifically on the macquarie island population of northern giant petrels using wherever possible data from this population fitting to historical census data and capturing the uncertainty in these observations within the projection framework the bayesian approach allows the uncertainty in the population parameters to be quantified and this uncertainty to be integrated within projections of population abundance managers responsible for the conservation of these populations are then afforded a more complete picture of the risk and can manage the population accordingly our model was applied to northern giant petrels but macquarie island also has a substantial population of southern giant petrels which are listed as endangered under the australian epbc categorisation the island s southern giant petrel population was also impacted by the mortality event and showed similar declines in abundance over 2010 and 2011 dpipwe unpublished considerably fewer southern giant petrels were collected as part of the ground searches for carcasses 38 compared to 692 northern giant petrel carcasses over 2010 and 2011 however this likely reflects the more pelagic foraging habits of southern giant petrels and so many more birds could have died at sea interestingly southern giant petrels also showed a delayed impact to the observed number of breeding pairs following the poisoning r alderman unpublished data a future development may be to adapt the current model for application to the southern giant petrel to estimate total mortality and impacts upon that species this mortality event also had potential ramifications beyond macquarie island although robust contemporary data are lacking for many northern giant petrel populations macquarie island represents an estimated 15 of the total global abundance 11 800 breeding pairs acap 2016 and there was concern that this localised mortality could impact the species as a whole our model results suggest 5 of the global breeding population was killed by the mipep and full recovery will have occurred within 10 years suggesting this population driver was not a significant global concern however another cryptic impact of the non target poisoning became apparent when researchers recovered four male deceased northern giant petrels from enderby and auckland islands in august 2010 dpipwe unpublished data one individual was banded and therefore known to have originated from the macquarie island population upon request liver samples were collected and analysed with all four individuals found to contain traces of brodifacoum poison dpipwe unpublished this suggests all birds either originated from macquarie island or had been present on the island recently and consumed carcasses while we cannot confidently attribute the death of these birds to poisoning the low likelihood that researchers were present on these uninhabited islands at the time and also happened to discover and report a bird banded on macquarie island suggests that the dispersal and subsequent mortality of poisoned individuals was likely substantial this is supported by our model results which estimated 1 400 individuals were killed over the two years which is substantially more than the 692 found on the island the important implication of this observation is that some of the poison broadcast on macquarie island made its way to other islands the scale at which this occurred and the impacts upon other wildlife and ecosystems are not known in the second season of baiting 2011 there were substantial efforts to recover and remove carcasses before the poison could enter the food chain springer 2016 and this would have served to reduce the likelihood of brodifacoum poison spreading to other islands while the potential for the mipep to introduce poison to other island ecosystems had not been explicitly identified the likelihood of non target mortality affecting native species on the island had certainly been foreshadowed parks and wildlife service 2009a the anticipated impacts of poisoning were believed to be low or medium for giant petrels at macquarie island with little potential for significant impact to species at a population scale parks and wildlife service 2009a it is difficult to evaluate this assessment because what constituted significant impact was not clearly defined in the short term arguably a reduction in breeding population of 33 is significant however because the underlying population increase resumed despite the population perturbation in the medium term our model suggests this assessment was correct it is notable that if the eradication had gone as planned i e the comprehensive baiting regime was achieved in 2010 there would not have been the opportunity to re evaluate risk and initiate effective mitigation measures before continuing in 2011 as a consequence the impact of non target poisoning on the macquarie island northern giant petrel population may have been much greater every island eradication will be unique in terms of operational methods required to achieve eradication the target species and their behaviour and the communities interactions and vulnerabilities of non target species for example the recent successful eradication of rats from south georgia using similar aerial baiting methods resulted in very little northern giant petrel mortality despite the island supporting a substantial population of this species black et al 2017 the aim of this paper therefore is not to describe specific operational lessons and provide recommendations rather the aim is to show how a population model can be used to gain insights into the magnitude of impact and likely trajectory of a population affected by a sudden mortality event in addition this study exemplifies the need to ensure adequate pre and post eradication monitoring 5 conclusion assessing the population impacts of mortality events whether a single mass mortality event or ongoing additional mortality is an important consideration for managers of natural resources relatively simple models such as that presented here can be used both before and after a mass mortality event to inform decision makers prior to the event the model can be used to anticipate likely population impacts if estimates of mortality can be quantified or provided in a scenario testing framework after the event if adequate data exist estimates of mortality and recovery times can be predicted for the study population of macquarie island northern giant petrels we were able to estimate the total mortality of birds and provide estimates of population recovery that match observations well in this case the population appears to have buffered the mortality and is on the way to recovering to pre poisoning levels model results such as these can assist managers with conservation planning for both currently impacted populations and future eradications at other islands

25128,pest eradication conducted over the years 2010 to 2014 at macquarie island successfully eradicated introduced rabbits rats and mice from this sub antarctic island the initial aerial baiting phase in the winters of 2010 and 2011 resulted in significant mortality of several native seabird species through primary and secondary ingestion of brodifacoum bait a species of key concern is the northern giant petrel macronectes halli which although relatively abundant and increasing on macquarie island is listed as threatened under australian legislation and was one of the species most affected by poisoning we use a bayesian approach to estimate the total mortality and the response of the population to the poisoning event over the short to medium term we then considered how population abundance might respond over the ensuing years projections of population trajectories suggest a greater than 50 probability of recovery to the pre poisoning levels of 2009 breeding pairs by 2017 this modelling approach could be applied to future planned eradications to quantify the mortality and recovery of incidentally affected populations keywords macronectes halli non target poisoning recovery time population response bayesian model 1 introduction macquarie island 54 30 s 158 57 e is a world heritage site located approximately 1500 km south east of tasmania australia fig 1 the island is uninhabited except for a permanent research base it is under tasmanian state jurisdiction and is recognised for its wildlife including numerous populations of seabirds and marine mammals parks and wildlife service 2006 rats and mice flourished on the island soon after their inadvertent introduction from european ships in the early 1800 s and rabbits were introduced on the island as a food source for sealers around 1870 terauds et al 2014 the increasingly destructive impact of rabbits on the native vegetation scott and kirkpatrick 2013 and the consequent impacts on seabird nesting habitat combined with direct predation by rodents of burrowing seabird eggs and chicks e g brothers and bone 2008 led to a joint tasmanian and australian government program the macquarie island pest eradication project mipep at 12 785 ha this was to be the largest eradication program for rabbits rats and mice attempted anywhere in the world at the time parks and wildlife service 2014 the operational phase of the mipep commenced in june 2010 and was declared successful in april 2014 springer 2016 describes the full technical and chronological account of the mipep implementation the initial helicopter aerial baiting phase in which brodifacoum poison was to be spread across the island via two whole of island bait drops was specifically timed for the austral winter when the majority of the islands wildlife had departed to minimise non target impacts parks and wildlife service 2009a b a delayed arrival to the island coupled with sustained inclement weather resulted in limited flying opportunities in 2010 only a small proportion of the island 8 had been baited by the end of june 2010 and a decision was made to suspend activity until the following winter parks and wildlife service 2014 in the months that followed large numbers of native seabirds including kelp gulls larus dominicus black duck anas superciliosa subantarctic skua catharacta skua northern giant petrel macronectes halli and southern giant petrel m giganteus were reported as killed depending upon species poisoning occurred through direct ingestion of toxic baits and or in the case of scavenging species through secondary ingestion by feeding on toxic rabbit and seabird carcasses giant petrels are scavengers and thus it took a period of weeks to months depending upon the composition of individual birds diet before lethal doses of brodifacoum accumulated in their systems as both giant petrel species are listed as threatened under the australian environmental protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 epbc act the mortality associated with the 2010 secondary poisoning was considered a matter of national environmental significance and triggered a review of the eradication by the australian commonwealth government anon 2010 given the clear ecosystem benefits of a successful eradication to the island the review recommended that the eradication proceed with additional measures aimed at reducing the volume of toxic carcasses available to scavenging seabirds the principal mitigation measure was the introduction of rabbit calici virus rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in the summer months to reduce the rabbit numbers on the island prior to baiting cooke et al 2017 this measure was extremely effective and was estimated to have reduced the rabbit numbers by 80 90 parks and wildlife service 2014 prior to the second attempt at aerial baiting a second mitigation measure was the allocation of additional staff time to conduct thorough ground searches and dispose of poisoned target and non target carcasses before they could be ingested by scavenging seabirds the second season of baiting occurred throughout may and june of 2011 over may to november 2011 ground teams recovered approximately 1 450 individual dead birds this represented an approximately 50 increase in documented non target native seabird mortality compared to the previous baiting attempt in 2010 n 960 it should however be noted that significantly more poison bait was broadcast in 2011 with 100 of target bait volume delivered compared to 5 in 2010 in addition there was increased search effort dedicated to locating and estimating non target mortality in 2011 so estimates for that year are more reliable whereas the number killed in 2010 is likely underestimated the baiting was followed by an on ground hunting phase during which teams of hunters and specifically trained dogs conducted comprehensive ground searches for any remaining rabbits and rodents the ground team found the last rabbit in november 2011 and the tasmanian government declared the island free of rabbits and rodents in april 2014 parks and wildlife service 2014 the vegetation has been recovering ever since whinham and alderman 2016 despite the mitigating actions the combined observed non target mortality across the two baiting periods was substantial for several native seabird species particularly for kelp gulls northern giant petrels and skuas observed mortalities of 989 692 and 512 respectively across the two winters noting that the observed mortalities are minima as many birds will have died at sea or been otherwise undetected by ground personnel while the true scale of the mass mortality event is unknown it is likely to have been detrimental to many of the affected seabird populations here we focus on estimating the scale and impact of this mortality event on one of the most affected species the northern giant petrel given the conservation status of the species vulnerable and rare under commonwealth and state legislation respectively and the global significance of this population with an estimated 1 500 1 800 annual breeding pairs prior to the mortality event representing approximately 15 of the global population the large number of individuals killed was of concern both nationally and internationally acap 2016 phillips et al 2016 single or rare mass mortality events have been documented for fish seabirds and other wildlife occurring as a result of both human activities and as natural events these have included mortality due to algal blooms fire flood sea ice expansion changes in ocean conditions pollution and poisoning winters et al 1986 baduini et al 2001 lyon and o connor 2008 richlen et al 2010 if the species impacted by a mass mortality event has threatened population status either before or potentially after the event or some commercial value then an assessment of their post event status and projected recovery time may be valuable for the responsible managers for example punt and wade 2012 considered the consequences of a catastrophic mortality event on population abundance for the eastern north pacific stock of gray whales over the years 1999 2000 this population experienced an unusually large number of strandings of emaciated adult whales and a marked reduction in calf production possibly due to heavy ice cover in those years punt and wade 2012 explicitly included an additional mortality parameter in a population model for this population to account for the mass mortality event and applied a bayesian approach to parameter estimation to predict stock status relative to management reference points assessments of seabird population status have largely been driven by the need to understand the impacts of additional anthropogenic mortality through bycatch associated with industrial scale fishing industrial fishing by longline and trawl gear has been implicated in numerous seabird population declines e g weimerskirch et al 1997 gales 1998 phillips et al 2006 tuck et al 2011 assessments of bycatch often assume that annual fishing mortality is a function of fishing effort numbers of hooks set or trawl hours and as such is an ongoing mortality source rather than a single event tuck et al 2001 2015 zador et al 2008 robinson et al 2015 thomson et al 2015 for example zador et al 2008 consider the impacts of the alaskan trawl fishery on the endangered short tailed albatross phoebastria albatrus and provide probabilities of achieving management goals such as population recovery according to assumptions regarding future fishing activity and uncertainty in growth rates following zador et al 2008 we use a bayesian approach to quantify parameter uncertainty the advantage of quantifying uncertainty in this manner and providing probabilistic decision tables for managers is that a more honest and informed assessment of the uncertainty inherent in the biological and management systems is provided thereby allowing managers the opportunity to debate potential risk trade offs and learn more about their system zador et al 2008 bunnefeld et al 2011 robinson et al 2015 we use a bayesian approach to estimate the population consequences of the major mortality event on the macquarie island population of northern giant petrels that occurred over 2010 and 2011 the true scale of the mortality is not known as observations of mortality are minima therefore our objectives were to 1 use known or inferred population parameters and observations of annual breeding pairs within a population model that can predict a time series of population size 2 estimate a probability distribution for the magnitude of mortality as a consequence of the non target poisoning and 3 evaluate the most likely future population trajectories to inform conservation management decisions we show how a model like this can be used to evaluate the potential scale and impacts of mortality events such as island pest eradications that may result in secondary mortality of threatened species both prior to and after the event this can assist managers in decisions regarding threatened status and recovery planning 2 material and methods 2 1 population monitoring northern giant petrels nest singly or in small loose groups on most coastal areas of macquarie island a small number breed inland including on ridgelines and headlands and occasionally on the highland plateau egg laying commences in mid august and chicks fledge throughout february giant petrel populations on macquarie island have been studied sporadically since the 1950s these studies have mostly focused on banding individuals to investigate distribution at sea with occasional population estimates reported many of which are of unknown accuracy e g downes et al 1954 johnstone 1974 woehler and johnstone 1988 a consistent monitoring program for this species was established in the 1994 95 breeding season here after referred to by the year of egg laying i e 1994 a long term study area on the north west coastal terraces representing 25 of the total annual breeding population has been monitored in most years thorough ground searches of this study area are conducted during the first two weeks of september to estimate the total number of breeding pairs nest locations are recorded with a handheld gps unit accurate to 10 m and revisited in january to count and band pre fledging chicks and estimate annual breeding success comparable estimates of breeding pairs and breeding success for this study area have been obtained in all seasons between 1994 and 2014 inclusive with the exception of 1999 2004 and 2006 and two earlier estimates of breeding pairs in the study area are also available 1976 and 1979 whole of island censuses of breeding pairs have been undertaken less frequently with nine estimates available between 1996 and 2014 both before and after the mass mortality events of 2010 and 2011 very high correlation between the whole of island numbers and the sample population r 0 985 t3 10 04 p 0 002 confirm that the study area is representative of island trends while there has been a consistent program of banding pre fledging chicks there has been limited and inconsistent band re resighting of breeding adults therefore we do not obtain our survival estimates or breeding frequency estimates from in situ data but they do inform age at first breeding and age of first return to the colony through prior distributions bait drops commenced on the 5th june 2010 and 4th may 2011 and in both years were completed by the end of june the first non target mortalities were detected within the first few weeks of the commencement of baiting and continued to be detected into october however the majority of mortalities 90 had been detected by the commencement of the laying period i e the first week of september 2 2 analytic framework we develop an age and sex structured population model of northern giant petrels values for those parameters not estimated by fitting the model to the data were chosen either directly from macquarie island northern giant petrel datasets or if not available from other published studies on populations of this species or similarly sized annual breeding procellariforms see table 1 the macquarie island population was increasing in size prior to the poisoning event with increases attributed to an increase in food availability similar to other populations of northern giant petrel gonzalez solis et al 2000 patterson et al 2008 this increase in population size was exponential and meant that initial models that included density dependence were not able to estimate density related parameters well the population is thus assumed to grow independent of density during the period of interest this is a reasonable assumption as the main model objectives are to estimate the mortality rate due to secondary poisoning and consider the short term post poisoning recovery dynamics of the population fishing mortality from incidental bycatch has been recorded for giant petrels gandini and frere 2006 and banding data confirm that the macquarie island populations of giant petrels are vulnerable to fisheries related mortality trebilco et al 2008 small scale tracking studies have provided some insight into the at sea distribution for these populations and have demonstrated that considerable time is spent foraging in the australian exclusive economic zone surrounding macquarie island and in ccamlr commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources waters trebilco et al 2008 however because commercial fisheries in both of these key areas are tightly regulated and bycatch of this species is consequently negligible we do not consider fishing mortality to be substantial enough for inclusion in a model likewise some studies have shown that giant petrels can benefit from the discards of fishing vessels copello and quintana 2009 however these interactions are not considered here because regulations require nil discards around macquarie island the initial numbers of birds of each sex of age a 1 in

poisoning in 2010 table 2 following the poisoning events the number of breeding pairs declined to 386 in 2011 and has since slowly increased the accuracy of the annual breeding pair survey depends upon a range of factors including timing number of person days dedicated to the survey experience of the personnel and weather conditions to capture this uncertainty a relative qualitative score based upon expert knowledge was assigned based on the above factors with the most reliable estimates having an observation error equal to the estimated error σ ˆ 1 σ ˆ those estimates with intermediate

based on the metropolis hastings algorithm gelman and rubin 1992 gelman et al 2004 haddon 2011 were used to construct posterior distributions for the four parameters so as to characterize their uncertainty the mcmc sampling process was started at the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters which were found using the optimx function within r nash and varadhan 2011 r core team 2016 samples from the posterior distributions for the four parameters were used to develop a posterior distribution for other model outcomes such as the predicted time series of breeding pairs across the years independent uniform priors across the full range of positive values for each parameter were assumed for each parameter table 1 three chains were each begun using the maximum likelihood estimates as the starting parameter set they were run for 1 000 000 iterations each with values accepted every 50 iterations the thinning rate the results from the first 2000 stored iterations from each chain were ignored as a burn in the posterior marginal distributions were constructed by combining results from all three chains resulting in 54 000 parameter vectors an evaluation of the performance of the model to mimic the available data was conducted using posterior predictive checks gelman et al 2004 for a data point during year y this involved sampling a set of 1 000 parameter vectors each consisting of values for the four parameters from the posterior distribution at random and computing the number of breeding pairs during year y then for each of the numbers of breeding pairs adding observation error based on the value for σ with associated relative uncertainty for the parameter vector concerned to generate a distribution for the data point in year y accounting for both parameter and observation uncertainty 3 results the marginal posterior distributions for the four estimated parameters showed that the data substantially updated the uniform priors with the posterior modes well determined for each of the parameters fig 2 table 3 the three chains overlap considerably indicating support for the conclusion that the mcmc sampling process has converged to the posterior distribution the correlation plots fig 3 show a strong positive correlation between the initial number of age 1 birds and juvenile mortality this is not surprising as the greater the initial population the greater the juvenile mortality that is needed to balance and match the annual breeding pair observations table 2 there is also a negative correlation between the initial numbers of age 1 birds and the poisoning mortality rate parameter k this is because the rate of mortality that is needed to produce the same approximate magnitude of kill can be smaller if the population size at the time of the poisoning is larger posterior predictive distributions fig 4 are used to check whether the model is consistent with the data by generating replicate unobserved data that can be compared with actual observations these distributions capture both the uncertainty in the data and the uncertainty in the trajectory time series fig 4 differs from the posterior distributions fig 2 that describe the probability distributions of a parameter given the data observations the distributions of fig 4 indicate that the model is consistent with the data because all but one of the 20 observations are within the 95 posterior predictive intervals for each set of breeding pair observations and corresponding observation error the posterior for the time trajectory of the number of breeding pairs based upon 54 000 parameter vectors from the posterior distribution fig 5 illustrates the relative confidence in the estimate of the time series of breeding pairs and the varying widths of the credibility intervals reflect the availability of data points widest when there are few data and into the future the consequence of the secondary poisoning events in 2010 and 2011 on the number of breeding pairs is clearly evident resulting in a median decline in breeding pairs of approximately 120 the model predicts an immediate decline in breeding pairs due to the poisoning that occurred in 2010 however this is not evident in the observations which exhibit a one year delay prior to a decline table 2 following the poisoning observations of breeding pair numbers stabilised before showing a marked increase in 2015 and 2016 these observations correspond very well to the model predicted median number of breeding pairs over this period the mean is not shown as it is very similar to the median the posterior distribution of the number of males and females killed from the study population over both 2010 and 2011 shows a broad distribution for males and a much narrower distribution for females fig 6 a table 3 this reflects the relative availability to poisoning of the sexes with females being less available than males due to being at sea for longer periods of time during the winters when poisoning occurred furthermore using the base model predictions of 262 posterior median males 95 credibility intervals 121 406 and 92 posterior median females 95 credibility intervals 41 145 killed from within the sample population and extrapolating up to the total population plausible estimates suggests up to 1 400 birds were killed across the two years the time for the population to recover to the pre poisoning number of breeding pairs in 2009 is quantified by the cumulative probability distribution of recovery times the predicted year with a 50 probability of recovery of breeding pairs to levels at or beyond pre poisoning is approximately 2017 and a 95 probability of recovery by 2021 fig 6b a retrospective of the model fits that sequentially remove annual breeding pair values from the full data set the base case with data to 2016 back to 2011 the final year of the poisoning shows that the median trajectory of breeding pairs is relatively consistent with the observations fig 7 even the fit to breeding pair data that excluded breeding pair observations after 2011 shows a remarkably good fit to the more recent breeding pair values this analysis provides confidence in the model s predictive ability and shows no concerning retrospective patterns that may reflect any mis specification in the model s design e g hurtado ferro et al 2015 model results were not overly sensitive to the value of adult mortality table 3 the signal in the breeding pair observations tends to constrain variation in parameters and any change in adult mortality is compensated by a change in juvenile mortality as a consequence the number of estimated birds killed and recovery times do not vary greatly among values for adult natural mortality table 3 similarly alternative values for the proportion breeding and proportion of females available to poisoning while key unknowns for the population changed the posteriors for the numbers killed between males and females but did not alter the estimated year at 50 probability of recovery 2017 4 discussion a primary motivation for developing this model was to quantify the impact of the macquarie island pest eradication project operations on the status and trends of the islands northern giant petrel population our analyses suggest that the mass mortality resulting from secondary poisoning during the baiting operations in 2010 and 2011 had a considerable immediate impact killing up to 1 400 individuals over two years resulting in a decline in breeding pairs by approximately 33 posterior median 95 credibility interval 29 37 however the population is estimated to have a high probability of recovering to pre poisoning levels over the ensuing 10 years fig 6b given this result which is conditional on the model structure and parameters applied there is no strong evidence for increasing the conservation status of macquarie island s northern giant petrels which was a valid concern at the time anon 2010 post eradication monitoring to document ecosystem responses to mipep was not specifically funded parks and wildlife service 2009b this is a situation common to many island eradications jones et al 2016 instead the mipep was largely reliant upon the continuation of existing monitoring programs that may not have been specifically designed to address questions around post eradication response in addition the continuation of these programs may have been uncertain as they themselves depended upon ongoing resourcing and logistic support for example in 2016 the commonwealth government announced it would close the permanent research station on macquarie island http www antarctica gov au news 2016 change in operations on macquarie island while that decision has since been reversed it was entirely plausible that our understanding of giant petrel population responses to the mortality event in the short to medium term would rely on ex situ modelling approaches fortunately however continued field observations of breeding pairs post baiting were available to validate the model in general the annual breeding population abundance estimated by the model matches the field observations reasonably well however of note is the apparent delay in the decline of observed breeding pairs following the initial year of poisoning in 2010 despite the initial confirmed mortality event the observed number of breeding pairs in the study site was 525 this represented an increase over the previous breeding season 2009 and maintained the increasing population trajectory observed since 1995 table 2 it was not until after the second winter baiting regime in 2011 that a decline in breeding pairs was observed we are confident this effect was not due to timing of the surveys since 90 of bird mortalities had been detected by early september 2010 which is the start of the incubation period and when counts of breeding pairs were made it is also possible that this apparent delay may simply be a result of observation error in the measure of breeding pairs however this is considered unlikely since search effort was higher during the mipep years as there were additional personnel on the island for the eradication thus these estimates are among the most accurate of the time series dpipwe unpublished a plausible scenario for the continued increase in the breeding population after the initial poisoning in 2010 is that the mortality event served to reduce intra specific breeding competition due to the disruption to established breeding pair bonds and more male birds being killed than females the population may have experienced compensatory recruitment with younger birds particularly males having an increased opportunity to partner with newly widowed birds and enter the breeding population e g muths et al 2011 alternatively established breeding birds that would normally have undertaken a sabbatical were able to breed due to reduced competition for resources e g reynolds et al 2017 ryan et al 2006 disentangling these scenarios requires finer scale analyses of the age structure of the breeding population from known age banded birds and such data are not available at this time further refinements to the population dynamics model could consider these suggested mechanisms for the population to buffer and absorb the additional mortality however this is unlikely to greatly change conclusions regarding recovery times which have been shown to match the observations well in the current model formulation fig 5 the bayesian modelling approach taken here explicitly accounts for parameter uncertainty this differs from other models that have dealt with single mass mortality events for example due to the complexity of the macquarie island ecosystem raymond et al 2011 use a qualitative simulation approach to explore the likely outcomes from the macquarie island pest eradication giant petrels were not a focus of their model and predictions did not match observations for this community finkelstein et al 2010 use a stochastic simulation approach to consider the impacts on short tailed albatross phoebastria albatrus of sudden catastrophic volcanism and more chronic threats such as fishery bycatch their model also does not fit to census data unlike zador et al 2008 but instead selects from alternative sets of demographic parameter values in order to match the observed high growth rate in these examples the approaches taken may be suitable to answer broader ecosystem questions in the first instance and deal with a data poor situation in the latter by contrast our model has focussed specifically on the macquarie island population of northern giant petrels using wherever possible data from this population fitting to historical census data and capturing the uncertainty in these observations within the projection framework the bayesian approach allows the uncertainty in the population parameters to be quantified and this uncertainty to be integrated within projections of population abundance managers responsible for the conservation of these populations are then afforded a more complete picture of the risk and can manage the population accordingly our model was applied to northern giant petrels but macquarie island also has a substantial population of southern giant petrels which are listed as endangered under the australian epbc categorisation the island s southern giant petrel population was also impacted by the mortality event and showed similar declines in abundance over 2010 and 2011 dpipwe unpublished considerably fewer southern giant petrels were collected as part of the ground searches for carcasses 38 compared to 692 northern giant petrel carcasses over 2010 and 2011 however this likely reflects the more pelagic foraging habits of southern giant petrels and so many more birds could have died at sea interestingly southern giant petrels also showed a delayed impact to the observed number of breeding pairs following the poisoning r alderman unpublished data a future development may be to adapt the current model for application to the southern giant petrel to estimate total mortality and impacts upon that species this mortality event also had potential ramifications beyond macquarie island although robust contemporary data are lacking for many northern giant petrel populations macquarie island represents an estimated 15 of the total global abundance 11 800 breeding pairs acap 2016 and there was concern that this localised mortality could impact the species as a whole our model results suggest 5 of the global breeding population was killed by the mipep and full recovery will have occurred within 10 years suggesting this population driver was not a significant global concern however another cryptic impact of the non target poisoning became apparent when researchers recovered four male deceased northern giant petrels from enderby and auckland islands in august 2010 dpipwe unpublished data one individual was banded and therefore known to have originated from the macquarie island population upon request liver samples were collected and analysed with all four individuals found to contain traces of brodifacoum poison dpipwe unpublished this suggests all birds either originated from macquarie island or had been present on the island recently and consumed carcasses while we cannot confidently attribute the death of these birds to poisoning the low likelihood that researchers were present on these uninhabited islands at the time and also happened to discover and report a bird banded on macquarie island suggests that the dispersal and subsequent mortality of poisoned individuals was likely substantial this is supported by our model results which estimated 1 400 individuals were killed over the two years which is substantially more than the 692 found on the island the important implication of this observation is that some of the poison broadcast on macquarie island made its way to other islands the scale at which this occurred and the impacts upon other wildlife and ecosystems are not known in the second season of baiting 2011 there were substantial efforts to recover and remove carcasses before the poison could enter the food chain springer 2016 and this would have served to reduce the likelihood of brodifacoum poison spreading to other islands while the potential for the mipep to introduce poison to other island ecosystems had not been explicitly identified the likelihood of non target mortality affecting native species on the island had certainly been foreshadowed parks and wildlife service 2009a the anticipated impacts of poisoning were believed to be low or medium for giant petrels at macquarie island with little potential for significant impact to species at a population scale parks and wildlife service 2009a it is difficult to evaluate this assessment because what constituted significant impact was not clearly defined in the short term arguably a reduction in breeding population of 33 is significant however because the underlying population increase resumed despite the population perturbation in the medium term our model suggests this assessment was correct it is notable that if the eradication had gone as planned i e the comprehensive baiting regime was achieved in 2010 there would not have been the opportunity to re evaluate risk and initiate effective mitigation measures before continuing in 2011 as a consequence the impact of non target poisoning on the macquarie island northern giant petrel population may have been much greater every island eradication will be unique in terms of operational methods required to achieve eradication the target species and their behaviour and the communities interactions and vulnerabilities of non target species for example the recent successful eradication of rats from south georgia using similar aerial baiting methods resulted in very little northern giant petrel mortality despite the island supporting a substantial population of this species black et al 2017 the aim of this paper therefore is not to describe specific operational lessons and provide recommendations rather the aim is to show how a population model can be used to gain insights into the magnitude of impact and likely trajectory of a population affected by a sudden mortality event in addition this study exemplifies the need to ensure adequate pre and post eradication monitoring 5 conclusion assessing the population impacts of mortality events whether a single mass mortality event or ongoing additional mortality is an important consideration for managers of natural resources relatively simple models such as that presented here can be used both before and after a mass mortality event to inform decision makers prior to the event the model can be used to anticipate likely population impacts if estimates of mortality can be quantified or provided in a scenario testing framework after the event if adequate data exist estimates of mortality and recovery times can be predicted for the study population of macquarie island northern giant petrels we were able to estimate the total mortality of birds and provide estimates of population recovery that match observations well in this case the population appears to have buffered the mortality and is on the way to recovering to pre poisoning levels model results such as these can assist managers with conservation planning for both currently impacted populations and future eradications at other islands

25129,ecologists have established rich literatures on the relationship between disturbance and biodiversity yet for conservation and management purpose there is no clear mechanism understanding of how disturbance implementation e g pesticide prescribed burning or human controlled grazing mowing or flooding alters the invasion outcome and even for what conditions the established alien species could be successfully impeded here we synthetically use pair approximation equations and spatial explicit simulations to explore a two species competitive system which subject to spatial structured landscape disturbance and allow for habitat recovery after analyzing the stability of non invasion equilibrium points we find that spatial aggregation and disturbing frequency or habitat lifetime play more important roles than recovering rate when applying disturbance control measure but if keeping overall disturbance density fixed the optimal strategy should depend on both spatial and temporal factors in terms of target invasion system native community with stronger fecundity has a wider successful control region and this area is not sensitive to invaders competitive power our results highlight a critical role of spatiotemporal landscape disturbance on invasion suppression and could also give some meaningful understandings of disturbance effect on competition coexistence keywords biological invasion landscape dynamic competition coexistence pair approximation cellular automata 1 introduction since substantial economic and environmental damages species invasion has long been studied for decades cadotte et al 2006 keane and crawley 2002 lonsdale 1999 simberloff et al 2013 large body of theoretical works have explored the control management through three aspects pinpointing the main mechanism underlining successful establishment of invader theoharides and dukes 2007 determining the critical spreading drivers epanchin niell and hastings 2010 or to better target by analyzing the property of native community alien species invaded davis et al 2000 most of them were limited to emphasize species only han and yang 2019 huston 2004 such as species interacting types the way of population dispersion frequency for individual evolution and so on landscape structure on the other hand was proved essential for species coexistence and has direct or indirect impacts during various invasion stages buenau et al 2007 caplat et al 2012 patches with heterogeneous qualities decide how well the population will establish and cause different level of spatial mortalities and fecundities moilanen and hanski 1995 nee and may 1992 any landscape management events could lead to completely different invading outcomes but since disturbance usually appears as the consequence of invasion process or co occur with the presence of invasion researchers always accounted for their facilitating effect on alien species instead of suppression mechanism bradley et al 2010 kumschick et al 2015 landscape disturbance was seldom mentioned in invasion control problems garrison et al 2012 the ecological impacts of landscape disturbance are complicated which depends on multiple distinct aspects like timing intensity extent periodicity and duration miller et al 2011 roxburgh et al 2004 shea and chesson 2002 traditional theoretical and experimental works just simply focused on one of above characteristics more recently how the confounding nature of these separate regimes decide population dynamics has been more and more recognized not addressing intensity and extent only but also the effect of spatial configuration liao et al 2016 miller et al 2011 disturbance events break the connectivity of continuous habitat patches and result in a heterogeneous distribution of habitat quality this directly impact the offspring dispersal distance of target species banitz et al 2008 the importance of spatial correlation was always highlighted however temporal scale variability of disturbance should not be omitted as well klausmeier 1998 tilman et al 1994 bascompte and sole 1996 once confirmed the role of patch dynamics on population persistence garrison et al 2012 on the other hand used experimental and theoretical methods to illustrate that adjustment of temporal scale of disturbance occurrence can be regarded as a no cost manipulation strategy for conservation purpose in fact habitat quality should be altered over time it can result from numerous events like anthropogenic effects jacquemyn et al 2003 masaki 2004 forest gap formation manrubia and sole 1997 or weather condition ringsby et al 2002 in short combining both spatial and temporal variability of landscape disturbance especially when improving management efficiency is very important and necessary garrison et al 2012 hiebeler et al 2016 liao et al 2016 to obtain quantitative linkages between landscape disturbance and the long time consequence of native and invaded competitors we construct mathematic models by extending the pair approximation approach of hiebeler et al 2016 to the two species case we are possible to get deep insight of native invader species interaction process as well as how this process responds to randomly happened habitat disturbance events in fact the pair approximation model has been shown to be effective when capturing the ecological dynamic of lattice structured populations particularly for those interaction between nearby individuals on heterogenous habitat hui and li 2004 liao et al 2016 matsuda et al 1992 hiebeler et al 2016 utilized this method to investigate how a single population survive or become extinct under spatiotemporally heterogenous landscape disturbance but applying to two or multi species community should be executed with caution single species model is always built with no interspecific or intraspecific interactions both of which play a key role in species coexisting theories especially invasion process and can determine the final densities by numerical ways for another analytical analysis which usually omitted by studies of complex system dynamics is more accurate and powerful than direct computer simulation especially when examining parameter space and initial conditions pair approximation equations could even work as an approximate analytical tool for spatial lattice model webb et al 2007 yang et al 2014 here we establish the two species competition model between resident and alien species block disturbance events several continuous habitat sets being disturbed at the same time are randomly introduced for conversation goals then we provide bifurcation analyses for critical parameters to understand their independent and joint impact on equilibrium densities finally stochastic simulations are implemented under the obtained parameter region by doing so we mainly assess the following two questions 1 whether introduced landscape disturbance can be used as the conservation purpose if so 2 what is the efficient condition area for successful eradicating invaded population 2 method 2 1 pair approximation model our pair wised competition model is constructed as a spatial discrete and time continuous process the spreading of native and alien species happens on a two dimensional regular lattice which is assumed infinitely large and homogeneous individuals can only interact with their nearest z 4 neighbors neumann neighborhood are used here as what people usually do a system of ordinary differential equations yields global densities and pair densities for populations our whole system dynamic involves two simultaneously happened processes species dynamic and habitat disturbance alien species possess stronger competing abilities over native species which decides the sudden decreasing of ingredient populations in fact this advantage could be caused by enemy releasing elton 1958 wolfe 2002 on the other hand we involve the disturbance events under block scheme it represents the usual control management applied on a certain spatial scale habitat quality can recover at a certain rate like the implement measure pesticide this is different from previous theoretical works which usually regarded the disturbance as a long term effect namely disturbed locations were less possible to be recolonized again specifically all details are as follows 2 1 1 species dynamic there are two species native species 1 and alien species 2 number 0 represents empty site individuals of species i die at a constant rate m i i 1 2 hiebeler et al 2016 offspring could be sent to their empty neighbor sites but fail to survive there if the site already occupied by other individuals parameters α i i and α i j indicate the extra death caused by intra and inter specific interactions positive and negative sign of these two parameters correspond to competition and mutualism zeros mean no interaction happened since invader species 2 with a competitive advantage we set α 21 α 12 transition rules of these interaction processes are illustrated in fig 1 2 1 2 habitat disturbance we divide the lattice sites into two types of state undisturbed suitable s and disturbed u suitable site is either empty or colonized by propagules from both species 1 and 2 individuals cannot survive on the disturbed cells when implementing habitat disturbance as hiebeler et al 2016 did b b sites will be randomly chosen to become unsuitable any occupied sites within this block are turned into empty and unsuitable this disturbing event happens at rate r s u b 2 so that we can ensure the per site disturbing rate to be a constant r s u pair s s will be disturbed at the rate of r s u 1 1 b this quality comes from the sum rate over all the locations where disturbance could affect one or both cells in a pair but for u s 0 1 2 s since the pair neighbor has already been unsuitable its disturbing probability is r s u here we allow the unsuitable sites to recover they independently become suitable empty sites at rate r u s together with r s u and r u s the temporal autocorrelation of disturbance for a given site is possible to be quantified the block size b on the other hand represents the degree of spatial autocorrelation we express the habitat disturbance events as a simple equation system given in appendix a to analyze the system under a fixed total disturbance intensity we always introduce the landscape distance as the equilibrium state p s all the parameters are explained as table1 2 1 3 mathematical equations for system dynamics let p i be the total density of cells in state i and p i j gives the possibility of choosing a random pair under state ij where i j 0 1 2 u they are respectively called global and pair densities since most events happened within the local distance we also need conditional probabilities q i j i j 0 1 2 u which defined as the probability of randomly chosen neighbor of the central cell j is in state i by this definition the pair densities could be produced by global and conditional densities as p i j p j i p i q j i p j q i j for probability rules i 0 1 2 u p i 1 and i j 0 1 2 u p i j p i the total 14 variable of state are turned down to 9 independent variables since p s p 0 p 1 p 2 and p n are always set as their equilibrium points p s p n we finally have 7 independent variables here our chosen 7 state transfer equations are as following 1 p 1 r 1 p 1 q 0 1 m 1 r s u p 1 α 21 p 1 q 2 1 α 11 p 1 q 1 1 2 p 2 r 2 p 2 q 0 2 m 2 r s u p 2 α 12 p 2 q 1 2 α 22 p 2 q 2 2 3 p 11 2 r 1

birth intrinsic death competition including intra and inter specific competition and disturbance fig 1 1 5 the appearing of number 2 among eq 3 is because the symmetry in the interaction between sites like p σ σ σ σ p σ σ σ σ but as for the other equations like p σ σ p σ σ σ σ p σ σ σ σ and p σ σ p σ σ as well then the 2 will be eliminated so that equations for p σ σ do not have the number 2 for each pair i j we assume the right side cell is always under transaction specifically for the empty cell of pair i 0 i 1 2 offspring for the transacting cell 0 can be both from the pair species i and its nearby individuals while in the case of 0 0 or u 0 central empty cell is only filled with neighbor occupied species therefore the birth rate of i 0 0 0 and u 0 respectively are r i θ 1 θ q i i 0 r i 1 θ q i 00 and r i 1 θ q i u 0 fig 1 3 in terms of competition process transiting individual i in pair i i j i 0 i and u i surfers the mortality risk from intraspecific and interspecific competitors similar to birth process their transaction probability also depended on the pair structure fig 1 4 5 our differential equation system is not closed because of triplet densities q k i j i j k 0 1 2 u they could be obtained by p i j k q k i j p i j but if so some new higher dimensional block densities the quadruplet structure will occur as well to arrive at a close system we use the simple standard pair approximation q k i j q k j assuming species correlation on the lattice decreases quickly with their distance sato et al 1994 webb et al 2007 on some degree the metric q i j and q i i represent the frequency of species i contacting with species j and their own population individuals matsuda et al 1992 yang et al 2014 and conditional density q u u measures how unsuitable sites spatially clustered if p u q u u 0 unsuitable sites are clustering immerged while p u q u u 0 means separated distribution p u q u u 0 corresponds to random configuration 2 2 simulation verifications are made by comparing with spatially explicit simulation results we assume a two dimensional landscape with a limited size 300 300 and periodic boundary condition in order to see how the disturbance control measure reverse invasion tendency species interaction processes are first set to happen the disturbance controlling measure will not be released until 2 3 native population density has been eradicated on the other hand since the total degree of structured landscape disturbance is fixed as p s and p u we initially run habitat dynamic to their equilibrium state and then implement the disturbing points under this generated configuration our simulation is running 50 repeats for each combination value of parameters the method to take equilibrium density is after 10000 steps we record values every 100 steps if more than three recorded densities remain almost the same the values between these records are all regarded as in the equilibrium state yang et al 2014 3 result since our mainly focus is whether introduced landscape disturbance could reverse the already happened population invasion we just considered the invader zero equilibrium point p 0 p 1 p 2 p u p 0 p 1 0 r s u r u s r s u and did some stability analysis referred to the appendix b the results were illustrated in fig 2 3 1 disturbance management effect from the second panel of fig 2 we knew that in general non zero equilibrium density for native species 1 could be reached under the r s u range of 0 0 5 too frequent disturbing events caused extra death of both native and invasion species however in terms of stability condition first panel of fig 2 some regions like r s u 0 1 and 0 2 r s u 0 3 former none zero equilibrium points were not locally stable native species still had the risk of re invasion therefore we combined these two conditions and obtained the successful controlling parameter conditions green area in the third panel in addition disturbance duration played minor roles among controlling process only those managements with extremely longer recovery time or even permanent destruction v e r y s m a l l r u s o r r u s 0 failed to eradicate invaders above patterns could be attributed to the dynamic of site distribution on lattice fig 3 illustrated how equilibrium conditional density q u 1 a n d q 0 1 depended on our parameters as we seen the areas 0 3 q 0 1 0 72 and 0 2 q 0 1 q u 1 1 5 q 0 1 were the same with the successful controlling area in fig 2 in fact they did have some connections we fixed r u s and increased r s u as an example to see what happened in region 1 of fig 3 extremely small disturbance rate r s u was too weak to wipe invader individuals so that q u 1 a n d q 0 1 being both small invader species still mostly surrounded native species they had the competition advantage and the outcome could not be varied as r s u increased to region 2 disturbance had produced enough empty space for native species to birth and defense invader were suppressed in the end but for region 3 although q 0 1 was increased more the generated q u 1 remained small this situation allowed alien species to be possible to emerge nearby native individuals again then the non zero native population density was locally unstable in region 4 bigger disturbing rate r s u caused more unsuitable sites species 1 was mostly surrounded by u sites which in some degree protected native population from competition with alien species it is why invasion was stopped in this case eventually for overfast disturbing frequency region 5 since the majority proportion of landscape has been destroyed already there were too big conditional probability q u 1 it made residents fail to birth and survive themselves in this case both species went extinction to illustrate the interaction influence between spatial configuration extent spatial aggregation and time scale parameters disturbance frequency and duration let r s u m r u s resulting p u r s u r u s r s u m 1 m if reflected on r u s r s u phase diagram it was a line away from the zero point third panel of fig 2 then the disturbance extent p u totally depended on single parameter m p u q u u p u 1 q s u p u 1 p s p s s p u 1 m m 1 1 2 b m 2 indicated the spatial autocorrelation of adjacent unsuitable cells for a given time step when m fixed this metrics was a monotonic increasing function of b r u s r s u on the other hand decided the updating speed of unsuitable sites since control measures were time and money costing ecologists always hope managements being limited cost suggested relatively small total extent hence here we fixed m on four levels m 0 15 0 25 0 45 1 third panel of fig 2 and investigated how spatial configuration and time scale worked together for final consequence these four lines corresponded to four columns of fig 4 each diagram represented a b vs r u s spatial correlation and disturbance time duration phase given small extent m 0 15 p u 0 13 successful control region located at the top right corner that is when utilizing low cost disturbance management to control invading species we should simultaneously keep higher spatial correlation enough disturbed block size b and faster updating rate for slightly bigger m 0 25 p u 0 2 green area moved to the middle position too fast or slow disturbance recovering rate failed to wipe spreading tendency of invader under medium m 0 45 p u 0 3 patterns became more complicated where emerged two separate green areas the half percent intensity m 1 p u 0 5 led green area to be much lower position and thinner in general disturbance more spatially clustered and with enough updating rate was more effective to impede invader s thriving fig 5 presented the spatial dynamics under above successful combined parameter criteria initially species 2 had competition advantage and spread in patches when 2 3 native population density has been eradicated t 1209 a certain intensity of disturbance was released individuals on the lattice began to randomly vanish and some new empty sites reemerged which provided enough space for residents surviving clumping species 2 were gradually driven to be more randomly distributed part of unsuitable patches also blocked interactions between native and species individuals in this way endangered populations gained increasing possibility and when t 4000 their density returned to be dominant 3 2 properties of invasion species we further considered the other parameters like invader competition level and native species resistibility survival rate on empty lattice cells which well stand for the properties of invasion species and are very important during biological invasion dynamics we set α 12 0 1 a n d α 21 f α 12 then f 1 suggested higher competitive power over native species birth rate r 1 and r 2 had a certain connection r 1 0 1 0 4 0 7 1 r 2 0 8 r 1 this usually depended on the environmental factors strong birth rate represented those r selection communities where populations having better quality of offspring to survive in hostile environment instead small birth rate corresponded to k selection communities whose population densities close to carrying capacity when putting our result pattern under several combinations of f r 1 fig 6 we found that the control measure by introducing landscape disturbance was effective for both low and high competing invaders this kind of management did not rely on target invader s harmful degree the competitiveness here but on the other hand controlling outcome varied a lot among community types there was a wider successful range of parameter values for more r selection communities and high frequent disturbance events could not gain stable depression of alien species for k selection style community 4 discussion here we extend the pair approximation model of hiebeler et al 2016 to a two species invading system and analytically explore the long term outcomes when habitat disturbance included by doing so we want to get a deeper basic understanding of connections between disturbance and invader species declining especially for the two species competition system our results suggest that spatiotemporal landscape disturbance could reverse competing invaders and recover native populations but it depends on both management related parameters and metapopulation life history first we find that the success of controlling measures is completely decided by the balance of empty sites and unsuitable sites left for native species and even subject to how those two kinds of sites finally arranged on the lattice disturbance events with small scale of blocks or less frequency small values of b or r s u cannot provide indigenous population with enough empty breeding zones so that invasion process could not be stopped this quite agree with many previous studies bascompte and sole 1996 keymer et al 2000 nee and may 1992 tilman et al 1994 although disturbance with medium periodicity r s u has generated more empty space and hence keep a non zero native population in the end there still exists part of this value range like region3 of fig 3 which has the possibility to be invaded again it is because in that case resulted abundant empty sites nearby native individuals can also give superior competitors space to recolonize nee and may 1992 once gave the same explanation through the deterministic model a long time ago since the shortcoming of mean field work omitting spatial structure of habitat dytham 1995 and moilanen and hanski 1995 have respectively extended this model to a more realistic case they both obtained the same claim that inferior competitors are always underperformance at high clustered empty patches because of the continued presence of superior competitor at last we show that too fast habitat destruction rate r s u must fail to eradicate alien species parameter r s u suggests the expected lifetime of one habitat site too bigger r s u means nonsufficient surviving time for individuals between two sequential disturbing events therefore both species could go down to extinction the most common stance for people applying control measures is how to improve strategies under the same amount of money terry and gourley 2010 only changes in spatial configuration and time correlation are usually more costless and so do a slight savings garrison et al 2012 hiebeler et al 2016 therefore we exhibit the results as total disturbance density fixed our analysis shows that the implementation of weak intensity fixed on low total density of unsuitable sites or lines a of fig 2 disturbance should combine with more frequently using the measure type with high recovering rate previous works claimed shorter refractory period large r u s enhance population persistence ellner and fussmann 2003 hastings 2003 hiebeler et al 2016 johnson 2000 whereas wilcox et al 2006 indicated speeding up habitat turnover while keeping the same mean number of undestroyed patches would result in persistence decline it is also derived from natural observations by instead using synchronization of patch state johst and drechsler 2003 these different conclusions might be caused by the one species system for two species interacting case the competing outcome would be quite different besides they also did not emphasize the conclusion on intensity degree various patterns occurred along the intensity gradient in our model system when increasing the total disturbance density a little short patch lifetime large r u s cannot conserve endangered species and medium updating rate of disturbance becomes more effective this is because large recovering rate opens empty pathways between patches of native and invader species banitz et al 2008 hiebeler et al 2016 as applying half percentage disturbance density m 1 of fig 4 successful control area becomes lower and narrow position only taking control measure itself into consideration is not quite enough we should also understand the features of local community like species life history tayeh et al 2015 invader competitiveness huston 2004 and dispersal types liao et al 2016 they were often omitted by control strategies before fagan et al 2002 moller 1996 our results show that r selected community populations with strong fecundity are relatively easy to implement landscape control measure while k selected community only impose a hasher successful parameter range and seems better suits to lower frequent disturbance hiebeler et al 2016 and johst and drechsler 2003 both illustrated the similar claim that k strategy species are more adversely affected by habitat turnover rate in light of competitive discrepancy between alien and native populations we notice that invasion system of k strategy community is more easily to eradicate stronger competitive invaders while r select community does not differ the invaders competitiveness this could also be explained from the spatial configuration generated by individuals and habitat yang et al 2014 the importance of species distribution over space has been explored both in experiment and theoretical field monzeglio and stoll 2008 murrell and law 2003 takenaka et al 1997 reproduction limitation and low competition discrepancy will cause more interspecific clustering namely native and invader population mixed together disturbance caused vacant space cannot make up the negative competition effects from neighboring invaders so control measure does not work well but inversely for large competition discrepancy there are more intraspecific clumping patterns this leads habitat disturbance to be effective so far we have modeled the dynamic of two species invasion system under spatiotemporal habitat disturbance some successful control areas are obtained through equilibrium analysis and simulations these results could provide meaningful insights into the species coexistence under habitat disturbance and give suggestions about the optimum control strategy for conservation however we have only focused on the competitive invasion process when alien species enter native communities although competition for limiting resources should happen first vila and weiner 2004 some other interaction relationship like positive davies et al 2005 host parasitism mitchell and power 2003 herbivory carpenter and cappuccino 2005 apparent competition noonburg and byers 2005 wootton 1994 and even the indirect facilitation brown et al 2002 might also be assembled this depends on their relatedness to native populations mitchell et al 2006 so our theoretical work could be further extended to more kinds of invasion systems acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 31700347

25129,ecologists have established rich literatures on the relationship between disturbance and biodiversity yet for conservation and management purpose there is no clear mechanism understanding of how disturbance implementation e g pesticide prescribed burning or human controlled grazing mowing or flooding alters the invasion outcome and even for what conditions the established alien species could be successfully impeded here we synthetically use pair approximation equations and spatial explicit simulations to explore a two species competitive system which subject to spatial structured landscape disturbance and allow for habitat recovery after analyzing the stability of non invasion equilibrium points we find that spatial aggregation and disturbing frequency or habitat lifetime play more important roles than recovering rate when applying disturbance control measure but if keeping overall disturbance density fixed the optimal strategy should depend on both spatial and temporal factors in terms of target invasion system native community with stronger fecundity has a wider successful control region and this area is not sensitive to invaders competitive power our results highlight a critical role of spatiotemporal landscape disturbance on invasion suppression and could also give some meaningful understandings of disturbance effect on competition coexistence keywords biological invasion landscape dynamic competition coexistence pair approximation cellular automata 1 introduction since substantial economic and environmental damages species invasion has long been studied for decades cadotte et al 2006 keane and crawley 2002 lonsdale 1999 simberloff et al 2013 large body of theoretical works have explored the control management through three aspects pinpointing the main mechanism underlining successful establishment of invader theoharides and dukes 2007 determining the critical spreading drivers epanchin niell and hastings 2010 or to better target by analyzing the property of native community alien species invaded davis et al 2000 most of them were limited to emphasize species only han and yang 2019 huston 2004 such as species interacting types the way of population dispersion frequency for individual evolution and so on landscape structure on the other hand was proved essential for species coexistence and has direct or indirect impacts during various invasion stages buenau et al 2007 caplat et al 2012 patches with heterogeneous qualities decide how well the population will establish and cause different level of spatial mortalities and fecundities moilanen and hanski 1995 nee and may 1992 any landscape management events could lead to completely different invading outcomes but since disturbance usually appears as the consequence of invasion process or co occur with the presence of invasion researchers always accounted for their facilitating effect on alien species instead of suppression mechanism bradley et al 2010 kumschick et al 2015 landscape disturbance was seldom mentioned in invasion control problems garrison et al 2012 the ecological impacts of landscape disturbance are complicated which depends on multiple distinct aspects like timing intensity extent periodicity and duration miller et al 2011 roxburgh et al 2004 shea and chesson 2002 traditional theoretical and experimental works just simply focused on one of above characteristics more recently how the confounding nature of these separate regimes decide population dynamics has been more and more recognized not addressing intensity and extent only but also the effect of spatial configuration liao et al 2016 miller et al 2011 disturbance events break the connectivity of continuous habitat patches and result in a heterogeneous distribution of habitat quality this directly impact the offspring dispersal distance of target species banitz et al 2008 the importance of spatial correlation was always highlighted however temporal scale variability of disturbance should not be omitted as well klausmeier 1998 tilman et al 1994 bascompte and sole 1996 once confirmed the role of patch dynamics on population persistence garrison et al 2012 on the other hand used experimental and theoretical methods to illustrate that adjustment of temporal scale of disturbance occurrence can be regarded as a no cost manipulation strategy for conservation purpose in fact habitat quality should be altered over time it can result from numerous events like anthropogenic effects jacquemyn et al 2003 masaki 2004 forest gap formation manrubia and sole 1997 or weather condition ringsby et al 2002 in short combining both spatial and temporal variability of landscape disturbance especially when improving management efficiency is very important and necessary garrison et al 2012 hiebeler et al 2016 liao et al 2016 to obtain quantitative linkages between landscape disturbance and the long time consequence of native and invaded competitors we construct mathematic models by extending the pair approximation approach of hiebeler et al 2016 to the two species case we are possible to get deep insight of native invader species interaction process as well as how this process responds to randomly happened habitat disturbance events in fact the pair approximation model has been shown to be effective when capturing the ecological dynamic of lattice structured populations particularly for those interaction between nearby individuals on heterogenous habitat hui and li 2004 liao et al 2016 matsuda et al 1992 hiebeler et al 2016 utilized this method to investigate how a single population survive or become extinct under spatiotemporally heterogenous landscape disturbance but applying to two or multi species community should be executed with caution single species model is always built with no interspecific or intraspecific interactions both of which play a key role in species coexisting theories especially invasion process and can determine the final densities by numerical ways for another analytical analysis which usually omitted by studies of complex system dynamics is more accurate and powerful than direct computer simulation especially when examining parameter space and initial conditions pair approximation equations could even work as an approximate analytical tool for spatial lattice model webb et al 2007 yang et al 2014 here we establish the two species competition model between resident and alien species block disturbance events several continuous habitat sets being disturbed at the same time are randomly introduced for conversation goals then we provide bifurcation analyses for critical parameters to understand their independent and joint impact on equilibrium densities finally stochastic simulations are implemented under the obtained parameter region by doing so we mainly assess the following two questions 1 whether introduced landscape disturbance can be used as the conservation purpose if so 2 what is the efficient condition area for successful eradicating invaded population 2 method 2 1 pair approximation model our pair wised competition model is constructed as a spatial discrete and time continuous process the spreading of native and alien species happens on a two dimensional regular lattice which is assumed infinitely large and homogeneous individuals can only interact with their nearest z 4 neighbors neumann neighborhood are used here as what people usually do a system of ordinary differential equations yields global densities and pair densities for populations our whole system dynamic involves two simultaneously happened processes species dynamic and habitat disturbance alien species possess stronger competing abilities over native species which decides the sudden decreasing of ingredient populations in fact this advantage could be caused by enemy releasing elton 1958 wolfe 2002 on the other hand we involve the disturbance events under block scheme it represents the usual control management applied on a certain spatial scale habitat quality can recover at a certain rate like the implement measure pesticide this is different from previous theoretical works which usually regarded the disturbance as a long term effect namely disturbed locations were less possible to be recolonized again specifically all details are as follows 2 1 1 species dynamic there are two species native species 1 and alien species 2 number 0 represents empty site individuals of species i die at a constant rate m i i 1 2 hiebeler et al 2016 offspring could be sent to their empty neighbor sites but fail to survive there if the site already occupied by other individuals parameters α i i and α i j indicate the extra death caused by intra and inter specific interactions positive and negative sign of these two parameters correspond to competition and mutualism zeros mean no interaction happened since invader species 2 with a competitive advantage we set α 21 α 12 transition rules of these interaction processes are illustrated in fig 1 2 1 2 habitat disturbance we divide the lattice sites into two types of state undisturbed suitable s and disturbed u suitable site is either empty or colonized by propagules from both species 1 and 2 individuals cannot survive on the disturbed cells when implementing habitat disturbance as hiebeler et al 2016 did b b sites will be randomly chosen to become unsuitable any occupied sites within this block are turned into empty and unsuitable this disturbing event happens at rate r s u b 2 so that we can ensure the per site disturbing rate to be a constant r s u pair s s will be disturbed at the rate of r s u 1 1 b this quality comes from the sum rate over all the locations where disturbance could affect one or both cells in a pair but for u s 0 1 2 s since the pair neighbor has already been unsuitable its disturbing probability is r s u here we allow the unsuitable sites to recover they independently become suitable empty sites at rate r u s together with r s u and r u s the temporal autocorrelation of disturbance for a given site is possible to be quantified the block size b on the other hand represents the degree of spatial autocorrelation we express the habitat disturbance events as a simple equation system given in appendix a to analyze the system under a fixed total disturbance intensity we always introduce the landscape distance as the equilibrium state p s all the parameters are explained as table1 2 1 3 mathematical equations for system dynamics let p i be the total density of cells in state i and p i j gives the possibility of choosing a random pair under state ij where i j 0 1 2 u they are respectively called global and pair densities since most events happened within the local distance we also need conditional probabilities q i j i j 0 1 2 u which defined as the probability of randomly chosen neighbor of the central cell j is in state i by this definition the pair densities could be produced by global and conditional densities as p i j p j i p i q j i p j q i j for probability rules i 0 1 2 u p i 1 and i j 0 1 2 u p i j p i the total 14 variable of state are turned down to 9 independent variables since p s p 0 p 1 p 2 and p n are always set as their equilibrium points p s p n we finally have 7 independent variables here our chosen 7 state transfer equations are as following 1 p 1 r 1 p 1 q 0 1 m 1 r s u p 1 α 21 p 1 q 2 1 α 11 p 1 q 1 1 2 p 2 r 2 p 2 q 0 2 m 2 r s u p 2 α 12 p 2 q 1 2 α 22 p 2 q 2 2 3 p 11 2 r 1

birth intrinsic death competition including intra and inter specific competition and disturbance fig 1 1 5 the appearing of number 2 among eq 3 is because the symmetry in the interaction between sites like p σ σ σ σ p σ σ σ σ but as for the other equations like p σ σ p σ σ σ σ p σ σ σ σ and p σ σ p σ σ as well then the 2 will be eliminated so that equations for p σ σ do not have the number 2 for each pair i j we assume the right side cell is always under transaction specifically for the empty cell of pair i 0 i 1 2 offspring for the transacting cell 0 can be both from the pair species i and its nearby individuals while in the case of 0 0 or u 0 central empty cell is only filled with neighbor occupied species therefore the birth rate of i 0 0 0 and u 0 respectively are r i θ 1 θ q i i 0 r

similar to birth process their transaction probability also depended on the pair structure fig 1 4 5 our differential equation system is not closed because of triplet densities q k i j i j k 0 1 2 u they could be obtained by p i j k q k i j p i j but if so some new higher dimensional block densities the quadruplet structure will occur as well to arrive at a close system we use the simple standard pair approximation q k i j q k j assuming species correlation on the lattice decreases quickly with their distance sato et al 1994 webb et al 2007 on some degree the metric q i j and q i i represent the frequency of species i contacting with species j and their own population individuals matsuda et al 1992 yang et al 2014 and conditional density q u u measures how unsuitable sites spatially clustered if p u q u u 0 unsuitable sites are clustering immerged while p u q u u 0 means separated distribution p u q u u 0 corresponds to random configuration 2 2 simulation verifications are made by comparing with spatially explicit simulation results we assume a two dimensional landscape with a limited size 300 300 and periodic boundary condition in order to see how the disturbance control measure reverse invasion tendency species interaction processes are first set to happen the disturbance controlling measure will not be released until 2 3 native population density has been eradicated on the other hand since the total degree of structured landscape disturbance is fixed as p s and p u we initially run habitat dynamic to their equilibrium state and then implement the disturbing points under this generated configuration our simulation is running 50 repeats for each combination value of parameters the method to take equilibrium density is after 10000 steps we record values every 100 steps if more than three recorded densities remain almost the same the values between these records are all regarded as in the equilibrium state yang et al 2014 3 result since our mainly focus is whether introduced landscape disturbance could reverse the already happened population invasion we just considered the invader zero equilibrium point p 0 p 1 p 2 p u p 0 p 1 0 r s u r u s r s u and did some stability analysis referred to the appendix b the results were illustrated in fig 2 3 1 disturbance management effect from the second panel of fig 2 we knew that in general non zero equilibrium density for native species 1 could be reached under the r s u range of 0 0 5 too frequent disturbing events caused extra death of both native and invasion species however in terms of stability condition first panel of fig 2 some regions like r s u 0 1 and 0 2 r s u 0 3 former none zero equilibrium points were not locally stable native species still had the risk of re invasion therefore we combined these two conditions and obtained the successful controlling parameter conditions green area in the third panel in addition disturbance duration played minor roles among controlling process only those managements with extremely longer recovery time or even permanent destruction v e r y s m a l l r u s o r r u s 0 failed to eradicate invaders above patterns could be attributed to the dynamic of site distribution on lattice fig 3 illustrated how equilibrium conditional density q u 1 a n d q 0 1 depended on our parameters as we seen the areas 0 3 q 0 1 0 72 and 0 2 q 0 1 q u 1 1 5 q 0 1 were the same with the successful controlling area in fig 2 in fact they did have some connections we fixed r u s and increased r s u as an example to see what happened in region 1 of fig 3 extremely small disturbance rate r s u was too weak to wipe invader individuals so that q u 1 a n d q 0 1 being both small invader species still mostly surrounded native species they had the competition advantage and the outcome could not be varied as r s u increased to region 2 disturbance had produced enough empty space for native species to birth and defense invader were suppressed in the end but for region 3 although q 0 1 was increased more the generated q u 1 remained small this situation allowed alien species to be possible to emerge nearby native individuals again then the non zero native population density was locally unstable in region 4 bigger disturbing rate r s u caused more unsuitable sites species 1 was mostly surrounded by u sites which in some degree protected native population from competition with alien species it is why invasion was stopped in this case eventually for overfast disturbing frequency region 5 since the majority proportion of landscape has been destroyed already there were too big conditional probability q u 1 it made residents fail to birth and survive themselves in this case both species went extinction to illustrate the interaction influence between spatial configuration extent spatial aggregation and time scale parameters disturbance frequency and duration let r s u m r u s resulting p u r s u r u s r s u m 1 m if reflected on r u s r s u phase diagram it was a line away from the zero point third panel of fig 2 then the disturbance extent p u totally depended on single parameter m p u q u u p u 1 q s u p u 1 p s p s s p u 1 m m 1 1 2 b m 2 indicated the spatial autocorrelation of adjacent unsuitable cells for a given time step when m fixed this metrics was a monotonic increasing function of b r u s r s u on the other hand decided the updating speed of unsuitable sites since control measures were time and money costing ecologists always hope managements being limited cost suggested relatively small total extent hence here we fixed m on four levels m 0 15 0 25 0 45 1 third panel of fig 2 and investigated how spatial configuration and time scale worked together for final consequence these four lines corresponded to four columns of fig 4 each diagram represented a b vs r u s spatial correlation and disturbance time duration phase given small extent m 0 15 p u 0 13 successful control region located at the top right corner that is when utilizing low cost disturbance management to control invading species we should simultaneously keep higher spatial correlation enough disturbed block size b and faster updating rate for slightly bigger m 0 25 p u 0 2 green area moved to the middle position too fast or slow disturbance recovering rate failed to wipe spreading tendency of invader under medium m 0 45 p u 0 3 patterns became more complicated where emerged two separate green areas the half percent intensity m 1 p u 0 5 led green area to be much lower position and thinner in general disturbance more spatially clustered and with enough updating rate was more effective to impede invader s thriving fig 5 presented the spatial dynamics under above successful combined parameter criteria initially species 2 had competition advantage and spread in patches when 2 3 native population density has been eradicated t 1209 a certain intensity of disturbance was released individuals on the lattice began to randomly vanish and some new empty sites reemerged which provided enough space for residents surviving clumping species 2 were gradually driven to be more randomly distributed part of unsuitable patches also blocked interactions between native and species individuals in this way endangered populations gained increasing possibility and when t 4000 their density returned to be dominant 3 2 properties of invasion species we further considered the other parameters like invader competition level and native species resistibility survival rate on empty lattice cells which well stand for the properties of invasion species and are very important during biological invasion dynamics we set α 12 0 1 a n d α 21 f α 12 then f 1 suggested higher competitive power over native species birth rate r 1 and r 2 had a certain connection r 1 0 1 0 4 0 7 1 r 2 0 8 r 1 this usually depended on the environmental factors strong birth rate represented those r selection communities where populations having better quality of offspring to survive in hostile environment instead small birth rate corresponded to k selection communities whose population densities close to carrying capacity when putting our result pattern under several combinations of f r 1 fig 6 we found that the control measure by introducing landscape disturbance was effective for both low and high competing invaders this kind of management did not rely on target invader s harmful degree the competitiveness here but on the other hand controlling outcome varied a lot among community types there was a wider successful range of parameter values for more r selection communities and high frequent disturbance events could not gain stable depression of alien species for k selection style community 4 discussion here we extend the pair approximation model of hiebeler et al 2016 to a two species invading system and analytically explore the long term outcomes when habitat disturbance included by doing so we want to get a deeper basic understanding of connections between disturbance and invader species declining especially for the two species competition system our results suggest that spatiotemporal landscape disturbance could reverse competing invaders and recover native populations but it depends on both management related parameters and metapopulation life history first we find that the success of controlling measures is completely decided by the balance of empty sites and unsuitable sites left for native species and even subject to how those two kinds of sites finally arranged on the lattice disturbance events with small scale of blocks or less frequency small values of b or r s u cannot provide indigenous population with enough empty breeding zones so that invasion process could not be stopped this quite agree with many previous studies bascompte and sole 1996 keymer et al 2000 nee and may 1992 tilman et al 1994 although disturbance with medium periodicity r s u has generated more empty space and hence keep a non zero native population in the end there still exists part of this value range like region3 of fig 3 which has the possibility to be invaded again it is because in that case resulted abundant empty sites nearby native individuals can also give superior competitors space to recolonize nee and may 1992 once gave the same explanation through the deterministic model a long time ago since the shortcoming of mean field work omitting spatial structure of habitat dytham 1995 and moilanen and hanski 1995 have respectively extended this model to a more realistic case they both obtained the same claim that inferior competitors are always underperformance at high clustered empty patches because of the continued presence of superior competitor at last we show that too fast habitat destruction rate r s u must fail to eradicate alien species parameter r s u suggests the expected lifetime of one habitat site too bigger r s u means nonsufficient surviving time for individuals between two sequential disturbing events therefore both species could go down to extinction the most common stance for people applying control measures is how to improve strategies under the same amount of money terry and gourley 2010 only changes in spatial configuration and time correlation are usually more costless and so do a slight savings garrison et al 2012 hiebeler et al 2016 therefore we exhibit the results as total disturbance density fixed our analysis shows that the implementation of weak intensity fixed on low total density of unsuitable sites or lines a of fig 2 disturbance should combine with more frequently using the measure type with high recovering rate previous works claimed shorter refractory period large r u s enhance population persistence ellner and fussmann 2003 hastings 2003 hiebeler et al 2016 johnson 2000 whereas wilcox et al 2006 indicated speeding up habitat turnover while keeping the same mean number of undestroyed patches would result in persistence decline it is also derived from natural observations by instead using synchronization of patch state johst and drechsler 2003 these different conclusions might be caused by the one species system for two species interacting case the competing outcome would be quite different besides they also did not emphasize the conclusion on intensity degree various patterns occurred along the intensity gradient in our model system when increasing the total disturbance density a little short patch lifetime large r u s cannot conserve endangered species and medium updating rate of disturbance becomes more effective this is because large recovering rate opens empty pathways between patches of native and invader species banitz et al 2008 hiebeler et al 2016 as applying half percentage disturbance density m 1 of fig 4 successful control area becomes lower and narrow position only taking control measure itself into consideration is not quite enough we should also understand the features of local community like species life history tayeh et al 2015 invader competitiveness huston 2004 and dispersal types liao et al 2016 they were often omitted by control strategies before fagan et al 2002 moller 1996 our results show that r selected community populations with strong fecundity are relatively easy to implement landscape control measure while k selected community only impose a hasher successful parameter range and seems better suits to lower frequent disturbance hiebeler et al 2016 and johst and drechsler 2003 both illustrated the similar claim that k strategy species are more adversely affected by habitat turnover rate in light of competitive discrepancy between alien and native populations we notice that invasion system of k strategy community is more easily to eradicate stronger competitive invaders while r select community does not differ the invaders competitiveness this could also be explained from the spatial configuration generated by individuals and habitat yang et al 2014 the importance of species distribution over space has been explored both in experiment and theoretical field monzeglio and stoll 2008 murrell and law 2003 takenaka et al 1997 reproduction limitation and low competition discrepancy will cause more interspecific clustering namely native and invader population mixed together disturbance caused vacant space cannot make up the negative competition effects from neighboring invaders so control measure does not work well but inversely for large competition discrepancy there are more intraspecific clumping patterns this leads habitat disturbance to be effective so far we have modeled the dynamic of two species invasion system under spatiotemporal habitat disturbance some successful control areas are obtained through equilibrium analysis and simulations these results could provide meaningful insights into the species coexistence under habitat disturbance and give suggestions about the optimum control strategy for conservation however we have only focused on the competitive invasion process when alien species enter native communities although competition for limiting resources should happen first vila and weiner 2004 some other interaction relationship like positive davies et al 2005 host parasitism mitchell and power 2003 herbivory carpenter and cappuccino 2005 apparent competition noonburg and byers 2005 wootton 1994 and even the indirect facilitation brown et al 2002 might also be assembled this depends on their relatedness to native populations mitchell et al 2006 so our theoretical work could be further extended to more kinds of invasion systems acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 31700347
