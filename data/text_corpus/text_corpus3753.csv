18765,arsenic as contamination of groundwater is a public health concern impacting the lives of approximately 100 million people in india chronic exposure to as significantly increases mortality due to the occurrence of several types of cancer respiratory and cardiac diseases uttar pradesh is a part of the middle indo gangetic plains and has been found to be severely affected by as contamination of groundwater as established by several small scale studies the current study incorporates a hybrid method based on a random forest ensemble algorithm and univariate feature selection using 1473 data points for predicting as in the region twenty direct proxy predictor variables were considered to describe the geochemical environment aquifer conditions and topography that are responsible for as enrichment in groundwater the map of as predicted through the hybrid random forest ensemble model shows an overall accuracy of 84 67 the hybrid random forest model performs better than the univariate logistic fuzzy adaptive fuzzy and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems which have been widely used for as prediction the projected number of rural populations at risk due to high as exposure is 12 of the total population of the region which accounts for 23 48 million people who are at risk the predictive map provides insight for the regions where future testing campaigns and interventions for mitigation should be prioritized by policymakers graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic india prediction regression hybrid random forest model 1 introduction elevated arsenic as concentrations above the world health organization who permissible limit of 10 μg l in groundwater pose a health threat to approximately 100 million people in india chakraborti et al 2016 2018 bhowmick et al 2018 several countries including bangladesh yang et al 2014 india mukherjee et al 2009 china guo et al 2014 nepal pokhrel et al 2009 cambodia polya et al 2010 vietnam winkel et al 2011 myanmar van geen et al 2014 laos cho et al 2011 indonesia winkel et al 2008a b and the usa gong et al 2014 are severely affected by high as in groundwater chronic as exposure significantly increases mortality due to cardiovascular diseases argos et al 2010 and prolonged as exposure can result in skin liver bladder and lung cancer chen et al 2011 as poisoning has also been linked to infant mortality impaired intellect and motor dysfunction in children bhowmick et al 2018 parvez et al 2011 rahman et al 2010 wasserman et al 2004 as in groundwater is not only related to as containing host minerals but also affected by host minerals solubility redox conditions and ph studies have revealed that as rich minerals are linked with the quaternary deposits of alluvial sediments belonging to the holocene age mukherjee et al 2009 shah 2010 as contamination can occur due to the reductive dissolution of as bearing minerals postma et al 2016 these as rich sediments are transported by rivers originating from the himalayas and are deposited into downstream basins and deltaic areas the organic matter buried along with the sediment is utilized by microbes for metabolic activities the microbial reduction of iron fe from fe3 to fe2 due to the consumption of oxygen bound to as bearing fe oxyhydroxides results in the subsequent release of as drahota et al 2013 verma et al 2016 as contamination can take place in reducing aquifer environments in oxidizing environments with high ph nickson et al 2005 with oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals and with geothermal activity soil texture also plays a significant role in providing the appropriate environment for as release into the groundwater hoque et al 2009 however there is still a lack of understanding of the extent of the problem and a need for an elaborative investigation of the sources and exact geological conditions that lead to as contamination testing individual wells for as contamination is cumbersome and requires manpower and time with quality control and detailed maps which can help identify such high risk regions are still missing thus these predictive maps could be very useful to help decision makers to focus their mitigation efforts on the areas that are most affected several studies use modeling to predict occurrences of as at global to regional scales berg et al 2001 2016 bretzler et al 2017 winkel et al 2008a b yang et al 2014 the modeling approach requires an understanding of the geochemical mechanism that assists the release of as along with the geological topographical and environmental factors and thus the models can be used as proxies to predict as affected regions modeling based prediction helps in identifying the areas for future testing so that interventions to provide safe drinking water can be prioritized a few studies have used methods such as thiessen polygon inverse distance weighing idw gong et al 2014 global polynomial interpolation bhunia et al 2016 kriging sovann and polya 2014 and cokriging gong et al 2014 to predict the spatial variation of contaminants in groundwater at the local regional scale although these methods are simple and easy to use substantial data points are required to produce outcomes and they do not account for spatial dependency of the data or consider the factors or processes that might influence the occurrence of the contaminants there is a paucity of data at a larger scale thus these models do not perform well thus predictive models that consider the factors responsible for contamination are used to overcome the limitations of the models that use interpolation for prediction logistic regression models lrm have been commonly employed to predict the spatial distributions of as worldwide dummer et al 2014 several studies have used logistic regression lee et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 to assess the likelihood of as contamination greater than the predefined limit of 10 μg l by using limited as data points along with auxiliary independent variables such as geology topography and soil properties in 2013 rodriguez lado et al used proxies such as holocene sediments soil salinity fine subsoil texture topographic wetness index twi density of rivers slope distance to rivers and gravity anomaly out of which holocene sediments soil salinity subsoil texture and twi were found to be most significant highlighting their relative importance in predicting the occurrence of groundwater as a few studies used linear regression lr zhang et al 2013 principal component regression pcr luo et al 2012 bayesian modeling cha et al 2016 and artificial neural network ann based regression bonelli et al 2017 cho et al 2011 for as prediction such models cha et al 2016 cho et al 2011 have shown accuracies varying between 60 and 70 to understand such complex relationships and the magnitude of the problem machine learning models have been found to be much more accurate machine learning models e g random forests and neural networks show higher prediction accuracy than lrm due to their strength in modeling complex relationships between response and predictor variables tesoriero et al 2017 the machine learning algorithms develop sophisticated model subunits for capturing relationships that are otherwise too complex to specify in parametric models however no such model has been developed either at the regional or national scale in india even though new regions have been added to existing high as risk areas affecting millions of people in india a novel hybrid random forest model has been used to predict the regions in uttar pradesh at risk due to as contamination in this model the outcomes from stepwise regression have been incorporated in the random forest model the predictive abilities of widely used models such as univariate lrm fuzzy adaptive fuzzy regression afr and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis were compared with that of a hybrid random forest model the population at risk was estimated using a linear function relationship between predicted as and the population density of uttar pradesh 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater as data a total of 1680 as data points were collected for this study a total of 728 data points were collected from randomly tested household handpumps and the remaining 952 were collected from the literature cgwb 2014 chauhan et al 2009 mehrotra et al 2014 raju 2011 shah 2008 shah 2010 shah 2013 shah 2017 the geotagged groundwater as data were collected from 728 domestic and community handpumps with well depths of 3 122 m using its econo quick test kits the kit results were validated through laboratory measurements which were found to be comparable george et al 2012a b van geen et al 2014 van geen et al 2018 with slight overestimation at high as concentrations the kit correctly categorized 90 of wells george et al 2012a b van geen et al 2014 as per the who guideline of 10 μg l for as which is also the limit of the bureau of indian standards which was recently lowered from 50 μg l bis 2012 the data points from the literature have limit of detection lod values ranging from 0 0001 to 0 0003 mg l whereas the lod value of the kit is 0 01 mg l the as data required for the modeling were classified as 10 μg l and 10 μg l for model training testing and validation rodriguez lado et al 2013 ayotte et al 2016 bretzler et al 2017 podgorski et al 2017 the as concentration is spatially variable and relatively stable temporally van geen et al 2013 randomly distributed data doesn t impact the regression rather the randomly distributed independent variable is an advantage to model the prediction probability because the selected variables are used based on initial regression to model the prediction the prediction studies performed by ayotte et al 2016 winkel et al 2008a b rodriguez lado et al 2013 podgorski et al 2017 bretzler et al 2017 have all used randomly collected as datapoints the as datapoints were placed over a grid size of 100 m 100 m comparable to highest spatial resolution of proxy variable used in the study i e geology further some of the datapoints were aggregated together by using the geometric mean to a resolution of one point per grid bretzler et al 2017 thus reducing the total data points of 1680 to 1473 of these 1473 data points 804 were equal n 469 or greater than n 335 10 μg l 54 5 and 669 45 41 were less than 10 μg l fig 1 the dataset was split randomly into training 80 and testing 20 comprising of 1178 and 295 data points the aggregated data points were binary coded such that there are only two possibilities either contaminated as 10 μg l i e 1 or uncontaminated as 10 μg l i e 0 2 2 independent predictor variables based on the findings of previous investigations berg et al 2016 podgorski et al 2017 rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008a b twenty independent proxy variables were considered for use in the model table 1 the datasets available for extraction of these independent variables were collected for this study from several sources as shown in table 1 the proxy variables used in the modeling are directly or indirectly associated with the occurrence and enrichment of as in groundwater some of the independent variables such as the redox state of the aquifer and well depth could not be directly considered due to the unavailability of the data therefore soil organic carbon and geological sequence of holocene and pleistocene sediments were used as proxies in the model these independent predictor variables can be classified as geological soil climatic and anthropogenic factors that are associated with the occurrence and enrichment of as in groundwater table 1 these variables were extracted either by digitizing the scanned datasheets quaternary geological maps or by acquiring them from available online sources as mentioned in table 2 the climatic variables such as evapotranspiration precipitation and temperature were downloaded in the form of grids from the worldclim database the groundwater level data were derived using an algorithm on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data table 2 due to differences in resolution data format and projections the variables were converted to raster format at 100 m spatial resolution to maintain uniformity among datasets furthermore all the datasets were reprojected to the universe transverse mercator utm coordinate system with the wgs projection for the northern hemisphere zone 44 to maintain the consistency and spatial integrity of the data all maps were prepared using arcgis 10 3 1 software prior to conducting this study the literature related to as contamination was extensively reviewed subsequently twenty independent direct and proxy variables were gathered to understand the processes leading to as contamination furthermore significant variables among these twenty variables table 3 were narrowed down using univariate feature selection univariate feature selection builds a predictive model for the response variable using each individual variable and measures the performance of each model in fact it is similar to pearson s correlation coefficient since it is equivalent to the standardized regression coefficient that is used for prediction in linear regression if the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable is nonlinear then random forests are used to avoid overfitting following this the independent variables can either be added or subtracted from the set of exploratory variables based upon the criterion set by sequential output obtained through the f test or t test the variables based on univariate feature selection can introduce bias in the parameter estimates which are further from 0 specifically in complex prediction models harrell 2001 2015 to avoid this we have considered the few variables that are important during initial univariate feature selection based upon the findings from the model a total of eight variables were found to be significant with a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 consequently these eight independent variables were used to construct the hybrid random forest ensemble model table 3 a geology geologically the gangetic plains has been classified into three major classes fig 2 a i upper siwalik upper pliocene to lower pleistocene which includes lower middle and upper groups in the northern part of the siwaliks middle miocene to early pleistocene ii older alluvium middle to upper pleistocene and iii newer alluvium upper pleistocene to recent holocene in order of successions shah 2008 the study area comprises thick layers of quaternary sediments containing multiple layers of aquifers the shallow groundwater resides in the unconsolidated alluvial sediments in the zone of saturation at 0 100 m depth and are rich in minerals including as hoque et al 2011 shah 2010 geological quadrangle maps at a scale of 1 50 000 were obtained from the geological survey of india gsi digitized table 1 and reclassified into eight classes archean proterozoic carboniferous holocene meso proterozoic mid miocene to pliocene neo proterozoic paleo proterozoic and pleistocene based on geological succession fig 2a b soil subsoil clay silt sand fraction and organic content were extracted from a digital soil grids database fig 2b c 2d and 2e the data were further downscaled by using a resampling mean method from 250 m to 100 m resolution to avoid loss of data the data were extracted for the subsoil at the depth of 30 200 cm for the percentage of sand silt clay and organic content of the soil table 1 c groundwater level data gwl the groundwater level data at 1350 locations for the years 1996 2016 were acquired from the central ground water board fig 2f table 1 the groundwater level is recorded quarterly in india during the months of january april august and november the annual average was calculated and a continuous raster surface was generated using the inverse distance weighing idw interpolation method e fluvisols fluvisols are genetically young soils in alluvial deposits that are rich in iron bearing minerals fao 1999 these types of soils are found to be associated with cooccurrences of as stuckey et al 2016 they are supposed to provide a similar environment as holocene sediments podgorski et al 2017 the dataset for the fluvisol soils table 1 was downscaled to 100 m fig 2g f lulc land use land cover lulc data were extracted using landsat 8 satellite imagery for the year 2017 table 1 by performing an isodata unsupervised classification algorithm in erdas imagine 14 the output consisted of 8 major lulc classes present in the region fig 2h 2 3 development of hybrid random forest model for as prediction random forest is a machine learning algorithm based on the generation of many decision trees and their assemblage to produce a final output breiman 2001 each output from the decision tree is dependent on the values of a random vector that is sampled independently from the same distribution of all decision trees generated in the forest the number of predictors used to find the best split at each node is randomly chosen from a subset of all the predictors among the ensemble classifiers random forest best accounts for the nature of different input predictors efficiently random forest is also insensitive to noise outliers and overtraining which reduces the chances of bias in the data it is computationally less intensive than other boosting based ensemble and simple bagging methods breiman 2001 this model is used where complex processes act as controlling factors for the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any dependent variable and thus helps in identifying the controlling factors sources and processes to implement the model the number of decision trees in the ensemble was generated at each node the classification model repeatedly split the dependent variable as over independent variables resulting in the highest variance of the dependent variable breiman 2001 the number of bins was determined using sturges formula and the bin width was varied so each bin contained the same number of members the data were consolidated to focus on the fundamental criterion of whether the concentration of as poses a health hazard in addition a univariate logistic regression was run with each variable and the significance of the coefficient was assessed through its p value as shown in table 3 the numbers of bins were calculated to categorize a continuous numerical variable which was found to be 10 since classification accuracy is more sensitive to independent variables the number of decision tree was fixed at a default value of 1500 and independent variables were tested for 10 values this parameter tuning process was iterated 4 times and repeated for a 20 fold cross validation process breiman 2001 to reach the maximum configuration of the model output the modeling was performed with training and then testing datasets random forest was applied using the raster and caret package within r ver 3 5 1 open source statistical software team r 2016 2 4 comparison with other predictive models in this study we evaluated the performance of hybrid random forest model with univariate logistic regression mode lrm fuzzy adaptive fuzzy regression afr and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the model comparison would indicate the best fit model that can be used for predictive modeling with best outputs in the region the univariate model is used to understand the simple relationship between dependent and independent variables however this only takes direct association or disassociation into account which makes it less comprehensive in nature the lrm involves categorization of the dependent variable which can either be above or below a threshold value however there is a significant disadvantage for using it with continuous variables dummer et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 furthermore lrm results could be difficult to accurately decipher the solid relationship among the different independent variables fuzzy regression models can only address uncertainty in the rules individually rodriguez lado et al 2013 and lack the capability for learning and adapting to a new set of input and output datasets therefore the afr takes into account both uncertainty in the rules and capability for learning and adapting in the processes however anfis was found to work better than the previous methods as it was a powerful means to solve the complex and nonlinear relations using either binary or categorical variables tesoriero et al 2017 to resolve the complexity among the dependent and independent datasets the hybrid random forest model was used in this study the hybrid random forest model takes account of the relationships and can directly incorporate the potentially significant binary or categorical or continuous factors breiman 2001 all other modeling procedures including the retaining or discarding of models are based on the hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit test and the weighting and averaging of coefficients 2 5 accuracy assessment and sensitivity analysis the diagnostic statistics used for assessing the accuracy of the interpolation were root mean square error rmse and standardized root mean square rms given in eq i and ii i rmse 1 n i 1 n z i a c t z i e s t 2 ii standardized rms 1 n i 1 n 1 s 2 z i a c t z i e s t 2 r m s e s where z i a c t is the actual values for as z i e s t is the estimated or predicted values for as s is the standard deviation and s2 is the variance among the datasets for n number of data points the method yielding smaller rmse and a standardized rms value close to 1 is an optimal method winkel et al 2008a b the validation process is different from cross validation since it depends on the subset of the dataset the dataset was divided into two groups one for model development as a training dataset and the other for testing the accuracy using a testing dataset the model has been validated using training and testing datasets bretzler et al 2017 2 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to test the performance of the models in the forward selection stepwise technique the incremental change in the r2 values is an indication of the significance of sensitivity of the output to each newly introduced predictor variable the performance of a prediction model was determined by its true positive rate sensitivity and true negative rate specificity iii s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n 100 iv s p e c i f i c i t y t n t n f p 100 v o v e r a l l a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f p f n t n 100 sensitivity measures the model s ability to correctly classify groundwater samples with as 10 μg l true positive tp whereas specificity measures the model s ability to correctly classify samples with as 10 μg l true negative tn using eq iii and iv in general a true positive tp value is an outcome when the model accurately predicts the positive class correspondingly a true negative tn value is an outcome when the model accurately predicts the negative class and a false positive fp value is a result when the model inaccurately predicts the positive class a false negative fn is a result when the model inaccurately predicts the negative class value the classification results of the as prediction model under different probability cutoff values mostly show that sensitivity is inversely related to specificity berg et al 2001 a plot of sensitivity against specificity for all the outputs of model cutoff values between 0 and 1 draws a receiver operating characteristic roc curve the area under the curve auc value must be above 0 5 no predictive capability and 1 best predictive capability tesoriero et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of model proxies the highest positive weighing coefficient table 3 for geology λ 4 71 indicates that geology plays a major role in as enrichment in aquifers shallow aquifers with holocene deposits in regions with low slope gradients are found to have high as shamsudduha et al 2008 the holocene sedimentary deposits λ 5 12 provide a chemically reducing environment in the floodplains of rivers thus enriching aquifers with as mcarthur et al 2004 2008 the holocene organic rich alluvial deposits have been found to be statistically significant in other studies lado et al 2008 winkel et al 2011 furthermore geochemical analytical studies have found that the sediments belonging to newer alluvium are high in concentrations of as and fe simultaneously kirchner et al 1998 saha and sahu 2016 moreover x ray diffraction xrd of newer and older alluvium sediments reveal mineral assemblages of quartz chlorite muscovite montmorillonite kaolinite and feldspar shah 2010 however newer alluvium minerals have amphibole and goethite minerals which are rich in fe shah 2010 therefore handpumps installed over newer alluvial deposits are more prone to as contamination minerals rich in fe are found to adsorb as onto their surfaces and release it into groundwater under different geochemical environments naseem et al 2018 the fluvisols are soils that are genetically rich in iron minerals and depict an alluvial setting under the influence of reducing conditions the as adsorbed on the iron oxyhydroxide feooh surfaces is released in groundwater the fluvisols show a high weighing coefficient of λ 1 12 table 3 and the studies in the middle gangetic plains show a strong correlation between as and fe berg et al 2001 mcarthur et al 2008 the reducing conditions in the groundwater are initiated by the microbially mediated decay of dissolved organic carbon doc harvey et al 2002 and the mobilization of as by humic and fluvic acids which plays an important role in mineral degradation and metal mobilization of feooh experimental studies by sharma et al 2010 verified that both fluvic acids and humic acids adhere strongly to metal oxides and clay minerals which displaces as from metal oxide and mineral surfaces sharma et al 2010 therefore doc which comprises the organic matter fraction of subsoil with λ 1 41 table 3 is embedded in the sediments and past drainage in the region plays a vital role in as release by generating favorable redox conditions mazumder et al 2016 further experimental evidence mcarthur et al 2001 in the bengal basin suggests that aquifers are separated from overlying silt λ 1 75 soils these aquifers are separated by underlying paleosol formations hoque et al 2012 mcarthur et al 2011 which are rich in clay content λ 2 23 and a source of organic carbon these conditions initiate reducing conditions in the aquifer which are favorable for as enrichment in groundwater this as rich groundwater interacts with gray sands λ 2 34 which have already undergone reduction table 1 the as containing groundwater supplies organic carbon through the clay layer the downward movement of this as rich water leads to further contamination of deep aquifers mcarthur et al 2001 silt was found to be inversely associated with as contamination λ 1 75 a higher percentage of silt represents the transport and deposition of fresh materials in the river basin ahmed et al 2004 silt could also be produced by mechanical weathering of soils as it is highly reactive the silt has active silicate sites and as readily adheres to these sites thereby decreasing its concentration in groundwater therefore silt can provide active sites for adsorption of as species chakraborti et al 2002 the results also show that the areas closer to the rivers are more susceptible to contamination with as thus the subsoil composition with different fractions of sand silt and clay plays a vital role in the enrichment of as in aquifers studies suggest that increased flooded irrigation leads to as contamination bhattacharya et al 2006 harvey et al 2002 nickson et al 2005 there has been an increase in groundwater use for irrigation from 54 31 to 72 16 from 2000 to 2009 gwp 2013 rice wheat bajra barley and maize crops in the state of uttar pradesh have dominantly been irrigated roychowdhury et al 2005 found that surface soils have lower as levels than subsurface soils lulc with a weighing factor of λ 0 74 was found to be a significant proxy variable within the subclasses for lulc cropland λ 0 67 was found to be the most significant contributing factor these are in agreement with most of the variables found to be significant with other prediction models berg et al 2016 groundwater from private and government wells is used to irrigate 101 61 lakh hectares which comprises 73 58 of the total cultivated area of the state roy and ahmad 2015 this is dominantly planted with wheat 37 90 rice 22 83 millet 3 57 maize 2 68 sorghum 0 69 and barley 0 64 roy and ahmad 2015 excessive cultivation of rice acts as a barrier to the inflow of oxygen into the subsurface aquifer due to flooded irrigation a dominant practice in the region and provides a favorable reducing environment resulting in as release van geen et al 2013 the over extraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes has disturbed the hydrological balance of the aquifers resulting in fluctuating groundwater levels rasool et al 2016 the groundwater level in the region λ 2 12 suggests similar exploitation trends with significant table 3 p values 0 034 the groundwater fluctuation results in subsequent changes in the geochemical environment of the aquifer the groundwater level initiates the reduction of sulfide rich minerals mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria harvey et al 2005 depending on this biogeochemical behavior and changes in the redox conditions of aquifers the solubility of as is affected resulting in as contamination of the groundwater mukherjee et al 2006 irrigation might result in higher evapotranspiration and slow infiltration through young alluvial sediments thus increasing the groundwater as concentration podgorski et al 2017 3 2 hybrid random forest model eight significant p 0 05 independent variables table 3 were used in the hybrid random forest model to predict as contamination in the groundwater of uttar pradesh fig 3 a fig 3b depicts the binary map of as prediction which shows areas at low 10 μg l and high risk 10 μg l the hybrid random forest model prediction is in agreement with the existing spatial distribution of groundwater as contamination of the 1473 binary recoded as concentration data points greater than or equal to 10 μg l 85 are correctly predicted by the hybrid random forest model fig 3b more precisely 73 of the groundwater samples with as concentrations greater than or equal to 10 μg l are correctly predicted sensitivity whereas 97 of the groundwater samples with as concentrations less than 10 μg l are appropriately predicted specificity the performance of the hybrid random forest model was evaluated using roc and auc auc is a measure of the model performance with values typically varying between 0 5 and 1 naghibi et al 2016 the auc value for the hybrid random forest model is 0 755 fig 4 a with an overall accuracy of 84 6 along with rms and rmse values of 0 014 and 0 006 table 4 a cutoff value of 0 61 was used based on the intersection of specificity and sensitivity so that predictive accuracy is not biased towards either high or low as values fig 4b similar cut off values are obtained for the testing and overall datasets the auc value for the test dataset is 0 74 with an overall accuracy of 86 29 table 5 the specificity of the test dataset 95 6 is similar to that of the training dataset 95 7 the true negative rate indicates the ability of the model to correctly predict the little contaminated areas and considers the robustness of the model the high true positive rate indicates that the model is more sensitive to delineating the unsafe areas the overall accuracy of the hybrid random forest model for the total data points n 1473 together with the training 80 and testing 20 datasets fig 4a is 84 67 which is calculated using eq v the findings are also evident from the results of ravenscroft et al 2009 moreover the auc values for the univariate lrm fuzzy afr and anfis models are found to be 0 49 0 54 0 45 0 59 and 0 71 respectively with an overall prediction accuracy of 40 6 67 3 as shown in table 5 the fuzzy model performance was least 40 as fuzzy alone is very unstable and very sensitive to resampling maiti and tiwari 2014 the performance of lrm was found to be 53 9 the input dilutes the variability of independent variables anfis 67 3 is preferred over afr 56 9 due to its greater robustness and flexibility which caters to the complexity of hydrogeochemical conditions thus the hybrid random forest model with an accuracy of 84 67 performs much better than the models used in other prediction studies cao et al 2018 rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008a b zhang et al 2012 the ensemble hybrid random forest model involves an unlimited number of decision tree formations along with the flexibility to incorporate expert knowledge of the aquifer environments and generates robust output with high accuracy 3 3 prediction map of as the hybrid random forest ensemble model identifies seven districts of uttar pradesh namely ballia chauhan et al 2009 gorakhpur singh et al 2018 ghazipur kumar et al 2010 gonda cgwb 2014 faizabad barabanki and lakhimpur kheri as high risk regions with prediction probabilities of 0 8 1 0 fig 5 a the majority of these areas lie in the floodplains of the ganga rapti and ghaghra rivers fig 1 studies involving geochemical analysis have found that groundwater in these areas is contaminated with high as these soils are rich in organic content that seeps into groundwater creating reducing conditions and thus impacting the solubility of as bearing minerals the organic content that seeps down is used in microbial reduction which leads to the reduction of as bearing iron oxyhydroxides resulting in the subsequent release of as these findings are in accordance with previous geochemical studies that confirmed the presence of high as in groundwater in these districts ahamed et al 2006 chauhan et al 2009 singh et al 2018 nevertheless this result suggests that the districts of barabanki and gonda are high risk regions and require blanket testing to confirm as contamination of groundwater the districts of shahjahanpur unnao chauhan et al 2012 chanduali varanasi cgwb 2014 pratapgarh kushinagar mau balrampur deoria and siddharth nagar were found to be under moderate risk of as contamination with prediction probabilities of 0 6 0 8 fig 5a however no exhaustive study has been performed in these moderately predicted high risk areas except unnao and varanasi fig 5a also highlights nine districts baghpat meerut ghaziabad mathura agra firozabad jhansi fatehpur and banda with probabilities of 0 4 0 6 for predicted as furthermore 28 districts with low risk are also demarcated with probabilities lying within 0 1 0 4 the areas underlain by pleistocene deposits were found to be safe with low risk probabilities of 0 0 1 the pleistocene older alluvium is characterized by sediments of yellow to brown color having fewer reduced iron fe ii concretions that do not provide as adsorption sites which results in as safe groundwater the remaining 16 districts are at no risk of as contamination 3 4 population affected in high risk regions the probability map of fig 5a shows the severity of as contamination in the groundwater of uttar pradesh the probabilities are grouped to prepare an arsenic hazard map with high moderate low and no risk zones indicating a probability of as between 80 and 100 60 80 10 60 and 10 in addition there are regions of predicted high as concentrations that are below the statistically determined probability cutoff of 61 and have been used to calculate high risk regions which would estimate population density more accurately for densely populated areas uttar pradesh is the most densely populated state of india with a total population of 199 million census of india 2011 out of the total population of uttar pradesh 155 million people 77 73 live in rural areas mdws report 2011 without access to piped water and rely mostly on groundwater for their drinking and domestic needs the population density of uttar pradesh varies from 242 to 3917 people km2 census of india 2011 accordingly 23 48 million people in rural areas are exposed to high as since they are dependent on groundwater for drinking cooking and irrigation fig 5b this number has been calculated using the following equation vi which signifies a linear function relationship between predicted as probabilities and population density to identify the actual population exposed to high as vi population exposed rural population of area predicted probability of as the risk map indicates the need for widespread testing of wells in the regions of uttar pradesh to help reduce the long term exposure of the people residing in populated clusters with 180 2271 people km2 within these identified regions districts such as ballia varanasi gazipur gorakhpur faizabad and deoria are evidently experiencing a public health crisis due to as exposure the map shown in fig 5b also indicates that out of a total of 72 districts 40 are exposed to high as in groundwater especially districts located in the northeastern parts of the state the present findings confirm the widespread as contamination in uttar pradesh 4 policy implications well switching the result of the study subsumes an elaborative demarcation for high and low as risk areas in the state of uttar pradesh the outputs from hybrid random forest model highlights the high risk areas where as testing can be prioritized by the government or non governmental organizations thus the prediction maps can be used as a guide for government and policymakers to downscale their sites of action and provide interventions in the affected regions a blanket testing in the affected areas using as field kits which are reliable to demarcate safe and unsafe wells would be first step to reduce the exposure nickson et al 2007 on a long term basis use of filters other arsenic removal techniques and piped water supply are the most viable solution the costs and logistic of treating and supplying water are considerably higher and most of the times have been prohibitive due to logistics its operation and maintenance issues well switching has been found to be a significant short term mitigation option in as affected areas however the viability of well switching is based on blanket testing of well in these regions in bihar barnwal et al 2017 have tried to address this problem by demonstrating the ability of safe well sharing among neighbors barnwal et al 2017 this is an example of indulging handpump owners into a social network leading to safe drinking water regular interventions after baseline survey resulted into 30 5 higher switching to a safer well a similar pattern of switching results of 26 41 was obtained in bangladesh george et al 2012a b stressing community participation the approach is very reasonable and economical however the neighbor with a safe well needs to be compensated in some economical and logistical way for the sharing of well 5 conclusion the study highlights the threat of arsenic in groundwater of the most populous state of india in the indo gangetic basin the as hazard map can be used as a baseline to identify the regions where the targeted blanket testing of handpumps and mitigation measures are urgently required blanket testing of wells in high risk regions would inform households about safe and unsafe wells handpumps once safe and unsafe wells are identified people can be informed to switch to safe wells for drinking and cooking purposes however if higher percentages of wells are unsafe then options for centralized treatment such as reverse osmosis systems or deep well installation can be explored spatial variation of arsenic is very high even within a single village because of highly heterogeneous aquifers in the region since this prediction is not able to account for small scale variations specific regions could be called upon to reduce the poisoning of the population similar approaches for as prediction modeling with high accuracy can be emulated at the national scale to identify the regions at risk with higher accuracy a hazard map at the national scale in india can be considered to create awareness in high risk regions and accordingly plan mitigation strategies declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the fellowship provided by university grant commission to

18765,arsenic as contamination of groundwater is a public health concern impacting the lives of approximately 100 million people in india chronic exposure to as significantly increases mortality due to the occurrence of several types of cancer respiratory and cardiac diseases uttar pradesh is a part of the middle indo gangetic plains and has been found to be severely affected by as contamination of groundwater as established by several small scale studies the current study incorporates a hybrid method based on a random forest ensemble algorithm and univariate feature selection using 1473 data points for predicting as in the region twenty direct proxy predictor variables were considered to describe the geochemical environment aquifer conditions and topography that are responsible for as enrichment in groundwater the map of as predicted through the hybrid random forest ensemble model shows an overall accuracy of 84 67 the hybrid random forest model performs better than the univariate logistic fuzzy adaptive fuzzy and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems which have been widely used for as prediction the projected number of rural populations at risk due to high as exposure is 12 of the total population of the region which accounts for 23 48 million people who are at risk the predictive map provides insight for the regions where future testing campaigns and interventions for mitigation should be prioritized by policymakers graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic india prediction regression hybrid random forest model 1 introduction elevated arsenic as concentrations above the world health organization who permissible limit of 10 μg l in groundwater pose a health threat to approximately 100 million people in india chakraborti et al 2016 2018 bhowmick et al 2018 several countries including bangladesh yang et al 2014 india mukherjee et al 2009 china guo et al 2014 nepal pokhrel et al 2009 cambodia polya et al 2010 vietnam winkel et al 2011 myanmar van geen et al 2014 laos cho et al 2011 indonesia winkel et al 2008a b and the usa gong et al 2014 are severely affected by high as in groundwater chronic as exposure significantly increases mortality due to cardiovascular diseases argos et al 2010 and prolonged as exposure can result in skin liver bladder and lung cancer chen et al 2011 as poisoning has also been linked to infant mortality impaired intellect and motor dysfunction in children bhowmick et al 2018 parvez et al 2011 rahman et al 2010 wasserman et al 2004 as in groundwater is not only related to as containing host minerals but also affected by host minerals solubility redox conditions and ph studies have revealed that as rich minerals are linked with the quaternary deposits of alluvial sediments belonging to the holocene age mukherjee et al 2009 shah 2010 as contamination can occur due to the reductive dissolution of as bearing minerals postma et al 2016 these as rich sediments are transported by rivers originating from the himalayas and are deposited into downstream basins and deltaic areas the organic matter buried along with the sediment is utilized by microbes for metabolic activities the microbial reduction of iron fe from fe3 to fe2 due to the consumption of oxygen bound to as bearing fe oxyhydroxides results in the subsequent release of as drahota et al 2013 verma et al 2016 as contamination can take place in reducing aquifer environments in oxidizing environments with high ph nickson et al 2005 with oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals and with geothermal activity soil texture also plays a significant role in providing the appropriate environment for as release into the groundwater hoque et al 2009 however there is still a lack of understanding of the extent of the problem and a need for an elaborative investigation of the sources and exact geological conditions that lead to as contamination testing individual wells for as contamination is cumbersome and requires manpower and time with quality control and detailed maps which can help identify such high risk regions are still missing thus these predictive maps could be very useful to help decision makers to focus their mitigation efforts on the areas that are most affected several studies use modeling to predict occurrences of as at global to regional scales berg et al 2001 2016 bretzler et al 2017 winkel et al 2008a b yang et al 2014 the modeling approach requires an understanding of the geochemical mechanism that assists the release of as along with the geological topographical and environmental factors and thus the models can be used as proxies to predict as affected regions modeling based prediction helps in identifying the areas for future testing so that interventions to provide safe drinking water can be prioritized a few studies have used methods such as thiessen polygon inverse distance weighing idw gong et al 2014 global polynomial interpolation bhunia et al 2016 kriging sovann and polya 2014 and cokriging gong et al 2014 to predict the spatial variation of contaminants in groundwater at the local regional scale although these methods are simple and easy to use substantial data points are required to produce outcomes and they do not account for spatial dependency of the data or consider the factors or processes that might influence the occurrence of the contaminants there is a paucity of data at a larger scale thus these models do not perform well thus predictive models that consider the factors responsible for contamination are used to overcome the limitations of the models that use interpolation for prediction logistic regression models lrm have been commonly employed to predict the spatial distributions of as worldwide dummer et al 2014 several studies have used logistic regression lee et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 to assess the likelihood of as contamination greater than the predefined limit of 10 μg l by using limited as data points along with auxiliary independent variables such as geology topography and soil properties in 2013 rodriguez lado et al used proxies such as holocene sediments soil salinity fine subsoil texture topographic wetness index twi density of rivers slope distance to rivers and gravity anomaly out of which holocene sediments soil salinity subsoil texture and twi were found to be most significant highlighting their relative importance in predicting the occurrence of groundwater as a few studies used linear regression lr zhang et al 2013 principal component regression pcr luo et al 2012 bayesian modeling cha et al 2016 and artificial neural network ann based regression bonelli et al 2017 cho et al 2011 for as prediction such models cha et al 2016 cho et al 2011 have shown accuracies varying between 60 and 70 to understand such complex relationships and the magnitude of the problem machine learning models have been found to be much more accurate machine learning models e g random forests and neural networks show higher prediction accuracy than lrm due to their strength in modeling complex relationships between response and predictor variables tesoriero et al 2017 the machine learning algorithms develop sophisticated model subunits for capturing relationships that are otherwise too complex to specify in parametric models however no such model has been developed either at the regional or national scale in india even though new regions have been added to existing high as risk areas affecting millions of people in india a novel hybrid random forest model has been used to predict the regions in uttar pradesh at risk due to as contamination in this model the outcomes from stepwise regression have been incorporated in the random forest model the predictive abilities of widely used models such as univariate lrm fuzzy adaptive fuzzy regression afr and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis were compared with that of a hybrid random forest model the population at risk was estimated using a linear function relationship between predicted as and the population density of uttar pradesh 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater as data a total of 1680 as data points were collected for this study a total of 728 data points were collected from randomly tested household handpumps and the remaining 952 were collected from the literature cgwb 2014 chauhan et al 2009 mehrotra et al 2014 raju 2011 shah 2008 shah 2010 shah 2013 shah 2017 the geotagged groundwater as data were collected from 728 domestic and community handpumps with well depths of 3 122 m using its econo quick test kits the kit results were validated through laboratory measurements which were found to be comparable george et al 2012a b van geen et al 2014 van geen et al 2018 with slight overestimation at high as concentrations the kit correctly categorized 90 of wells george et al 2012a b van geen et al 2014 as per the who guideline of 10 μg l for as which is also the limit of the bureau of indian standards which was recently lowered from 50 μg l bis 2012 the data points from the literature have limit of detection lod values ranging from 0 0001 to 0 0003 mg l whereas the lod value of the kit is 0 01 mg l the as data required for the modeling were classified as 10 μg l and 10 μg l for model training testing and validation rodriguez lado et al 2013 ayotte et al 2016 bretzler et al 2017 podgorski et al 2017 the as concentration is spatially variable and relatively stable temporally van geen et al 2013 randomly distributed data doesn t impact the regression rather the randomly distributed independent variable is an advantage to model the prediction probability because the selected variables are used based on initial regression to model the prediction the prediction studies performed by ayotte et al 2016 winkel et al 2008a b rodriguez lado et al 2013 podgorski et al 2017 bretzler et al 2017 have all used randomly collected as datapoints the as datapoints were placed over a grid size of 100 m 100 m comparable to highest spatial resolution of proxy variable used in the study i e geology further some of the datapoints were aggregated together by using the geometric mean to a resolution of one point per grid bretzler et al 2017 thus reducing the total data points of 1680 to 1473 of these 1473 data points 804 were equal n 469 or greater than n 335 10 μg l 54 5 and 669 45 41 were less than 10 μg l fig 1 the dataset was split randomly into training 80 and testing 20 comprising of 1178 and 295 data points the aggregated data points were binary coded such that there are only two possibilities either contaminated as 10 μg l i e 1 or uncontaminated as 10 μg l i e 0 2 2 independent predictor variables based on the findings of previous investigations berg et al 2016 podgorski et al 2017 rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008a b twenty independent proxy variables were considered for use in the model table 1 the datasets available for extraction of these independent variables were collected for this study from several sources as shown in table 1 the proxy variables used in the modeling are directly or indirectly associated with the occurrence and enrichment of as in groundwater some of the independent variables such as the redox state of the aquifer and well depth could not be directly considered due to the unavailability of the data therefore soil organic carbon and geological sequence of holocene and pleistocene sediments were used as proxies in the model these independent predictor variables can be classified as geological soil climatic and anthropogenic factors that are associated with the occurrence and enrichment of as in groundwater table 1 these variables were extracted either by digitizing the scanned datasheets quaternary geological maps or by acquiring them from available online sources as mentioned in table 2 the climatic variables such as evapotranspiration precipitation and temperature were downloaded in the form of grids from the worldclim database the groundwater level data were derived using an algorithm on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data table 2 due to differences in resolution data format and projections the variables were converted to raster format at 100 m spatial resolution to maintain uniformity among datasets furthermore all the datasets were reprojected to the universe transverse mercator utm coordinate system with the wgs projection for the northern hemisphere zone 44 to maintain the consistency and spatial integrity of the data all maps were prepared using arcgis 10 3 1 software prior to conducting this study the literature related to as contamination was extensively reviewed subsequently twenty independent direct and proxy variables were gathered to understand the processes leading to as contamination furthermore significant variables among these twenty variables table 3 were narrowed down using univariate feature selection univariate feature selection builds a predictive model for the response variable using each individual variable and measures the performance of each model in fact it is similar to pearson s correlation coefficient since it is equivalent to the standardized regression coefficient that is used for prediction in linear regression if the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable is nonlinear then random forests are used to avoid overfitting following this the independent variables can either be added or subtracted from the set of exploratory variables based upon the criterion set by sequential output obtained through the f test or t test the variables based on univariate feature selection can introduce bias in the parameter estimates which are further from 0 specifically in complex prediction models harrell 2001 2015 to avoid this we have considered the few variables that are important during initial univariate feature selection based upon the findings from the model a total of eight variables were found to be significant with a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 consequently these eight independent variables were used to construct the hybrid random forest ensemble model table 3 a geology geologically the gangetic plains has been classified into three major classes fig 2 a i upper siwalik upper pliocene to lower pleistocene which includes lower middle and upper groups in the northern part of the siwaliks middle miocene to early pleistocene ii older alluvium middle to upper pleistocene and iii newer alluvium upper pleistocene to recent holocene in order of successions shah 2008 the study area comprises thick layers of quaternary sediments containing multiple layers of aquifers the shallow groundwater resides in the unconsolidated alluvial sediments in the zone of saturation at 0 100 m depth and are rich in minerals including as hoque et al 2011 shah 2010 geological quadrangle maps at a scale of 1 50 000 were obtained from the geological survey of india gsi digitized table 1 and reclassified into eight classes archean proterozoic carboniferous holocene meso proterozoic mid miocene to pliocene neo proterozoic paleo proterozoic and pleistocene based on geological succession fig 2a b soil subsoil clay silt sand fraction and organic content were extracted from a digital soil grids database fig 2b c 2d and 2e the data were further downscaled by using a resampling mean method from 250 m to 100 m resolution to avoid loss of data the data were extracted for the subsoil at the depth of 30 200 cm for the percentage of sand silt clay and organic content of the soil table 1 c groundwater level data gwl the groundwater level data at 1350 locations for the years 1996 2016 were acquired from the central ground water board fig 2f table 1 the groundwater level is recorded quarterly in india during the months of january april august and november the annual average was calculated and a continuous raster surface was generated using the inverse distance weighing idw interpolation method e fluvisols fluvisols are genetically young soils in alluvial deposits that are rich in iron bearing minerals fao 1999 these types of soils are found to be associated with cooccurrences of as stuckey et al 2016 they are supposed to provide a similar environment as holocene sediments podgorski et al 2017 the dataset for the fluvisol soils table 1 was downscaled to 100 m fig 2g f lulc land use land cover lulc data were extracted using landsat 8 satellite imagery for the year 2017 table 1 by performing an isodata unsupervised classification algorithm in erdas imagine 14 the output consisted of 8 major lulc classes present in the region fig 2h 2 3 development of hybrid random forest model for as prediction random forest is a machine learning algorithm based on the generation of many decision trees and their assemblage to produce a final output breiman 2001 each output from the decision tree is dependent on the values of a random vector that is sampled independently from the same distribution of all decision trees generated in the forest the number of predictors used to find the best split at each node is randomly chosen from a subset of all the predictors among the ensemble classifiers random forest best accounts for the nature of different input predictors efficiently random forest is also insensitive to noise outliers and overtraining which reduces the chances of bias in the data it is computationally less intensive than other boosting based ensemble and simple bagging methods breiman 2001 this model is used where complex processes act as controlling factors for the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any dependent variable and thus helps in identifying the controlling factors sources and processes to implement the model the number of decision trees in the ensemble was generated at each node the classification model repeatedly split the dependent variable as over independent variables resulting in the highest variance of the dependent variable breiman 2001 the number of bins was determined using sturges formula and the bin width was varied so each bin contained the same number of members the data were consolidated to focus on the fundamental criterion of whether the concentration of as poses a health hazard in addition a univariate logistic regression was run with each variable and the significance of the coefficient was assessed through its p value as shown in table 3 the numbers of bins were calculated to categorize a continuous numerical variable which was found to be 10 since classification accuracy is more sensitive to independent variables the number of decision tree was fixed at a default value of 1500 and independent variables were tested for 10 values this parameter tuning process was iterated 4 times and repeated for a 20 fold cross validation process breiman 2001 to reach the maximum configuration of the model output the modeling was performed with training and then testing datasets random forest was applied using the raster and caret package within r ver 3 5 1 open source statistical software team r 2016 2 4 comparison with other predictive models in this study we evaluated the performance of hybrid random forest model with univariate logistic regression mode lrm fuzzy adaptive fuzzy regression afr and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the model comparison would indicate the best fit model that can be used for predictive modeling with best outputs in the region the univariate model is used to understand the simple relationship between dependent and independent variables however this only takes direct association or disassociation into account which makes it less comprehensive in nature the lrm involves categorization of the dependent variable which can either be above or below a threshold value however there is a significant disadvantage for using it with continuous variables dummer et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 furthermore lrm results could be difficult to accurately decipher the solid relationship among the different independent variables fuzzy regression models can only address uncertainty in the rules individually rodriguez lado et al 2013 and lack the capability for learning and adapting to a new set of input and output datasets therefore the afr takes into account both uncertainty in the rules and capability for learning and adapting in the processes however anfis was found to work better than the previous methods as it was a powerful means to solve the complex and nonlinear relations using either binary or categorical variables tesoriero et al 2017 to resolve the complexity among the dependent and independent datasets the hybrid random forest model was used in this study the hybrid random forest model takes account of the relationships and can directly incorporate the potentially significant binary or categorical or continuous factors breiman 2001 all other modeling procedures including the retaining or discarding of models are based on the hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit test and the weighting and averaging of coefficients 2 5 accuracy assessment and sensitivity analysis the diagnostic statistics used for assessing the accuracy of the interpolation were root mean square error rmse and standardized root mean square rms given in eq i and ii i rmse 1 n i 1 n z i a c t z i e s t 2 ii standardized rms 1 n i 1 n 1 s 2 z i a c t z i e s t 2 r m s e s where z i a c t is the actual values for as z i e s t is the estimated or predicted values for as s is the standard deviation and s2 is the variance among the datasets for n number of data points the method yielding smaller rmse and a standardized rms value close to 1 is an optimal method winkel et al 2008a b the validation process is different from cross validation since it depends on the subset of the dataset the dataset was divided into two groups one for model development as a training dataset and the other for testing the accuracy using a testing dataset the model has been validated using training and testing datasets bretzler et al 2017 2 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to test the performance of the models in the forward selection stepwise technique the incremental change in the r2 values is an indication of the significance of sensitivity of the output to each newly introduced predictor variable the performance of a prediction model was determined by its true positive rate sensitivity and true negative rate specificity iii s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n 100 iv s p e c i f i c i t y t n t n f p 100 v o v e r a l l a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f p f n t n 100 sensitivity measures the model s ability to correctly classify groundwater samples with as 10 μg l true positive tp whereas specificity measures the model s ability to correctly classify samples with as 10 μg l true negative tn using eq iii and iv in general a true positive tp value is an outcome when the model accurately predicts the positive class correspondingly a true negative tn value is an outcome when the model accurately predicts the negative class and a false positive fp value is a result when the model inaccurately predicts the positive class a false negative fn is a result when the model inaccurately predicts the negative class value the classification results of the as prediction model under different probability cutoff values mostly show that sensitivity is inversely related to specificity berg et al 2001 a plot of sensitivity against specificity for all the outputs of model cutoff values between 0 and 1 draws a receiver operating characteristic roc curve the area under the curve auc value must be above 0 5 no predictive capability and 1 best predictive capability tesoriero et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of model proxies the highest positive weighing coefficient table 3 for geology λ 4 71 indicates that geology plays a major role in as enrichment in aquifers shallow aquifers with holocene deposits in regions with low slope gradients are found to have high as shamsudduha et al 2008 the holocene sedimentary deposits λ 5 12 provide a chemically reducing environment in the floodplains of rivers thus enriching aquifers with as mcarthur et al 2004 2008 the holocene organic rich alluvial deposits have been found to be statistically significant in other studies lado et al 2008 winkel et al 2011 furthermore geochemical analytical studies have found that the sediments belonging to newer alluvium are high in concentrations of as and fe simultaneously kirchner et al 1998 saha and sahu 2016 moreover x ray diffraction xrd of newer and older alluvium sediments reveal mineral assemblages of quartz chlorite muscovite montmorillonite kaolinite and feldspar shah 2010 however newer alluvium minerals have amphibole and goethite minerals which are rich in fe shah 2010 therefore handpumps installed over newer alluvial deposits are more prone to as contamination minerals rich in fe are found to adsorb as onto their surfaces and release it into groundwater under different geochemical environments naseem et al 2018 the fluvisols are soils that are genetically rich in iron minerals and depict an alluvial setting under the influence of reducing conditions the as adsorbed on the iron oxyhydroxide feooh surfaces is released in groundwater the fluvisols show a high weighing coefficient of λ 1 12 table 3 and the studies in the middle gangetic plains show a strong correlation between as and fe berg et al 2001 mcarthur et al 2008 the reducing conditions in the groundwater are initiated by the microbially mediated decay of dissolved organic carbon doc harvey et al 2002 and the mobilization of as by humic and fluvic acids which plays an important role in mineral degradation and metal mobilization of feooh experimental studies by sharma et al 2010 verified that both fluvic acids and humic acids adhere strongly to metal oxides and clay minerals which displaces as from metal oxide and mineral surfaces sharma et al 2010 therefore doc which comprises the organic matter fraction of subsoil with λ 1 41 table 3 is embedded in the sediments and past drainage in the region plays a vital role in as release by generating favorable redox conditions mazumder et al 2016 further experimental evidence mcarthur et al 2001 in the bengal basin suggests that aquifers are separated from overlying silt λ 1 75 soils these aquifers are separated by underlying paleosol formations hoque et al 2012 mcarthur et al 2011 which are rich in clay content λ 2 23 and a source of organic carbon these conditions initiate reducing conditions in the aquifer which are favorable for as enrichment in groundwater this as rich groundwater interacts with gray sands λ 2 34 which have already undergone reduction table 1 the as containing groundwater supplies organic carbon through the clay layer the downward movement of this as rich water leads to further contamination of deep aquifers mcarthur et al 2001 silt was found to be inversely associated with as contamination λ 1 75 a higher percentage of silt represents the transport and deposition of fresh materials in the river basin ahmed et al 2004 silt could also be produced by mechanical weathering of soils as it is highly reactive the silt has active silicate sites and as readily adheres to these sites thereby decreasing its concentration in groundwater therefore silt can provide active sites for adsorption of as species chakraborti et al 2002 the results also show that the areas closer to the rivers are more susceptible to contamination with as thus the subsoil composition with different fractions of sand silt and clay plays a vital role in the enrichment of as in aquifers studies suggest that increased flooded irrigation leads to as contamination bhattacharya et al 2006 harvey et al 2002 nickson et al 2005 there has been an increase in groundwater use for irrigation from 54 31 to 72 16 from 2000 to 2009 gwp 2013 rice wheat bajra barley and maize crops in the state of uttar pradesh have dominantly been irrigated roychowdhury et al 2005 found that surface soils have lower as levels than subsurface soils lulc with a weighing factor of λ 0 74 was found to be a significant proxy variable within the subclasses for lulc cropland λ 0 67 was found to be the most significant contributing factor these are in agreement with most of the variables found to be significant with other prediction models berg et al 2016 groundwater from private and government wells is used to irrigate 101 61 lakh hectares which comprises 73 58 of the total cultivated area of the state roy and ahmad 2015 this is dominantly planted with wheat 37 90 rice 22 83 millet 3 57 maize 2 68 sorghum 0 69 and barley 0 64 roy and ahmad 2015 excessive cultivation of rice acts as a barrier to the inflow of oxygen into the subsurface aquifer due to flooded irrigation a dominant practice in the region and provides a favorable reducing environment resulting in as release van geen et al 2013 the over extraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes has disturbed the hydrological balance of the aquifers resulting in fluctuating groundwater levels rasool et al 2016 the groundwater level in the region λ 2 12 suggests similar exploitation trends with significant table 3 p values 0 034 the groundwater fluctuation results in subsequent changes in the geochemical environment of the aquifer the groundwater level initiates the reduction of sulfide rich minerals mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria harvey et al 2005 depending on this biogeochemical behavior and changes in the redox conditions of aquifers the solubility of as is affected resulting in as contamination of the groundwater mukherjee et al 2006 irrigation might result in higher evapotranspiration and slow infiltration through young alluvial sediments thus increasing the groundwater as concentration podgorski et al 2017 3 2 hybrid random forest model eight significant p 0 05 independent variables table 3 were used in the hybrid random forest model to predict as contamination in the groundwater of uttar pradesh fig 3 a fig 3b depicts the binary map of as prediction which shows areas at low 10 μg l and high risk 10 μg l the hybrid random forest model prediction is in agreement with the existing spatial distribution of groundwater as contamination of the 1473 binary recoded as concentration data points greater than or equal to 10 μg l 85 are correctly predicted by the hybrid random forest model fig 3b more precisely 73 of the groundwater samples with as concentrations greater than or equal to 10 μg l are correctly predicted sensitivity whereas 97 of the groundwater samples with as concentrations less than 10 μg l are appropriately predicted specificity the performance of the hybrid random forest model was evaluated using roc and auc auc is a measure of the model performance with values typically varying between 0 5 and 1 naghibi et al 2016 the auc value for the hybrid random forest model is 0 755 fig 4 a with an overall accuracy of 84 6 along with rms and rmse values of 0 014 and 0 006 table 4 a cutoff value of 0 61 was used based on the intersection of specificity and sensitivity so that predictive accuracy is not biased towards either high or low as values fig 4b similar cut off values are obtained for the testing and overall datasets the auc value for the test dataset is 0 74 with an overall accuracy of 86 29 table 5 the specificity of the test dataset 95 6 is similar to that of the training dataset 95 7 the true negative rate indicates the ability of the model to correctly predict the little contaminated areas and considers the robustness of the model the high true positive rate indicates that the model is more sensitive to delineating the unsafe areas the overall accuracy of the hybrid random forest model for the total data points n 1473 together with the training 80 and testing 20 datasets fig 4a is 84 67 which is calculated using eq v the findings are also evident from the results of ravenscroft et al 2009 moreover the auc values for the univariate lrm fuzzy afr and anfis models are found to be 0 49 0 54 0 45 0 59 and 0 71 respectively with an overall prediction accuracy of 40 6 67 3 as shown in table 5 the fuzzy model performance was least 40 as fuzzy alone is very unstable and very sensitive to resampling maiti and tiwari 2014 the performance of lrm was found to be 53 9 the input dilutes the variability of independent variables anfis 67 3 is preferred over afr 56 9 due to its greater robustness and flexibility which caters to the complexity of hydrogeochemical conditions thus the hybrid random forest model with an accuracy of 84 67 performs much better than the models used in other prediction studies cao et al 2018 rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008a b zhang et al 2012 the ensemble hybrid random forest model involves an unlimited number of decision tree formations along with the flexibility to incorporate expert knowledge of the aquifer environments and generates robust output with high accuracy 3 3 prediction map of as the hybrid random forest ensemble model identifies seven districts of uttar pradesh namely ballia chauhan et al 2009 gorakhpur singh et al 2018 ghazipur kumar et al 2010 gonda cgwb 2014 faizabad barabanki and lakhimpur kheri as high risk regions with prediction probabilities of 0 8 1 0 fig 5 a the majority of these areas lie in the floodplains of the ganga rapti and ghaghra rivers fig 1 studies involving geochemical analysis have found that groundwater in these areas is contaminated with high as these soils are rich in organic content that seeps into groundwater creating reducing conditions and thus impacting the solubility of as bearing minerals the organic content that seeps down is used in microbial reduction which leads to the reduction of as bearing iron oxyhydroxides resulting in the subsequent release of as these findings are in accordance with previous geochemical studies that confirmed the presence of high as in groundwater in these districts ahamed et al 2006 chauhan et al 2009 singh et al 2018 nevertheless this result suggests that the districts of barabanki and gonda are high risk regions and require blanket testing to confirm as contamination of groundwater the districts of shahjahanpur unnao chauhan et al 2012 chanduali varanasi cgwb 2014 pratapgarh kushinagar mau balrampur deoria and siddharth nagar were found to be under moderate risk of as contamination with prediction probabilities of 0 6 0 8 fig 5a however no exhaustive study has been performed in these moderately predicted high risk areas except unnao and varanasi fig 5a also highlights nine districts baghpat meerut ghaziabad mathura agra firozabad jhansi fatehpur and banda with probabilities of 0 4 0 6 for predicted as furthermore 28 districts with low risk are also demarcated with probabilities lying within 0 1 0 4 the areas underlain by pleistocene deposits were found to be safe with low risk probabilities of 0 0 1 the pleistocene older alluvium is characterized by sediments of yellow to brown color having fewer reduced iron fe ii concretions that do not provide as adsorption sites which results in as safe groundwater the remaining 16 districts are at no risk of as contamination 3 4 population affected in high risk regions the probability map of fig 5a shows the severity of as contamination in the groundwater of uttar pradesh the probabilities are grouped to prepare an arsenic hazard map with high moderate low and no risk zones indicating a probability of as between 80 and 100 60 80 10 60 and 10 in addition there are regions of predicted high as concentrations that are below the statistically determined probability cutoff of 61 and have been used to calculate high risk regions which would estimate population density more accurately for densely populated areas uttar pradesh is the most densely populated state of india with a total population of 199 million census of india 2011 out of the total population of uttar pradesh 155 million people 77 73 live in rural areas mdws report 2011 without access to piped water and rely mostly on groundwater for their drinking and domestic needs the population density of uttar pradesh varies from 242 to 3917 people km2 census of india 2011 accordingly 23 48 million people in rural areas are exposed to high as since they are dependent on groundwater for drinking cooking and irrigation fig 5b this number has been calculated using the following equation vi which signifies a linear function relationship between predicted as probabilities and population density to identify the actual population exposed to high as vi population exposed rural population of area predicted probability of as the risk map indicates the need for widespread testing of wells in the regions of uttar pradesh to help reduce the long term exposure of the people residing in populated clusters with 180 2271 people km2 within these identified regions districts such as ballia varanasi gazipur gorakhpur faizabad and deoria are evidently experiencing a public health crisis due to as exposure the map shown in fig 5b also indicates that out of a total of 72 districts 40 are exposed to high as in groundwater especially districts located in the northeastern parts of the state the present findings confirm the widespread as contamination in uttar pradesh 4 policy implications well switching the result of the study subsumes an elaborative demarcation for high and low as risk areas in the state of uttar pradesh the outputs from hybrid random forest model highlights the high risk areas where as testing can be prioritized by the government or non governmental organizations thus the prediction maps can be used as a guide for government and policymakers to downscale their sites of action and provide interventions in the affected regions a blanket testing in the affected areas using as field kits which are reliable to demarcate safe and unsafe wells would be first step to reduce the exposure nickson et al 2007 on a long term basis use of filters other arsenic removal techniques and piped water supply are the most viable solution the costs and logistic of treating and supplying water are considerably higher and most of the times have been prohibitive due to logistics its operation and maintenance issues well switching has been found to be a significant short term mitigation option in as affected areas however the viability of well switching is based on blanket testing of well in these regions in bihar barnwal et al 2017 have tried to address this problem by demonstrating the ability of safe well sharing among neighbors barnwal et al 2017 this is an example of indulging handpump owners into a social network leading to safe drinking water regular interventions after baseline survey resulted into 30 5 higher switching to a safer well a similar pattern of switching results of 26 41 was obtained in bangladesh george et al 2012a b stressing community participation the approach is very reasonable and economical however the neighbor with a safe well needs to be compensated in some economical and logistical way for the sharing of well 5 conclusion the study highlights the threat of arsenic in groundwater of the most populous state of india in the indo gangetic basin the as hazard map can be used as a baseline to identify the regions where the targeted blanket testing of handpumps and mitigation measures are urgently required blanket testing of wells in high risk regions would inform households about safe and unsafe wells handpumps once safe and unsafe wells are identified people can be informed to switch to safe wells for drinking and cooking purposes however if higher percentages of wells are unsafe then options for centralized treatment such as reverse osmosis systems or deep well installation can be explored spatial variation of arsenic is very high even within a single village because of highly heterogeneous aquifers in the region since this prediction is not able to account for small scale variations specific regions could be called upon to reduce the poisoning of the population similar approaches for as prediction modeling with high accuracy can be emulated at the national scale to identify the regions at risk with higher accuracy a hazard map at the national scale in india can be considered to create awareness in high risk regions and accordingly plan mitigation strategies declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the fellowship provided by university grant commission to

18766,biochars are low cost and environmental friendly materials which are promising in wastewater treatment in this study biochars were manufactured from c phycocyanin extracted c cp spirulina residue sdbc via thermal pyrolysis simultaneously n doping was also achieved from the protein in the algae for obtaining a high performance carbocatalyst for peroxydisulfate pds activation the sdbc yielded large specific surface areas nitrogen loading and good conductivity which demonstrated excellent oxidation efficiencies toward a wide array of aqueous microcontaminants an in depth mechanistic study was performed by integrating selective radical scavenging solvent exchange h2o to d2o diverse organic probes and electrochemical measurement unveiling that sdbc pds did not rely on free radicals or singlet oxygen but a nonradical pathway pds intimately was bonded with a biochar sdbc 900 acid pyrolysis at 900 c to form a surface reactive complex that subsequently attacked an organic sulfamethoxazole smx adsorbed on the biochar via an electron transfer regime during this process the sdbc 900 acid played versatile roles in pds activation organic accumulation and mediating the electron shuttle from smx to pds this nonradical system can maintain a superior oxidation efficiency in complicated water matrix and long term stable operation more importantly the nonradical species in sdbc 900 acid pds system were capable of inactivating the bacteria escherichia coli in wastewater therefore the biochar based nonradical system can provide a mild and high efficiency strategy for disinfection in waste and drinking water by green carbocatalysis this study provides not only a value added biochar catalyst for wastewater purification but also the first insight into the bacteria inactivation via nonradical oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar peroxydisulfate nonradical carbocatalysis bacteria inactivation 1 introduction recently cyanobacteria become the raising star in the microbiota community because they can be cultivated in non portable water without competing with food crops for fertile land meanwhile they help to reducing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere via photosynthesis chen et al 2017b ho et al 2011 moreover the cyanobacteria biomass can be converted into various value added products such as biofuels cosmetic food nutraceutical and pharmacological chemicals ho et al 2018 raja et al 2016 sarsekeyeva et al 2015 spirulina is of particular favorite in food science and medicine it is composed of many valuable compounds such as c phycocyanin c pc nearly 10 15 of the dry weight lipids 6 13 and carbohydrates 15 20 borowitzka 2013 chaiklahan et al 2018 papadaki et al 2017 it has been reported that c pc can effectively prevent cancer modulate lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms and indirectly control the onset of chronic diseases chang et al 2018 eriksen 2008 kuddus et al 2013 however c pc extraction from spirulina has to use media containing large amounts of inorganic salts such as calcium chloride citric acid sodium hypochlorite and disodium hydrogen phosphate which unfortunately prevent the residue to be used as an animal feed or fertilizer to reduce the cost of downstream process after the c pc extraction we firstly demonstrate that spirulina residue can be directly converted into functional biochar via thermal pyrolysis for water treatment biochar is a low cost easy accessible and environmental friendly carbonaceous material and can be produced from a wide array of biomass wastes with tunable specific surface areas ssas and surface functional groups as the pyrolysis temperature is elevated the carbon content aromaticity surface ph ssas and zeta potential ζ of biochar can be simultaneously regulated previous studies have indicated that algae derived biochar can be used for adsorptive and catalytic removal of pollutants chen et al 2018c nautiyal et al 2016 in addition many strategies have been applied to optimize the physicochemical properties of biochar in environmental applications for instance the ssas and porosity of biochar can be improved by inducing pore forming agents zncl2 nh4cl etc and nitrogen modification can also be instantaneously achieved by adding organic inorganic n precursors during the thermal pyrolysis a myriad of microspores can be created in carbon nanosheets by etching in naclo solution cui et al 2018 in this study the inorganic salts in spirulina residue can act as natural pore forming agents to increase the ssas and porosity without inducing extra chemical agents the n containing protein in spirulina can be directly used as a nitrogen source to achieve the n doping additionally for the first time we demonstrate that the nonradical pathway in the sdbc 900 acid peroxydisulfate pds system can effectively kill bacteria in water this work provides a green and low cost strategy for recycling and converting spirulina residue to n doped and porous graphitic biochar catalysts to build an integrated oxidation system for simultaneous contaminant purification and disinfection in wastewater treatment recently sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are gaining increasing popularity in water restoration because so4 possesses a longer half life 30 40 μs and a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v chen et al 2018a duan et al 2018a matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 sulfate radicals can be produced from persulfate salts such as peroxymonosulfate pms and pds oh et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 pds is cheaper with a more stable chemical structure and the activation requires destruction of the symmetric peroxide o o in so3 o o so3 xiao et al 2018a carbonaceous materials e g carbon nanotubes nanodiamonds and reduced graphene oxides have been evidenced as appealing metal free catalysts for pds activation attributed to their higher ssas porous structures defective edges and oxygen functional groups duan et al 2018b liang et al 2017 moreover a rational modification of carbon nanomaterials with heteroatom dopants such as b n s and p can effectively improve the carbocatalysis in pds activation xiao et al 2018a however nanocarbon catalysts are still limited to their high cost in manufacture toward practical wastewater treatment in this regard graphitic biochars stand out as promising candidates with tunable carbon structure and surface chemistry to the best of our knowledge the catalytic performance of spirulina residue derived biochar sdbc has not yet been explored this study aims to utilize spirulina residue to produce n doped and porous graphitic biochars to catalyze pds activation and to identify the physicochemical properties of sdbcs at different pyrolysis temperatures additionally the change of salt compositions structure and surface chemistry in sdbcs were explored including hierarchical porous architecture n doping and conductivity of sdbc before and after acid washing the mechanisms of pds activation by carbon based catalysts are still under debate regarding the radical and nonradical oxidation pathways therefore in this study we systematically explored the mechanism of pds activation on sdbcs via diverse methods such as selective radical quenching solvent exchange h2o to d2o selectivity toward specific organic probes and in situ electrochemical measurements more importantly the sdbc pds system was examined for antibacterial activity by colony forming fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem this work provides a green and low cost strategy for recycling and converting spirulina residue to n doped and porous graphitic biochar catalysts to build an integrated oxidation system for simultaneous contaminant purification and disinfection in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sulfamethoxazole smx phenol sulfathiazole stz carbamazepine cmp furfuryl alcohol ffa bisphenol a bpa benzoic acid ba and potassium persulfate pds were purchased from sigma aldrich methanol meoh and tert butanol tba of 99 purity were received from tedia and ficher all the chemicals were received without further purification phycocyanin was commercially extracted from spirulina by adding 50 kg spirulina dry algae powder and 1200 kg water during the dissolution the temperature was controlled below 18 c with additions of 20 30 kg calcium chloride 3 5 kg citric acid and 20 ml sodium hypochlorite the mixture was first stirred for 3 5 h and maintained for 8 h then 15 20 kg of disodium hydrogen phosphate was added and stirred for another 12 h to yield phycocyanin and spirulina residues 2 2 preparation and characterization of biochars sdbc was prepared by pyrolysis of spirulina residue at 400 700 and 900 c under anoxygenous atmosphere with a n2 flow rate of 100 ml min 1 for 90 min and a heating rate of 15 c min 1 the derived products were rinsed with 5 m hydrochloric acid filtered and washed with deionized water before drying in an oven the ashes were derived by annealing the biochar under air ambience at 600 c for 120 min the weight percentages of c h and n in the sdbc were measured via an elemental analyzer vario microcube bruker germany the weight percentage of o was calculated by o wt 100 c wt h wt n wt ash wt the black powders were ground finely and denoted as sdbc 400 700 and 900 accordingly sem sigma500 zeiss germany was used to analyze the micro morphological images of the biochars and bacteria with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x max50 oxford england ssas were analyzed on a micrometrics tristar instrument bet jw bk132f jwgb sci tech china fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum one perkinelmer usa was used to identify the surface functional groups of sdbc with a wavenumber region of 400 4000 cm 1 x ray powder diffraction xrd x pert rro mpd panalytical holland was used to examine the crystallinity of sdbc over a 2θ collection range of 10 90 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps esca lab 250xi thermo usa was performed to analyze the surface compositions of sdbcs within a depth of 10 nm 2 3 smx degradation experiments the experiments were carried out in a batch reactor with a mixture of smx catalyst and pds at each time interval the aqueous solution was filtered mixed with methanol and then injected into a hplc vial hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa the concentrations of smx phenol sulfathiazole stz carbamazepine cmp furfuryl alcohol ffa bisphenol a bpa and benzoic acid ba were quantified by hplc a uv vis spectrophotometer uvmini 1240 shimadzu japan was used to determine the concentration of orange g og under a wavelength of 504 nm in addition the radical species in sdbc pds system were identified by using different quenching agents such as methanol chloroform cf and p benzoquinone p bq 2 4 electrochemical measurements sdbc powder and isopropanol were mixed in ethanol for 4 h the mixed suspension was loaded in a graphite paper electrode the electrode was dried at 80 c overnight in a vacuum oven the electrochemical tests were performed with a three electrode configuration in 0 5 m na2so4 solution using a graphite rod as the counter electrode saturated calomel electrode as the reference the liner sweep voltammetry lsv chronoamperometric measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were performed on a vmp 3 instrument bio logic sa france 2 5 experimental procedure of disinfection escherichia coli e coli was used as the model gram negative bacterium to assess the antibacterial performance of sdbc 900 acid pds system the bacteria were cultured in a luria bertani lb nutrient solution at 37 c for 24 h the culture medium was then washed using distilled water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm under shaking and then washed with 0 8 nacl sterile water the bacteria were added into a sterilized aqueous solution under different experimental conditions the conditions of sdbc pds system for the sterilization were set as follows firstly sdbc 900 acid was dispersed in 50 ml water with addition of 1 ml diluted bacterial solution under magnetic stirring at room temperature then 6 mm pds was added into the solution to trigger the reaction after 10 min and 90 min reaction the mixture solution was taken and diluted with sterilized water and then 0 1 ml solution was uniformly dispersed onto an agar plate the plate was placed into an incubator at 37 c for 24 h similarly the control experiments including e coli pds and sdbc 900 acid alone were also conducted respectively the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular probes l 7012 together with a fluorescence microscope bx53 olympus oberkochen japan was performed to reveal the viability of bacterial cells 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of sdbcs the elemental analysis and bet surface areas of sdbcs by different treatments were displayed in table 1 the contents of c h and n decreased significantly with the raising pyrolysis temperatures from 400 to 900 c and the corresponding elemental contents increased after acid washing for sdbc 900 acid due to the synthesis the protein in algae could be decomposed into amine compounds or nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds at medium pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 500 c parnaudeau and dignac 2007 which contributed to the n dopants in sdbcs the carbonization degree was analyzed based on the molar ratio of h c in biochar the higher temperatures would result in a lower h c value carbonization and aromaticity degree of biochar chen et al 2018b nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed to investigate the textural characteristics of sdbc table 1 and fig s1a the ssas of sdbcs improved from 67 0 m2 g 1 to 117 9 m2 g 1 thanks to the volatilization of tar compounds under high temperature pyrolysis after the acid pickling a jumping improvement of ssas was observed in sdbc 900 acid 370 1 m2 g 1 due to the removal of inorganic salts and creation of a porous carbon framework crystalline structure and surface morphology of sdbcs were revealed by sem in fig 1 the sdbc 400 presented some deep tunnels fig 1a as the temperature increased a wealth of stick like crystals appeared on the surface of the biochar fig 1b which were the precipitated inorganic salts such as calcium phosphate from spirulina residue when the temperature rose to 900 c the salt nanocrystals melted and agglomerated into larger blocks fig 1c sdbc 900 acid displayed a myriad of micro meso pores figs 1d s1b and s1c which is in accordance with the enlarged ssas since the spirulina residue was derived from the phycocyanin extracted biomass together with large amounts of inorganic chemicals these inorganic salts may function as natural pore forming agents to produce a hierarchically porous structure eds was then performed to analyze the elemental distribution on the surface of sdbc 900 and sdbc 900 acid fig s2 shows that c o n ca and p were detected the crystalline phases of sdbcs were further affirmed by the xrd patterns fig s3a the peaks observed at 26 58 28 68 and 30 38 are the characteristic peaks of γ ca2p2o7 for sdbc 400 and 700 γ ca2p2o7 was converted to β ca2p2o7 at 900 c with lattice parameters of a 6 685 å and c 24 147 å with four distinct crystallographic sites of ca2 hill et al 2012 jain et al 2017 kolay et al 2018 wang et al 2014 yang and wang 1998 only one dominant peak at 26 66 was observed for sdbc 900 acid which could be attributed to the graphitic carbon fig s3b shows the ftir spectra of sdbcs the peaking regions of 1220 1130 1100 940 and 700 500 cm 1 can be assigned to the p o asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations the peak intensities increased at the higher temperatures the surface chemical compositions of the biochars were analyzed by xps figs s3c and s4 the xps survey spectra showed the distinct c 1s peak at 284 8 ev o 1s peak at 530 1 ev and n 1s peak at 400 ev the n spectra were divided into four peaks at 405 3 ev oxidized n 401 5 ev graphitic n 397 9 ev pyrrolic n and 395 1 ev pyridinic n the content of graphitic n was increased from 5 4 at sdbc 400 to 14 7 at sdbc 900 acid which might be ascribed to the better thermal stability and transformation from other nitrogen species the c 1s envelop of sdbc could be deconvoluted into three contributions of c c and cc 284 8 ev c oh 285 7 ev and co 287 9 ev the ketonic oxygen co slightly increased in sdbc 900 12 73 at compared to sdbc 400 11 8 at in fig s5 due to the transformation from unstable c o groups shao et al 2018 additionally c c cc content was increased from 52 1 at sdbc 400 to 56 8 at sdbc 900 implying a higher graphitization degree of biochar raman spectra of sdbc exhibited typical d band 1320 1350 cm 1 and g band 1570 1585 cm 1 which were related to the defective sites in graphitic carbons and the sp2 bond stretching vibrations respectively kang et al 2018 pan et al 2014 thus the intensity ratio of id ig can represent the defective degree originated from the edges and vacancies in sdbc the id ig values reduced from 0 91 to 0 79 with the increased temperatures from 400 to 900 c fig s3d suggesting that the thermal pyrolysis could result in well ordered and highly graphitic carbons 3 2 smx degradation performance smx was chosen as the target pollutant to assess the catalytic performance of sdbc in pds activation in fig 2 the adsorption of smx by sdbc slightly increased with the rising temperatures and the maximum removal 32 9 was achieved by sdbc 900 acid the adsorption capacity depends on both the characteristics of pollutants and surface chemistry of biochar the adsorption mechanisms include electrostatic attraction hydrophobic interaction pore filling adsorption partition ion exchange and or π π interactions xiao et al 2018b xu et al 2017 herein the highly graphitic structure of sdbc 900 facilitated the π π interactions between the aromatic ring of smx and carbon surface ahmed et al 2017 thus sdbc 900 acid with a higher porosity and larger ssas can provide more adsorption sites for smx as shown in fig 2 pds without activation could oxidize less than 4 of smx whereas sdbc could effectively activate pds for rapid smx degradation compared with 33 0 and 84 9 smx removals on sdbc 400 and 700 sdbc 900 led to a faster smx degradation with complete smx removal in 45 min the metal free sdbc 900 acid was also an effective pds activator which even surpassed the benchmark zero valent iron zvi pds system fig s6 in order to explore the role of inorganic salts in preparation of biochar hydrochloric acid was used to clean the salts in the spirulina residue the desalted residue was pyrolyzed at 900 c and denoted as sdbc 900 a fig s7 shows that sdbc 900 a could barely catalyze pds with only 5 2 smx removal in contrast the desalted residue was re added with the salts same as the compositions in the phycocyanin extraction procedure and pyrolyzed at 900 c as sdbc 900 a1 to our delight over 90 of smx could be degraded in sdbc 900 a1 pds system therefore the inorganic salts e g calcium chloride citric acid sodium hypochlorite and disodium hydrogen phosphate played an important role in preparation of high efficiency biochar catalysts by increasing the ssas and porosity table s1 3 3 mechanism of pds activation by sdbc to investigate the activation mechanism of sdbc pds system chemical scavengers meoh p bq and cf were employed to reveal that the reactive oxygen species ros contributing to smx degradation meoh can quench both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals with high reaction rates k so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 whereas both p bq and cf preferably react with o2 at reaction rates of 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively chen et al 2018a ji et al 2012 kappler et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 the radical inhibitory effect was insignificant for sdbc 400 900 and 900 acid based systems meoh could not terminate the oxidation in sdbc 900 pds even at a high meoh pds molar ratio of 2000 1 fig s8 suggesting that both oh and so4 were not the dominant ros in smx degradation therefore non hydroxyl sulfate radical based oxidation pathways may exist involving other reactive species such as 1o2 o2 or surface confined ros duan et al 2018a 2018b lee et al 2016 oh et al 2016 the inhibitory effect of cf was obvious for sdbc 400 and p bq could partially slow down the reaction rate of sdbc 700 900 and 900 acid the results suggest that a small quantity of o2 might exist in sdbc pds system previous studies reported that the life times of 1o2 in h2o and d2o were 4 2 and 55 μs respectively thus the 1o2 based oxidation should be theoretically enhanced in the d2o solution chen et al 2018a yun et al 2018 however sdbc 900 pds d2o system did not facilitate smx degradation fig s9 suggesting that 1o2 was not the primary ros sdbc 900 pds and sdbc 900 acid pds systems were used to investigate the degradation of different organic pollutants fig 3 ba can be degraded by both so4 k2 ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and oh k2 ba oh 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 however the ba degradation rate constants were lower than 0 003 min 1 confirming that oh and so4 were not produced in contrast other organics such as og phenol stz bpa and smx could be completely removed within 20 30 min lee et al evaluated the organic selectivity of 1o2 produced from photoexcited rose bengal rb and discovered that bpa could not be oxidized by 1o2 yun et al 2018 in this study bpa could be efficiently degraded in sdbc 900 pds and sdbc 900 acid pds systems besides ffa is a 1o2 scavenger with a higher second order rate of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 compared with the targeted phenolic compound 2 0 3 0 106 m 1 s 1 however both sdbc 900 pds and sdbc 900 acid pds systems exhibited faster phenol degradation rates than ffa removal all the evidences suggest that 1o2 is not generated in sdbc pds systems and other nonradical species may be the intrinsic ros in the recently proposed nonradical pathway pds was supposed to be activated by carbocatalysts to form a surface activated complex which is capable of oxidizing the organics via a direct electron transfer through the carbon matrix duan et al 2018a the electron shuttling mechanism was analyzed by the electrochemical measurements including lsv chronoamperometric measurements and esi analysis in fig 4 a d the currents of sdbc 900 acid only slightly changed with the sole addition of pds or pollutants in the lsv analysis while the currents increased significantly with simultaneous additions of pds and different pollutants including smx phenol og and stz the results suggest that the co presence of target organics electron donor and pds electron acceptor is a necessity in the electron mediation regime distinctly the current was not improved when ba and pds were added in as shown in fig 4e therefore except for ba the pollutants of smx phenol og and stz can be oxidized via the nonradical electron transfer mechanism which is consistent with the catalytic degradation in fig 3 the chronoamperometric measurements in fig s10 exhibited a negative current peak which verified the electron transfer process from sdbc 900 acid to pds the carbon network was reported to be able to activate the peroxide o o bond in pds to form a surface attached and metastable pds carbon complex lee et al 2016 yun et al 2017 the introduction of nitrogen dopants into carbon lattice would lead to a redistribution of charge densities among graphitic carbons that are previously immersed in a homogeneous π system yun et al 2018 then pds will strongly bond with the positively charged oxygen atoms around the n dopants to enhance the carbocatalysis duan et al 2015 subsequently the adsorbed smx can be oxidized by offering electrons to the activated pds sdbc complex via a nonradical manner such an electron transfer process was well recorded by in situ electrochemical analysis the current eis is a handy technique to study the charge transfer and electrode ion diffusion processes in electrode materials fig 4f shows the nyquist plots of sdbcs in a three electrode system the semicircle diameter can describe the charge transfer resistance of the electrode materials sdbc 900 presented a much smaller semicircle and a better conductivity than sdbc 400 indicating that the higher pyrolysis temperature assisted to induce a higher graphitic degree and better conductivity which is beneficial for electron transfer after acid treatment the charge transfer resistance of sdbc 900 acid was further decreased due to the removal of inorganic salts therefore electron conductivity of carbon materials is well correlated with their performances in nonradical oxidation suggesting that a higher graphitic degree can synergistically benefit pds activation and electron tunneling process in carbon driven aops 3 4 influences of reaction conditions the implications of diverse background matters were evaluated in sdbc 900 pds system as shown in fig 5 a d inorganic anions e g hco3 no3 cl and so4 2 at different concentrations 0 2 1 g l 1 exhibited marginal effects on inhibiting smt degradation the oxidative system could maintain high smx degradation rate in a wide ph range from 2 to 10 fig 6 a additionally because the higher reaction temperature is favorable for the carbocatalysis from both kinetics and thermodynamics increasing the reaction temperature from 15 to 45 c was advantageous for pds activation and smx degradation fig 6b duan et al 2018a elevating the reaction temperatures may not only enhance the chemisorption of organic pds but also facilitate the electron transfer process between pollutants and pds via the carbocatalyst duan et al 2018a moreover the introduction of natural organic matters such as humic acid ha in a range of 0 40 mg l 1 could barely affect the smx removal efficiency fig 6c to our delight fig 6d depicts that the sdbc 900 pds system could achieve 98 6 and 96 4 of smx oxidation efficiencies when the reaction was performed in actual water systems of songhua river china and wastewater effluents respectively therefore the carbon based nonradical system is much beneficial to remediate complicated wastewater matrix regardless of the complex interferences of background organic and inorganic substances the stability and reusability tests of sdbc 900 were shown in fig s11 the fresh sdbc 900 could remove 100 smx within 90min whereas only 56 80 and 42 51 of smx degradation were yielded in the 2nd and 3rd runs respectively in previous studies the stabilities of carbocatalysts such as graphene activated carbon and carbon nanotubes were typically mediocre in aops duan et al 2015a 2015b the deactivation could be caused by the structural changes including the coverage of intermediate products and the change of pore structure as well as the tuned surface chemistry from carbon oxidation and re fabrication of n dopants duan et al 2018 the degradation efficiency of smx was recovered after thermal treatment of the passivated carbocatalyst at 900 c suggesting that the active sites and porous structures of sdbc 900 could be recovered during the thermal pyrolysis moreover the oxidative system was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor with a continuous flow to estimate the removal of organic contaminants in wastewater effluents it is demonstrated that the active sites and porous structures of sdbc 900 could be well preserved or recovered during pyrolysis process in fig s12 most of smx could be effectively oxidized by the sdbc 900 pds system in a continuous run suggesting the system demonstrated high stability and great potential for long term operations 3 5 efficiency of bacterial inactivation in sdbc 900 acid pds system fig 7 displays e coli sterilization in sdbc 900 acid pds system the bacterial membrane integrity was monitored by a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit the dead e coli with damaged membranes can be dyed and visualized by both syto 9 and pi stains emitting red fluorescence compare to blank group bk in fig 7a the percentage of dead e coli cells slightly increased in the presence of pds only fig 7b and sdbc 900 acid only fig 7c systems in 90 min the final log c c0 values of sterilization were 0 035 and 0 152 in the presence of 2 and 3 mm pds respectively indicating that pds alone could not sterilize e coli effectively zhang et al 2019 in light of the biochar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can be produced during the pyrolysis which may impact the activity of bacterial together with the heavy metal residues the persistent free radicals pfrs in biochar may also cause biotoxicity risk since hydrogen peroxide or even oxygen could be activated by pfr to produce oxidizing free radicals for sterilization fang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 in this work fig s2a indicated that less heavy metals existed in sdbc 900 acid while pahs and pfrs were removed after 500 c by thermal decomposition or evaporation liu et al 2018 nakajima et al 2007 consequently the formation of toxicants in biochar could be inhibited by increasing the annealing temperature to reduce the potential environmental threats hale et al 2012 yang et al 2019 therefore pds and sdbc 900 acid are of low hypotoxicity to the e coli and sdbc 900 acid is a green material with low hazards to the aquatic microorganism in contrast the red fluorescent staining cells emerged upon the addition of sdbc 900 acid and pds in 10 min suggesting that the cell membrane was damaged by sdbc 900 acid pds system fig s13 the ratio of live dead cells obviously decreased in 90 min fig 7d demonstrating an effective inactivation of e coli by carbon catalyzed nonradical oxidation the e coli sterilization from fluorescence analysis is also accordance to the directly counting of the bacterium colonies in plate fig s14 to understand the disruption of the bacterial cell membrane sem images of intact and inactivation e coli cells were compared before the inactivation treatment e coli cells exhibited a well preserved rod shape with smooth surface in fig 7e then some e coli cells membrane manifested a completely disordered broken morphology in fig 7f and g implying that the cell membranes had been destroyed by catalytic oxidation the previous experiment demonstrated that oh so4 and 1o2 were not the dominant ros in aop reaction therefore similar to the organic oxidation the mechanism of e coli inactivation stems from destructor of cell membrane by nonradical electron transfer from the protein to the activated pds on carbon surface sdbc 900 will interact with the wall membrane of e coli during pds activation which would cause the cell inactivation to increase the permeability cell swelling and rupture giving rise to the leakage of cellular components michael kordatou et al 2018 the initial damage of bacterial cell membrane was to the exopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan wall followed by lipid peroxidation as well as protein and polysaccharide oxidation these changes in cell permeability also have negative impacts on cell membrane regulation internal and external exchange capacity dalrymple et al 2010 in previous studies o2 h2o2 and h were confirmed as the main ros for bacterial inactivation in photocatalysis by employing ultrathin carbon coated cobalt ferrite composites as the photocatalysts wang et al 2018 additionally chen et al reported that e coli was mainly inactivated by so4 generated in me ii sulfite systems me mn co fe and cu chen et al 2017a in this study for the first time we demonstrate that the nonradical pathway in sdbc 900 acid pds system is effectively inactivating bacteria in water therefore the biochar based aops can provide a new and green strategy for rapid inactivation of bacteria for wastewater remediation 4 conclusions in this study n doped graphitic biochars were synthesized from spirulina residue after c pc extraction to demonstrate the high salt containing spirulina residue can be perfectly converted into a green carbocatalysts for pds activation and smx oxidation sdbc 900 exhibited larger ssas higher contents of graphitic n and better conductivity compared to those synthesized at low temperatures sdbc 400 and 700 and achieved excellent smx oxidation efficiency the radical quenching tests unveiled that the oxidation capacity of sdbc pds system did not rely on free radicals solvent exchange from h2o to d2o and organic selectivity test indicated that 1o2 was not generated and a nonradical pathway played a crucial role in sdbc pds system the electrochemical measurements demonstrated that pds would intimately bond with the activated carbon atoms in sdbc 900 acid to form a surface reactive complex which subsequently attacks the adsorbed organics via electron transfer during this process sdbc 900 acid played an important role in pds activation and mediating the electron shuttle from smx to pds the biochar based nonradical system achieved outstanding performances in real water matrixes in addition it was found that the nonradical oxidation system was capable of destroying the cell membranes of bacteria leading to their rapid inactivation this study provides a promising strategy to manufacture value added and n doped graphitic biochar derived from the non disposable spirulina

18766,biochars are low cost and environmental friendly materials which are promising in wastewater treatment in this study biochars were manufactured from c phycocyanin extracted c cp spirulina residue sdbc via thermal pyrolysis simultaneously n doping was also achieved from the protein in the algae for obtaining a high performance carbocatalyst for peroxydisulfate pds activation the sdbc yielded large specific surface areas nitrogen loading and good conductivity which demonstrated excellent oxidation efficiencies toward a wide array of aqueous microcontaminants an in depth mechanistic study was performed by integrating selective radical scavenging solvent exchange h2o to d2o diverse organic probes and electrochemical measurement unveiling that sdbc pds did not rely on free radicals or singlet oxygen but a nonradical pathway pds intimately was bonded with a biochar sdbc 900 acid pyrolysis at 900 c to form a surface reactive complex that subsequently attacked an organic sulfamethoxazole smx adsorbed on the biochar via an electron transfer regime during this process the sdbc 900 acid played versatile roles in pds activation organic accumulation and mediating the electron shuttle from smx to pds this nonradical system can maintain a superior oxidation efficiency in complicated water matrix and long term stable operation more importantly the nonradical species in sdbc 900 acid pds system were capable of inactivating the bacteria escherichia coli in wastewater therefore the biochar based nonradical system can provide a mild and high efficiency strategy for disinfection in waste and drinking water by green carbocatalysis this study provides not only a value added biochar catalyst for wastewater purification but also the first insight into the bacteria inactivation via nonradical oxidation graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar peroxydisulfate nonradical carbocatalysis bacteria inactivation 1 introduction recently cyanobacteria become the raising star in the microbiota community because they can be cultivated in non portable water without competing with food crops for fertile land meanwhile they help to reducing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere via photosynthesis chen et al 2017b ho et al 2011 moreover the cyanobacteria biomass can be converted into various value added products such as biofuels cosmetic food nutraceutical and pharmacological chemicals ho et al 2018 raja et al 2016 sarsekeyeva et al 2015 spirulina is of particular favorite in food science and medicine it is composed of many valuable compounds such as c phycocyanin c pc nearly 10 15 of the dry weight lipids 6 13 and carbohydrates 15 20 borowitzka 2013 chaiklahan et al 2018 papadaki et al 2017 it has been reported that c pc can effectively prevent cancer modulate lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms and indirectly control the onset of chronic diseases chang et al 2018 eriksen 2008 kuddus et al 2013 however c pc extraction from spirulina has to use media containing large amounts of inorganic salts such as calcium chloride citric acid sodium hypochlorite and disodium hydrogen phosphate which unfortunately prevent the residue to be used as an animal feed or fertilizer to reduce the cost of downstream process after the c pc extraction we firstly demonstrate that spirulina residue can be directly converted into functional biochar via thermal pyrolysis for water treatment biochar is a low cost easy accessible and environmental friendly carbonaceous material and can be produced from a wide array of biomass wastes with tunable specific surface areas ssas and surface functional groups as the pyrolysis temperature is elevated the carbon content aromaticity surface ph ssas and zeta potential ζ of biochar can be simultaneously regulated previous studies have indicated that algae derived biochar can be used for adsorptive and catalytic removal of pollutants chen et al 2018c nautiyal et al 2016 in addition many strategies have been applied to optimize the physicochemical properties of biochar in environmental applications for instance the ssas and porosity of biochar can be improved by inducing pore forming agents zncl2 nh4cl etc and nitrogen modification can also be instantaneously achieved by adding organic inorganic n precursors during the thermal pyrolysis a myriad of microspores can be created in carbon nanosheets by etching in naclo solution cui et al 2018 in this study the inorganic salts in spirulina residue can act as natural pore forming agents to increase the ssas and porosity without inducing extra chemical agents the n containing protein in spirulina can be directly used as a nitrogen source to achieve the n doping additionally for the first time we demonstrate that the nonradical pathway in the sdbc 900 acid peroxydisulfate pds system can effectively kill bacteria in water this work provides a green and low cost strategy for recycling and converting spirulina residue to n doped and porous graphitic biochar catalysts to build an integrated oxidation system for simultaneous contaminant purification and disinfection in wastewater treatment recently sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are gaining increasing popularity in water restoration because so4 possesses a longer half life 30 40 μs and a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v chen et al 2018a duan et al 2018a matzek and carter 2016 wang and wang 2018 sulfate radicals can be produced from persulfate salts such as peroxymonosulfate pms and pds oh et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 pds is cheaper with a more stable chemical structure and the activation requires destruction of the symmetric peroxide o o in so3 o o so3 xiao et al 2018a carbonaceous materials e g carbon nanotubes nanodiamonds and reduced graphene oxides have been evidenced as appealing metal free catalysts for pds activation attributed to their higher ssas porous structures defective edges and oxygen functional groups duan et al 2018b liang et al 2017 moreover a rational modification of carbon nanomaterials with heteroatom dopants such as b n s and p can effectively improve the carbocatalysis in pds activation xiao et al 2018a however nanocarbon catalysts are still limited to their high cost in manufacture toward practical wastewater treatment in this regard graphitic biochars stand out as promising candidates with tunable carbon structure and surface chemistry to the best of our knowledge the catalytic performance of spirulina residue derived biochar sdbc has not yet been explored this study aims to utilize spirulina residue to produce n doped and porous graphitic biochars to catalyze pds activation and to identify the physicochemical properties of sdbcs at different pyrolysis temperatures additionally the change of salt compositions structure and surface chemistry in sdbcs were explored including hierarchical porous architecture n doping and conductivity of sdbc before and after acid washing the mechanisms of pds activation by carbon based catalysts are still under debate regarding the radical and nonradical oxidation pathways therefore in this study we systematically explored the mechanism of pds activation on sdbcs via diverse methods such as selective radical quenching solvent exchange h2o to d2o selectivity toward specific organic probes and in situ electrochemical measurements more importantly the sdbc pds system was examined for antibacterial activity by colony forming fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem this work provides a green and low cost strategy for recycling and converting spirulina residue to n doped and porous graphitic biochar catalysts to build an integrated oxidation system for simultaneous contaminant purification and disinfection in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sulfamethoxazole smx phenol sulfathiazole stz carbamazepine cmp furfuryl alcohol ffa bisphenol a bpa benzoic acid ba and potassium persulfate pds were purchased from sigma aldrich methanol meoh and tert butanol tba of 99 purity were received from tedia and ficher all the chemicals were received without further purification phycocyanin was commercially extracted from spirulina by adding 50 kg spirulina dry algae powder and 1200 kg water during the dissolution the temperature was controlled below 18 c with additions of 20 30 kg calcium chloride 3 5 kg citric acid and 20 ml sodium hypochlorite the mixture was first stirred for 3 5 h and maintained for 8 h then 15 20 kg of disodium hydrogen phosphate was added and stirred for another 12 h to yield phycocyanin and spirulina residues 2 2 preparation and characterization of biochars sdbc was prepared by pyrolysis of spirulina residue at 400 700 and 900 c under anoxygenous atmosphere with a n2 flow rate of 100 ml min 1 for 90 min and a heating rate of 15 c min 1 the derived products were rinsed with 5 m hydrochloric acid filtered and washed with deionized water before drying in an oven the ashes were derived by annealing the biochar under air ambience at 600 c for 120 min the weight percentages of c h and n in the sdbc were measured via an elemental analyzer vario microcube bruker germany the weight percentage of o was calculated by o wt 100 c wt h wt n wt ash wt the black powders were ground finely and denoted as sdbc 400 700 and 900 accordingly sem sigma500 zeiss germany was used to analyze the micro morphological images of the biochars and bacteria with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x max50 oxford england ssas were analyzed on a micrometrics tristar instrument bet jw bk132f jwgb sci tech china fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum one perkinelmer usa was used to identify the surface functional groups of sdbc with a wavenumber region of 400 4000 cm 1 x ray powder diffraction xrd x pert rro mpd panalytical holland was used to examine the crystallinity of sdbc over a 2θ collection range of 10 90 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps esca lab 250xi thermo usa was performed to analyze the surface compositions of sdbcs within a depth of 10 nm 2 3 smx degradation experiments the experiments were carried out in a batch reactor with a mixture of smx catalyst and pds at each time interval the aqueous solution was filtered mixed with methanol and then injected into a hplc vial hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa the concentrations of smx phenol sulfathiazole stz carbamazepine cmp furfuryl alcohol ffa bisphenol a bpa and benzoic acid ba were quantified by hplc a uv vis spectrophotometer uvmini 1240 shimadzu japan was used to determine the concentration of orange g og under a wavelength of 504 nm in addition the radical species in sdbc pds system were identified by using different quenching agents such as methanol chloroform cf and p benzoquinone p bq 2 4 electrochemical measurements sdbc powder and isopropanol were mixed in ethanol for 4 h the mixed suspension was loaded in a graphite paper electrode the electrode was dried at 80 c overnight in a vacuum oven the electrochemical tests were performed with a three electrode configuration in 0 5 m na2so4 solution using a graphite rod as the counter electrode saturated calomel electrode as the reference the liner sweep voltammetry lsv chronoamperometric measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were performed on a vmp 3 instrument bio logic sa france 2 5 experimental procedure of disinfection escherichia coli e coli was used as the model gram negative bacterium to assess the antibacterial performance of sdbc 900 acid pds system the bacteria were cultured in a luria bertani lb nutrient solution at 37 c for 24 h the culture medium was then washed using distilled water and centrifuged at 3000 rpm under shaking and then washed with 0 8 nacl sterile water the bacteria were added into a sterilized aqueous solution under different experimental conditions the conditions of sdbc pds system for the sterilization were set as follows firstly sdbc 900 acid was dispersed in 50 ml water with addition of 1 ml diluted bacterial solution under magnetic stirring at room temperature then 6 mm pds was added into the solution to trigger the reaction after 10 min and 90 min reaction the mixture solution was taken and diluted with sterilized water and then 0 1 ml solution was uniformly dispersed onto an agar plate the plate was placed into an incubator at 37 c for 24 h similarly the control experiments including e coli pds and sdbc 900 acid alone were also conducted respectively the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular probes l 7012 together with a fluorescence microscope bx53 olympus oberkochen japan was performed to reveal the viability of bacterial cells 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of sdbcs the elemental analysis and bet surface areas of sdbcs by different treatments were displayed in table 1 the contents of c h and n decreased significantly with the raising pyrolysis temperatures from 400 to 900 c and the corresponding elemental contents increased after acid washing for sdbc 900 acid due to the synthesis the protein in algae could be decomposed into amine compounds or nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds at medium pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 500 c parnaudeau and dignac 2007 which contributed to the n dopants in sdbcs the carbonization degree was analyzed based on the molar ratio of h c in biochar the higher temperatures would result in a lower h c value carbonization and aromaticity degree of biochar chen et al 2018b nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed to investigate the textural characteristics of sdbc table 1 and fig s1a the ssas of sdbcs improved from 67 0 m2 g 1 to 117 9 m2 g 1 thanks to the volatilization of tar compounds under high temperature pyrolysis after the acid pickling a jumping improvement of ssas was observed in sdbc 900 acid 370 1 m2 g 1 due to the removal of inorganic salts and creation of a porous carbon framework crystalline structure and surface morphology of sdbcs were revealed by sem in fig 1 the sdbc 400 presented some deep tunnels fig 1a as the temperature increased a wealth of stick like crystals appeared on the surface of the biochar fig 1b which were the precipitated inorganic salts such as calcium phosphate from spirulina residue when the temperature rose to 900 c the salt nanocrystals melted and agglomerated into larger blocks fig 1c sdbc 900 acid displayed a myriad of micro meso pores figs 1d s1b and s1c which is in accordance with the enlarged ssas since the spirulina residue was derived from the phycocyanin extracted biomass together with large amounts of inorganic chemicals these inorganic salts may function as natural pore forming agents to produce a hierarchically porous structure eds was then performed to analyze the elemental distribution on the surface of sdbc 900 and sdbc 900 acid fig s2 shows that c o n ca and p were detected the crystalline phases of sdbcs were further affirmed by the xrd patterns fig s3a the peaks observed at 26 58 28 68 and 30 38 are the characteristic peaks of γ ca2p2o7 for sdbc 400 and 700 γ ca2p2o7 was converted to β ca2p2o7 at 900 c with lattice parameters of a 6 685 å and c 24 147 å with four distinct crystallographic sites of ca2 hill et al 2012 jain et al 2017 kolay et al 2018 wang et al 2014 yang and wang 1998 only one dominant peak at 26 66 was observed for sdbc 900 acid which could be attributed to the graphitic carbon fig s3b shows the ftir spectra of sdbcs the peaking regions of 1220 1130 1100 940 and 700 500 cm 1 can be assigned to the p o asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations the peak intensities increased at the higher temperatures the surface chemical compositions of the biochars were analyzed by xps figs s3c and s4 the xps survey spectra showed the distinct c 1s peak at 284 8 ev o 1s peak at 530 1 ev and n 1s peak at 400 ev the n spectra were divided into four peaks at 405 3 ev oxidized n 401 5 ev graphitic n 397 9 ev pyrrolic n and 395 1 ev pyridinic n the content of graphitic n was increased from 5 4 at sdbc 400 to 14 7 at sdbc 900 acid which might be ascribed to the better thermal stability and transformation from other nitrogen species the c 1s envelop of sdbc could be deconvoluted into three contributions of c c and cc 284 8 ev c oh 285 7 ev and co 287 9 ev the ketonic oxygen co slightly increased in sdbc 900 12 73 at compared to sdbc 400 11 8 at in fig s5 due to the transformation from unstable c o groups shao et al 2018 additionally c c cc content was increased from 52 1 at sdbc 400 to 56 8 at sdbc 900 implying a higher graphitization degree of biochar raman spectra of sdbc exhibited typical d band 1320 1350 cm 1 and g band 1570 1585 cm 1 which were related to the defective sites in graphitic carbons and the sp2 bond stretching vibrations respectively kang et al 2018 pan et al 2014 thus the intensity ratio of id ig can represent the defective degree originated from the edges and vacancies in sdbc the id ig values reduced from 0 91 to 0 79 with the increased temperatures from 400 to 900 c fig s3d suggesting that the thermal pyrolysis could result in well ordered and highly graphitic carbons 3 2 smx degradation performance smx was chosen as the target pollutant to assess the catalytic performance of sdbc in pds activation in fig 2 the adsorption of smx by sdbc slightly increased with the rising temperatures and the maximum removal 32 9 was achieved by sdbc 900 acid the adsorption capacity depends on both the characteristics of pollutants and surface chemistry of biochar the adsorption mechanisms include electrostatic attraction hydrophobic interaction pore filling adsorption partition ion exchange and or π π interactions xiao et al 2018b xu et al 2017 herein the highly graphitic structure of sdbc 900 facilitated the π π interactions between the aromatic ring of smx and carbon surface ahmed et al 2017 thus sdbc 900 acid with a higher porosity and larger ssas can provide more adsorption sites for smx as shown in fig 2 pds without activation could oxidize less than 4 of smx whereas sdbc could effectively activate pds for rapid smx degradation compared with 33 0 and 84 9 smx removals on sdbc 400 and 700 sdbc 900 led to a faster smx degradation with complete smx removal in 45 min the metal free sdbc 900 acid was also an effective pds activator which even surpassed the benchmark zero valent iron zvi pds system fig s6 in order to explore the role of inorganic salts in preparation of biochar hydrochloric acid was used to clean the salts in the spirulina residue the desalted residue was pyrolyzed at 900 c and denoted as sdbc 900 a fig s7 shows that sdbc 900 a could barely catalyze pds with only 5 2 smx removal in contrast the desalted residue was re added with the salts same as the compositions in the phycocyanin extraction procedure and pyrolyzed at 900 c as sdbc 900 a1 to our delight over 90 of smx could be degraded in sdbc 900 a1 pds system therefore the inorganic salts e g calcium chloride citric acid sodium hypochlorite and disodium hydrogen phosphate played an important role in preparation of high efficiency biochar catalysts by increasing the ssas and porosity table s1 3 3 mechanism of pds activation by sdbc to investigate the activation mechanism of sdbc pds system chemical scavengers meoh p bq and cf were employed to reveal that the reactive oxygen species ros contributing to smx degradation meoh can quench both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals with high reaction rates k so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 whereas both p bq and cf preferably react with o2 at reaction rates of 1 5 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively chen et al 2018a ji et al 2012 kappler et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 the radical inhibitory effect was insignificant for sdbc 400 900 and 900 acid based systems meoh could not terminate the oxidation in sdbc 900 pds even at a high meoh pds molar ratio of 2000 1 fig s8 suggesting that both oh and so4 were not the dominant ros in smx degradation therefore non hydroxyl sulfate radical based oxidation pathways may exist involving other reactive species such as 1o2 o2 or surface confined ros duan et al 2018a 2018b lee et al 2016 oh et al 2016 the inhibitory effect of cf was obvious for sdbc 400 and p bq could partially slow down the reaction rate of sdbc 700 900 and 900 acid the results suggest that a small quantity of o2 might exist in sdbc pds system previous studies reported that the life times of 1o2 in h2o and d2o were 4 2 and 55 μs respectively thus the 1o2 based oxidation should be theoretically enhanced in the d2o solution chen et al 2018a yun et al 2018 however sdbc 900 pds d2o system did not facilitate smx degradation fig s9 suggesting that 1o2 was not the primary ros sdbc 900 pds and sdbc 900 acid pds systems were used to investigate the degradation of different organic pollutants fig 3 ba can be degraded by both so4 k2 ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and oh k2 ba oh 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 however the ba degradation rate constants were lower than 0 003 min 1 confirming that oh and so4 were not produced in contrast other organics such as og phenol stz bpa and smx could be completely removed within 20 30 min lee et al evaluated the organic selectivity of 1o2 produced from photoexcited rose bengal rb and discovered that bpa could not be oxidized by 1o2 yun et al 2018 in this study bpa could be efficiently degraded in sdbc 900 pds and sdbc 900 acid pds systems besides ffa is a 1o2 scavenger with a higher second order rate of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 compared with the targeted phenolic compound 2 0 3 0 106 m 1 s 1 however both sdbc 900 pds and sdbc 900 acid pds systems exhibited faster phenol degradation rates than ffa removal all the evidences suggest that 1o2 is not generated in sdbc pds systems and other nonradical species may be the intrinsic ros in the recently proposed nonradical pathway pds was supposed to be activated by carbocatalysts to form a surface activated complex which is capable of oxidizing the organics via a direct electron transfer through the carbon matrix duan et al 2018a the electron shuttling mechanism was analyzed by the electrochemical measurements including lsv chronoamperometric measurements and esi analysis in fig 4 a d the currents of sdbc 900 acid only slightly changed with the sole addition of pds or pollutants in the lsv analysis while the currents increased significantly with simultaneous additions of pds and different pollutants including smx phenol og and stz the results suggest that the co presence of target organics electron donor and pds electron acceptor is a necessity in the electron mediation regime distinctly the current was not improved when ba and pds were added in as shown in fig 4e therefore except for ba the pollutants of smx phenol og and stz can be oxidized via the nonradical electron transfer mechanism which is consistent with the catalytic degradation in fig 3 the chronoamperometric measurements in fig s10 exhibited a negative current peak which verified the electron transfer process from sdbc 900 acid to pds the carbon network was reported to be able to activate the peroxide o o bond in pds to form a surface attached and metastable pds carbon complex lee et al 2016 yun et al 2017 the introduction of nitrogen dopants into carbon lattice would lead to a redistribution of charge densities among graphitic carbons that are previously immersed in a homogeneous π system yun et al 2018 then pds will strongly bond with the positively charged oxygen atoms around the n dopants to enhance the carbocatalysis duan et al 2015 subsequently the adsorbed smx can be oxidized by offering electrons to the activated pds sdbc complex via a nonradical manner such an electron transfer process was well recorded by in situ electrochemical analysis the current eis is a handy technique to study the charge transfer and electrode ion diffusion processes in electrode materials fig 4f shows the nyquist plots of sdbcs in a three electrode system the semicircle diameter can describe the charge transfer resistance of the electrode materials sdbc 900 presented a much smaller semicircle and a better conductivity than sdbc 400 indicating that the higher pyrolysis temperature assisted to induce a higher graphitic degree and better conductivity which is beneficial for electron transfer after acid treatment the charge transfer resistance of sdbc 900 acid was further decreased due to the removal of inorganic salts therefore electron conductivity of carbon materials is well correlated with their performances in nonradical oxidation suggesting that a higher graphitic degree can synergistically benefit pds activation and electron tunneling process in carbon driven aops 3 4 influences of reaction conditions the implications of diverse background matters were evaluated in sdbc 900 pds system as shown in fig 5 a d inorganic anions e g hco3 no3 cl and so4 2 at different concentrations 0 2 1 g l 1 exhibited marginal effects on inhibiting smt degradation the oxidative system could maintain high smx degradation rate in a wide ph range from 2 to 10 fig 6 a additionally because the higher reaction temperature is favorable for the carbocatalysis from both kinetics and thermodynamics increasing the reaction temperature from 15 to 45 c was advantageous for pds activation and smx degradation fig 6b duan et al 2018a elevating the reaction temperatures may not only enhance the chemisorption of organic pds but also facilitate the electron transfer process between pollutants and pds via the carbocatalyst duan et al 2018a moreover the introduction of natural organic matters such as humic acid ha in a range of 0 40 mg l 1 could barely affect the smx removal efficiency fig 6c to our delight fig 6d depicts that the sdbc 900 pds system could achieve 98 6 and 96 4 of smx oxidation efficiencies when the reaction was performed in actual water systems of songhua river china and wastewater effluents respectively therefore the carbon based nonradical system is much beneficial to remediate complicated wastewater matrix regardless of the complex interferences of background organic and inorganic substances the stability and reusability tests of sdbc 900 were shown in fig s11 the fresh sdbc 900 could remove 100 smx within 90min whereas only 56 80 and 42 51 of smx degradation were yielded in the 2nd and 3rd runs respectively in previous studies the stabilities of carbocatalysts such as graphene activated carbon and carbon nanotubes were typically mediocre in aops duan et al 2015a 2015b the deactivation could be caused by the structural changes including the coverage of intermediate products and the change of pore structure as well as the tuned surface chemistry from carbon oxidation and re fabrication of n dopants duan et al 2018 the degradation efficiency of smx was recovered after thermal treatment of the passivated carbocatalyst at 900 c suggesting that the active sites and porous structures of sdbc 900 could be recovered during the thermal pyrolysis moreover the oxidative system was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor with a continuous flow to estimate the removal of organic contaminants in wastewater effluents it is demonstrated that the active sites and porous structures of sdbc 900 could be well preserved or recovered during pyrolysis process in fig s12 most of smx could be effectively oxidized by the sdbc 900 pds system in a continuous run suggesting the system demonstrated high stability and great potential for long term operations 3 5 efficiency of bacterial inactivation in sdbc 900 acid pds system fig 7 displays e coli sterilization in sdbc 900 acid pds system the bacterial membrane integrity was monitored by a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit the dead e coli with damaged membranes can be dyed and visualized by both syto 9 and pi stains emitting red fluorescence compare to blank group bk in fig 7a the percentage of dead e coli cells slightly increased in the presence of pds only fig 7b and sdbc 900 acid only fig 7c systems in 90 min the final log c c0 values of sterilization were 0 035 and 0 152 in the presence of 2 and 3 mm pds respectively indicating that pds alone could not sterilize e coli effectively zhang et al 2019 in light of the biochar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can be produced during the pyrolysis which may impact the activity of bacterial together with the heavy metal residues the persistent free radicals pfrs in biochar may also cause biotoxicity risk since hydrogen peroxide or even oxygen could be activated by pfr to produce oxidizing free radicals for sterilization fang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 in this work fig s2a indicated that less heavy metals existed in sdbc 900 acid while pahs and pfrs were removed after 500 c by thermal decomposition or evaporation liu et al 2018 nakajima et al 2007 consequently the formation of toxicants in biochar could be inhibited by increasing the annealing temperature to reduce the potential environmental threats hale et al 2012 yang et al 2019 therefore pds and sdbc 900 acid are of low hypotoxicity to the e coli and sdbc 900 acid is a green material with low hazards to the aquatic microorganism in contrast the red fluorescent staining cells emerged upon the addition of sdbc 900 acid and pds in 10 min suggesting that the cell membrane was damaged by sdbc 900 acid pds system fig s13 the ratio of live dead cells obviously decreased in 90 min fig 7d demonstrating an effective inactivation of e coli by carbon catalyzed nonradical oxidation the e coli sterilization from fluorescence analysis is also accordance to the directly counting of the bacterium colonies in plate fig s14 to understand the disruption of the bacterial cell membrane sem images of intact and inactivation e coli cells were compared before the inactivation treatment e coli cells exhibited a well preserved rod shape with smooth surface in fig 7e then some e coli cells membrane manifested a completely disordered broken morphology in fig 7f and g implying that the cell membranes had been destroyed by catalytic oxidation the previous experiment demonstrated that oh so4 and 1o2 were not the dominant ros in aop reaction therefore similar to the organic oxidation the mechanism of e coli inactivation stems from destructor of cell membrane by nonradical electron transfer from the protein to the activated pds on carbon surface sdbc 900 will interact with the wall membrane of e coli during pds activation which would cause the cell inactivation to increase the permeability cell swelling and rupture giving rise to the leakage of cellular components michael kordatou et al 2018 the initial damage of bacterial cell membrane was to the exopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan wall followed by lipid peroxidation as well as protein and polysaccharide oxidation these changes in cell permeability also have negative impacts on cell membrane regulation internal and external exchange capacity dalrymple et al 2010 in previous studies o2 h2o2 and h were confirmed as the main ros for bacterial inactivation in photocatalysis by employing ultrathin carbon coated cobalt ferrite composites as the photocatalysts wang et al 2018 additionally chen et al reported that e coli was mainly inactivated by so4 generated in me ii sulfite systems me mn co fe and cu chen et al 2017a in this study for the first time we demonstrate that the nonradical pathway in sdbc 900 acid pds system is effectively inactivating bacteria in water therefore the biochar based aops can provide a new and green strategy for rapid inactivation of bacteria for wastewater remediation 4 conclusions in this study n doped graphitic biochars were synthesized from spirulina residue after c pc extraction to demonstrate the high salt containing spirulina residue can be perfectly converted into a green carbocatalysts for pds activation and smx oxidation sdbc 900 exhibited larger ssas higher contents of graphitic n and better conductivity compared to those synthesized at low temperatures sdbc 400 and 700 and achieved excellent smx oxidation efficiency the radical quenching tests unveiled that the oxidation capacity of sdbc pds system did not rely on free radicals solvent exchange from h2o to d2o and organic selectivity test indicated that 1o2 was not generated and a nonradical pathway played a crucial role in sdbc pds system the electrochemical measurements demonstrated that pds would intimately bond with the activated carbon atoms in sdbc 900 acid to form a surface reactive complex which subsequently attacks the adsorbed organics via electron transfer during this process sdbc 900 acid played an important role in pds activation and mediating the electron shuttle from smx to pds the biochar based nonradical system achieved outstanding performances in real water matrixes in addition it was found that the nonradical oxidation system was capable of destroying the cell membranes of bacteria leading to their rapid inactivation this study provides a promising strategy to manufacture value added and n doped graphitic biochar derived from the non disposable spirulina

18767,microbial electrosynthesis mes has been proposed as a sustainable platform to simultaneously achieve wastewater treatment renewable energy generation and chemicals production currently the co2 valorization via mes is restricted by the low production rate while that via electrochemical reduction is limited by the production of c1 products with high efficiency and selectivity the electrocatalyst assisted mes could potentially solve these bottlenecks of both mes and electrochemical reduction technology by increasing the production rate and expanding the product range here four types of metals were evaluated for mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes with the fabrication of electrical biological hybrid cathodes cathodes based on in zn ti and cu showed high parallelism at 30 a m2 however no parallelism was observed at 50 a m2 and only zn experienced a further increase of the maximum acetic acid production rate 1 23 0 02 g l d 313 5 g m2 d and titer 9 2 0 1 g l with the highest value of the production rate normalized to the project area of the fiber cathodes other volatile fatty acids and ethanol were below 0 5 g l moreover it was the sharp h2 generation which mainly caused the fluctuation of coulombic efficiency the application of such zn based electrical biological hybrid system shall provide a more efficient route for co2 valorization graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial electrosynthesis microbial electrochemical technology extracellular electron transfer formic acid microbial fuel cell 1 introduction the utilization of co2 laden emissions as raw materials without competing with the food supply chain to produce chemical compounds is of great significance for greenhouse gas emission reduction energy security and sustainable development li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 in addition the worldwide energy demands are over reliant on fossil fuels resulting in various environmental and energy concerns that need to be well addressed microbial electrochemical technology met has been proposed as a sustainable platform to accomplish the generation of electrical energy and the treatment of wastewater el mekawy et al 2019 microbial electrosynthesis mes is a novel met which employs autotrophic microorganisms as the catalyst for the production of chemicals from co2 generally with c2 acetic acid compounds as the main products when the methanogenesis is inhibited nevin et al 2010 mes provides a new route under mild conditions to convert a variety of renewable energy sources into chemical energy claassens et al 2016 accordingly considerable progress has been made in this field such as the improvement of the electron exchange capacity with novel cathodes the optimization of the operating parameters and the expansion of the product range with the enhancement of the syntrophic interactions and the development of enabling technologies like synthetic biology jiang and zeng 2018 logan et al 2019 may et al 2016 despite the numerous environmental benefits and scientific efforts currently mes is still not yet regarded as a cost effective route for the production of chemicals beegle and borole 2018 rahman et al 2017 shen et al 2018 this is mostly due to its limited production rate chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 which is almost one order of magnitude lower than that of syngas fermentation demler and weuster botz 2011 organic waste bioconversion xue et al 2017 or the electrocatalysis route chen et al 2019 it is widely recognized that the in situ h2 generation with concomitant rapid consumption is the main way to achieve the fast electron exchange between cathodes and microorganisms in mes may et al 2016 thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that increasing the flux of direct substrates of microorganisms e g h2 and co2 into cells is the key to enhance the production rate although numerous studies focused on increasing the flux of h2 into cells by decorating the cathodes for enhanced hydrogen evolution bajracharya et al 2015 li et al 2018 a few studies have emphasized increasing the flux of co2 into cells recently a gas diffusion electrode and a hollow fiber cathode were applied to increase the availability of co2 to the microbial catalyst bajracharya et al 2016a katuri et al 2018 however these strategies that simply rely on the stimulation of the mass transfer process only achieve a limited improvement of the production rate the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 is recognized as an efficient way for the production of chemicals whose production rate is dramatically higher than that of mes chen et al 2019 in general metal catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of co2 can be divided into four classes zhang et al 2018b those that 1 mainly form formic acid e g in 2 mainly form co e g zn 3 form significant amounts of hydrocarbons e g cu 4 mainly form h2 e g ti in particular only c1 compounds formic acid and co can be efficiently and selectively produced by the electrocatalytic reduction process rahman et al 2017 sánchez et al 2019 the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 for c1 production was demonstrated to be economically viable for energy storage bushuyev et al 2018 however the practical application of formic acid is partly restricted by the limited world market and in terms of co it can be restricted by various problems such as compression storage and safety francke et al 2018 in this context upgrading these c1 feedstock through the integration of an additional microbial synthesis process represents one of the most promising options for the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 cotton et al 2018 francke et al 2018 these integrated systems can stimulate the yield of value added products by reducing co2 to c1 via electrocatalytic reduction in the first step and thus the flux of co2 into microorganisms is enhanced as an additional available carbon source is provided cotton et al 2018 among them the electrocatalyst assisted mes has recently been proposed as a proof of concept gimkiewicz et al 2017 which has similarity with enzyme assisted microbial electrosynthesis majumdar et al 2017 the electrocatalyst assisted mes generally uses in as the metal catalyst to generate formic acid and a pure engineered planktonic bacteria as the microbial catalyst to produce value added chemicals such as isobutanol li et al 2012 and pyruvate tashiro et al 2018 a recent report described the enhanced production of methane in mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes huang and hu 2018 which is of great significance as the mixed culture was able to achieve a significantly higher production rate than that of a pure culture jiang et al 2019 however the performance of the electrocatalyst was not evaluated under microbial conditions because formic acid as the intermediate compound was generated and consumed in two separated chambers huang and hu 2018 although no previous data on this topic had been reported it was presumed that the in situ generation and rapid consumption of co as an intermediate compound in electrocatalyst assisted mes could potentially avoid the problem of its limited solubility for bioconversion aryal et al 2017 thus the application of electrocatalyst that reduces co2 to co as the intermediate compound will also increase the flux of co2 into cells since co is a well studied substrate in mixed culture syngas fermentation chen et al 2019 taken together electrocatalyst assisted mes could potentially solve the bottlenecks of both mes and electrochemical reduction technology by increasing the production rate and expanding the product range however for an efficient electrocatalyst assisted mes with the production of liquid chemicals an extensive screening of different classes of electrocatalysts under microbial conditions should be first conducted in this study four types of electrocatalysts from different metal groups which could be potentially used in mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes were comprehensively tested to evaluate their biocompatibility with the fabrication of a novel electrical biological hybrid cathode such a hybrid cathode design was expected to provide an efficient way to systematically achieve the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts under biocompatible conditions as such the performance of these electrical biological hybrid cathodes in terms of chemicals production cathode potential variation polarization and electrons recovery were evaluated under the galvanostatic operation the application of such electrical biological hybrid cathode shall offer a more efficient route to improve the overall feasibility of the process for co2 valorization via electrocatalyst assisted mes 2 materials and methods 2 1 mes reactor construction and operation eight h type mes reactors were constructed with a 3 8 cm2 cation exchange membrane cem 3361bw shanghai shanghua water treatment materials co ltd shanghai china to separate the anode and cathode chamber each of 100 ml the anode consisted of two pieces of polished graphite plate 3 cm 5 cm 0 5 cm the electrical biological hybrid cathodes with a projected area of 3 14 cm2 were fabricated by mechanically pressing together a piece of electrocatalyst foil from four different metal groups in zn ti and cu foil respectively 0 2 mm thick and a piece of carbon felt 3 mm thick the carbon felt was expected to increase the loading of biomass and such an electrical biological hybrid cathode design was expected to provide a higher electrical conductivity as well as provide an efficient way to systematically achieve the catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst an ag agcl reference electrode saturated kcl gaoss union co ltd wuhan china was inserted near the cathode as the reference electrode throughout this paper all cathode potentials are reported with respect to this refernce ag agcl electrode the anolyte contained 50 mm phosphate buffer k2hpo4 2 6 g l kh2po4 4 4 g l thus water was used as the electron donor in the anode while the catholyte contained 50 mm phosphate buffer and nutrient solution nh4cl 0 31 g l nahco3 4 2 g l 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid 1 0 g l mgcl2 6h2o 0 2 g l yeast extract 0 05 g l during the 40 day startup process fig s1 the anode chamber was filled with 80 ml of anolyte while the cathode chamber was filled with 70 ml of the catholyte and 10 ml of activated sludge as the inoculum whose detail parameters are given in table s1 the cathode chamber was flushed with co2 and thus the initial ph value of the catholyte was adjusted to near 7 0 the mes reactors were connected with a multichannel potentiostat chi 1000b chenhua co shanghai china by setting the cathode potential of 1 1 v the potentiostatic mode was commonly used for the startup of mes with the cathode potential slightly more negative than that of previous studies del pilar anzola rojas et al 2018b it should be noted that 1 1 v was negative enough to avoid the electrochemical oxidation of zn fig s2 as the zn based hybrid cathode showed an open circuit potential of 0 96 0 02 v table s2 the increased current consumption along with the increased operation cycles indicated the enrichment of autotrophic mixed culture su et al 2013 as shown in fig s1 after the 40 day startup process the mes reactors were operated in the galvanostatic method with the current density fixed at 30 and 50 a m2 respectively operation in the galvanostatic mode offers several advantages such as the low cost electronic periphery and the straightforward two electrode arrangement the cathode chamber was filled with 80 ml of catholyte and was flushed with co2 before the electrical connection the gaseous co2 as the substrate was timely supplied with an injection syringe the ph value of the catholyte was manually adjusted to neutral condition using hcl solution at the end of a batch run 90 of the catholyte was replaced with the fresh medium the 10 of catholyte retained from the previous batch enhanced the h2 mediated electron consumption by increasing the loading of planktonic cells bajracharya et al 2016b all mes reactors were stirred with magnetic stirrer and operated in duplicate with the temperature maintained at 30 c 2 2 analyses and calculations the current signal of the mes reactor in potentiostatic mode was recorded with a potentiostat the cathode potentials in galvanostatic mode were manually measured using a multimeter the ph value was measured with a sartorius pb 10 ph meter sartorius scientific instrument co ltd beijing china ethanol and volatile fatty acids vfas were measured by gas chromatography gc using a shimadzu nexis gc 2030 gc system equipped with a flame ionization detection fid detection shimadzu scientific instruments inc kyoto japan while the formic acid was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a shimadzu lc 2030 3d hplc system shimadzu scientific instruments inc equipped with an ultraviolet detector at 210 nm and a c18 reversed phase chromatography column the gaseous samples including methane hydrogen carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were analyzed by gc on a gas chromatograph sp 6890 shandong lunan inc jinan china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd the optical density of the catholyte was assessed using a uv visible spectrophotometer at 660 nm the volatile suspended solid vss and suspended solid ss were analyzed according to a previous study zhang et al 2018a the contents of metals dissolved in the catholyte were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes on an avio 200 icp optical emission spectrometer perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa dna extraction pcr and dna sequencing for microbial diversity analysis were performed on a commercial platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of the samples was performed on a phi quantera sxm x ray photoelectron spectrometer ulvac phi inc chigasaki japan the morphologies of the samples were analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem hitachi s 5500 tokyo japan the polarization curve of electrical biological hybrid cathodes was plotted by measuring the cathode potentials at the stabilization stage while increasing the current density stepwise every 5 min from 0 to 100 a m2 jiang et al 2015 the current density was calculated by normalizing the recorded current consumption to the project area of the cathode 3 14 cm2 the coulombic efficiency ce as an indicator of the cathodic electrons recovery was calculated by considering the different molar conversion factors of the identified products jiang et al 2013 patil et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemicals production with hybrid cathodes the acetic acid production over time during the galvanostatic operation is shown in fig 1 the electrical biological hybrid cathodes based on in zn ti and cu foil exhibited a high parallelism for acetic acid production process at 30 a m2 which could be divided into two phases during the first phase 0 7 days acetic acid increased quickly to almost 6 g l with a production rate of 0 8 0 1 g l d 204 25 g m2 d thereafter in the second phase 8 17 days acetic acid increased gradually up to a maximum concentration of 7 6 0 8 g l with the production rate decreased to 0 2 0 1 g l d the tendency in production of acetic acid was consistent with the gaseous co2 consumption based on the timely supply of co2 fig s2 when the mes reactors were challenged with a higher fixed current density of 50 a m2 days 17 32 no parallelism was observed with these hybrid cathodes in the case of the zn based hybrid electrode acetic acid quickly increased up to a maximum concentration of 9 2 0 1 g l at the 24th day with a production rate of 1 23 0 02 g l d 313 5 g m2 d instead the maximum concentration of acetic acid of the other types of hybrid cathodes at the 24th day showed no parallelism and was much lower than that of zn in the following order in 5 1 2 2 g l cu 3 9 3 6 g l and ti 1 8 0 4 g l for all hybrid cathodes the maximum concentration of acetic acid remained stable during the 24th to 27th day but a decrease of acetic acid was observed from the 28th to 33th day the decrease of acetic acid with the increase of operation time in mes has also been observed in previous studies and it generally coincides with the generation of other chemicals biomass accumulation as well as the diffusion of uncharged molecules toward the anolyte even when a piece of cem was used as a separator gildemyn et al 2015 srikanth et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018 indeed small amounts of c3 c5 vfas including propionic acid isobutyric acid butyric acid and isovaleric acid as well as ethanol were identified during the galvanostatic operation fig 1b the detailed accumulation of these chemicals along with operation time is shown in fig s4 hybrid cathodes exhibited a higher parallelism for c3 c5 vfas and ethanol production at 30 a m2 however with the increase of the current density to 50 a m2 the zn based hybrid cathode for the production of these organic chemicals surpassed the other three types of cathodes generally the concentration of c3 c5 vfas was below 0 1 g l and the operation at 50 a m2 achieved a higher titer however the concentration of ethanol at 30 a m2 0 14 0 38 g l was higher than that of 50 a m2 0 0 01 g l the formic acid accumulation was also very low with the maximum concentration failing to exceed 0 5 g l fig s5 the maximum variation of the ph value of different mes reactors before it was adjusted to neutral condition using hcl solution was monitored throughout the experiments fig 1c the variation of the ph value using all four hybrid cathodes could be successfully controlled below 9 at 30 a m2 whereas at 50 a m2 this was only true for the zn based hybrid cathode actually the mes could be operated at both acidic and alkaline conditions with the ph value of the catholyte largely varying from 4 4 to 10 annie modestra et al 2015 srikanth et al 2018 the alkaline condition was found to be optimal for the production of acetic acid annie modestra et al 2015 while the acidic condition was found to be optimal for the production of ethanol and carboxylic acids with higher carbon member arends et al 2017 srikanth et al 2018 in this study the high current density triggered a sharp hydrogen generation and thus the alkalization of the catholyte in contrast the form of vfas was expected to cause the acidification of the catholyte may et al 2016 the multiple effects of these two processes led to a cathode with a higher microbial activity for vfas generation such as the zn based hybrid cathode in this study which would successfully prevent the over alkalization of the catholyte it should be noted that the lowest concentration of carboxylic acids was obtained with the ti based hybrid cathode at 50 a m2 which was mostly due to its high catalytic activity for hydrogen generation the zn based hybrid cathode having the highest electroactivity for co2 reduction was also supported by the cathode potential variation which was generally more positive than that of other cathodes at both 30 and 50 a m2 fig 1d 3 2 coulombic efficiency and polarization curve the ce accounted for the identified liquid products using different hybrid cathodes that exhibited a high parallelism at 30 a m2 fig 2 a the ce accounted for the increase of the acetic acid from 70 to 100 within 7 days which was then followed by the gradual reduction to 50 at the end of the galvanostatic operation at 30 a m2 when the catholyte was refreshed the ce of the zn based hybrid cathode gradually decreased from 100 at the 17th day to 70 at the 24th day which was then followed by a sharp decrease to a level of 30 at the 33th day the ce of the other types of hybrid cathodes showed no parallelism at 50 a m2 and was much lower than that of the zn based hybrid cathode in the following order in below 80 cu below 42 and ti below 40 the ce variation was consistent with the trend of acetic acid accumulation and it also illustrated that the electrons recovery as c3 c5 vfas or ethanol was negligible the corresponding drop in ce was caused by the timely decrease of the production rate of liquid products the ce achieved here was consistent with previous studies on mixed culture based mes reactors in which the ce fluctuated from near 0 to almost 100 according to recently published reviews jiang et al 2019 the polarization curve of hybrid cathodes at the beginning and end of the galvanostatic operation at 30 a m2 is shown in fig 2b the shift of the cathode potential implied that the accumulation of organic chemicals and the alkalization of the catholyte could greatly inhibit the electroactivity of the hybrid cathode puig et al 2017 the notable polarization properties indicated that the zn based hybrid cathode had the highest electroactivity for co2 reduction which could lead to a much lower energy consumption for chemicals production patil et al 2015 3 3 analysis of gaseous samples and the growth of planktonic cells the gaseous samples and the growth of planktonic cells were analyzed to identify other electron sinks fig 3 only h2 and co2 were identified at the end of the galvanostatic operation with a total composition of almost 100 generally the composition of h2 increased with the increase of the fixed current density in addition the zn based hybrid cathode had the lowest h2 accumulation which was mainly due to its highest h2 consumption rate with the addition of methanogenesis inhibitor methane was only detected below 1 and ultimately diluted to levels below the detection limit of gc with the timely supply of co2 data not shown no other gaseous chemicals were detected which was also in line with the finding that the total composition of the identified gases was almost 100 in order to quantitatively analyze the growth of planktonic cells the absorbance of the samples was monitored at od660 the od660 at 30 a m2 was in the following order in 0 16 0 06 zn 0 35 0 05 ti 0 44 0 17 and cu 0 54 0 19 but the reason for this order remains unclear the timely monitoring of the microbial diversity throughout the experiments might help further understand it however it was not applied in this study because a small mes reactor was used the zn based hybrid cathode achieved the highest od660 at 50 a m2 0 54 0 31 which was slightly higher than that of a previous study jourdin et al 2014 the high error bars might be due to the performance variation of the duplicated reactors which has also been reported in previous studies when the reactor is operated at high current density labelle and may 2017 the ss 0 5 0 9 and vss ss 0 15 0 6 at the end of a batch run were also analyzed fig s6 and were found to be within a typical range for bioreactors based on autotrophic mixed culture zhang et al 2018a these results were realistic as the planktonic microorganismcould also contribute to the reduction of co2 with h2 labelle and may 2017 it has suggested that the low ce in mixed culture based mes could be associated with the products re consumption via methanogenesis the limitation of biofilm attachment on an inefficient cathode the diffusion of uncharged molecules toward the anolyte and the recovery of h2 due to the inefficient microbial activity jiang et al 2019 in this study the high concentration of h2 accumulation negligible ch4 production and the limited growth of planktonic cells all indicated that the electron recovery as h2 due to the inefficient microbial activity was the main reason for the decreased ce 3 4 microbial diversity the majority of the bacterial 16s rrna genes in the biofilm and in planktonic cells belonged to seven phyla fig 4 a namely firmicutes proteobacteria spirochaetae bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi and synergistetes some species from firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria have been found to be electroactive logan et al 2019 gram positive firmicutes and gram negative bacteroidetes are commonly found as digesters in fermentation and anaerobic digestion jiang et al 2018a at the genus level fig 4b there were three relatively abundant genera including acetobacterium 11 5 71 8 on biofilm and 9 6 65 9 in suspension pseudomonas 4 1 29 4 in biofilm 2 7 13 0 in suspending medium and clostridium 1 5 45 4 in biofilm 1 7 5 1 in suspending medium notably acetobacterium clostridium and acetoanaerobium which are capable of producing acetate from co2 and h2 were identified to be present with the highest abundance in zn based hybrid cathode other bacteria capable of generationg acetate such as proteiniphilum were identified with an abundance from 0 3 to 5 6 which were also found with a low abundance in a previous study del pilar anzola rojas et al 2018a electrotrophic microorganisms jiang and zeng 2019 logan et al 2019 which could grow by directly or indirectly accepting electrons derived from the cathode were also identified in this study at the genus level such as acetobacterium and pseudomonas the microbial diversity could also be affected by the leakage of metals dissolved in the catholyte acute toxicity testing indicated that both in and zn were less toxic than cu cooper et al 2009 yang 2014 loss of in from the foil to the catholyte was observed table s3 with the concentration increasing from 0 22 0 08 mg l 30 a m2 to 0 91 mg l 50 a m2 the concentration of in was in a similar range as a previous study on electrochemical reduction of co2 and could be regulated by adjusting the applied potential solution conductivity and the dissolved nahco3 concentration hegner et al 2018 the concentration of cu and zn were below 0 02 mg l which might be due to the high redox potentials jiang et al 2018b taken together the results indicate that zn based hybrid cathode benefitted from its low toxicity to microorganisms as well as its low concentration in the electrolyte solution resulting in the highest production rate 3 5 perspectives the present study for the first time demonstrated the availability of electrocatalyst from different metal groups for the manufacturing of electrical biological hybrid cathodes the results indicated that zn was the most promising material in further studies focused on electrocatalyst assisted mes the performance of the mes systems with the novel zn based hybrid cathode was compared with previous studies fig 5 the results revealed that such electrical biological hybrid cathode led to the highest production rate of acetic acid when normalized to the project area of fiber based cathodes in addition both the volumetric production rate and product titer of acetic acid using such zn based hybrid electrode were also considerably high when compared with previous studies jiang et al 2019 due to the complexity of the electrocatalyst assisted mes process the following challenges need to be addressed systematically generally the most effective catalysts for electrochemical co2 reduction are restricted by the high cost of noble metals while cheaper catalysts have problems with long term stability bushuyev et al 2018 low cost zn is a promising electrocatalyst for c1 production with high selectivity however the rapid oxidation on the surface of bulk zn can decrease the efficiency and stability zhang et al 2018b the xps and fe sem analysis of zn foil and zn based hybrid cathode after running indicated that the cathodic biofilm was able to modify the metal electrode surface and the operation in mes increased its degree of oxidation fig s7 and fig s8 the efficiency and stability of the zn based electrical biological hybrid cathode could be further optimized by for example the direct growth of zn nanoparticles on 3d materials via novel approaches liu et al 2018 other cheaper catalysts such as metal alloys and carbon based metal free electrocatalysts shall also be tested in electrocatalyst assisted mes in terms of efficiency biocompatibility and stability in addition the volumetric production rate of the hybrid cathode could be further improved by the effective control of the growth of planktonic microorganisms labelle and may 2017 furthermore advanced engineering technologies are required to balance the hydrogen generation and carboxylic acids formation process in order to avoid the over acidification or alkalization li et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 moreover the structure of the whole mes reactor could also be optimized by for instance the integration of an on line extraction module to increase the final titer of the products bajracharya et al 2017 gildemyn et al 2015 liang et al 2018 in particular it would be interesting to use the energy recovered from wastewater to drive the co2 reduction process considering that the electroactivity of both the bioanode yamashita and yokoyama 2018 and biocathode can be stimulated by the zn based material noteworthy the long term performance of mes bioreactors have been supported with a stable operation for as long as one year arends et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2016b srikanth et al 2017 while most of the catalysts for electrochemical co2 reduction were merely tested within a couple of hours gimkiewicz et al 2017 tashiro et al 2018 generally the cathode potentials from studies of the electrochemical reduction of co2 were much more negative than that from mes chen et al 2019 in this study the performance of electrical biological hybrid cathodes was not further evaluated at more negative cathode potentials so as to further stimulate the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts chen et al 2019 this was due to the limited buffer capability of the catholyte to balance the sharp h2 generation process the selectivity of the metal catalysts and electroactivity of microorganisms are both greatly affected by further decreasing the cathode potential hegner et al 2018 lam et al 2018 in addition the increased applied potential can increase the electricity consumption in electrocatalyst assisted mes a basic question posed here begging for answers is

18767,microbial electrosynthesis mes has been proposed as a sustainable platform to simultaneously achieve wastewater treatment renewable energy generation and chemicals production currently the co2 valorization via mes is restricted by the low production rate while that via electrochemical reduction is limited by the production of c1 products with high efficiency and selectivity the electrocatalyst assisted mes could potentially solve these bottlenecks of both mes and electrochemical reduction technology by increasing the production rate and expanding the product range here four types of metals were evaluated for mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes with the fabrication of electrical biological hybrid cathodes cathodes based on in zn ti and cu showed high parallelism at 30 a m2 however no parallelism was observed at 50 a m2 and only zn experienced a further increase of the maximum acetic acid production rate 1 23 0 02 g l d 313 5 g m2 d and titer 9 2 0 1 g l with the highest value of the production rate normalized to the project area of the fiber cathodes other volatile fatty acids and ethanol were below 0 5 g l moreover it was the sharp h2 generation which mainly caused the fluctuation of coulombic efficiency the application of such zn based electrical biological hybrid system shall provide a more efficient route for co2 valorization graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial electrosynthesis microbial electrochemical technology extracellular electron transfer formic acid microbial fuel cell 1 introduction the utilization of co2 laden emissions as raw materials without competing with the food supply chain to produce chemical compounds is of great significance for greenhouse gas emission reduction energy security and sustainable development li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 in addition the worldwide energy demands are over reliant on fossil fuels resulting in various environmental and energy concerns that need to be well addressed microbial electrochemical technology met has been proposed as a sustainable platform to accomplish the generation of electrical energy and the treatment of wastewater el mekawy et al 2019 microbial electrosynthesis mes is a novel met which employs autotrophic microorganisms as the catalyst for the production of chemicals from co2 generally with c2 acetic acid compounds as the main products when the methanogenesis is inhibited nevin et al 2010 mes provides a new route under mild conditions to convert a variety of renewable energy sources into chemical energy claassens et al 2016 accordingly considerable progress has been made in this field such as the improvement of the electron exchange capacity with novel cathodes the optimization of the operating parameters and the expansion of the product range with the enhancement of the syntrophic interactions and the development of enabling technologies like synthetic biology jiang and zeng 2018 logan et al 2019 may et al 2016 despite the numerous environmental benefits and scientific efforts currently mes is still not yet regarded as a cost effective route for the production of chemicals beegle and borole 2018 rahman et al 2017 shen et al 2018 this is mostly due to its limited production rate chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 which is almost one order of magnitude lower than that of syngas fermentation demler and weuster botz 2011 organic waste bioconversion xue et al 2017 or the electrocatalysis route chen et al 2019 it is widely recognized that the in situ h2 generation with concomitant rapid consumption is the main way to achieve the fast electron exchange between cathodes and microorganisms in mes may et al 2016 thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that increasing the flux of direct substrates of microorganisms e g h2 and co2 into cells is the key to enhance the production rate although numerous studies focused on increasing the flux of h2 into cells by decorating the cathodes for enhanced hydrogen evolution bajracharya et al 2015 li et al 2018 a few studies have emphasized increasing the flux of co2 into cells recently a gas diffusion electrode and a hollow fiber cathode were applied to increase the availability of co2 to the microbial catalyst bajracharya et al 2016a katuri et al 2018 however these strategies that simply rely on the stimulation of the mass transfer process only achieve a limited improvement of the production rate the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 is recognized as an efficient way for the production of chemicals whose production rate is dramatically higher than that of mes chen et al 2019 in general metal catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of co2 can be divided into four classes zhang et al 2018b those that 1 mainly form formic acid e g in 2 mainly form co e g zn 3 form significant amounts of hydrocarbons e g cu 4 mainly form h2 e g ti in particular only c1 compounds formic acid and co can be efficiently and selectively produced by the electrocatalytic reduction process rahman et al 2017 sánchez et al 2019 the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 for c1 production was demonstrated to be economically viable for energy storage bushuyev et al 2018 however the practical application of formic acid is partly restricted by the limited world market and in terms of co it can be restricted by various problems such as compression storage and safety francke et al 2018 in this context upgrading these c1 feedstock through the integration of an additional microbial synthesis process represents one of the most promising options for the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 cotton et al 2018 francke et al 2018 these integrated systems can stimulate the yield of value added products by reducing co2 to c1 via electrocatalytic reduction in the first step and thus the flux of co2 into microorganisms is enhanced as an additional available carbon source is provided cotton et al 2018 among them the electrocatalyst assisted mes has recently been proposed as a proof of concept gimkiewicz et al 2017 which has similarity with enzyme assisted microbial electrosynthesis majumdar et al 2017 the electrocatalyst assisted mes generally uses in as the metal catalyst to generate formic acid and a pure engineered planktonic bacteria as the microbial catalyst to produce value added chemicals such as isobutanol li et al 2012 and pyruvate tashiro et al 2018 a recent report described the enhanced production of methane in mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes huang and hu 2018 which is of great significance as the mixed culture was able to achieve a significantly higher production rate than that of a pure culture jiang et al 2019 however the performance of the electrocatalyst was not evaluated under microbial conditions because formic acid as the intermediate compound was generated and consumed in two separated chambers huang and hu 2018 although no previous data on this topic had been reported it was presumed that the in situ generation and rapid consumption of co as an intermediate compound in electrocatalyst assisted mes could potentially avoid the problem of its limited solubility for bioconversion aryal et al 2017 thus the application of electrocatalyst that reduces co2 to co as the intermediate compound will also increase the flux of co2 into cells since co is a well studied substrate in mixed culture syngas fermentation chen et al 2019 taken together electrocatalyst assisted mes could potentially solve the bottlenecks of both mes and electrochemical reduction technology by increasing the production rate and expanding the product range however for an efficient electrocatalyst assisted mes with the production of liquid chemicals an extensive screening of different classes of electrocatalysts under microbial conditions should be first conducted in this study four types of electrocatalysts from different metal groups which could be potentially used in mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes were comprehensively tested to evaluate their biocompatibility with the fabrication of a novel electrical biological hybrid cathode such a hybrid cathode design was expected to provide an efficient way to systematically achieve the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts under biocompatible conditions as such the performance of these electrical biological hybrid cathodes in terms of chemicals production cathode potential variation polarization and electrons recovery were evaluated under the galvanostatic operation the application of such electrical biological hybrid cathode shall offer a more efficient route to improve the overall feasibility of the process for co2 valorization via electrocatalyst assisted mes 2 materials and methods 2 1 mes reactor construction and operation eight h type mes reactors were constructed with a 3 8 cm2 cation exchange membrane cem 3361bw shanghai shanghua water treatment materials co ltd shanghai china to separate the anode and cathode chamber each of 100 ml the anode consisted of two pieces of polished graphite plate 3 cm 5 cm 0 5 cm the electrical biological hybrid cathodes with a projected area of 3 14 cm2 were fabricated by mechanically pressing together a piece of electrocatalyst foil from four different metal groups in zn ti and cu foil respectively 0 2 mm thick and a piece of carbon felt 3 mm thick the carbon felt was expected to increase the loading of biomass and such an electrical biological hybrid cathode design was expected to provide a higher electrical conductivity as well as provide an efficient way to systematically achieve the catalytic performance of the electrocatalyst an ag agcl reference electrode saturated kcl gaoss union co ltd wuhan china was inserted near the cathode as the reference electrode throughout this paper all cathode potentials are reported with respect to this refernce ag agcl electrode the anolyte contained 50 mm phosphate buffer k2hpo4 2 6 g l kh2po4 4 4 g l thus water was used as the electron donor in the anode while the catholyte contained 50 mm phosphate buffer and nutrient solution nh4cl 0 31 g l nahco3 4 2 g l 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid 1 0 g l mgcl2 6h2o 0 2 g l yeast extract 0 05 g l during the 40 day startup process fig s1 the anode chamber was filled with 80 ml of anolyte while the cathode chamber was filled with 70 ml of the catholyte and 10 ml of activated sludge as the inoculum whose detail parameters are given in table s1 the cathode chamber was flushed with co2 and thus the initial ph value of the catholyte was adjusted to near 7 0 the mes reactors were connected with a multichannel potentiostat chi 1000b chenhua co shanghai china by setting the cathode potential of 1 1 v the potentiostatic mode was commonly used for the startup of mes with the cathode potential slightly more negative than that of previous studies del pilar anzola rojas et al 2018b it should be noted that 1 1 v was negative enough to avoid the electrochemical oxidation of zn fig s2 as the zn based hybrid cathode showed an open circuit potential of 0 96 0 02 v table s2 the increased current consumption along with the increased operation cycles indicated the enrichment of autotrophic mixed culture su et al 2013 as shown in fig s1 after the 40 day startup process the mes reactors were operated in the galvanostatic method with the current density fixed at 30 and 50 a m2 respectively operation in the galvanostatic mode offers several advantages such as the low cost electronic periphery and the straightforward two electrode arrangement the cathode chamber was filled with 80 ml of catholyte and was flushed with co2 before the electrical connection the gaseous co2 as the substrate was timely supplied with an injection syringe the ph value of the catholyte was manually adjusted to neutral condition using hcl solution at the end of a batch run 90 of the catholyte was replaced with the fresh medium the 10 of catholyte retained from the previous batch enhanced the h2 mediated electron consumption by increasing the loading of planktonic cells bajracharya et al 2016b all mes reactors were stirred with magnetic stirrer and operated in duplicate with the temperature maintained at 30 c 2 2 analyses and calculations the current signal of the mes reactor in potentiostatic mode was recorded with a potentiostat the cathode potentials in galvanostatic mode were manually measured using a multimeter the ph value was measured with a sartorius pb 10 ph meter sartorius scientific instrument co ltd beijing china ethanol and volatile fatty acids vfas were measured by gas chromatography gc using a shimadzu nexis gc 2030 gc system equipped with a flame ionization detection fid detection shimadzu scientific instruments inc kyoto japan while the formic acid was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a shimadzu lc 2030 3d hplc system shimadzu scientific instruments inc equipped with an ultraviolet detector at

lunan inc jinan china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd the optical density of the catholyte was assessed using a uv visible spectrophotometer at 660 nm the volatile suspended solid vss and suspended solid ss were analyzed according to a previous study zhang et al 2018a the contents of metals dissolved in the catholyte were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes on an avio 200 icp optical emission spectrometer perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa dna extraction pcr and dna sequencing for microbial diversity analysis were performed on a commercial platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of the samples was performed on a phi quantera sxm x ray photoelectron spectrometer ulvac phi inc chigasaki japan the morphologies of the samples were analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem hitachi s 5500 tokyo japan the polarization curve of electrical biological hybrid cathodes was plotted by measuring the cathode potentials at the stabilization stage while increasing the current density stepwise every 5 min from 0 to 100 a m2 jiang et al 2015 the current density was calculated by normalizing the recorded current consumption to the project area of the cathode 3 14 cm2 the coulombic efficiency ce as an indicator of the cathodic electrons recovery was calculated by considering the different molar conversion factors of the identified products jiang et al 2013 patil et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemicals production with hybrid cathodes the acetic acid production over time during the galvanostatic operation is shown in fig 1 the electrical biological hybrid cathodes based on in zn ti and cu foil exhibited a high parallelism for acetic acid production process at 30 a m2 which could be divided into two phases during the first phase 0 7 days acetic acid increased quickly to almost 6 g l with a production rate of 0 8 0 1 g l d 204 25 g m2 d thereafter in the second phase 8 17 days acetic acid increased gradually up to a maximum concentration of 7 6 0 8 g l with the production rate decreased to 0 2 0 1 g l d the tendency in production of acetic acid was consistent with the gaseous co2 consumption based on the timely supply of co2 fig s2 when the mes reactors were challenged with a higher fixed current density of 50 a m2 days 17 32 no parallelism was observed with these hybrid cathodes in the case of the zn based hybrid electrode acetic acid quickly increased up to a maximum concentration of 9 2 0 1 g l at the 24th day with a production rate of 1 23 0 02 g l d 313 5 g m2 d instead the maximum concentration of acetic acid of the other types of hybrid cathodes at the 24th day showed no parallelism and was much lower than that of zn in the following order in 5 1 2 2 g l cu 3 9 3 6 g l and ti 1 8 0 4 g l for all hybrid cathodes the maximum concentration of acetic acid remained stable during the 24th to 27th day but a decrease of acetic acid was observed from the 28th to 33th day the decrease of acetic acid with the increase of operation time in mes has also been observed in previous studies and it generally coincides with the generation of other chemicals biomass accumulation as well as the diffusion of uncharged molecules toward the anolyte even when a piece of cem was used as a separator gildemyn et al 2015 srikanth et al 2018 vassilev et al 2018 indeed small amounts of c3 c5 vfas including propionic acid isobutyric acid butyric acid and isovaleric acid as well as ethanol were identified during the galvanostatic operation fig 1b the detailed accumulation of these chemicals along with operation time is shown in fig s4 hybrid cathodes exhibited a higher parallelism for c3 c5 vfas and ethanol production at 30 a m2 however with the increase of the current density to 50 a m2 the zn based hybrid cathode for the production of these organic chemicals surpassed the other three types of cathodes generally the concentration of c3 c5 vfas was below 0 1 g l and the operation at 50 a m2 achieved a higher titer however the concentration of ethanol at 30 a m2 0 14 0 38 g l was higher than that of 50 a m2 0 0 01 g l the formic acid accumulation was also very low with the maximum concentration failing to exceed 0 5 g l fig s5 the maximum variation of the ph value of different mes reactors before it was adjusted to neutral condition using hcl solution was monitored throughout the experiments fig 1c the variation of the ph value using all four hybrid cathodes could be successfully controlled below 9 at 30 a m2 whereas at 50 a m2 this was only true for the zn based hybrid cathode actually the mes could be operated at both acidic and alkaline conditions with the ph value of the catholyte largely varying from 4 4 to 10 annie modestra et al 2015 srikanth et al 2018 the alkaline condition was found to be optimal for the production of acetic acid annie modestra et al 2015 while the acidic condition was found to be optimal for the production of ethanol and carboxylic acids with higher carbon member arends et al 2017 srikanth et al 2018 in this study the high current density triggered a sharp hydrogen generation and thus the alkalization of the catholyte in contrast the form of vfas was expected to cause the acidification of the catholyte may et al 2016 the multiple effects of these two processes led to a cathode with a higher microbial activity for vfas generation such as the zn based hybrid cathode in this study which would successfully prevent the over alkalization of the catholyte it should be noted that the lowest concentration of carboxylic acids was obtained with the ti based hybrid cathode at 50 a m2 which was mostly due to its high catalytic activity for hydrogen generation the zn based hybrid cathode having the highest electroactivity for co2 reduction was also supported by the cathode potential variation which was generally more positive than that of other cathodes at both 30 and 50 a m2 fig 1d 3 2 coulombic efficiency and polarization curve the ce accounted for the identified liquid products using different hybrid cathodes that exhibited a high parallelism at 30 a m2 fig 2 a the ce accounted for the increase of the acetic acid from 70 to 100 within 7 days which was then followed by the gradual reduction to 50 at the end of the galvanostatic operation at 30 a m2 when the catholyte was refreshed the ce of the zn based hybrid cathode gradually decreased from 100 at the 17th day to 70 at the 24th day which was then followed by a sharp decrease to a level of 30 at the 33th day the ce of the other types of hybrid cathodes showed no parallelism at 50 a m2 and was much lower than that of the zn based hybrid cathode in the following order in below 80 cu below 42 and ti below 40 the ce variation was consistent with the trend of acetic acid accumulation and it also illustrated that the electrons recovery as c3 c5 vfas or ethanol was negligible the corresponding drop in ce was caused by the timely decrease of the production rate of liquid products the ce achieved here was consistent with previous studies on mixed culture based mes reactors in which the ce fluctuated from near 0 to almost 100 according to recently published reviews jiang et al 2019 the polarization curve of hybrid cathodes at the beginning and end of the galvanostatic operation at 30 a m2 is shown in fig 2b the shift of the cathode potential implied that the accumulation of organic chemicals and the alkalization of the catholyte could greatly inhibit the electroactivity of the hybrid cathode puig et al 2017 the notable polarization properties indicated that the zn based hybrid cathode had the highest electroactivity for co2 reduction which could lead to a much lower energy consumption for chemicals production patil et al 2015 3 3 analysis of gaseous samples and the growth of planktonic cells the gaseous samples and the growth of planktonic cells were analyzed to identify other electron sinks fig 3 only h2 and co2 were identified at the end of the galvanostatic operation with a total composition of almost 100 generally the composition of h2 increased with the increase of the fixed current density in addition the zn based hybrid cathode had the lowest h2 accumulation which was mainly due to its highest h2 consumption rate with the addition of methanogenesis inhibitor methane was only detected below 1 and ultimately diluted to levels below the detection limit of gc with the timely supply of co2 data not shown no other gaseous chemicals were detected which was also in line with the finding that the total composition of the identified gases was almost 100 in order to quantitatively analyze the growth of planktonic cells the absorbance of the samples was monitored at od660 the od660 at 30 a m2 was in the following order in 0 16 0 06 zn 0 35 0 05 ti 0 44 0 17 and cu 0 54 0 19 but the reason for this order remains unclear the timely monitoring of the microbial diversity throughout the experiments might help further understand it however it was not applied in this study because a small mes reactor was used the zn based hybrid cathode achieved the highest od660 at 50 a m2 0 54 0 31 which was slightly higher than that of a previous study jourdin et al 2014 the high error bars might be due to the performance variation of the duplicated reactors which has also been reported in previous studies when the reactor is operated at high current density labelle and may 2017 the ss 0 5 0 9 and vss ss 0 15 0 6 at the end of a batch run were also analyzed fig s6 and were found to be within a typical range for bioreactors based on autotrophic mixed culture zhang et al 2018a these results were realistic as the planktonic microorganismcould also contribute to the reduction of co2 with h2 labelle and may 2017 it has suggested that the low ce in mixed culture based mes could be associated with the products re consumption via methanogenesis the limitation of biofilm attachment on an inefficient cathode the diffusion of uncharged molecules toward the anolyte and the recovery of h2 due to the inefficient microbial activity jiang et al 2019 in this study the high concentration of h2 accumulation negligible ch4 production and the limited growth of planktonic cells all indicated that the electron recovery as h2 due to the inefficient microbial activity was the main reason for the decreased ce 3 4 microbial diversity the majority of the bacterial 16s rrna genes in the biofilm and in planktonic cells belonged to seven phyla fig 4 a namely firmicutes proteobacteria spirochaetae bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi and synergistetes some species from firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria have been found to be electroactive logan et al 2019 gram positive firmicutes and gram negative bacteroidetes are commonly found as digesters in fermentation and anaerobic digestion jiang et al 2018a at the genus level fig 4b there were three relatively abundant genera including acetobacterium 11 5 71 8 on biofilm and 9 6 65 9 in suspension pseudomonas 4 1 29 4 in biofilm 2 7 13 0 in suspending medium and clostridium 1 5 45 4 in biofilm 1 7 5 1 in suspending medium notably acetobacterium clostridium and acetoanaerobium which are capable of producing acetate from co2 and h2 were identified to be present with the highest abundance in zn based hybrid cathode other bacteria capable of generationg acetate such as proteiniphilum were identified with an abundance from 0 3 to 5 6 which were also found with a low abundance in a previous study del pilar anzola rojas et al 2018a electrotrophic microorganisms jiang and zeng 2019 logan et al 2019 which could grow by directly or indirectly accepting electrons derived from the cathode were also identified in this study at the genus level such as acetobacterium and pseudomonas the microbial diversity could also be affected by the leakage of metals dissolved in the catholyte acute toxicity testing indicated that both in and zn were less toxic than cu cooper et al 2009 yang 2014 loss of in from the foil to the catholyte was observed table s3 with the concentration increasing from 0 22 0 08 mg l 30 a m2 to 0 91 mg l 50 a m2 the concentration of in was in a similar range as a previous study on electrochemical reduction of co2 and could be regulated by adjusting the applied potential solution conductivity and the dissolved nahco3 concentration hegner et al 2018 the concentration of cu and zn were below 0 02 mg l which might be due to the high redox potentials jiang et al 2018b taken together the results indicate that zn based hybrid cathode benefitted from its low toxicity to microorganisms as well as its low concentration in the electrolyte solution resulting in the highest production rate 3 5 perspectives the present study for the first time demonstrated the availability of electrocatalyst from different metal groups for the manufacturing of electrical biological hybrid cathodes the results indicated that zn was the most promising material in further studies focused on electrocatalyst assisted mes the performance of the mes systems with the novel zn based hybrid cathode was compared with previous studies fig 5 the results revealed that such electrical biological hybrid cathode led to the highest production rate of acetic acid when normalized to the project area of fiber based cathodes in addition both the volumetric production rate and product titer of acetic acid using such zn based hybrid electrode were also considerably high when compared with previous studies jiang et al 2019 due to the complexity of the electrocatalyst assisted mes process the following challenges need to be addressed systematically generally the most effective catalysts for electrochemical co2 reduction are restricted by the high cost of noble metals while cheaper catalysts have problems with long term stability bushuyev et al 2018 low cost zn is a promising electrocatalyst for c1 production with high selectivity however the rapid oxidation on the surface of bulk zn can decrease the efficiency and stability zhang et al 2018b the xps and fe sem analysis of zn foil and zn based hybrid cathode after running indicated that the cathodic biofilm was able to modify the metal electrode surface and the operation in mes increased its degree of oxidation fig s7 and fig s8 the efficiency and stability of the zn based electrical biological hybrid cathode could be further optimized by for example the direct growth of zn nanoparticles on 3d materials via novel approaches liu et al 2018 other cheaper catalysts such as metal alloys and carbon based metal free electrocatalysts shall also be tested in electrocatalyst assisted mes in terms of efficiency biocompatibility and stability in addition the volumetric production rate of the hybrid cathode could be further improved by the effective control of the growth of planktonic microorganisms labelle and may 2017 furthermore advanced engineering technologies are required to balance the hydrogen generation and carboxylic acids formation process in order to avoid the over acidification or alkalization li et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 moreover the structure of the whole mes reactor could also be optimized by for instance the integration of an on line extraction module to increase the final titer of the products bajracharya et al 2017 gildemyn et al 2015 liang et al 2018 in particular it would be interesting to use the energy recovered from wastewater to drive the co2 reduction process considering that the electroactivity of both the bioanode yamashita and yokoyama 2018 and biocathode can be stimulated by the zn based material noteworthy the long term performance of mes bioreactors have been supported with a stable operation for as long as one year arends et al 2017 bajracharya et al 2016b srikanth et al 2017 while most of the catalysts for electrochemical co2 reduction were merely tested within a couple of hours gimkiewicz et al 2017 tashiro et al 2018 generally the cathode potentials from studies of the electrochemical reduction of co2 were much more negative than that from mes chen et al 2019 in this study the performance of electrical biological hybrid cathodes was not further evaluated at more negative cathode potentials so as to further stimulate the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts chen et al 2019 this was due to the limited buffer capability of the catholyte to balance the sharp h2 generation process the selectivity of the metal catalysts and electroactivity of microorganisms are both greatly affected by further decreasing the cathode potential hegner et al 2018 lam et al 2018 in addition the increased applied potential can increase the electricity consumption in electrocatalyst assisted mes a basic question posed here begging for answers is how electrotrophic microorganisms can accomplish their metabolism of substances and energy at such negative cathode potentials in this context the long term performance and a low cost evaluation of electrocatalyst assisted mes should be evaluated to find an economically viable hybrid process for the production of chemicals 4 conclusions in this study four types of electrocatalysts were evaluated in mixed culture based electrocatalyst assisted mes for the fabrication of novel electrical biological hybrid cathodes the outcomes were cathodes based on in zn ti and cu exhibited a high parallelism at 30 a m2 no parallelism was observed at 50 a m2 and only zn experienced a further increase of the production rate and titer the maximum achieved acetic acid production rate 1 23 0 02 g l d 313 5 g m2 d and titer 9 2 0 1 g l were the highest recorded for fiber cathode the concentration of other organic chemicals was below 0 5 g l and the sharp h2 generation was the main reason for the fluctuation of ce future research will focus on the structure optimization of such cathode to further increase the electro activity of co2 reduction acknowledgments this work was supported by the

18768,due to the lack of robust ways to quantify aggregations fouling of two foulant aggregations is poorly understood this work systematically reports the ultrafiltration membrane fouling by aggregations formed from two oppositely charged organic foulants i e humic acid ha and lysozyme lys with the aid of resonance light scattering rls technique rls provides an effective approach to detecting the aggregation concentration and reveals that the ha lys aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m lys m ha 2 77 during the filtration of the mixture of ha and lys aggregations over individual foulants were identified to be the main substances deposited on the membrane surface where the mass of deposition had a good linear relationship with the feed concentration of the aggregations the ha lys aggregations might decrease the total fouling due to their large size but reduce the fouling reversibility in the ph range of 5 5 9 2 the ph value had limiting effects on the concentration of ha lys aggregations as well as the consequent fouling at low ionic strength the membrane fouling by ha lys aggregations decreased as the ionic strength increased due to the reduction of the aggregation concentration oppositely at high ionic strength this tendency was reversed due to the electrical double layer compression effect these results suggest that rls is a simple and effective way to quantify the aggregations of foulants and the aggregations of foulants have distinct fouling behaviors compared with the individual foulants keywords membrane fouling aggregation resonance light scattering foulants deposition interaction 1 introduction organic matter can cause severe membrane fouling in a membrane filtration process chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 to gain fundamental understandings of the organic fouling phenomenon previous studies generally used a single type of model foulant such as alginate or humic acid ha in well defined conditions chen et al 2015 kim and dempsey 2013 shao et al 2017 these studies found that the foulants membrane and foulants foulants interactions play a crucial role in the fouling formation and these interactions are highly affected by solution chemistry li et al 2017 miao et al 2015 tang et al 2011 for example severe fouling is expected at a high ionic strength and a ph value close to the isoelectric point iep of an organic foulant because of the reduction of electrostatic repulsion among foulants miao et al 2017 yuan and zydney 2000 in practice the feed water for a membrane process is complex and contains more

bonding and form aggregations in feeds myat et al 2014 wang and tang 2011 wang et al 2015 for example the aggregation of bovine serum albumin bsa and ha could be formed by the bond between the amide groups of bsa and the hydroxyl groups of ha guan et al 2018 neemann et al 2013 pivokonsky et al 2015 according to a handful of previous studies the formation of aggregations can change the interaction of foulants membrane and foulants foulants therefore the aggregations may show completely different fouling behaviors compared with the individual foulants arkhangelsky et al 2016 wang and tang 2011 in some cases the aggregations can act as the main cause of the fouling zator et al 2009 however possibly because of the lack of robust ways to quantify aggregations the membrane fouling caused by them is still poorly understood resonance light scattering rsl which can be easily detected using a common fluorescence spectrophotometer in the synchronous scan mode δλ 0 nm lu et al 2007 is the enhancement of light scattering signal when the wavelength of incident light is near or within absorption bands of chromophore aggregations pasternack and collings 1995 different chromophore aggregations exhibit different rls spectra and the monomers generally do not exhibit enhanced rls signal pasternack and collings 1995 therefore the technique could be used for detecting and characterizing the aggregation of chromophores e g cationic porphyrins and nucleic acids collings et al 1999 pasternack et al 1993 rls also received considerable attention as a sensitive and selective method for biochemical and pharmaceutical analysis lu et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 for example a dye molecule generally exhibits a low rls intensity but a high rls intensity is expected when it binds with macromolecules e g carbohydrate and protein this rls intensity is closely related to the concentration of macromolecules if the solution has an excessive concentration of dye consequently a quantification method for the macromolecules could be established using the rls technique huang and li 2003 many membrane foulants such as bsa ha and lysozyme lys have chromophores these chromophores offer an opportunity to use rls for detecting and quantifying the aggregations formed by these foulants in this study ha and lys were used as the model foulants rls technique was employed to investigate the interaction between them and quantify the formed aggregations the role of the aggregations on membrane fouling was investigated and the impacts of ph and ionic strength on the fouling behavior of the aggregations were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 2 1 reagents ha sigma aldrich 53680 and lys sigma aldrich 62971 were chosen as model foulants for the following two reasons 1 they are typical foulants used in previous studies gao et al 2016 kim and dempsey 2013 shao et al 2017 wang and tang 2011 2 the phiep of ha and lys are 0 9 and 10 2 respectively fig s1 therefore they have opposite charges in most raw streams and can easily form aggregations by electrostatic attraction the stock solution of ha was prepared according to our previous study li et al 2014 the working solution of lys was freshly prepared prior to each experiment to avoid biodegradation the ph and ionic strength of the feed solution were adjusted by adding nacl hcl and naoh 2 2 2 membrane two types of commercially available flat sheet polyethersulfone pes uf membranes microdyn nadir germany were used the properties of the membranes are shown in table 1 for the 150 kda membrane most of the ha and lys could pass through the membrane pore while their aggregations could be rejected section 3 1 2 therefore the membrane was used for the validation analysis of rls technique in the quantification of ha lys aggregations for the 20 kda membrane most of the foulants could not pass through the membrane pore where cake formation was the major fouling mechanism therefore the membrane was used in the fouling test to simplify the fouling phenomenon all membranes were thoroughly washed with pure water before use 2 2 resonance light scattering measurement a fluorescence spectrophotometer cary eclipse agilent us was used for recording the rls spectra at ambient temperature 21 2 c the spectra were measured by synchronous scanning λ ex λ em over wavelengths of 300 600 nm at an interval of 2 nm the path length was 1 cm the slit was 5 nm and the pmt voltage was 550 v 2 3 membrane filtration test all the membrane filtration tests were operated in dead end filtration mode using a self made filtration cell fig s2 the filtration cell had an effective filtration area of 16 6 cm2 during the filtration a constant flux of 50 l m2 h was maintained using a peristaltic pump longer china and the trans membrane pressure tmp was monitored using a pressure sensor cyyz11 star sensors china the protocol of the filtration experiment is as follows 1 pure water was filtered for 30 min to stabilize the system 2 the feed water was changed to the solution of ha and lys and 350 ml of the solution was filtered 3 the membrane was backwashed at a flux of 50 l m2 h for 2 min 4 the corresponding background solution was filtered to determine the reversibility of the fouling the tmp was online recorded using a programmable logic controller the rejection of ha and lys was obtained until the values reach a stable plateau membrane fouling was quantified using the membrane fouling index fi as described in our previous study shao et al 2016 total fouling index tfi and physically irreversible fouling index ifi were used to describe the fouling before and after backwashing under the constant flux mode the fi is defined by the following equation tmp tmp0 1 fi v sp therefore the tfi can be calculated by the linear regression between tmp tmp0 and the specific volume v sp nguyen et al 2011 and the ifi can be determined using the tmp data of the membrane after backwashing and the tmp data of the virgin membrane the reversibility of the membrane fouling was calculated by the formula of tfi ifi tfi 100 2 4 foulant extraction and analysis after the filtration the membrane was unloaded and soaked into the naoh solution ph 12 overnight then ph of the acquired solution was adjusted to 7 0 7 5 using hcl solution this solution was used to analyze the ha and lys foulants deposited on the membrane surface the concentration of ha was determined by measuring ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan the concentration of lys was determined using the bicinchoninic acid bca assay sangon biological engineering technology services co ltd shanghai china 2 5 other analytical measurements zeta potentials of lys and ha were determined with freshly prepared lys and ha solution using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zse malvern uk the hydrodynamic diameters of ha lys and the ha lys aggregation were determined using dynamic light scattering method zetasizer nano zse malvern uk the ph value was measured using a ph meter fe 20 mettler toledo usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantification of the aggregations formed by ha and lys 3 1 1 rls spectra of the mixtures of ha and lys the rls intensities of the single ha and lys solution were relatively low but the ha lys mixture s rls spectra were significantly intensified bearing a maximal intensity around 475 nm fig 1 a because of the electrostatic attractions negatively charged ha could bind to positively charged lys to form the ha lys aggregations these aggregations led to an enhancement of light scattering intensity pasternack and collings 1995 the formation of aggregations was also evidenced by the fluorescence quenching of the lys fluorescent signal in the mixture of ha and lys fig s4a wang et al 2015 when c lys c ha 2 77 the rls intensity linearly increased as c lys c ha increased r 2 0 965 fig 1b however when c lys c ha 2 77 the rls intensity was stabilized at a level of 573 0 these results could be explained by the fact that the ha lys aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m lys m ha 2 77 when c lys c ha 2 77 the mixtures had excessive levels of ha thus the concentration of ha lys aggregations increased as the c lys c ha increased leading to the increase of the rls intensity however when c lys c ha 2 77 the concentration of ha became the limiting factor for the formation of aggregations therefore the rls intensity and the concentration of ha lys aggregation were almost unchanged the mixtures of alginate and lys were also studied a similar two stage trend was obtained fig s5a due to the good linear relationship between the rls intensity and the concentration of aggregations the rls intensity could possibly be used to quantify the aggregations at a specific range 3 1 2 validation analysis of rls technique in the quantification of ha lys aggregations most of the ha and lys could not be rejected by the 150 kda pes membrane with rejections of 29 4 and 5 9 respectively however the rejections of ha and lys were significantly enhanced when filtering the mixture of ha and lys fig 2 a for example almost 100 rejection of lys was achieved when c lys c ha 3 and the rejection of lys gradually decreased as c lys c ha increased when c lys c ha 3 the variations of the rejections of ha and lys at different c lys c ha could be ascribed to the formation of ha lys aggregations the almost total rejections of ha and lys 95 100 in a specific range of c lys c ha in fig 2a suggested that nearly all the ha lys aggregations could be rejected by the 150 kda membrane which gave us the opportunity to identify the validation of rls technique in the quantification of the ha lys aggregations according to the results of rls fig 1b the ha lys aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m lys m ha 2 77 therefore the rejections of ha and lys could be calculated based on the following equations if c lys c ha 2 77 r lys 0 and r ha 1 29 4 c ha c lys 2 77 c ha if c lys c ha 2 77 r ha 0 and r lys 1 5 9 c lys 2 77 c ha c lys fig 2b compares the calculated data with the experimental data obtained in fig 2a almost all data points were clustered around the line y x suggesting that the two sets of data matched reasonably well in the mixture of alginate and lys the rls results also provided a reasonable prediction of the rejections of lys and alginate these results show that the rls results could be used for determining the mass ratio of the monomers in the aggregations or the number of binding sites during the interaction although fluorescence quenching method is commonly used for determining the number of binding sites in the monomers interaction arkhangelsky et al 2016 van de weert 2010 wang et al 2015 its results as shown in fig s4 were not consistent with the data in fig 2a fig s4b c in fluorescence quenching method the number of binding sites is determined basing on the presupposition that the formed aggregation is a non fluorescent complex van de weert 2010 however the ha lys aggregations may have residual fluorescence moreover the ha molecular can absorb the radiation emitted by lys fig s3 therefore fluorescence quenching method was not favorable in this study the concentration of the aggregations could be quantified by the decrease of the organic matter in the permeate due to the fact that the ha lys aggregations could be rejected by the 150 kda membrane fig 2c shows that the increase of rejected organic matter has a very good linear relationship with the rls intensity of the feed water r 2 0 987 which further improved the effectiveness of rls technique in the quantification of the ha lys aggregations in the mixture of alginate and lys similar results were also obtained fig s5b c 3 2 membrane fouling by the ha lys aggregations total fouling and physically irreversible fouling of the mixture of ha and lys are shown in fig 3 a because of the low molecular weight cutoff of the membrane 20 kda cake formation was expected to be the major fouling mechanism ha caused severe total fouling but the physically irreversible fouling is very low this high reversibility 86 6 was caused by the electrostatic repulsion among ha molecules shao et al 2016 tang et al 2011 lys also caused severe total fouling and the reversibility of lys fouling was relatively low 56 6 which may be caused by the electrostatic attraction between the positive charged lys and the negative charged membrane tang et al 2011 in the mixture of ha and lys both monomers ha and lys and aggregations present and the aggregations had the highest concentration at the ratio of c lys c ha 2 77 the total fouling gradually decreased as the contents of the ha lys aggregation increased and the minimal total fouling occurred when the ratio of c lys c ha was around 2 77 these results suggested that the ha lys aggregations caused relatively low total fouling probably due to the large size of aggregations the hydrodynamic diameter of ha lys and ha lys aggregations were 352 4 39 4 450 8 39 4 and 2967 7 293 1 nm respectively and produced a highly porous cake layer with low hydraulic resistance this result is consistent with the study of neemann et al 2013 which reported that the aggregation by alginate and bsa could be formed at low ph and the aggregation allows to form a more porous foulants layer possibly because of the low electrostatic repulsion among the aggregations they were readily deposited on the membrane surface consequently the reversibility of the fouling by aggregations is dramatically decreased 15 20 except for the mixture with c lys c ha 0 33 and 7 the rls intensity of the mixture had a good linear relationship with the total mass of the deposited foulants r 2 0 801 fig 3b suggesting that the aggregations in the feed water might determine the total mass of the deposited foulants although the monomers were also presented the exceptional data at the ratio of 0 33 and 7 could be ascribed to the relatively low concentration of aggregations in the mixtures additionally the mass of the deposited ha and the mass of the deposited lys showed a good linear relationship with a slope of 2 41 fig 3c which is very close to the mass ratio of ha and lys in the aggregations 2 77 these results confirmed that the aggregations were readily deposited on the membrane surface and the deposited foulants mainly consisted of the ha lys aggregations rather than the monomers the membrane fouling was jointly caused by the monomers and the aggregations because the monomer especially lys could also cause severe membrane fouling the rls intensity showed a poor correlation with the total fouling and the physically irreversible fouling fig s6 3 3 effects of ph and ionic strength on the fouling behavior of ha lys aggregations feed chemistry such as ph and ionic strength of solutes can change the electrostatic interaction between ha and lys thereby altering the fouling behavior of aggregations tang et al 2011 in this section the mixture of ha and lys at a mass ratio of 2 75 was investigated because almost no monomers were presented in this mixture at the ph of 7 5 and the ionic strength of 10 mmol l 3 3 1 effects of ph the effect of ph on rls intensity of the ha lys mixed solution is shown in fig 4 a at the ph range of 5 5 9 2 the marginal change of rls intensity suggested that the concentration of the ha lys aggregation was rarely varied with different ph the ph range of 5 5 9 2 belongs to the range of iepha and ieplys thus the ha was negative charged and the lys was positive charged fig s1 consequently the aggregations were easily formed which lead to a stable concentration of the ha lys aggregations however beyond this ph range ph 5 5 or ph 9 2 the aggregation concentration sharply decreased this result could be explained by the fact that the interactions between the ha and lys molecules were weakened by their reduced charge when the ph iepha or ph ieplys ha and lys had the same charge which induced an electrostatic repulsion therefore the ha lys aggregations were hardly formed the effect of ph on the physically irreversible fouling caused by the ha lys mixtures is shown in fig 4b similar to the trend of rls intensity changes of irreversible fouling were barely evident at the ph range of 4 1 9 2 the ph independent fouling phenomenon was also observed in previous study wang and tang 2011 however for a single foulant the irreversible fouling was more severe at the ph of iep fig s7 ibáñez et al 2007 the total mass of the deposited foulants only had a small fluctuation and the m lys m ha of the deposited foulants was almost identical fig 4c these results could be ascribed to the approximately equal concentration of the aggregations at this ph range at the ph near the ieplys the electrostatic repulsion among the lys molecules was very low therefore the membrane fouling was dramatically increased when the ph ieplys no aggregations were formed and the lys molecules repulsed with each other consequently the deposited foulants were sharply decreased fig 4c at the ph near the iepha the enhanced membrane fouling was also found at the ph near the ieplys the m lys m ha increased while at the ph near the iepha the m lys m ha decreased 3 3 2 effects of ionic strength the effect of ionic strength on the rls intensity of the ha lys mixtures is shown in fig 5 a the rls intensity sharply decreased as the ionic strength increased when the ionic strength 200 mmol l and then became stable with the further increase of the ionic strength the ha lys aggregations were formed by the electrostatic attraction between them high ionic strength suppressed the electrostatic attraction between ha and lys molecules by the effect of electrical double layer compression therefore a low rls intensity was observed at a high ionic strength it was suspected that the ha lys aggregations were hardly formed when the ionic strength 200 mmol l for the fouling caused by a single type of foulants more severe fouling was expected at high ionic strengths because of the electrical double layer compression effect fig s7 tang et al 2011 however the effect of ph on the fouling by ha lys aggregation did not follow the same trend fig 5b at an ionic strength of 0 100 mmol l the physically irreversible fouling decreased with increased ionic strength for example the fouling index at 100 mmol l was nearly three times lower than that at 0 mmol l this opposite trend could be explained by the decrease in the concentration of aggregations fig 5a the ionic strength dependent trend for the deposited foulants fig 5c was almost the same as that for the rls intensity fig 5a which could be ascribed to the fact that the aggregation was more readily deposited on the membrane surface compared with monomers when the ionic strength 100 mmol l physically irreversible fouling increased as the ionic strength increased at such a range of ionic strength the concentration of the aggregations was very low therefore the fouling behavior of the ha lys mixture was similar to that of the single foulant 3 4 implications according to the above study fouling behaviors of the aggregations and the monomer foulants were compared table 2 the aggregations were more readily deposited on the membrane surface and caused the fouling with low reversibility in the current study the fouling caused by the aggregations was not severe due to the formation of a porous cake layer however serious fouling problems may be expected when the membrane and the foulants are changed hwang and chiang 2014 marroquin et al 2014 vu et al 2016 for example at the case that the sizes of monomer foulants are smaller than the membrane pore while the sizes of the formed aggregations are similar to the membrane pore the aggregation could cause severe fouling due to pore blockage although the specific ha lys pair was examined in this study it demonstrated that the opposite charged substances could form aggregations in feed water the negative charged substances include humic substances polysaccharides negative charged proteins etc the positive charged substances include positive charged proteins dyes surfactants etc pivokonsky et al 2015 srisukphun et al 2009 in some water streams such as textile wastewater and food industry wastewater both negative charged substances and positive charged substances are existed srisukphun et al 2009 ye 2008 zuriaga agusti et al 2014 and the fouling by the aggregations formed by these opposite charged substances should be noticed the aggregations show some unique behaviors compared with the monomer foulants table 2 suggesting that the interaction among different types of foulants may play an important role in the fouling formation still now studies about the interaction among different foulants are still limited the current study focuses on electrostatic interaction other types of interactions such as hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding should be considered in further study 4 conclusions in this study the rls technique was used to study the fouling behavior of the aggregations formed by ha and lys the following conclusions could be drawn 1 ha and lys could form aggregations in water by the force of electrostatic attraction and the value of m lys m ha in the aggregation was 2 77 the ha lys aggregations led to an enhancement of light scattering intensity and the rls technique could be used to quantify the ha lys aggregations in the mixture of ha and lys 2 the ha lys aggregations were readily deposited on the membrane surface which led to fouling with low reversibility 15 20 however the specific hydraulic resistance of the cake layer formed by the aggregations was low due to their large size the mass of deposited organic matter shows a good linear relationship with the concentration of ha lys aggregations in the feed water 3 at the ph range of 5 5 9 2 the ph had a limiting effect on the concentration of ha lys aggregations and therefore a limiting effect on membrane fouling beyond this ph range the concentration of the aggregations was sharply decreased 4 the concentration of ha lys aggregation decreased as the ionic strength increased therefore the membrane fouling decrease as the ionic strength increased at low ionic strength however with the further increase of the ionic strength the membrane fouling increased due to the electrical double layer compression effect declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

18768,due to the lack of robust ways to quantify aggregations fouling of two foulant aggregations is poorly understood this work systematically reports the ultrafiltration membrane fouling by aggregations formed from two oppositely charged organic foulants i e humic acid ha and lysozyme lys with the aid of resonance light scattering rls technique rls provides an effective approach to detecting the aggregation concentration and reveals that the ha lys aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m lys m ha 2 77 during the filtration of the mixture of ha and lys aggregations over individual foulants were identified to be the main substances deposited on the membrane surface where the mass of deposition had a good linear relationship with the feed concentration of the aggregations the ha lys aggregations might decrease the total fouling due to their large size but reduce the fouling reversibility in the ph range of 5 5 9 2 the ph value had limiting effects on the concentration of ha lys aggregations as well as the consequent fouling at low ionic strength the membrane fouling by ha lys aggregations decreased as the ionic strength increased due to the reduction of the aggregation concentration oppositely at high ionic strength this tendency was reversed due to the electrical double layer compression effect these results suggest that rls is a simple and effective way to quantify the aggregations of foulants and the aggregations of foulants have distinct fouling behaviors compared with the individual foulants keywords membrane fouling aggregation resonance light scattering foulants deposition interaction 1 introduction organic matter can cause severe membrane fouling in a membrane filtration process chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 to gain fundamental understandings of the organic fouling phenomenon previous studies generally used a single type of model foulant such as alginate or humic acid ha in well defined conditions chen et al 2015 kim and dempsey 2013 shao et al 2017 these studies found that the foulants membrane and foulants foulants interactions play a crucial role in the fouling formation and these interactions are highly affected by solution chemistry li et al 2017 miao et al 2015 tang et al 2011 for example severe fouling is expected at a high ionic strength and a ph value close to the isoelectric point iep of an organic foulant because of the reduction of electrostatic repulsion among foulants miao et al 2017 yuan and zydney 2000 in practice the feed water for a membrane process is complex and contains more

therefore they have opposite charges in most raw streams and can easily form aggregations by electrostatic attraction the stock solution of ha was prepared according to our previous study li et al

aggregations formed by ha and lys 3 1 1 rls spectra of the mixtures of ha and lys the rls intensities of the single ha and lys solution were relatively low but the ha lys mixture s rls spectra were significantly intensified bearing a maximal intensity around 475 nm fig 1 a because of the electrostatic attractions negatively charged ha could bind to positively charged lys to form the ha lys aggregations these aggregations led to an enhancement of light scattering intensity pasternack and collings 1995 the formation of aggregations was also evidenced by the fluorescence quenching of the lys fluorescent signal in the mixture of ha and lys fig s4a wang et al 2015 when c lys c ha 2 77 the rls intensity linearly increased as c lys c ha increased r 2 0 965 fig 1b however when c lys c ha 2 77 the rls intensity was stabilized at a level of 573 0 these results could be explained by the fact that the ha lys aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m lys m ha 2 77 when c lys c ha 2 77 the mixtures had excessive levels of ha thus the concentration of ha lys aggregations increased as the c lys c ha increased leading to the increase of the rls intensity however when c lys c ha 2 77 the concentration of ha became the limiting factor for the formation of aggregations therefore the rls intensity and the concentration of ha lys aggregation were almost unchanged the mixtures of alginate and lys were also studied a similar two stage trend was obtained fig s5a due to the good linear relationship between the rls intensity and the concentration of aggregations the rls intensity could possibly be used to quantify the aggregations at a specific range 3 1 2 validation analysis of rls technique in the quantification of ha lys aggregations most of the ha and lys could not be rejected by the 150 kda pes membrane with rejections of 29 4 and 5 9 respectively however the rejections of ha and lys were significantly enhanced when filtering the mixture of ha and lys fig 2 a for example almost 100 rejection of lys was achieved when c lys c ha 3 and the rejection of lys gradually decreased as c lys c ha increased when c lys c ha 3 the variations of the rejections of ha and lys at different c lys c ha could be ascribed to the formation of ha lys aggregations the almost total rejections of ha and lys 95 100 in a specific range of c lys c ha in fig 2a suggested that nearly all the ha lys aggregations could be rejected by the 150 kda membrane which gave us the opportunity to identify the validation of rls technique in the quantification of the ha lys aggregations according to the results of rls fig 1b the ha lys aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m lys m ha 2 77 therefore the rejections of ha and lys could be calculated based on the following equations if c lys c ha 2 77 r lys 0 and r ha 1 29 4 c ha c lys 2 77 c ha if c lys c ha 2 77 r ha 0 and r lys 1 5 9 c lys 2 77 c ha c lys fig 2b compares the calculated data with the experimental data obtained in fig 2a almost all data points were clustered around the line y x suggesting that the two sets of data matched reasonably well in the mixture of alginate and lys the rls results also provided a reasonable prediction of the rejections of lys and alginate these results show that the rls results could be used for determining the mass ratio of the monomers in the aggregations or the number of binding sites during the interaction although fluorescence quenching method is commonly used for determining the number of binding sites in the monomers interaction arkhangelsky et al 2016 van de weert 2010 wang et al 2015 its results as shown in fig s4 were not consistent with the data in fig 2a fig s4b c in fluorescence quenching method the number of binding sites is determined basing on the presupposition that the formed aggregation is a non fluorescent complex van de weert 2010 however the ha lys aggregations may have residual fluorescence moreover the ha molecular can absorb the radiation emitted by lys fig s3 therefore fluorescence quenching method was not favorable in this study the concentration of the aggregations could be quantified by the decrease of the organic matter in the permeate due to the fact that the ha lys aggregations could be rejected by the 150 kda membrane fig 2c shows that the increase of rejected organic matter has a very good linear relationship with the rls intensity of the feed water r 2 0 987 which further improved the effectiveness of rls technique in the quantification of the ha lys aggregations in the mixture of alginate and lys similar results were also obtained fig s5b c 3 2 membrane fouling by the ha lys aggregations total fouling and physically irreversible fouling of the mixture of ha and lys are shown in fig 3 a because of the low molecular weight cutoff of the membrane 20 kda cake formation was expected to be the major fouling mechanism ha caused severe total fouling but the physically irreversible fouling is very low this high reversibility 86 6 was caused by the electrostatic repulsion among ha molecules shao et al 2016 tang et al 2011 lys also caused severe total fouling and the reversibility of lys fouling was relatively low 56 6 which may be caused by the electrostatic attraction between the positive charged lys and the negative charged membrane tang et al 2011 in the mixture of ha and lys both monomers ha and lys and aggregations present and the aggregations had the highest concentration at the ratio of c lys c ha 2 77 the total fouling gradually decreased as the contents of the ha lys aggregation increased and the minimal total fouling occurred when the ratio of c lys c ha was around 2 77 these results suggested that the ha lys aggregations caused relatively low total fouling probably due to the large size of aggregations the hydrodynamic diameter of ha lys and ha lys aggregations were 352 4 39 4 450 8 39 4 and 2967 7 293 1 nm respectively and produced a highly porous cake layer with low hydraulic resistance this result is consistent with the study of neemann et al 2013 which reported that the aggregation by alginate and bsa could be formed at low ph and the aggregation allows to form a more porous foulants layer possibly because of the low electrostatic repulsion among the aggregations they were readily deposited on the membrane surface consequently the reversibility of the fouling by aggregations is dramatically decreased 15 20 except for the mixture with c lys c ha 0 33 and 7 the rls intensity of the mixture had a good linear relationship with the total mass of the deposited foulants r 2 0 801 fig 3b suggesting that the aggregations in the feed water might determine the total mass of the deposited foulants although the monomers were also presented the exceptional data at the ratio of 0 33 and 7 could be ascribed to the relatively low concentration of aggregations in the mixtures additionally the mass of the deposited ha and the mass of the deposited lys showed a good linear relationship with a slope of 2 41 fig 3c which is very close to the mass ratio of ha and lys in the aggregations 2 77 these results confirmed that the aggregations were readily deposited on the membrane surface and the deposited foulants mainly consisted of the ha lys aggregations rather than the monomers the membrane fouling was jointly caused by the monomers and the aggregations because the monomer especially lys could also cause severe membrane fouling the rls intensity showed a poor correlation with the total fouling and the physically irreversible fouling fig s6 3 3 effects of ph and ionic strength on the fouling behavior of ha lys aggregations feed chemistry such as ph and ionic strength of solutes can change the electrostatic interaction between ha and lys thereby altering the fouling behavior of aggregations tang et al 2011 in this section the mixture of ha and lys at a mass ratio of 2 75 was investigated because almost no monomers were presented in this mixture at the ph of 7 5 and the ionic strength of 10 mmol l 3 3 1 effects of ph the effect of ph on rls intensity of the ha lys mixed solution is shown in fig 4 a at the ph range of 5 5 9 2 the marginal change of rls intensity suggested that the concentration of the ha lys aggregation was rarely varied with different ph the ph range of 5 5 9 2 belongs to the range of iepha and ieplys thus the ha was negative charged and the lys was positive charged fig s1 consequently the aggregations were easily formed which lead to a stable concentration of the ha lys aggregations however beyond this ph range ph 5 5 or ph 9 2 the aggregation concentration sharply decreased this result could be explained by the fact that the interactions between the ha and lys molecules were weakened by their reduced charge when the ph iepha or ph ieplys ha and lys had the same charge which induced an electrostatic repulsion therefore the ha lys aggregations were hardly formed the effect of ph on the physically irreversible fouling caused by the ha lys mixtures is shown in fig 4b similar to the trend of rls intensity changes of irreversible fouling were barely evident at the ph range of 4 1 9 2 the ph independent fouling phenomenon was also observed in previous study wang and tang 2011 however for a single foulant the irreversible fouling was more severe at the ph of iep fig s7 ibáñez et al 2007 the total mass of the deposited foulants only had a small fluctuation and the m lys m ha of the deposited foulants was almost identical fig 4c these results could be ascribed to the approximately equal concentration of the aggregations at this ph range at the ph near the ieplys the electrostatic repulsion among the lys molecules was very low therefore the membrane fouling was dramatically increased when the ph ieplys no aggregations were formed and the lys molecules repulsed with each other consequently the deposited foulants were sharply decreased fig 4c at the ph near the iepha the enhanced membrane fouling was also found at the ph near the ieplys the m lys m ha increased while at the ph near the iepha the m lys m ha decreased 3 3 2 effects of ionic strength the effect of ionic strength on the rls intensity of the ha lys mixtures is shown in fig 5 a the rls intensity sharply decreased as the ionic strength increased when the ionic strength 200 mmol l and then became stable with the further increase of the ionic strength the ha lys aggregations were formed by the electrostatic attraction between them high ionic strength suppressed the electrostatic attraction between ha and lys molecules by the effect of electrical double layer compression therefore a low rls intensity was observed at a high ionic strength it was suspected that the ha lys aggregations were hardly formed when the ionic strength 200 mmol l for the fouling caused by a single type of foulants more severe fouling was expected at high ionic strengths because of the electrical double layer compression effect fig s7 tang et al 2011 however the effect of ph on the fouling by ha lys aggregation did not follow the same trend fig 5b at an ionic strength of 0 100 mmol l the physically irreversible fouling decreased with increased ionic strength for example the fouling index at 100 mmol l was nearly three times lower than that at 0 mmol l this opposite trend could be explained by the decrease in the concentration of aggregations fig 5a the ionic strength dependent trend for the deposited foulants fig 5c was almost the same as that for the rls intensity fig 5a which could be ascribed to the fact that the aggregation was more readily deposited on the membrane surface compared with monomers when the ionic strength 100 mmol l physically irreversible fouling increased as the ionic strength increased at such a range of ionic strength the concentration of the aggregations was very low therefore the fouling behavior of the ha lys mixture was similar to that of the single foulant 3 4 implications according to the above study fouling behaviors of the aggregations and the monomer foulants were compared table 2 the aggregations were more readily deposited on the membrane surface and caused the fouling with low reversibility in the current study the fouling caused by the aggregations was not severe due to the formation of a porous cake layer however serious fouling problems may be expected when the membrane and the foulants are changed hwang and chiang 2014 marroquin et al 2014 vu et al 2016 for example at the case that the sizes of monomer foulants are smaller than the membrane pore while the sizes of the formed aggregations are similar to the membrane pore the aggregation could cause severe fouling due to pore blockage although the specific ha lys pair was examined in this study it demonstrated that the opposite charged substances could form aggregations in feed water the negative charged substances include humic substances polysaccharides negative charged proteins etc the positive charged substances include positive charged proteins dyes surfactants etc pivokonsky et al 2015 srisukphun et al 2009 in some water streams such as textile wastewater and food industry wastewater both negative charged substances and positive charged substances are existed srisukphun et al 2009 ye 2008 zuriaga agusti et al 2014 and the fouling by the aggregations formed by these opposite charged substances should be noticed the aggregations show some unique behaviors compared with the monomer foulants table 2 suggesting that the interaction among different types of foulants may play an important role in the fouling formation still now studies about the interaction among different foulants are still limited the current study focuses on electrostatic interaction other types of interactions such as hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding should be considered in further study 4 conclusions in this study the rls technique was used to study the fouling behavior of the aggregations formed by ha and lys the following conclusions could be drawn 1 ha and lys could form aggregations in water by the force of electrostatic attraction and the value of m lys m ha in the aggregation was 2 77 the ha lys aggregations led to an enhancement of light scattering intensity and the rls technique could be used to quantify the ha lys aggregations in the mixture of ha and lys 2 the ha lys aggregations were readily deposited on the membrane surface which led to fouling with low reversibility 15 20 however the specific hydraulic resistance of the cake layer formed by the aggregations was low due to their large size the mass of deposited organic matter shows a good linear relationship with the concentration of ha lys aggregations in the feed water 3 at the ph range of 5 5 9 2 the ph had a limiting effect on the concentration of ha lys aggregations and therefore a limiting effect on membrane fouling beyond this ph range the concentration of the aggregations was sharply decreased 4 the concentration of ha lys aggregation decreased as the ionic strength increased therefore the membrane fouling decrease as the ionic strength increased at low ionic strength however with the further increase of the ionic strength the membrane fouling increased due to the electrical double layer compression effect declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

because of dermal exposure kunisue et al 2012 wang et al 2013 hence an efficient and economical approach to removing these pollutants from aquatic environments is highly needed advanced oxidation processes aops which can generate reactive species are becoming increasingly popular technologies for contaminants degradation in water oller et al 2011 oturan and aaron 2014 radical based aops in particular those with hydroxyl radical ho or sulfate radical so4 have been successfully applied to decompose micropollutants keen and linden 2013 luo et al 2015 2017 nfodzo and choi 2011 yang et al

reports have shown that many micropollutants can react rapidly with ho 108 k 1010 m 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 whereas the reaction rates of pcps with ho and so4 have not been extensively studied especially for secondary reactive species i e carbonate radical co3 additionally one critical issue is that micropollutants such as pcps normally occur in a co exposure pattern rather than individual existence in aqueous environments the degradation behaviors of pcps in co exposure pattern are likely different from individual pattern using aops however the specific difference of degradation behaviors and its related factors for triggering are still unknown furthermore constituents in various water matrices make micropollutants degradation even more complex because of conversions of reactive species yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge degradation behaviors of multiple pcps i e uv filters by aops in various aqueous environments have not been investigated in this study the degradation of benzophenone derivatives in both individual and co exposure patterns by uv h2o2 and uv pds in the presence of different water matrices surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater was comprehensively investigated the degradation kinetics were also experimentally and mathematically determined for the first time the reaction rate constants of benzophenone derivatives toward ho so4 and co3 were determined which can largely benefit the future work regarding on the kinetic simulation of radical based degradation in other water matrices an

using nitrobenzene nb anisole as and para nitroaniline pna as reference compounds respectively co3 was generated by adding excess sodium bicarbonate 0 5 m during uv h2o2 process the experiments were conducted in pbs at ph 7 for ho and so4 and ph 9 for co3 the initial concentrations of uv filters and oxidants were 5 μm and 500 μm respectively in addition the concentrations of nb as and pna were 5

reactive species ianni 2012 the virtues of kintecus runs incredibly fast on personal computer and is basically unrestricted in terms of the number of reactions and species further the program automatically checks for correct mass and charge balance and also offers the opportunity to modify the concentrations of selected compounds at any point during time scale this feature easily allows modeling the actual conditions of experiments more than two hundred elementary reactions tables s3 were involved this model accounts for the effects of most inorganic ions including chloride sulfate carbonate species and bromide on uv h2o2 and uv pds and it has been successfully employed in several studies with proven reliability for simulations sun et al 2016 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016a 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct photolysis direct photolysis uv alone of individual bp1 bp3 and bp8 for individual substance hereafter referred to as bp and co exposure referred to bps benzophenone derivatives were studied in ultrapure water with pbs after 60 min irradiation the degradation of bp and bps were not evidently observed figure s2 confirms their photo stability these results were consistent with previous study which also did not observe bp3 photo degradation under uv irradiation liu et al 2011 meanwhile no degradation of bp was observed after 60 min with either h2o2 or pds in the absence of light figure s2 indicating that the degradation role of oxidants can be neglected therefore in this study this discussion focuses on photolysis via photo generated reactive species in different matrices 3 2 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in ultrapure water kinetic modeling was combined with experiments to comprehensively illustrate how the target compounds degradation was driven by different radicals rather than to draw a definitive conclusion on the concentration of radical in uv h2o2 and uv pds the overall degradation is owing to both direct and indirect photolysis eq 1 1 d b p d t k o b s b p k d k i b p k i b p where k obs is the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constant min 1 kd is the measured pseudo first order direct photolysis rate constant min 1 and ki is the indirect photolysis rate constant min 1 and is primarily related to reactive species due to negligible direct photolysis figure s2 the k obs equals to the indirect photolysis rate ki in uv h2o2 or uv pds bp was treated by uv with either 500 μm of h2o2 or pds at ph 7 2 the photolysis rate of bp followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s3 in ultrapure water k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 were increased from 0 to 0 214 0 278 and 0 348 min 1 respectively by uv h2o2 the increase of k obs was primarily due to the contribution of ho a competition kinetic method text s2 was used to determine the second order rate constants of bp with ho k ho table 2 which were in a narrow range 6 25 109 to 7 05 109 m 1 s 1 due to low selectivity of ho a higher k ho led to a higher degradation rate of bp fig 1 a furthermore degradation results from bps treatment by uv h2o2 showed that each contaminant followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s3d to be noted the degradation rate in co exposure pattern followed the order bp3 bp8 bp1 which differs from individual pattern bp1 bp3 bp8 this result indicates that some interference may occurred during co exposure the different degradation orders of individual and co exposure patterns may relate to molecular structure byproducts generated and treatment technique indicating that further study was needed compared with uv h2o2 uv pds in ultrapure water led to faster bp degradation but to different extents fig 1b the second order rate constants of bp with so4 k so4 were determined using competition kinetic text s2 which were 1 68 2 60 and 2 77 1010 m 1 s 1 for bp1 bp3 and bp8 respectively table 2 k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were 0 253 0 408 and 0 448 min 1 respectively all these values were higher than those observed when using uv h2o2 the enhanced degradation of bp in uv pds was mainly attributed to the formation rate of so4 from pds φpds 0 7 was higher than that of ho from h2o2 φh2o2 0 5 baxendale and wilson 1957 mark et al 1990 the degradation rates in co exposure pattern using uv pds followed the order bp1 bp3 bp8 which also differs from individual system bp1 bp3 bp8 in co exposure pattern k obs for bp1 bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were 0 094 0 128 and 0 128 min 1 respectively higher than those obtained in uv h2o2 meanwhile the overall k obs of bps for uv pds was 1 61 times higher than that for uv h2o2 therefore uv pds treatment demonstrated higher degradation efficiency for the abatement of target compounds overall results show that uv pds in ultrapure water was more efficient than uv h2o2 for both individual and co exposure patterns however whether this conclusion can be applied in real matrices need further investigation the presence of diverse constituents in actual environments and conversion of reactive species can further complicate these contaminants elimination additionally degradation behavior of target contaminants could be distinct for different feeding patterns representing a topic that has not been previously examined in a systematic manner this research is significant demanded because of the coexistence of constituents and multiple benzophenone derivatives in aquatic environments therefore three typical water matrices including surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater were selected for further studies owing to uv filters occurrence asimakopoulos et al 2014 cuderman and heath 2007 kim and choi 2014 magi et al 2013 manasfi et al 2015 meeker et al 2013 philippat et al 2012 tsui et al 2014 3 3 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in surface water compared to ultrapure water k obs for bp1 bp3 and bp8 using uv h2o2 decreased by 46 24 51 50 and 58 37 respectively in surface water fig 2 a kinetic modeling indicated that ho concentration decreased to 5 05 10 13 m in surface water compared to that in ultrapure water 5 00 10 12 m table 1 the decrease in ho concentration was primarily due to competing reactions with natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate hco3 the second order rate constants of nom with ho and co3 have been reported as 3 9 108 mc 1 s 1 and 2 3 104 mc 1 s 1 respectively brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 canonica et al 2005 high concentration and reactivity toward radicals made nom become the major scavenger in surface water the k obs for bp was inhibited by less than 60 which indicated that bp degradation was not only governed by ho the k obs in surface water should have been approximately 10 of that in ultrapure water if only ho oxidation was considered table 1 this discrepancy suggests that co3 was also responsible for bp degradation the second order rate constants of bp with co3 k co3 were also determined text s2 and it revealed that co3 exhibited lower reactivity than ho table 2 compared with other contaminants whose second order rate constants with co3 were approximately 106 107 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2015 bp was highly reactive toward co3 1 25 107 to 3 28 107 m 1 s 1 because of its electron rich moieties although k co3 was at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of k ho the higher selectivity of co3 also rendered it less susceptible to be scavenged by constituents zhang et al 2016a this lower susceptibility was evident from modeling which showed that the concentration of co3 was almost 30 times higher than that of ho in surface water table 1 and s5 in uv pds treated surface water k obs of bp also experienced a strong suppression especially for bp3 and bp8 fig 2b given electrophilic nature of co3 liu et al 2015 aromatic contaminants with electron donating substituents are also reactive toward co3 similar to ho and so4 two hydroxyl groups oh on bp1 can activate benzene ring which explains why bp1 demonstrates higher reactivity than bp3 and bp8 likewise k obs should approach zero if degradation was only governed by so4 and ho further confirming the participation of co3 in bp degradation when surface water was treated by uv pds a higher degradation rate for bp1 and lower degradation rates for bp3 and bp8 can be observed compare to uv h2o2 based on the simulated so4 and ho concentrations table 1 and measured rate constants table 2 uv pds was expected to have better performance on bp degradation than uv h2o2 however this hypothesis was only true for bp1 fig 2 a lower concentration of co3 table 1 and k co3 played a critical role in the degradation of bp3 and bp8 further study is necessary to determine whether any underestimated rate constant for the reaction with or unknown scavenger of so4 which can resulted in a lower concentration than predicted result when bps were added to surface water and treated using uv h2o2 and uv pds degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s5d and s6d interestingly the overall k obs for bps treated with uv h2o2 0 206 min 1 exceeded that of uv pds 0 178 min 1 fig 2 the order of degradation for bps via uv h2o2 was bp1 bp8 bp3 which was different from that in individual system bp1 bp3 bp8 one possible explanation for this difference was that bp3 may transform into bp8 via i hydrogen abstraction by ho or ii electron transfer from ho and co3 scheme 1 this hypothesis was verified by bp8 appearance when bp3 was treated using uv h2o2 figure s7 the ho byproducts generated could be detected as well for different model compounds using uv h2o2 yao et al 2013 feng et al 2015 castro et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b yin et al 2018 a suppression of bp1 by uv pds in co exposure pattern might suggest the conversion of bp3 to bp1 similarly via cytochrome p450 enzymes nakagawa and suzuki 2002 however it was disregarded because of the absence of bp1 when bp3 was treated using uv pds a possibility existed that intermediates from bp3 or and bp8 were susceptible to co3 attack which leading to the suppression of bp1 3 4 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in hydrolyzed urine recovering nutrients from human urine to produce fertilizers can potentially benefit wastewater management and resource recovery strategies etter et al 2011 however high concentration of micropollutants in urine can accumulate in soil and plants and become hazardous khan and nicell 2010 winker et al 2010 thus the removal of micropollutants from urine becomes necessary for urine based fertilizers the removal of both pharmaceuticals and their metabolites i e sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and n 4 acetylsulfamethoxazole by aops in urine have been reported zhang et al 2015 however few studies have focused on the abatement of pcps in urine particularly for the frequent occurrence of uv filters cuderman and heath 2007 meeker et al 2013 compared with k obs of bp via uv h2o2 in ultrapure water k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 via uv h2o2 in hydrolyzed urine decreased by 59 32 86 77 and 90 53 respectively and followed the order of bp8 bp3 bp1 fig 3a and s8 kinetic modeling indicated that ho concentration decreased from 5 00 10 12 m in ultrapure water to 1 62 10 15 m in hydrolyzed urine table 1 the decrease in ho concentration was primarily due to competing reactions involving ammonia nh3 and hco3 the degradation of bp in hydrolyzed urine cannot be fully attributed to ho table 1 and fig 3 a because k obs should close to zero if the oxidation is governed only by ho these results suggested other reactive species contributed to bp degradation high concentrations of nh3 hco3 and chloride cl in hydrolyzed urine could be considered as sources for their corresponding radicals table 1 amino radical nh2 would be initially generated from the reaction of nh3 and ho no 102 tables s3 then after a series of reactions with oxygen and h2o2 nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 nitric oxide radicals no onooh onoo and a few other reactive intermediates would be produced although rate constants between reactive nitrogen species rns and bp have not been previously determined the reactions are expected because rns are known to react with electron rich aromatic moieties neta et al 1978 nh2 reacts with phenol and compounds with primary amine functional groups i e p aminophenol and p phenylenediamine neta et al 1978 amino acids and melanins clarke et al 2008 given aromatic moieties oh as electron donating group of bp they are likely to react with onooh which could induce the nitration of naphthalene and benzene vione et al 2005 the simulation results suggest that no likely degrades bp to some extent because of its high concentration 2 32 10 5 m table 1 although nh2 concentration 3 37 10 13 m table 1 was low identified byproducts suggests that nh2 could react with bp for instance bp3 even m z numbers i e 228 258 280 288 and 296 figure s9 indicate that generated transformation products tps contained an odd number of nitrogen atoms the exact mass information of tps were illustrated by using ltq orbitrap velos pro mass deviations of all proposed formulas were in the range of 10 ppm of mass accuracy tables s4 specifically tp 228 m z 228 c14h14no2 implies that the oh was replaced by nh2 which further oxidized to a nitro group tp 258 m z 258 c14h12no4 the concentration of co3 in hydrolyzed urine 2 41 10 13 m table 1 decreased notably compared with that in surface water 1 44 10 11 m table 1 this decrease is primarily due to i both hco3 and nh3 competing to react with ho and ii the combination reaction between co3 and nh2 in addition co3 concentration was inadequate to retain the significant degradation for bp furthermore when cl was not considered during simulations for hydrolyzed urine ho and co3 concentrations would be the same although the reaction rate of ho with cl is high no 52 table s3 a fast backward reaction no 53 table s3 also simultaneously occurs leading to a stable ho concentration hence all the other rns radicals generated from ho would demonstrate negligible change due to cl table s5 meanwhile when hydrolyzed urine without cl was selected as a matrix k obs of bp was nearly identical to that in hydroxyl urine figure s10a these results suggest that reactive chlorine species rcs did not contribute to bp degradation because of its low concentrations table 1 compared with k obs of bp by uv pds in ultrapure water k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 by uv pds in hydrolyzed urine decreased by 66 81 90 37 and 88 54 respectively and followed the order of bp3 bp8 bp1 fig 3b and s11 k obs of bp1 and bp3 in hydrolyzed urine by uv pds were comparable to those in uv h2o2 fig 3 the quenching effect of nh3 on so4 no 103 table s3 was lower than that on ho no 102 table s3 due to the lower reaction rate thus a significant concentration of so4 together with rns should have resulted in a greater removal rate for bp8 in uv pds this rate was 1 56 times higher than that for uv h2o2 notably no2 and onooh onoo concentrations were much lower in uv pds than those in uv h2o2 because h2o2 was essential in their generation process in uv pds hydrolyzed urine without cl also negligibly affected k obs for bp figure s10b according to kinetic model the decreased so4 concentration was mainly attributed to scavenging effect of cl no 54 table s3 unlike cloh generation of so4 from the reaction of chlorine atom cl and sulfate ion was slow due to low sulfate concentration and low reaction rate constant no 55 table s3 huie et al 1991 instead the reaction of cl with h2o and ho produced cloh which theoretically led to a higher ho concentration whereas the presence of hco3 converted ho to co3 3 09 10 12 m for uv pds and 2 41 10 13 m for uv h2o2 in table 1 however simulated radical concentrations could not fully account for the observed degradation rates in the experiments this finding may be due to the overestimated scavenging effect of pds on co3 yang et al 2014 in co exposure pattern degradation of individual contaminant obeyed pseudo first order kinetics figure s8d and s11d notably bp3 degradation was strongly suppressed only 6 06 and 5 69 of the overall degradation in uv h2o2 and uv pds respectively fig 3 this suppression is primarily attributed to molecular structure and rns selectivity in details och3 group on bp3 inhibit rns attraction due to steric hindrance and electron drawing induction compare to bp1 meanwhile bp8 was more reactive than bp3 due to its electron donating oh on a different benzene ring b smith and march 2007 the generated rns were more prone to react with electron rich sites neta et al 1978 simultaneously byproducts formed from bp1 and or bp8 via both aops during individual pattern could easily be attacked by rns owing to the lack of such discrepancy for bp3 and bp8 in particular high selectivity of rns played a critical role in the rapid degradation of bp1 in hydrolyzed urine a similar tendency for co exposure pattern via uv h2o2 and uv pds was observed this result implies that rns except for co3 exerted significant influence on the degradation behavior of bps in hydrolyzed urine 3 5 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in seawater various pcps including uv filters are introduced by swimmers into seawater the concentrations of pcps in seawater ranged the level from ng l 1 to μg l 1 díaz cruz et al 2008 ekowati et al 2016 giokas et al 2007 sun et al 2014 weng et al 2014 the increase in popularity of by recreational activities in seawater including swimming snorkeling and scuba diving brings the ubiquity of uv filters by extensive of visitors danovaro et al 2008 lamb et al 2014 high reactivity of uv filters i e bp3 with chlorine in bromide rich seawater leads to the formation of chlorinated brominated disinfection byproducts abdallah et al 2015 to date potential degradation of uv filters by uv based aops in seawater has not been thoroughly investigated compared with k obs for bp degradation in ultrapure water those for bp1 bp3 and bp8 degradation in seawater were reduced by 18 08 86 20 and 90 96 for individual system via uv h2o2 respectively fig 4a and s12 kinetic modeling indicated that ho concentration decreased from 5 00 10 12 m in ultrapure water to 1 04 10 14 m in seawater table 1 the decrease of ho concentration was primarily due to competing anions including cl hco3 and bromide br the modeling ho concentrations in seawater without cl hco3 and br was 6 55 10 14 1 06 10 14 and 1 77 10 12 m respectively table s6 results indicated that br was the sink for ho highlighting the important role of br despite its low concentration relative to that of cl hence conversion of ho to less reactive halogen species rhs and co3 was responsible for k obs decrease the degradation rate followed the order bp8 bp3 bp1 fig 4 a likewise k obs should close to zero if the oxidation by only ho was considered high concentration of cl in seawater guaranteed an abundance of its corresponding radical table 1 the generated rhs including cl and cl2 favored co3 generation compared with bp3 or bp8 high selectivity of rhs for bp1 may responsible for its eminent degradation because k co3 was still of the same order of magnitude table 2 compared with k obs for bp in ultrapure water those for bp1 bp3 and bp8 in seawater were reduced by 17 76 54 44 and 58 73 for individual systems via uv pds respectively fig 4b and s13 similarly conversion of ho and so4 to rhs and co3 was responsible for k obs decrease in uv pds k obs of bp were higher than those in uv h2o2 especially for bp3 and bp8 fig 4b likewise k obs for all bp should close to zero if the oxidation only dominated by so4 and ho co3 should not be responsible for the significant degradation improvement for bp3 and bp8 fig 4 because its concentration was decreased by 15 times 1 22 10 10 m for uv h2o2 and 7 87 10 12 m for uv pds table 1 furthermore comparison of rhs concentrations between uv h2o2 and uv pds were performed the concentrations of halogen radicals including cl cl2 br br2 and brcl in uv pds were 2 10 times higher than those in uv h2o2 the concentration of clo was 9 orders of magnitude higher in uv pds than uv h2o2 table 1 unlike uv h2o2 the concentration of so4 for uv pds without cl hco3 and br barely reached those levels in ultrapure water table s6 surprisingly when cl and br were absent so4 concentration was nearly identical to that observed in ultrapure water this similarity demonstrates that coexistence of cl and br was the sink for so4 nevertheless ho concentration from modeling calculation was 4 6 times lower than that in ultrapure water due to the presence of hco3 the enhanced degradation in uv pds compared to uv h2o2 may stem from higher rhs concentrations until now identification of the halogen radical s accounting for improvement of bp degradation was still unclear with respect to co exposure pattern in seawater uv h2o2 for bps followed pseudo first order kinetics and exhibited similar degradation tendency as individual system figure s12d and 4a similarly degradation of bp1 via uv pds was consistent with pseudo first order kinetics figure s14a however degradation of bp3 and bp8 via uv pds displayed biphasic kinetics figure s14b c specifically their degradation was initially slow a lag phase followed by a rapid secondary decay phase these results imply that the capability of rhs contributing to degradation of investigated compounds was different moreover non first order degradation of co exposure micropollutants by uv pds has not been previously reported currently elucidation of non first order degradation behavior is difficult as we observed the contribution of rhs for bp3 and bp8 rarely occurred until bp1 had decreased by certain level 89 30 for bp3 and 73 84 for bp8 this phenomenon was due to a higher selectivity of rhs for bp1 than bp3 and bp8 furthermore occurrence of an accelerating stage ca 25 min for bp3 and 15 min for bp8 may due to the differences in molecular structure besides m methoxyphenol a higher electron donor character of phenol phenolate functional group favors the electrophilic attack of chlorine or bromine deborde and von gunten 2008 this finding might provide the insight knowledge to unravel non first order behavior in co exposure pattern rhs investigation based on radical reactions in seawater are much more complicated than those in ultrapure water future work should utilize this type of investigation to elucidate such degradation behavior in summary degradation behaviors of target contaminants depend on i their molecular structure ii operable uv based aops iii matrix constituents and iv feeding patterns individual or co exposure molecular properties such as geometric configuration and charge distribution would be the intrinsic factor for degradation behaviors ho and so4 are the reactive species source during uv h2o2 and uv pds processes respectively constituents i e hco3 nh3 cl and br and their concentrations in water matrix affect conversion of reactive species which complicates the elimination of contaminants notably the reaction between reactive species i e rns and rhs and parent compounds can generate various byproducts and elucidating their mechanisms requires further study in particular because benzophenone derivatives frequently co exist in aqueous environments examination on co exposure pattern is more practical and can benefit the overall understanding of their abatement furthermore mechanism of interference from generated byproducts and non first order behavior also warrants further investigation compared with those in ultrapure water degradation efficiency on bp for uv h2o2 and uv pds in real matrices was decreased by various extents 17 76 90 96 accordingly economic analysis regarding bp degradation is necessary to facilitate the selection of a cost efficient treatment 3 6 economic analysis using ee o to compare aops for bp degradation in different water matrices surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater an economic analysis using electrical efficiency per log order ee o concept was further conducted details about calculation of ee o were described in the text s3 in this study ee ototal was calculated based on 90 of target compounds removal as shown in table 3 uv h2o2 was more cost effective treatment than uv pds when bp degradation happened in ultrapure water surface water and hydrolyzed urine except for bp8 this was primarily because pds was more expensive than h2o2 nevertheless uv pds process costs less energy than uv h2o2 process in seawater except for bp1 which ascribe to the higher concentration of rhs as we discussed in section 3 5 regardless of uv h2o2 and uv pds it was generally less effective in synthetic matrices than in ultrapure water for example at the molar fraction of oxidant bp3 100 the ee ototal for the uv h2o2 in ultrapure water is 0 63 10 3 kwh l 1 which is 1 87 6 38 and 6 13 times lower that in surface water 1 18 10 3 kwh l 1 hydrolyzed urine 4 02 10 3 kwh l 1 and seawater 3 86 10 3 kwh l 1 respectively similarly the ee ototal for bp3 elimination via uv pds in ultrapure water is 1 62 10 3 kwh l 1 which is 2 72 3 04 and 1 26 times lower that in surface water 4 41 10 3 kwh l 1 hydrolyzed urine 4 92 10 3 kwh l 1 and seawater 2 04 10 3 kwh l 1 respectively these results further demonstrate that constituents of water matrices can greatly affect the efficiency of aops for contaminants removal 4 conclusions the individual and co exposure patterns of benzophenone derivatives degradation using uv h2o2 and uv pds were investigated under various water matrices the following conclusions were obtained 1 benzophenone derivatives could be degraded by ho so4 and co3 and the second order rate constants were determined table 2 2 in surface water attack of bp3 by ho and co3 in uv h2o2 can generate bp8 which was responsible for the relatively high degradation rate of bp3 intermediates generated from bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were susceptible to co3 which resulting in the reduction for bp1 degradation 3 in hydrolyzed urine cl was shown the negligible for benzophenone derivatives degradation due to low concentration of rcs bp3 abatement was excessively inhibited during co exposure pattern for both aops 4 in seawater non first order kinetic behavior for bp3 and bp8 was found during co exposure pattern br was the sink of ho and the co existence of br and cl was the sink of so4 5 in terms of energy efficiency uv h2o2 process is usually more economically competitive than uv pds process we holistically evaluated the performance of two typical aops uv h2o2 and uv pds which depended on i molecular structure of contaminants ii components of water matrices and iii reactive radical species kinetic simulations conducted in this study provided a trend comparison of radical concentrations under different conditions results illustrated the variation of main reactive species and unraveled the differences in aops meanwhile due to the coexistence and interference of benzophenone derivatives their degradation becomes more complicated hence a comprehensive evaluation of aops performance for micropollutants destroying in natural matrices is urgently needed our

degradation behaviors on co exposure benzophenone derivatives using uv driven advanced oxidation processes under different aqueous environments are still unknown in this study the degradation behavior of mixed benzophenone derivatives via uv h2o2 and uv peroxydisulfate pds in different water matrices surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater were systematically examined in surface water the attack of bp3 by hydroxyl radicals ho or carbonate radicals co3 in uv h2o2 can generate bp8 which was responsible for the relatively high degradation rate of bp3 intermediates from bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were susceptible to co3 bringing inhibition of bp1 degradation in hydrolyzed urine cl was shown the negligible effect for benzophenone derivatives degradation due to low concentration of reactive

benzophenone derivatives are commonly used due to their high photo biostability resulting in their general occurrence in environment media especially aqueous environments brausch and rand 2011

in recent decades schlumpf et al 2001 schreurs et al 2005 suzuki et al 2005 tang et al 2013 the most detected uv filters families in surface water were benzophenone derivatives with concentrations up

because of dermal exposure kunisue et al 2012 wang et al 2013 hence an efficient and economical approach to removing these pollutants from aquatic environments is highly needed advanced oxidation processes aops which can generate reactive species are becoming increasingly popular technologies for contaminants degradation in water oller et al 2011 oturan and aaron 2014 radical based aops in particular those with hydroxyl radical ho or sulfate radical so4 have been successfully applied to decompose micropollutants keen and linden 2013 luo et al 2015 2017 nfodzo and choi 2011 yang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 meanwhile aops were also used in human urine and seawater to obtain the pharmaceuticals removal toxicity elimination and disinfection zhang et al 2015 2016b rubio et al 2013 reports have shown that many micropollutants can react rapidly with ho 108 k 1010 m 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 whereas the reaction rates of pcps with ho and so4 have not been extensively studied especially for secondary reactive species i e carbonate radical co3 additionally one critical issue is that micropollutants such as pcps normally occur in a co exposure pattern rather than individual existence in aqueous environments the degradation behaviors of pcps in co exposure pattern are likely different from individual pattern using aops however the specific difference of degradation behaviors and its related factors for triggering are still unknown furthermore constituents in various water matrices make micropollutants degradation even more complex because of conversions of reactive species yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge degradation behaviors of multiple pcps i e uv filters by aops in various aqueous environments have not been investigated in this study the degradation of benzophenone derivatives in both individual and co exposure patterns by uv h2o2 and uv pds in the presence of different water matrices surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater was comprehensively investigated the degradation kinetics were also experimentally and mathematically determined for the first time the reaction rate constants of benzophenone derivatives toward ho so4 and co3 were determined which can largely benefit the future work regarding on the kinetic simulation of radical based degradation in other water matrices an energy cost evaluation i e electrical efficiency per log order ee o was also conducted to compare the energy cost of uv based aops in different water matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents sources of chemicals reagents and synthetic matrices were provided in the supporting information text s1 and tables s1 s2 2 2 kinetics of uv filter oxidation by uv h2o2 and uv pds in different water matrices a semi collimated beam apparatus figure s1 consisting of one 15 w low pressure mercury lamp above a quartz reactor 6 cm diameter 5 cm height was employed for batch studies

the volumetric light irradiance i 1 99 10 6 e l 1 s 1 was determined by h2o2 chemical actinometry beltrán et al 1995 yin et al 2018 all kinetics experiments were performed twice at least 2 3 determination of second order rate constants of uv filters with ho so4 and co3 competition kinetic approaches were used to determine the second order rate constants of uv filters with ho so4 and co3 using nitrobenzene nb anisole as and para nitroaniline pna as reference compounds respectively co3 was generated by adding excess sodium bicarbonate 0 5 m during uv h2o2 process the experiments were conducted in pbs at ph 7 for ho and so4 and ph 9 for co3 the initial concentrations of uv filters and oxidants were 5 μm and 500 μm respectively in addition the concentrations of nb as and pna were 5 μm 50 μm and 5 μm respectively 2 4 chemical analysis a hitachi l 2130 hplc equipped with an inert sustain c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm particle size and l 2420 uv vis detector was used to quantify uv filters the column temperature was set at 35 c the eluent was methanol 0 1 acetic acid purified water v v 80 20 flow rate was 1 ml min the injection volume was 10 μl for each sample and uv detection was set at 290 nm detection wavelengths for nb as and pna were set at 275 270 and 220 nm respectively the transformation products of uv filters were identified by hplc coupled triple quadrupole ms

resolution of scan description was ftms m z 100 500 and 60000 respectively 2 5 kinetic modeling radical concentrations in uv h2o2 and uv pds systems were simulated using kintecus 4 55 to evaluate the reactive species ianni 2012 the virtues of kintecus runs incredibly fast on personal computer and is basically unrestricted in terms of the number of reactions and species further the program automatically checks for correct mass and charge balance and also offers the opportunity to modify the concentrations of selected compounds at any point during time scale this feature easily allows modeling the actual conditions of experiments more than two hundred elementary reactions tables s3 were involved this model accounts for the effects of most inorganic ions including chloride sulfate carbonate species and bromide on uv h2o2 and uv pds and it has been successfully employed in several studies with proven reliability for simulations sun et al 2016 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016a 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct photolysis direct photolysis uv alone of individual bp1 bp3 and bp8 for individual substance hereafter referred to as bp and co exposure referred to bps benzophenone derivatives were studied in ultrapure water with pbs after 60 min irradiation the degradation of bp and bps were not evidently observed figure s2 confirms their photo stability these results were consistent with previous study which also did not observe bp3 photo degradation under uv irradiation liu et al 2011 meanwhile no degradation of bp was observed after 60 min with either h2o2 or pds in the absence of light figure s2 indicating that the degradation role of oxidants can be neglected therefore in this study this discussion focuses on photolysis via photo generated reactive species in different matrices 3 2 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in ultrapure water kinetic modeling was combined with experiments to comprehensively illustrate how the target compounds degradation was driven by different radicals rather than to draw a definitive conclusion on the concentration of radical in uv h2o2 and uv pds the overall degradation is owing to both direct and indirect photolysis eq 1 1 d b p d t k o b s b p k d k i b p k i b p where k obs is the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constant min 1 kd is the measured pseudo first order direct photolysis rate constant min 1 and ki is the indirect photolysis rate constant min 1 and is primarily related to reactive species due to negligible direct photolysis figure s2 the k obs equals to the indirect photolysis rate ki in uv h2o2 or uv pds bp was treated by uv with either 500 μm of h2o2 or pds at ph 7 2 the photolysis rate of bp followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s3 in ultrapure water k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 were increased from 0 to 0 214 0 278 and 0 348 min 1 respectively by uv h2o2 the increase of k obs was primarily due to the contribution of ho a competition kinetic method text s2 was used to determine the second order rate constants of bp with ho k ho table 2 which were in a narrow range 6 25 109 to 7 05 109 m 1 s 1 due to low selectivity of ho a higher k ho led to a higher degradation rate of bp fig 1 a furthermore degradation results from bps treatment by uv h2o2 showed that each contaminant followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s3d to be noted the degradation rate in co exposure pattern followed the order bp3 bp8 bp1 which differs from individual pattern bp1 bp3 bp8 this result indicates that some interference may occurred during co exposure the different degradation orders of individual and co exposure patterns may relate to molecular structure byproducts generated and treatment technique indicating that further study was needed compared with uv h2o2 uv pds in ultrapure water led to faster bp degradation but to different extents fig 1b the second order rate constants of bp with so4 k so4 were determined using competition kinetic text s2 which were 1 68 2 60 and 2 77 1010 m 1 s 1 for bp1 bp3 and bp8 respectively table 2 k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were 0 253 0 408 and 0 448 min 1 respectively all these values were higher than those observed when using uv h2o2 the enhanced degradation of bp in uv pds was mainly attributed to the formation rate of so4 from pds φpds 0 7 was higher than that of ho from h2o2 φh2o2 0 5 baxendale and wilson 1957 mark et al 1990 the degradation rates in co exposure pattern using uv pds followed the order bp1 bp3 bp8 which also differs from individual system bp1 bp3 bp8 in co exposure pattern k obs for bp1 bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were 0 094 0 128 and 0 128 min 1 respectively higher than those obtained in uv h2o2 meanwhile the overall k obs of bps for uv pds was 1 61 times higher than that for uv h2o2 therefore uv pds treatment demonstrated higher degradation efficiency for the abatement of target compounds overall results show that uv pds in ultrapure water was more efficient than uv h2o2 for both individual and co exposure patterns however whether this conclusion can be applied in real matrices need further investigation the presence of diverse constituents in actual environments and conversion of reactive species can further complicate these contaminants elimination additionally degradation behavior of target contaminants could be distinct for different feeding patterns representing a topic that has not been previously examined in a systematic manner this research is significant demanded because of the coexistence of constituents and multiple benzophenone derivatives in aquatic environments therefore three typical water matrices including surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater were selected for further studies owing to uv filters occurrence asimakopoulos et al 2014 cuderman and heath 2007 kim and choi 2014 magi et al 2013 manasfi et al 2015 meeker et al 2013 philippat et al 2012 tsui et al 2014 3 3 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in surface water compared to ultrapure water k obs for bp1 bp3 and bp8 using uv h2o2 decreased by 46 24 51 50 and 58 37 respectively in surface water fig 2 a kinetic modeling indicated that ho concentration decreased to 5 05 10 13 m in surface water compared to that in ultrapure water 5 00 10 12 m table 1 the decrease in ho concentration was primarily due to competing reactions with natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate hco3 the second order rate constants of nom with ho and co3 have been reported as 3 9 108 mc 1 s 1 and 2 3 104 mc 1 s 1 respectively brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 canonica et al 2005 high concentration and reactivity toward radicals made nom become the major scavenger in surface water the k obs for bp was inhibited by less than 60 which indicated that bp degradation was not only governed by ho the k obs in surface water should have been approximately 10 of that in ultrapure water if only ho oxidation was considered table 1 this discrepancy suggests that co3 was also responsible for bp degradation the second order rate constants of bp with co3 k co3 were also determined text s2 and it revealed that co3 exhibited lower reactivity than ho table 2 compared with other contaminants whose second order rate constants with co3 were approximately 106 107 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2015 bp was highly reactive toward co3 1 25 107 to 3 28 107 m 1 s 1 because of its electron rich moieties although k co3 was at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of k ho the higher selectivity of co3 also rendered it less susceptible to be scavenged by constituents zhang et al 2016a this lower susceptibility was evident from modeling which showed that the concentration of co3 was almost 30 times higher than that of ho in surface water table 1 and s5 in uv pds treated surface water k obs of bp also experienced a strong suppression especially for bp3 and bp8 fig 2b given electrophilic nature of co3 liu et al 2015 aromatic contaminants with electron donating substituents are also reactive toward co3 similar to ho and so4 two hydroxyl groups oh on bp1 can activate benzene ring which explains why bp1 demonstrates higher reactivity than bp3 and bp8 likewise k obs should approach zero if degradation was only governed by so4 and ho further confirming the participation of co3 in bp degradation when surface water was treated by uv pds a higher degradation rate for bp1 and lower degradation rates for bp3 and bp8 can be observed compare to uv h2o2 based on the simulated so4 and ho concentrations table 1 and measured rate constants table 2 uv pds was expected to have better performance on bp degradation than uv h2o2 however this hypothesis was only true for bp1 fig 2 a lower concentration of co3 table 1 and k co3 played a critical role in the degradation of bp3 and bp8 further study is necessary to determine whether any underestimated rate constant for the reaction with or unknown scavenger of so4 which can resulted in a lower concentration than predicted result when bps were added to surface water and treated using uv h2o2 and uv pds degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics figure s5d and s6d interestingly the overall k obs for bps treated with uv h2o2 0 206 min 1 exceeded that of uv pds 0 178 min 1 fig 2 the order of degradation for bps via uv h2o2 was bp1 bp8 bp3 which was different from that in individual system bp1 bp3 bp8 one possible explanation for this difference was that bp3 may transform into bp8 via i hydrogen abstraction by ho or ii electron transfer from ho and co3 scheme 1 this hypothesis was verified by bp8 appearance when bp3 was treated using uv h2o2 figure s7 the ho byproducts generated could be detected as well for different model compounds using uv h2o2 yao et al 2013 feng et al 2015 castro et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b yin et al 2018 a suppression of bp1 by uv pds in co exposure pattern might suggest the conversion of bp3 to bp1 similarly via cytochrome p450 enzymes nakagawa and suzuki 2002 however it was disregarded because of the absence of bp1 when bp3 was treated using uv pds a possibility existed that intermediates from bp3 or and bp8 were susceptible to co3 attack which leading to the suppression of bp1 3 4 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in hydrolyzed urine recovering nutrients from human urine to produce fertilizers can potentially benefit wastewater management and resource recovery strategies etter et al 2011 however high concentration of micropollutants in urine can accumulate in soil and plants and become hazardous khan and nicell 2010 winker et al 2010 thus the removal of micropollutants from urine becomes necessary for urine based fertilizers the removal of both pharmaceuticals and their metabolites i e sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and n 4 acetylsulfamethoxazole by aops in urine have been reported zhang et al 2015 however few studies have focused on the abatement of pcps in urine particularly for the frequent occurrence of uv filters cuderman and heath 2007 meeker et al 2013 compared with k obs of bp via uv h2o2 in ultrapure water k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 via uv h2o2 in hydrolyzed urine decreased by 59 32 86 77 and 90 53 respectively and followed the order of bp8 bp3 bp1 fig 3a and s8 kinetic modeling indicated that ho concentration decreased from 5 00 10 12 m in ultrapure water to 1 62 10 15 m in hydrolyzed urine table 1 the decrease in ho concentration was primarily due to competing reactions involving ammonia nh3 and hco3 the degradation of bp in hydrolyzed urine cannot be fully attributed to ho table 1 and fig 3 a because k obs should close to zero if the oxidation is governed only by ho these results suggested other reactive species contributed to bp degradation high concentrations of nh3 hco3 and chloride cl in hydrolyzed urine could be considered as sources for their corresponding radicals table 1 amino radical nh2 would be initially generated from the reaction of nh3 and ho no 102 tables s3 then after a series of reactions with oxygen and h2o2 nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 nitric oxide radicals no onooh onoo and a few other reactive intermediates would be produced although rate constants between reactive nitrogen species rns and bp have not been previously determined the reactions are expected because rns are known to react with electron rich aromatic moieties neta et al 1978 nh2 reacts with phenol and compounds with primary amine functional groups i e p aminophenol and p phenylenediamine neta et al 1978 amino acids and melanins clarke et al 2008 given aromatic moieties oh as electron donating group of bp they are likely to react with onooh which could induce the nitration of naphthalene and benzene vione et al 2005 the simulation results suggest that no likely degrades bp to some extent because of its high concentration 2 32 10 5 m table 1 although nh2 concentration 3 37 10 13 m table 1 was low identified byproducts suggests that nh2 could react with bp for instance bp3 even m z numbers i e 228 258 280 288 and 296 figure s9 indicate that generated transformation products tps contained an odd number of nitrogen atoms the exact mass information of tps were illustrated by using ltq orbitrap velos pro mass deviations of all proposed formulas were in the range of 10 ppm of mass accuracy tables s4 specifically tp 228 m z 228 c14h14no2 implies that the oh was replaced by nh2 which further oxidized to a nitro group tp 258 m z 258 c14h12no4 the concentration of co3 in hydrolyzed urine 2 41 10 13 m table 1 decreased notably compared with that in surface water 1 44 10 11 m table 1 this decrease is primarily due to i both hco3 and nh3 competing to react with ho and ii the combination reaction between co3 and nh2 in addition co3 concentration was inadequate to retain the significant degradation for bp furthermore when cl was not considered during simulations for hydrolyzed urine ho and co3 concentrations would be the same although the reaction rate of ho with cl is high no 52 table s3 a fast backward reaction no 53 table s3 also simultaneously occurs leading to a stable ho concentration hence all the other rns radicals generated from ho would demonstrate negligible change due to cl table s5 meanwhile when hydrolyzed urine without cl was selected as a matrix k obs of bp was nearly identical to that in hydroxyl urine figure s10a these results suggest that reactive chlorine species rcs did not contribute to bp degradation because of its low concentrations table 1 compared with k obs of bp by uv pds in ultrapure water k obs of bp1 bp3 and bp8 by uv pds in hydrolyzed urine decreased by 66 81 90 37 and 88 54 respectively and followed the order of bp3 bp8 bp1 fig 3b and s11 k obs of bp1 and bp3 in hydrolyzed urine by uv pds were comparable to those in uv h2o2 fig 3 the quenching effect of nh3 on so4 no 103 table s3 was lower than that on ho no 102 table s3 due to the lower reaction rate thus a significant concentration of so4 together with rns should have resulted in a greater removal rate for bp8 in uv pds this rate was 1 56 times higher than that for uv h2o2 notably no2 and onooh onoo concentrations were much lower in uv pds than those in uv h2o2 because h2o2 was essential in their generation process in uv pds hydrolyzed urine without cl also negligibly affected k obs for bp figure s10b according to kinetic model the decreased so4 concentration was mainly attributed to scavenging effect of cl no 54 table s3 unlike cloh generation of so4 from the reaction of chlorine atom cl and sulfate ion was slow due to low sulfate concentration and low reaction rate constant no 55 table s3 huie et al 1991 instead the reaction of cl with h2o and ho produced cloh which theoretically led to a higher ho concentration whereas the presence of hco3 converted ho to co3 3 09 10 12 m for uv pds and 2 41 10 13 m for uv h2o2 in table 1 however simulated radical concentrations could not fully account for the observed degradation rates in the experiments this finding may be due to the overestimated scavenging effect of pds on co3 yang et al 2014 in co exposure pattern degradation of individual contaminant obeyed pseudo first order kinetics figure s8d and s11d notably bp3 degradation was strongly suppressed only 6 06 and 5 69 of the overall degradation in uv h2o2 and uv pds respectively fig 3 this suppression is primarily attributed to molecular structure and rns selectivity in details och3 group on bp3 inhibit rns attraction due to steric hindrance and electron drawing induction compare to bp1 meanwhile bp8 was more reactive than bp3 due to its electron donating oh on a different benzene ring b smith and march 2007 the generated rns were more prone to react with electron rich sites neta et al 1978 simultaneously byproducts formed from bp1 and or bp8 via both aops during individual pattern could easily be attacked by rns owing to the lack of such discrepancy for bp3 and bp8 in particular high selectivity of rns played a critical role in the rapid degradation of bp1 in hydrolyzed urine a similar tendency for co exposure pattern via uv h2o2 and uv pds was observed this result implies that rns except for co3 exerted significant influence on the degradation behavior of bps in hydrolyzed urine 3 5 uv h2o2 and uv pds aops in seawater various pcps including uv filters are introduced by swimmers into seawater the concentrations of pcps in seawater ranged the level from ng l 1 to μg l 1 díaz cruz et al 2008 ekowati et al 2016 giokas et al 2007 sun et al 2014 weng et al 2014 the increase in popularity of by recreational activities in seawater including swimming snorkeling and scuba diving brings the ubiquity of uv filters by extensive of visitors danovaro et al 2008 lamb et al 2014 high reactivity of uv filters i e bp3 with chlorine in bromide rich seawater leads to the formation of chlorinated brominated disinfection byproducts abdallah et al 2015 to date potential degradation of uv filters by uv based aops in seawater has not been thoroughly investigated compared with k obs for bp degradation in ultrapure water those for bp1 bp3 and bp8 degradation in seawater were reduced by 18 08 86 20 and 90 96 for individual system via uv h2o2 respectively fig 4a and s12 kinetic modeling indicated that ho concentration decreased from 5 00 10 12 m in ultrapure water to 1 04 10 14 m in seawater table 1 the decrease of ho concentration was primarily due to competing anions including cl hco3 and bromide br the modeling ho concentrations in seawater without cl hco3 and br was 6 55 10 14 1 06 10 14 and 1 77 10 12 m respectively table s6 results indicated that br was the sink for ho highlighting the important role of br despite its low concentration relative to that of cl hence conversion of ho to less reactive halogen species rhs and co3 was responsible for k obs decrease the degradation rate followed the order bp8 bp3 bp1 fig 4 a likewise k obs should close to zero if the oxidation by only ho was considered high concentration of cl in seawater guaranteed an abundance of its corresponding radical table 1 the generated rhs including cl and cl2 favored co3 generation compared with bp3 or bp8 high selectivity of rhs for bp1 may responsible for its eminent degradation because k co3 was still of the same order of magnitude table 2 compared with k obs for bp in ultrapure water those for bp1 bp3 and bp8 in seawater were reduced by 17 76 54 44 and 58 73 for individual systems via uv pds respectively fig 4b and s13 similarly conversion of ho and so4 to rhs and co3 was responsible for k obs decrease in uv pds k obs of bp were higher than those in uv h2o2 especially for bp3 and bp8 fig 4b likewise k obs for all bp should close to zero if the oxidation only dominated by so4 and ho co3 should not be responsible for the significant degradation improvement for bp3 and bp8 fig 4 because its concentration was decreased by 15 times 1 22 10 10 m for uv h2o2 and 7 87 10 12 m for uv pds table 1 furthermore comparison of rhs concentrations between uv h2o2 and uv pds were performed the concentrations of halogen radicals including cl cl2 br br2 and brcl in uv pds were 2 10 times higher than those in uv h2o2 the concentration of clo was 9 orders of magnitude higher in uv pds than uv h2o2 table 1 unlike uv h2o2 the concentration of so4 for uv pds without cl hco3 and br barely reached those levels in ultrapure water table s6 surprisingly when cl and br were absent so4 concentration was nearly identical to that observed in ultrapure water this similarity demonstrates that coexistence of cl and br was the sink for so4 nevertheless ho concentration from modeling calculation was 4 6 times lower than that in ultrapure water due to the presence of hco3 the enhanced degradation in uv pds compared to uv h2o2 may stem from higher rhs concentrations until now identification of the halogen radical s accounting for improvement of bp degradation was still unclear with respect to co exposure pattern in seawater uv h2o2 for bps followed pseudo first order kinetics and exhibited similar degradation tendency as individual system figure s12d and 4a similarly degradation of bp1 via uv pds was consistent with pseudo first order kinetics figure s14a however degradation of bp3 and bp8 via uv pds displayed biphasic kinetics figure s14b c specifically their degradation was initially slow a lag phase followed by a rapid secondary decay phase these results imply that the capability of rhs contributing to degradation of investigated compounds was different moreover non first order degradation of co exposure micropollutants by uv pds has not been previously reported currently elucidation of non first order degradation behavior is difficult as we observed the contribution of rhs for bp3 and bp8 rarely occurred until bp1 had decreased by certain level 89 30 for bp3 and 73 84 for bp8 this phenomenon was due to a higher selectivity of rhs for bp1 than bp3 and bp8 furthermore occurrence of an accelerating stage ca 25 min for bp3 and 15 min for bp8 may due to the differences in molecular structure besides m methoxyphenol a higher electron donor character of phenol phenolate functional group favors the electrophilic attack of chlorine or bromine deborde and von gunten 2008 this finding might provide the insight knowledge to unravel non first order behavior in co exposure pattern rhs investigation based on radical reactions in seawater are much more complicated than those in ultrapure water future work should utilize this type of investigation to elucidate such degradation behavior in summary degradation behaviors of target contaminants depend on i their molecular structure ii operable uv based aops iii matrix constituents and iv feeding patterns individual or co exposure molecular properties such as geometric configuration and charge distribution would be the intrinsic factor for degradation behaviors ho and so4 are the reactive species source during uv h2o2 and uv pds processes respectively constituents i e hco3 nh3 cl and br and their concentrations in water matrix affect conversion of reactive species which complicates the elimination of contaminants notably the reaction between reactive species i e rns and rhs and parent compounds can generate various byproducts and elucidating their mechanisms requires further study in particular because benzophenone derivatives frequently co exist in aqueous environments examination on co exposure pattern is more practical and can benefit the overall understanding of their abatement furthermore mechanism of interference from generated byproducts and non first order behavior also warrants further investigation compared with those in ultrapure water degradation efficiency on bp for uv h2o2 and uv pds in real matrices was decreased by various extents 17 76 90 96 accordingly economic analysis regarding bp degradation is necessary to facilitate the selection of a cost efficient treatment 3 6 economic analysis using ee o to compare aops for bp degradation in different water matrices surface water hydrolyzed urine and seawater an economic analysis using electrical efficiency per log order ee o concept was further conducted details about calculation of ee o were described in the text s3 in this study ee ototal was calculated based on 90 of target compounds removal as shown in table 3 uv h2o2 was more cost effective treatment than uv pds when bp degradation happened in ultrapure water surface water and hydrolyzed urine except for bp8 this was primarily because pds was more expensive than h2o2 nevertheless uv pds process costs less energy than uv h2o2 process in seawater except for bp1 which ascribe to the higher concentration of rhs as we discussed in section 3 5 regardless of uv h2o2 and uv pds it was generally less effective in synthetic matrices than in ultrapure water for example at the molar fraction of oxidant bp3 100 the ee ototal for the uv h2o2 in ultrapure water is 0 63 10 3 kwh l 1 which is 1 87 6 38 and 6 13 times lower that in surface water 1 18 10 3 kwh l 1 hydrolyzed urine 4 02 10 3 kwh l 1 and seawater 3 86 10 3 kwh l 1 respectively similarly the ee ototal for bp3 elimination via uv pds in ultrapure water is 1 62 10 3 kwh l 1 which is 2 72 3 04 and 1 26 times lower that in surface water 4 41 10 3 kwh l 1 hydrolyzed urine 4 92 10 3 kwh l 1 and seawater 2 04 10 3 kwh l 1 respectively these results further demonstrate that constituents of water matrices can greatly affect the efficiency of aops for contaminants removal 4 conclusions the individual and co exposure patterns of benzophenone derivatives degradation using uv h2o2 and uv pds were investigated under various water matrices the following conclusions were obtained 1 benzophenone derivatives could be degraded by ho so4 and co3 and the second order rate constants were determined table 2 2 in surface water attack of bp3 by ho and co3 in uv h2o2 can generate bp8 which was responsible for the relatively high degradation rate of bp3 intermediates generated from bp3 and bp8 in uv pds were susceptible to co3 which resulting in the reduction for bp1 degradation 3 in hydrolyzed urine cl was shown the negligible for benzophenone derivatives degradation due to low concentration of rcs bp3 abatement was excessively inhibited during co exposure pattern for both aops 4 in seawater non first order kinetic behavior for bp3 and bp8 was found during co exposure pattern br was the sink of ho and the co existence of br and cl was the sink of so4 5 in terms of energy efficiency uv h2o2 process is usually more economically competitive than uv pds process we holistically evaluated the performance of two typical aops uv h2o2 and uv pds which depended on i molecular structure of contaminants ii components of water matrices and iii reactive radical species kinetic simulations conducted in this study provided a trend comparison of radical concentrations under different conditions results illustrated the variation of main reactive species and unraveled the differences in aops meanwhile due to the coexistence and interference of benzophenone derivatives their degradation becomes more complicated hence a comprehensive evaluation of aops performance for micropollutants destroying in natural matrices is urgently needed our findings will trigger further investigation regarding other types of micropollutants in mixed systems using uv based aops acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science
