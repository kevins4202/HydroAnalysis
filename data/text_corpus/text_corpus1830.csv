9150,soil evaporative efficiency see was estimated as the relative difference of soil temperature ts to its maximum ts max and minimum ts min values at minimum and maximum soil moisture sm i e see ts max ts ts max ts min this thermal indicator of sm smi has been proven effective in downscaling satellite microwave sm in some local areas however the ts max and ts min were usually determined in an empirical way which is not conducive to a wider range of applications or global downscaling in addition to the ts based smi see solo lst land surface temperature based smi and composite index of lst and optical smis have also been widely used in downscaling microwave sm however they have rarely been evaluated with spatially distributed sm at a similar spatial resolution leading to a vague understanding of their pros and cons in the downscaling in this study we first implemented a pixel wise and theoretically calculating of see with lst fvc space and meteorological reanalysis data then a critical evaluation with satellite aircraft and in situ sm observations was made via the smpavex15 and smapvex16 aircraft based field experiments results indicated that the thermal smis presented a better performance than the optical smis for depicting the variations of sm among the thermal smis ts based see showed better performance than the solo lst based index and the composite index temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi the results demonstrate the validity and necessity of obtaining the ts based see for downscaling satellite microwave sm with thermal optical data the provided pixel wise method was validated in this study for calculating the ts based see which is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave sm with microwave and thermal optical fusion however the disadvantages of cloud contamination the decoupling effect and uncertainties brought by complex meteorological conditions and reanalysis data urgently need more research efforts keywords thermal remote sensing soil moisture microwave downscaling 1 introduction soil moisture is of great significance in the land surface water cycle and surface energy cycle via influencing the conversion of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes determining the distribution of rainfall between infiltration and runoff and even affecting the coupled feedback mechanism between the surface and atmosphere system seneviratne et al 2010 therefore sm usually appears in various fields as a key variable peng et al 2021 such as agricultural water management numerical weather prediction flood and drought monitoring terrestrial carbon balance evapotranspiration et estimation watershed based runoff modelling etc aghakouchak et al 2015 brown et al 2008 dorigo et al 2017 kędzior and zawadzki 2017 it is thus listed as one of the essential climate variables ecv by the global climate observing system gcos there are many ground based observation methods to measure or obtain soil moisture however the spatial distribution of soil moisture is not so homogeneous that the ground based observations can depict it due to the various influencing factors such as topography climate soil type and vegetation coverage with the rapid development of remote sensing science and technology amounts of soil moisture estimation algorithms and products have emerged although most of them are for surface soil moisture sm with the depth of about 0 5 cm these remote sensing retrieval algorithms have covered the entire spectrum from visible band infrared band and thermal band to microwave band wang and qu 2009 currently the passive microwave way especially the l band is considered to have the maximum promising capacity for globally monitoring sm variations because the optical thermal cannot penetrate clouds and doesn t have a straight physical linkage with sm while the active microwave e g synthetic aperture radar sar has great difficulty in stripping the effects of vegetation structure and surface roughness on backscattering coefficients peng et al 2021 wang and qu 2009 wu et al 2014 soil moisture ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap are two landmark satellites that operate with the l band microwave for globally monitoring sm their sm products have proven to own satisfactory performance in various studies colliander et al 2017a 2017b kędzior and zawadzki 2016 2017 liu et al 2019 yet the passive microwave remotely sensed sm is generally restricted to relatively low spatial resolution approximately 25 50 km sun et al 2019a for many watershed scale or farmland scale applications such a coarse spatial resolution is difficult to meet practical needs as demonstrated in peng et al 2021 the requirements levels of landslide prediction flood forecasting drought monitoring precision agriculture etc are indicated as high for high spatial resolution sm less than 1 km thermal and optical remote sensing have higher spatial resolution and richer data sources thus providing crucial higher resolution indicators of sm hereafter smi for refining the spatial resolution of passive microwave sm peng et al 2017 petropoulos et al 2020b sun and cui 2021 sun et al 2019b downscaling microwave sm with microwave and thermal optical fusion or called optical based downscaling has become a significant way to generate remote sensing sm with higher spatiotemporal resolution peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 a comprehensive comparison of existing radar optical radiometer and oversampling based downscaling techniques indicated that the optical based products had the highest performance of temporal consistency with in situ and airborne sm sabaghy et al 2020 therefore the above mentioned microwave and thermal optical fusion still has great application potential generally there are three main methods of downscaling microwave sm with thermal optical remote sensing i e machine learning physical model and semi empirical method the machine learning method originates from the theory of remote sensing land surface temperature and fractional vegetation coverage lst fvc feature space carlson et al 1994 which can be expressed as a two dimensional scattergram composed of lst and fvc or spectral vegetation index petropoulos et al 2020a sun 2016 the upper boundary of the lst fvc space represents the theoretical minimum sm dry edge and the lower boundary represents the theoretical maximum sm wet edge from the dry edge to the wet edge it is composed of a set of gradient sm contour lines and each sm contour line is a linear regression function of lst and fvc or spectral vegetation index svi consequently a statistical regression relationship was generally established between sm and the two surface parameters i e lst and svi the basic idea of this method is to use the microwave sm at coarse resolution to establish a statistical regression relationship then apply the relationship to the surface parameters at high spatial resolution according to the nature of continuous model in remote sensing strahler et al 1986 the most common statistical regression relationship is multiple linear regression carlson 2007 for further research varied machine learning methods were introduced such as artificial neural networks support vector machine regression random forest and other machine learning algorithms liu et al 2018 srivastava et al 2013 sun and cui 2021 on the other hand various surface parameters were added which can be classified into three categories 1 thermal remote sensing smis such as solo lst based smi i e daytime lst long et al 2019 and composite smi such as the temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi amani et al 2017 xu et al 2022 2 optical remote sensing smis such as normalized difference water index ndwi sánchez ruiz et al 2014 perpendicular drought index pdi modified pdi mpdi and second mpdi mpdi1 etc 3 ancillary indicators such as surface albedo chauhan et al 2003 surface net incoming radiation rn sun et al 2019b geographical factors such as longitude latitude and elevation sun and cui 2021 soil texture precipitation abowarda et al 2021 etc as to the physical model approach the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change model dispatch is a typical representative which was constructed by merlin et al merlin et al 2010 2008a the basic idea of this model is to exert the physical function relationship between soil evaporation efficiency see and sm such physical function relationship was expanded by the taylor series at the coarser resolution microwave sm to calculate the sm at a higher spatial resolution regarding the functional relationship between see and sm merlin et al investigated a variety of linear and nonlinear functions including exponential cosine and power functions merlin et al 2010 2013 it turned out that the cosine form was more accurate but the exponential and power function forms were more robust merlin et al 2010 for calculating the see merlin et al utilized the lst fvc trapezoidal space to decompose the lst for obtaining soil surface temperature ts and the ts corresponding to the minimum and maximum sm ts max and ts min the see was then determined as ts max ts ts max ts min according to the expression of the see it is similar to the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi and vegetation temperature condition index vtci which are both derived from the lst fvc triangular or trapezoidal space sandholt et al 2002 sun et al 2019b wang et al 2001 as regards the semi empirical method the dscale mod16 model is a representative which was presented by sun et al 2020 without the usage of lst and lst derived smis to circumvent the issues of cloud contamination decomposing uncertainty and decoupling eﬀect on lst or lst derived smis this model utilized modis terrestrial et data to calculate an alternative downscaling factor land surface evaporative eﬃciency lee defined as lee et pet where pet is potential et sun et al 2020 a cosine square form was used to express the quantitative relationship between lee and sm the evaluation results indicate that the downscaled sm by the dscale mod16 model maintains the accuracy of the original microwave sm while offering more spatial details additionally the ucla method assumed an equal ratio relationship between sm and its remote sensing smis kim and hogue 2012 in the ucla method a soil wetness index swi developed by jiang and islam jiang and islam 2003 was used some scholars compared the swi with the tvdi and vtci in downscaling microwave sm with the ucla method and found that tvdi and vtci were superior to the swi index ling et al 2014 peng et al 2016 in summary microwave and thermal optical fusion is an important way to produce remote sensing sm with fine spatiotemporal resolution and reliable data quality the higher resolution smis derived from thermal remote sensing i e thermal smis are significant indicators in the fusion the existing thermal smis can be roughly divided into three categories 1 solo lst based indices such as daytime lst day night lst difference etc 2 ts based indices such as the above mentioned see tvdi and vtci 3 composite indices of lst and optical sm indices such as the tvmdi however two significant limitations need to be considered in the thermal smis first the ts based indicator see or vtci tvdi has been successfully utilized in downscaling microwave sm for some specific areas however the ts max and ts min in the calculation of see were usually determined empirically merlin et al 2008b petropoulos et al 2020a specifically the ts min was set to the minimum surface temperature observed within the study area and the ts max was set to the maximum value of the ts in the study area merlin et al 2010 2008b such an empirical method limits the see driven downscaling to some specific study areas where exist the actual pixels at the status of the bare soil surface minimum sm and maximum sm however such pixels do not exist for most areas in the satellite remote sensing views even if a specific study area contains such pixels all pixels in the study area image use the same ts max and ts min abbreviated as region wise calculating see which is questionable for a large area or heterogeneous area in other words the empirical region wise method of calculating see needs to be improved for globally downscaling microwave satellite sm second the above three types of thermal smis have been rarely evaluated with spatially distributed sm at the same spatial resolution leading to a vague understanding of their relative advantages in the microwave and thermal optical fusion and further limiting the development of such downscaling techniques therefore this study first aims to implement a pixel wise calculation of see by integrating thermal optical remote sensing with meteorological reanalysis data secondly we would make a critical evaluation of the typical thermal smis with some well known aircraft sm observations the advantages disadvantages and improvement directions of the pixel wise calculating see would be further clarified for improving the microwave and thermal optical fusion 2 data sources the specific data sources used in the study are shown in table 1 including aircraft experiment observations from smapvex15 and smapvex16 remote sensing data from smap and modis satellites and meteorological reanalysis data from gmao merra 2 they are briefly introduced in the following sections 2 1 aircraft and in situ sm observations the aircraft sm has continuous spatial distribution and similar spatial resolution to the thermal optical remote sensing smis thus it has a greater advantage for evaluating the spatial distribution and changing trends of thermal optical smis in this study aircraft observations from the smapvex campaign were used the data was produced by nasa smap to conduct the smap verification experiment mission to assist in the verification calibration and accuracy improvement of smap sm products the gridded sm retrieved from the passive active l band system pals is the aircraft sm used here the aircraft sm corresponds to the surface sm at around 0 5 cm it has been rigorously verified in the experiments their performances have been reported as rmse 0 016 m3 m3 the unbiased ubrmse 0 016 m3 m3 bias 0 005 m3 m3 pearson s r 0 83 colliander et al 2017 and its uncertainty for sm inversion is within a reasonable range to evaluate the experimental results more comprehensively we also gathered the in situ sm measurement data labelled as sv15psm within the smapvex experimental the spatial distribution of these aircraft and in situ sm is shown in fig 1 the smapvex15 campaign experiment period was about two weeks from 2 august to 18 august 2015 this campaign is located in an area of south eastern arizona usa most land cover types are open shrubs and grasslands the smapvex16 ia campaign experiment period was more than two months from 28 may to 18 august 2016 this campaign is located in an area of iowa usa the land cover types are dominated by crops these aircraft sm data were obtained from the national snow and ice data centre https nsidc org data 2 2 smap sm products the smap satellite aims to capture the time dependent changes in sm on a global level by observing sm every 2 3 days the sm products from smap were utilized in this study to evaluate the thermal and optical smis as downscaling factors the sm products data label is smap l3 sm p e and the version number is r16510 those sm products have a daily temporal and 9 km spatial resolution they were retrieved from the ground brightness temperature information first obtained by the smap microwave radiometer and then interpolated to 9 km by the backus gilbert optimization interpolation method 2 3 modis data the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis onboard the aqua and terra satellites can provide data in 36 bands covering the spectral range of 0 4 14 4 µm in the study six kinds of modis products data are mainly used including black white sky albedo data mcd43a3 surface reflectance data mod09ga and myd09ga land surface temperature data mod11a1 and myd11a1 surface cover type data mcd12q1 leaf area index lai data mcd15a2h and surface evapotranspiration data mod16a2 the lai was used to calculate the fvc by the following equation 1 f v c 1 e lai 2 cos ϑ where ϑ is the solar zenith angle f v c is the quantitative measure of fractional vegetation coverage the mcd12q1 were utilized to determine the vegetation albedo α v by a look up table of mean modis vegetation albedos for varied international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classes as listed in houldcroft et al 2009 subsequently the soil albedo α s was derived from the land surface albedo α and its vegetation component α v by the following equation 2 α f v c α v 1 f v c α s where land surface albedo α was obtained from the mcd43a3 product 2 4 gmao merra 2 meteorological data gmao merra 2 is a long term meteorological reanalysis dataset covering the whole world with hourly temporal resolution and 0 5 0 625 spatial resolution it has been widely used in the remote sensing community the surface air temperature surface net downward shortwave radiation data and surface wind speed from this dataset were used in order to match the merra 2 data with modis observations we rounded up the modis observation time to the nearest hour for example table 2 shows the time selection in the experiment of smapvex15 3 methods 3 1 pixel wise calculating see see is a ts based smi which can be basically defined as the following formula according to the previous research merlin et al 2010 3 see t s max t s t s max t s min where t s is soil surface temperature t s min and t s max are the t s at the status of minimum available sm and maximum available sm respectively the see has a data range of 0 1 where 0 implies an extremely dry surface and 1 implies an extremely wet surface generally the see derives from the classical lst fvc feature space model as we know the lst fvc space can be interpreted in two ways conventional trapezoid space and two stage trapezoid space sun 2016 correspondingly two sees can be derived from the different lst fvc spaces here the sees depend on the two stage trapezoid space and the conventional trapezoid space are labelled as see1 and see2 respectively fig 2 a and b show the schematic diagrams of the different lst fvc spaces in a physical sense the wet edge represents the wet land surface with enough moisture for evaporation the dry edge represents the dry land surface without available moisture for evaporation the middle dry edge represents the dry soil surface without available moisture for soil evaporation sun and zhao 2022 as shown in fig 2 a point p represents a pixel located within the lower triangle space of the two stage trapezoid whose coordinate is lst fvc m and n are the pixels at the middle dry edge and the wet edge with the same fvc as point p then the see1 of point p can be determined using the following expression 4 see1 t s max t s t s max t s min t s t s max lst m lst lst m lst n t s max t s min lst m t v min t s max f v c t s max lst n t v min t s min f v c t s min where lstn is the lst of point n on the wet edge lstm is the lst of point m on the middle dry edge t s max t s min t v max and t v min represent the four temperature endmembers as shown in fig 2 a for the conventional trapezoid space in fig 2 b point p also represents a random pixel located in the space with the coordinate of lst fvc o and n address the pixels at the wet edge and dry edge with the same fvc fractional vegetation coverage as point p then the see2 of point p can be expressed as 5 see2 t s max t s t s max t s min t s t s max lst o lst lst o lst n t s max t s min lst o t v max t s max f v c t s max lst n t v min t s min f v c t s min where lsto is the land surface temperature of point o on the dry edge and the other parameters are the same as that in see1 both the see1 and see2 have a data range from 0 to 1 where the greater the indices the wetter the conditions indicated the four temperature endmembers t s max t s min t v max and t v min are calculated using the sun2021 algorithm sun and zhao 2022 6 t s max 1 α s s d ε s ε a σ t a 4 ε s σ t a 4 4 ε s σ t a 3 ρ c p r a s 1

represent soil albedo and vegetation albedo respectively ε v ε s and ε a represent vegetation soil and air emissivity respectively calculated by the same method in sun et al 2019b σ represents the stefan boltzmann constant equalling to 5 76 10 8 w m2 k4 c p represents air specific heat capacity equalling to 1006 j kg k t a represents air temperature obtained from meteorological reanalysis data ρ represents air density approximately equalling to 1 225 kg m3 r a s and r a v represent soil and vegetable surface air dynamic resistance in s m sun et al 2019b n s and n v represent the fractional coefficients between the soil heat ﬂux and the net radiative flux in the soil and vegetation whose default values are 0 35 and 0 respectively δ represents the slope of the saturated vapour pressure temperature relation γ represents the thermometer constant more details of the sun2021 algorithm can be seen in sun and zhao 2022 sun et al 2019b 3 2 the other thermal and optical smis the other four typical thermal and optical smis were implemented and evaluated in this study the first one is the solo lst based smi i e normalized lst nlst using minimum maximum normalization the next is a composite index tvmdi based on lst and optical smi additionally land surface evapotranspiration efficiency lee calculated by the modis et product was also successfully utilized in downscaling microwave soil moisture sun and cui 2021 sun et al 2020 therefore the lee was also utilized in this evaluation as to the optical smi the visible and shortwave infrared drought index vsdi was selected in the evaluation since its good performance as compared with the other optical smis sun and cui 2021 3 2 1 solo lst based smi nlst is only calculated based on the lst by min max normalizing the daytime lst which can be expressed as 7 nlst lst max lst lst max lst min where lstmin and lstmax are the lowest and the highest lst in the study area nlst has a data range of 0 1 where the greater the nlst the wetter the conditions indicated 3 2 2 composite smi as shown in fig 3 tvmdi is a three dimensional space defined dryness index based on lst perpendicular vegetation index pvi and pdi the w point represents the wet point where the dryness is 0 which is considered to symbolize the lowest lst the highest vegetation coverage and the wettest soil with the growth of the lst the vegetation coverage and soil moisture lower the soil progressively dries and ultimately attains the dry point d in which the dryness is 1 the calculation of tvmdi is mainly based on the lst data the spectral reflectance at the red band and the near infrared band to facilitate the comparisons with the above mentioned indices we calculated the tvmdi using the following equation 8 tvmdi 1 lst 2 pdi 2 3 3 pvi 2 where lst represents a thermal index of sm pdi represents an optical index of sm perpendicular drought index and pvi is an index of vegetation richness the larger the tvmdi the wetter the conditions indicated note that the values of lst pdi and pvi are normalized to be between zero and 3 3 and the normalization method is as follows 9 normallized i i min i max i min i 3 3 where i represents one of the three factors pvi lst and pdi max i and min i mean taking the maximum and minimum values within the study area the pdi and pvi can be calculated by the following expressions amani et al 2017 10 pdi ρ nir 0 86 ρ red 0 082 1 0 86 2 11 pvi ρ nir 1 163 ρ red 0 017 1 1 163 2 where ρ n i r and ρ red are the spectral reflectance at near infrared and red bands respectively 3 2 3 lee in view of the strong coupling relationship between sm and et lee can be used as a downscaling factor of microwave sm sun et al 2020 here the lee calculated from the modis mod16 products was used 12 lee et pet where et and pet represent the actual and potential surface et respectively the larger the lee the wetter the conditions indicated 3 2 4 vsdi vsdi is a typical optical remote sensing index of sm created by utilizing the difference between three bands the blue spectrum red spectrum and swir spectrum according to the characteristic that the red and swir channels are more sensitive to moisture changes in vegetation and soil the blue channel is not sensitive to the changes of moisture in them so the red and swir channels can be used as humidity measurement channels and the blue channel can be used as a reference standard for humidity changes zhang et al 2013 the vsdi was defined as 13 vsdi 1 ρ swir2 ρ blue ρ red ρ blue where ρ red ρ swir2 and ρ blue correspond to the spectral reflectance at the red swir and blue bands respectively the vsdi was restricted to the range between 0 and 1 by setting the values greater than 1 1 the larger the vsdi the wetter the conditions indicated 3 3 evaluation methods the evaluation is carried out in three parts first the calculated smi was compared with the aircraft sm from the smapvex15 and smapvex16 ia second they were assessed with in situ measurement sm during the same period of aircraft campaigns in the third part the various smis were evaluated by using them to downscale the smap sm from 9 km to 500 m which was briefly called the evaluation with satellite sm in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r between the smis and in situ sm or aircraft sm was utilized as an evaluation index since the remote sensing index of sm describes the relative condition of sm rather than the absolute value the greater value of r shows a better performance of the smi as compared with the measured sm in addition a linear regression test is used to test the performance of varied smis it can be expressed as follows 14 θ a smi b where θ is in situ sm or aircraft sm a and b represent linear fitting slope and intercept the performance of smi in the linear regression can be measured by multiple indexes such as the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae normalized rmse nrmse and f test f statistically speaking the higher values of the r2 and f and the smaller values of mae and rmse nrmse indicate the better performance of smi the specific calculation expressions of these indicators can be further found in sun and cui 2021 to compare with the aircraft or in situ sm we also evaluate the smi as a factor in downscaling the smap sm data the machine learning method is utilized to conduct the downscaling process which can be simply expressed as 15 sm f smi a 1 a 2 a 3 where f represents a machine learning algorithm here the classical random forest rf algorithm is employed smi a 1 a 2 and a 3 represent various downscaling factors including fvc black sky albedo and white sky albedo the original 9 km smap sm products were the data to be downscaled they were employed as the dependent variable in the above expression to train the rf algorithm with the downscaling factors averagely aggregated to the spatial resolution of 9 km the trained rf algorithm was then employed to generate higher resolution sm with higher resolution downscaling factors to evaluate the performance of different smis in the downscaling only one thermal optical smi was employed in each experiment while the other downscaling factors remained constant note that the original spatial resolution of lst and solo lst based ts based composite smis is 1 km while that of fvc and black white sky albedos is 500 m the aircraft sm data from smapvex15 and smapvex16 ia also have a spatial resolution of 500 m consequently the above 1 km data were resampled to 500 m serving as the 500 m higher resolution downscaling factors via the nearest neighbour resampling method during the comparison between the downscaled sm and the referenced sm the r ubrmse rmse and bias were used as quantitative evaluation indicators whose calculation expression can be further found in sun and cui 2021 4 results 4 1 evaluation with aircraft sm figs 4 and 5 show the overall spatial distribution of various smis and aircraft sm during the smapvex15 experiment on august 16 2015 and the smapvex16 ia experiment on june 5 2016 respectively in order to uniformly display the spatial changes of different smis we have adjusted the colour tables of all sub figures the sub figure a is the aircraft sm where the soil moisture varied from 0 03 to 0 30 m3 m3 the sub figure b is the spatial distribution of the lee index the sub figure c to sub figure f are see1 terra see1 aqua see2 terra and see2 aqua respectively the sub figure g and sub figure h show tvmdi calculated using the terra and aqua satellites respectively the sub figure i and sub figure j are nlst terra and nlst aqua while the sub figure k and figure l are vsdi terra and vsdi aqua the distributions of the aircraft sm and various smis show that the overall performance of the see1 and see2 is the best as compared to the aircraft sm the spatial distribution of the nlst also looks similar to that of aircraft sm the spatial distribution of the tvmdi is a little fuzzy and not as clear as the former three the spatial distributions of vsdi and lee differ greatly from that of the aircraft sm in other words they have the lowest similarity with the aircraft sm to comprehensively evaluate the smis we made a statistic of all r values between aircraft sm and various smis with a violin plot fig 6 a is the result during the smapvex15 experiment fig 6 b is the result during the smapvex16 ia experiment and fig 6 c is the result of all experiments on the whole see1 and see2 perform the best because the area with the largest kernel density value has the largest value and the mean values are also higher than other indices vsdi and lee have the worst performance while the performance of nlst and tvmdi varies between them finally we performed linear regression tests on various smis table 3 lists the average values of r2 rmse nrmse mae and f and are sorted by r2 value the ranking results are consistent with the above statistics with the violin plot the r2 and f values of see1 see2 are the largest while the rmse nrmse and mae are the lowest the second are the nlst and the tvmdi ranks the third with the lowest r2 and f value and the largest rmse and mae vsdi gets the worst performance to sum up the above evaluation shows that compared with the aircraft sm the see1 see2 derived by the lst fvc space has the best overall performance in statistics and the second best is the nlst and tvmdi among them vsdi and lee indicators have the lowest consistency with aircraft sm 4 2 evaluation with in situ sm fig 7 illustrates the scatterplot of the in situ sm with different smis during the smapvex15 experiment on august 16 2015 except for the abnormal performance of the vsdi aqua the other smis are positively correlated with the in situ sm similar to the evaluation results with aircraft sm the best performance is found for see1 and see2 calculated using lst fvc feature space with the r value greater than 0 6 and the r2 greater than 0 4 in contrast the r values of the other smis are all less than 0 6 and the r2 values are all less than 0 4 additionally we evaluated the correlation between smis and in situ sm from a temporal variation it is at each site to calculate the r between the smis and in situ sm over the whole time series and then plot a violin statistical plot over all sites as shown in fig 8 statistical data shows that the median and mean r values of see1 see2 are higher than that of other smis in other words the see1 see2 still got the best performance when compared with the in situ sm to sum up the quantitative evaluation result with the in situ sm is the same as that with the aircraft sm 4 3 evaluation with satellite sm fig 9 shows the spatial distributions of aircraft sm original smap sm and varied downscaled sm with the smis during the smapvex15 experiment as shown in the figure more detailed changes in the spatial distribution of sm can be provided through the downscaling method compared with the original 9 km smap sm the downscaled sm are more similar to the spatial distribution of aircraft sm especially located in the northeast of the study area where the aircraft sm shows drier and the downscaled sm can more accurately display similar low value areas and changing areas of course the downscaling effect of different smis is different overall the downscaled sm with see nlst and tvmdi have a more similar spatial distribution to the aircraft sm the downscale sm with vsdi and lee have less similarity for evaluating the downscaling results as a whole we first calculated the r ubrmse rmse and bias values between downscaled sm and aircraft sm and displayed them in the form of violin plots as shown in fig 10 according to the r statistics the see1 see2 performed the best overall when used as downscaling factors their r values were statistically greater than that of the other smis for either the terra or aqua satellites fig 10 b and c show the statistics of ubrmse and rmse the smaller of them the better the performance the values of see1 and see2 are the lowest overall indicating that their deviations from the aircraft sm are the smallest fig 10 d shows the statistics of bias there is little difference in the mean value of different factors but the distribution of see1 see2 is more concentrated indicating that their performance is more stable experimental results with vsdi and lee as downscaling factors perform worse than that with see1 see2 additionally the downscaled sm data were evaluated with the in situ sm observations since there were more valid values for terra modis and very few valid values for aqua modis at the sites of in situ sm the thermal and optical smis derived from the terra modis were employed in the evaluation the evaluation results are shown in fig 11 which indicated that the statistical results are basically the same as those evaluated by aircraft sm the correlation coefficient of see1 see2 is the highest overall and their rmse and ubrmse metrics are the lowest the performance of different smis as downscaling factors can be roughly summarized as see1 see2 nlst tvmdi lee vsdi this result is consistent with the evaluations in section 4 1 and section 4 2 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity analysis since the proposed method for calculating the see requires some input parameters a sensitivity analysis was implemented using aircraft sm data to characterize the impact and corresponding importance of each input parameter the specific input parameters involved in the analysis include lst t a fvc αs αv sd and wind speed ws the sensitivity analysis was conducted by adding the relative error to each variable with equal gradients and measuring the correlation between aircraft sm and the new see calculated with the new variable the sensitivity analysis results are shown in fig 12 the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that lst and t a rank at the top sensitive variables fvc is the second most sensitive this result is in line with the basic theory of the model for calculating see as presented in the section 3 1 the model is mainly based on the feature space consisting of surface temperature lst vegetation coverage fvc and air temperature t a hence the lst t a and fvc present a strong sensitivity for the remaining input parameters wind speed ws soil albedo αs and solar shortwave downward radiation sd showed a lesser degree of sensitivity while the vegetable albedo αv showed the lowest sensitivity among the analysed variables these sensitivity analysis results imply that lst and t a are the main input variables that control the accuracy of see calculation which is consistent with the research results of sun and zhao 2022 in addition the reasonable calculation of fvc is also important followed by the accuracy of ws αs sd and αv this conclusion can not only show the rationality of the current method of see but also provide some references for the practical application of the method in the future especially for the collocation and selection of lst and t a 5 2 implications and advantages the above results show that the overall performance of the thermal remote sensing smis is better than that of the optical remote sensing smis since the former have higher consistency than the latter in comparison with aircraft sm and in situ sm as well as in downscaling satellite microwave sm among the thermal remote sensing smis the ts based indices i e either see1 or see2 performed better than the solo lst based indices i e daytime lst and the composite index of lst and optical smis i e tvmdi the above results demonstrate the necessity of obtaining ts based smis for downscaling microwave satellite sm with the microwave and thermal optical fusion as we have reviewed in the introduction the ts based smis are generally derived from the lst fvc space where the calculation of the wet dry edges is crucial as we know visual recognition automatic ﬁtting and theoretical calculation are three main categories of the calculation of wet dry edges whereas the first two are empirical methods fig 13 shows a conceptual map of the calculation of wet dry edges based on the visual recognition method firstly a two dimensional distribution of lst and fvc was established subsequently the temperature endmembers and wet dry edges were determined by artificial visual recognition finally an indicator of sm was calculated by the visually recognized boundaries i e obtaining region wise see in addition to the above visual recognition method the wet dry edges can also be obtained by linear regression i e the automatic fitting method this can be implemented by subdividing the horizontal axis fvc into several subintervals and collecting the maximum and minimum values of the vertical axis lst within each subinterval the collected maximum values of lst with the varied values of fvc were then employed to conduct a linear regression to form the expression of the dry edge in the same way the collected minimum lst values and the fvc values were used to form the expression of the wet edge in contrast we contributed a pixel wise calculation way to obtain ts based smi i e see by combining the lst fvc space with meteorological reanalysis data see section 3 1 where the reanalysis data were employed to theoretically calculation of wet dry edges of the lst fvc feature space rather than visual recognition and automatic ﬁtting conversion from the empirical and region wise method to the theoretical and pixel wise method is one important advantage of this suggested method for obtaining ts based smis we compared the empirical region wise see and the theoretical pixel wise see against the aircraft sm since there was a subtle difference between see1 and see2 the see2 was used in the comparisons fig 14 shows the kernel density scatter plots between empirical region wise see and theoretical pixel wise see against aircraft sm during the smapvex15 experiment the scatter plot and its statistics in the figure showed that the statistical distribution trends of the region wise see and pixel wise see are similar which confirmed the reliability of the suggested pixel wise calculating method further the overall distribution of pixel wise see scatter plot is more concentrated the residual sum of squares rss is smaller and the linear fitting result with aircraft sm is better than that of region wise see moreover pearson s r of pixel wise see is generally higher than that of region wise see indicating that the pixel wise calculated see has a stronger relationship with the aircraft sm than the region wise see in summary fig 14 illustrates the validity of our pixel wise way to obtain the ts based smi by combining the lst fvc space with meteorological reanalysis data moreover compared with the region wise empirical methods the pixel wise theoretical method can avoid some man made errors and evaluate the sm situation more objectively such pixel wise calculated see is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave sm through microwave and thermal optical fusion 5 3 disadvantages and directions although the pixel wise theoretical method of see has significant advantages there are some disadvantages that need to be addressed in the future firstly the ts based smis rely on the thermal radiation of soil to depict the soil moisture conditions one of the disadvantages is the cloud contamination issue for thermal remote sensing due to the existence of the cloud the available values of ts or lst may be scarce for example fig 15 shows the lst observed by the aqua and terra satellite on august 5 it can be seen that many areas have no available lst data from the aqua modis leading to the inability to extract see using the lst fvc space another disadvantage is the decoupling effect between soil temperature and soil moisture sun et al 2019b have found that the decoupling effect happens not only in very wet conditions but also in extremely dry situations and the decoupling effect presented adverse effects on the overall efficiency of thermal smis in downscaling satellite microwave sm additionally the utilization of meteorological reanalysis materials would introduce some uncertainties fig 16 shows the box plot statistics of pearson s r between aircraft sm and see calculated by different types of meteorological reanalysis data during the smapvex15 experiment the results clearly show that there was a significant difference when different meteorological reanalysis data were used the see results have the best correlation with the aircraft sm when the merra 2 data participate in the model calculation the highest correlation value of terra see with merra 2 is more than 0 65 and that of aqua see with merra 2 is more than 0 45 however the performance was reduced by using nldas 2 and gldas meteorological reanalysis data such results provide a caution that we need to choose the meteorological reanalysis data carefully for calculating the dry wet edges of the lst fvc space in addition to the caution of selecting appropriate reanalysis data the complex meteorological conditions may also bring adverse effects on obtaining ts based smis for example we counted the overall changes of lst and t a during the smapvex15 experiment fig 17 shows the regional averages of lst and t a observed in the smapvex15 experiment area from august 2 18 2015 under normal conditions the lst and t a should be in a gradual upward trend from local time 10 00 14 00 however it was found that there was an abnormal situation in the study area on august 5 firstly the t a showed an obvious downward trend after 12 00 but the t a on other days increased gradually secondly there was a big difference between the lst and the t a on this day which was different from the other days the lst is significantly higher than the t a value which may be due to the sudden change in the weather resultantly there was no significant consistency between the aircraft sm and see as shown in fig 18 to sum up there are three disadvantages of the ts based smis established in this study i e cloud contamination decoupling effect and uncertainties of meteorological conditions and reanalysis data these are also the directions of future researches 6 conclusion in this paper a feasible way for pixel wise calculating see was provided by integrating remotely sensed lst fvc space and meteorological reanalysis data five typical thermal optical remote sensing smis including the pixel wise calculated see were evaluated with aircraft sm and in situ sm they were also evaluated as significant factors in downscaling smap sm products the results can be summarized as follows 1 compared with the optical remote sensing smis the thermal remote sensing smis presented a higher consistency with aircraft sm and in situ sm the downscaled satellite sm with thermal remote sensing smis also showed higher performance than that with optical smis 2 among the thermal remote sensing smis see1 and see2 are ts based indices that were derived from the two stage trapezoidal and conventional trapezoidal lst fvc spaces both of them showed better performance than the solo lst based index and composite index of lst and optical smis in the overall evaluation with aircraft sm in situ sm and satellite sm 3 the way of pixel wise calculating see was validated with region wise empirically calculated see and with aircraft in situ as well as satellite sm it is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave sm through microwave and thermal optical fusion 4 however the see calculation method relies on available and reliable lst fvc and meteorological reanalysis data cloud contamination decoupling effect and uncertainties brought by meteorological conditions and reanalysis data are key questions that need to be addressed urgently in further researches for the cloud contamination issue we suggest that the lst gaps under clouds should be filled with alternatives that have taken into account the influence of sm on lst for the decoupling effect we think it is necessary to add complementary downscaling factors in the downscaling methods the last uncertainties issue is very tricky we look forward to higher quality meteorological reanalysis data and remotely sensed lst data funding this work was supported by the

9150,soil evaporative efficiency see was estimated as the relative difference of soil temperature ts to its maximum ts max and minimum ts min values at minimum and maximum soil moisture sm i e see ts max ts ts max ts min this thermal indicator of sm smi has been proven effective in downscaling satellite microwave sm in some local areas however the ts max and ts min were usually determined in an empirical way which is not conducive to a wider range of applications or global downscaling in addition to the ts based smi see solo lst land surface temperature based smi and composite index of lst and optical smis have also been widely used in downscaling microwave sm however they have rarely been evaluated with spatially distributed sm at a similar spatial resolution leading to a vague understanding of their pros and cons in the downscaling in this study we first implemented a pixel wise and theoretically calculating of see with lst fvc space and meteorological reanalysis data then a critical evaluation with satellite aircraft and in situ sm observations was made via the smpavex15 and smapvex16 aircraft based field experiments results indicated that the thermal smis presented a better performance than the optical smis for depicting the variations of sm among the thermal smis ts based see showed better performance than the solo lst based index and the composite index temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi the results demonstrate the validity and necessity of obtaining the ts based see for downscaling satellite microwave sm with thermal optical data the provided pixel wise method was validated in this study for calculating the ts based see which is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave sm with microwave and thermal optical fusion however the disadvantages of cloud contamination the decoupling effect and uncertainties brought by complex meteorological conditions and reanalysis data urgently need more research efforts keywords thermal remote sensing soil moisture microwave downscaling 1 introduction soil moisture is of great significance in the land surface water cycle and surface energy cycle via influencing the conversion of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes determining the distribution of rainfall between infiltration and runoff and even affecting the coupled feedback mechanism between the surface and atmosphere system seneviratne et al 2010 therefore sm usually appears in various fields as a key variable peng et al 2021 such as agricultural water management numerical weather prediction flood and drought monitoring terrestrial carbon balance evapotranspiration et estimation watershed based runoff modelling etc aghakouchak et al 2015 brown et al 2008 dorigo et al 2017 kędzior and zawadzki 2017 it is thus listed as one of the essential climate variables ecv by the global climate observing system gcos there are many ground based observation methods to measure or obtain soil moisture however the spatial distribution of soil moisture is not so homogeneous that the ground based observations can depict it due to the various influencing factors such as topography climate soil type and vegetation coverage with the rapid development of remote sensing science and technology amounts of soil moisture estimation algorithms and products have emerged although most of them are for surface soil moisture sm with the depth of about 0 5 cm these remote sensing retrieval algorithms have covered the entire spectrum from visible band infrared band and thermal band to microwave band wang and qu 2009 currently the passive microwave way especially the l band is considered to have the maximum promising capacity for globally monitoring sm variations because the optical thermal cannot penetrate clouds and doesn t have a straight physical linkage with sm while the active microwave e g synthetic aperture radar sar has great difficulty in stripping the effects of vegetation structure and surface roughness on backscattering coefficients peng et al 2021 wang and qu 2009 wu et al 2014 soil moisture ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap are two landmark satellites that operate with the l band microwave for globally monitoring sm their sm products have proven to own satisfactory performance in various studies colliander et al 2017a 2017b kędzior and zawadzki 2016 2017 liu et al 2019 yet the passive microwave remotely sensed sm is generally restricted to relatively low spatial resolution approximately 25 50 km sun et al 2019a for many watershed scale or farmland scale applications such a coarse spatial resolution is difficult to meet practical needs as demonstrated in peng et al 2021 the requirements levels of landslide prediction flood forecasting drought monitoring precision agriculture etc are indicated as high for high spatial resolution sm less than 1 km thermal and optical remote sensing have higher spatial resolution and richer data sources thus providing crucial higher resolution indicators of sm hereafter smi for refining the spatial resolution of passive microwave sm peng et al 2017 petropoulos et al 2020b sun and cui 2021 sun et al 2019b downscaling microwave sm with microwave and thermal optical fusion or called optical based downscaling has become a significant way to generate remote sensing sm with higher spatiotemporal resolution peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 a comprehensive comparison of existing radar optical radiometer and oversampling based downscaling techniques indicated that the optical based products had the highest performance of temporal consistency with in situ and airborne sm sabaghy et al 2020 therefore the above mentioned microwave and thermal optical fusion still has great application potential generally there are three main methods of downscaling microwave sm with thermal optical remote sensing i e machine learning physical model and semi empirical method the machine learning method originates from the theory of remote sensing land surface temperature and fractional vegetation coverage lst fvc feature space carlson et al 1994 which can be expressed as a two dimensional scattergram composed of lst and fvc or spectral vegetation index petropoulos et al 2020a sun 2016 the upper boundary of the lst fvc space represents the theoretical minimum sm dry edge and the lower boundary represents the theoretical maximum sm wet edge from the dry edge to the wet edge it is composed of a set of gradient sm contour lines and each sm contour line is a linear regression function of lst and fvc or spectral vegetation index svi consequently a statistical regression relationship was generally established between sm and the two surface parameters i e lst and svi the basic idea of this method is to use the microwave sm at coarse resolution to establish a statistical regression relationship then apply the relationship to the surface parameters at high spatial resolution according to the nature of continuous model in remote sensing strahler et al 1986 the most common statistical regression relationship is multiple linear regression carlson 2007 for further research varied machine learning methods were introduced such as artificial neural networks support vector machine regression random forest and other machine learning algorithms liu et al 2018 srivastava et al 2013 sun and cui 2021 on the other hand various surface parameters were added which can be classified into three categories 1 thermal remote sensing smis such as solo lst based smi i e daytime lst long et al 2019 and composite smi such as the temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvmdi amani et al 2017 xu et al 2022 2 optical remote sensing smis such as normalized difference water index ndwi sánchez ruiz et al 2014 perpendicular drought index pdi modified pdi mpdi and second mpdi mpdi1 etc 3 ancillary indicators such as surface albedo chauhan et al 2003 surface net incoming radiation rn sun et al 2019b geographical factors such as longitude latitude and elevation sun and cui 2021 soil texture precipitation abowarda et al 2021 etc as to the physical model approach the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change model dispatch is a typical representative which was constructed by merlin et al merlin et al 2010 2008a the basic idea of this model is to exert the physical function relationship between soil evaporation efficiency see and sm such physical function relationship was expanded by the taylor series at the coarser resolution microwave sm to calculate the sm at a higher spatial resolution regarding the functional relationship between see and sm merlin et al investigated a variety of linear and nonlinear functions including exponential cosine and power functions merlin et al 2010 2013 it turned out that the cosine form was more accurate but the exponential and power function forms were more robust merlin et al 2010 for calculating the see merlin et al utilized the lst fvc trapezoidal space to decompose the lst for obtaining soil surface temperature ts and the ts corresponding to the minimum and maximum sm ts max and ts min the see was then determined as ts max ts ts max ts min according to the expression of the see it is similar to the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi and vegetation temperature condition index vtci which are both derived from the lst fvc triangular or trapezoidal space sandholt et al 2002 sun et al 2019b wang et al 2001 as regards the semi empirical method the dscale mod16 model is a representative which was presented by sun et al 2020 without the usage of lst and lst derived smis to circumvent the issues of cloud contamination decomposing uncertainty and decoupling eﬀect on lst or lst derived smis this model utilized modis terrestrial et data to calculate an alternative downscaling factor land surface evaporative eﬃciency lee defined as lee et pet where pet is potential et sun et al 2020 a cosine square form was used to express the quantitative relationship between lee and sm the evaluation results indicate that the downscaled sm by the dscale mod16 model maintains the accuracy of the original microwave sm while offering more spatial details additionally the ucla method assumed an equal ratio relationship between sm and its remote sensing smis kim and hogue 2012 in the ucla method a soil wetness index swi developed by jiang and islam jiang and islam 2003 was used some scholars compared the swi with the tvdi and vtci in downscaling microwave sm with the ucla method and found that tvdi and vtci were superior to the swi index ling et al 2014 peng et al 2016 in summary microwave and thermal optical fusion is an important way to produce remote sensing sm with fine spatiotemporal resolution and reliable data quality the higher resolution smis derived from thermal remote sensing i e thermal smis are significant indicators in the fusion the existing thermal smis can be roughly divided into three categories 1 solo lst based indices such as daytime lst day night lst difference etc 2 ts based indices such as the above mentioned see tvdi and vtci 3 composite indices of lst and optical sm indices such as the tvmdi however two significant limitations need to be considered in the thermal smis first the ts based indicator see or vtci tvdi has been successfully utilized in downscaling microwave sm for some specific areas however the ts max and ts min in the calculation of see were usually determined empirically merlin et al 2008b petropoulos et al 2020a specifically the ts min was set to the minimum surface temperature observed within the study area and the ts max was set to the maximum value of the ts in the study area merlin et al 2010 2008b such an empirical method limits the see driven downscaling to some specific study areas where exist the actual pixels at the status of the bare soil surface minimum sm and maximum sm however such pixels do not exist for most areas in the satellite remote sensing views even if a specific study area contains such pixels all pixels in the study area image use the same ts max and ts min abbreviated as region wise calculating see which is questionable for a large area or heterogeneous area in other words the empirical region wise method of calculating see needs to be improved for globally downscaling microwave satellite sm second the above three types of thermal smis have been rarely evaluated with spatially distributed sm at the same spatial resolution leading to a vague understanding of their relative advantages in the microwave and thermal optical fusion and further limiting the development of such downscaling techniques therefore this study first aims to implement a pixel wise calculation of see by integrating thermal optical remote sensing with meteorological reanalysis data secondly we would make a critical evaluation of the typical thermal smis with some well known aircraft sm observations the advantages disadvantages and improvement directions of the pixel wise calculating see would be further clarified for improving the microwave and thermal optical fusion 2 data sources the specific data sources used in the study are shown in table 1 including aircraft experiment observations from smapvex15 and smapvex16 remote sensing data from smap and modis satellites and meteorological reanalysis data from gmao merra 2 they are briefly introduced in the following sections 2 1 aircraft and in situ sm observations the aircraft sm has continuous spatial distribution and similar spatial resolution to the thermal optical remote sensing smis thus it has a greater advantage for evaluating the spatial distribution and changing trends of thermal optical smis in this study aircraft observations from the smapvex campaign were used the data was produced by nasa smap to conduct the smap verification experiment mission to assist in the verification calibration and accuracy improvement of smap sm products the gridded sm retrieved from the passive active l band system pals is the aircraft sm used here the aircraft sm corresponds to the surface sm at around 0 5 cm it has been rigorously verified in the experiments their performances have been reported as rmse 0 016 m3 m3 the unbiased ubrmse 0 016 m3 m3 bias 0 005 m3 m3 pearson s r 0 83 colliander et al 2017 and its uncertainty for sm inversion is within a reasonable range to evaluate the experimental results more comprehensively we also gathered the in situ sm measurement data labelled as sv15psm within the smapvex experimental the spatial distribution of these aircraft and in situ sm is shown in fig 1 the smapvex15 campaign experiment period was about two weeks from 2 august to 18 august 2015 this campaign is located in an area of south eastern arizona usa most land cover types are open shrubs and grasslands the smapvex16 ia campaign experiment period was more than two months from 28 may to 18 august 2016 this campaign is located in an area of iowa usa the land cover types are dominated by crops these aircraft sm data were obtained from the national snow and ice data centre https nsidc org data 2 2 smap sm products the smap satellite aims to capture the time dependent changes in sm on a global level by observing sm every 2 3 days the sm products from smap were utilized in this study to evaluate the thermal and optical smis as downscaling factors the sm products data label is smap l3 sm p e and the version number is r16510 those sm products have a daily temporal and 9 km spatial resolution they were retrieved from the ground brightness temperature information first obtained by the smap microwave radiometer and then interpolated to 9 km by the backus gilbert optimization interpolation method 2 3 modis data the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis onboard the aqua and terra satellites can provide data in 36 bands covering the spectral range of 0 4 14 4 µm in the study six kinds of modis products data are mainly used including black white sky albedo data mcd43a3 surface reflectance data mod09ga and myd09ga land surface temperature data mod11a1 and myd11a1 surface cover type data mcd12q1 leaf area index lai data mcd15a2h and surface evapotranspiration data mod16a2 the lai was used to calculate the fvc by the following equation 1 f v c 1 e lai 2 cos ϑ where ϑ is the solar zenith angle f v c is the quantitative measure of fractional vegetation coverage the mcd12q1 were utilized to determine the vegetation albedo α v by a look up table of mean modis vegetation albedos for varied international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classes as listed in houldcroft et al 2009 subsequently the soil albedo α s was derived from the land surface albedo α and its vegetation component α v by the following equation 2 α f v c α v 1 f v c α s where land surface albedo α was obtained from the mcd43a3 product 2 4 gmao merra 2 meteorological data gmao merra 2 is a long term meteorological reanalysis dataset covering the whole world with hourly temporal resolution and 0 5 0 625 spatial resolution it has been widely used in the remote sensing community the surface air temperature surface net downward shortwave radiation data and surface wind speed from this dataset were used in order to match the merra 2 data with modis observations we rounded up the modis observation time to the nearest hour for example table 2 shows the time selection in the experiment of smapvex15 3 methods 3 1 pixel wise calculating see see is a ts based smi which can be basically defined as the following formula according to the previous research merlin et al 2010 3 see t s max t s t s max t s min where t s is soil surface temperature t s min and t s max are the t s at the status of minimum available sm and maximum available sm respectively the see has a data range of 0 1 where 0 implies an extremely dry surface and 1 implies an extremely wet surface generally the see derives from the classical lst fvc feature space model as we know the lst fvc space can be interpreted in two ways conventional trapezoid space and two stage trapezoid space sun 2016 correspondingly two sees can be derived from the different lst fvc spaces here the sees depend on the two stage trapezoid space and the conventional trapezoid space are labelled as see1 and see2 respectively fig 2 a and b show the schematic diagrams of the different lst fvc spaces in a physical sense the wet edge represents the wet land surface with enough moisture for evaporation the dry edge represents the dry land surface without available moisture for evaporation the middle dry edge represents the dry soil surface without available moisture for soil evaporation sun and zhao 2022 as shown in fig 2 a point p represents a pixel located within the lower triangle space of the two stage trapezoid whose coordinate is lst fvc m and n are the pixels at the middle dry edge and the wet edge with the same fvc as point p then the see1 of point p can be determined using the following expression 4 see1 t s max t s t s max t s min t s t s max lst m lst lst m lst n t s max t s min lst m t v min t s max f v c t s max lst n t v min t s min f v c t s min where lstn is the lst of point n on the wet edge lstm is the lst of point m on the middle dry edge t s max t s min t v max and t v min represent the four temperature endmembers as shown in fig 2 a for the conventional trapezoid space in fig 2 b point p also represents a random pixel located in the space with the coordinate of lst fvc o and n address the pixels at the wet edge and dry edge with the same fvc fractional vegetation coverage as point p then the see2 of point p can be expressed as 5 see2 t s max t s t s max t s min t s t s max lst o lst lst o lst n t s max t s min lst o t v max t s max f v c t s max lst n t v min t s min f v c t s min where lsto is the land surface temperature of point o on the dry edge and the other parameters are the same as that in see1 both the see1 and see2 have a data range from 0 to 1 where the greater the indices the wetter the conditions indicated the four temperature endmembers t s max t s min t v max and t v min are calculated using the sun2021 algorithm sun and zhao 2022 6 t s max 1 α s s d ε s ε a σ t a 4 ε s σ t a 4 4 ε s σ t a 3 ρ c p r a s 1

represent soil albedo and vegetation albedo respectively ε v ε s and ε a represent vegetation soil and air emissivity respectively calculated by the same method in sun et al 2019b σ represents the stefan boltzmann constant equalling to 5 76 10 8 w m2 k4 c p represents air specific heat capacity equalling to 1006 j kg k t a represents air temperature obtained from meteorological reanalysis data

coefficients between the soil heat ﬂux and the net radiative flux in the soil and vegetation whose default values are 0 35 and 0 respectively δ represents the slope of the saturated vapour pressure temperature relation γ represents the thermometer constant more details of the sun2021 algorithm can be seen in sun and zhao 2022 sun et al 2019b 3 2 the other thermal and optical smis the other four typical thermal and optical smis were implemented and evaluated in this study the first one is the solo lst based smi i e normalized lst nlst using minimum maximum normalization the next is a composite index tvmdi based on lst and optical smi additionally land surface evapotranspiration efficiency lee calculated by the modis et product was also successfully utilized in downscaling microwave soil moisture sun and cui 2021 sun et al 2020 therefore the lee was also utilized in this evaluation as to the optical smi the visible and shortwave infrared drought index vsdi was selected in the evaluation since its good performance as compared with the other optical smis sun and cui 2021 3 2 1 solo lst based smi nlst is only calculated based on the lst by min max normalizing the daytime lst which can be expressed as 7 nlst lst max lst lst max lst min where lstmin and lstmax are the lowest and the highest lst in the study area nlst has a data range of 0 1 where the greater the nlst the wetter the conditions indicated 3 2 2 composite smi as shown in fig 3 tvmdi is a three dimensional space defined dryness index based on lst perpendicular vegetation index pvi and pdi the w point represents the wet point where the dryness is 0 which is considered to symbolize the lowest lst the highest vegetation coverage and the wettest soil with the growth of the lst the vegetation coverage and soil moisture lower the soil progressively dries and ultimately attains the dry point d in which the dryness is 1 the calculation of tvmdi is mainly based on the lst data the spectral reflectance at the red band and the near infrared band to facilitate the comparisons with the above mentioned indices we calculated the tvmdi using the following equation 8 tvmdi 1 lst 2 pdi 2 3 3 pvi 2 where lst represents a thermal index of sm pdi represents an optical index of sm perpendicular drought index and pvi is an index of vegetation richness the larger the tvmdi the wetter the conditions indicated note that the values of lst pdi and pvi are normalized to be between zero and 3 3 and the normalization method is as follows 9 normallized i i min i max i min i 3 3 where i represents one of the three factors pvi lst and pdi max i and min i mean taking the maximum and minimum values within the study area the pdi and pvi can be calculated by the following expressions amani et al 2017 10 pdi ρ nir 0 86 ρ red 0 082 1 0 86 2 11 pvi ρ nir 1 163 ρ red 0 017 1 1 163 2 where ρ n i r and ρ red are the spectral reflectance at near infrared and red bands respectively 3 2 3 lee in view of the strong coupling relationship between sm and et lee can be used as a downscaling factor of microwave sm sun et al 2020 here the lee calculated from the modis mod16 products was used 12 lee et pet where et and pet represent the actual and potential surface et respectively the larger the lee the wetter the conditions indicated 3 2 4 vsdi vsdi is a typical optical remote sensing index of sm created by utilizing the difference between three bands the blue spectrum red spectrum and swir spectrum according to the characteristic that the red and swir channels are more sensitive to moisture changes in vegetation and soil the blue channel is not sensitive to the changes of moisture in them so the red and swir channels can be used as humidity measurement channels and the blue channel can be used as a reference standard for humidity changes zhang et al 2013 the vsdi was defined as 13 vsdi 1 ρ swir2 ρ blue ρ red ρ blue where ρ red ρ swir2 and ρ blue correspond to the spectral reflectance at the red swir and blue bands respectively the vsdi was restricted to the range between 0 and 1 by setting the values greater than 1 1 the larger the vsdi the wetter the conditions indicated 3 3 evaluation methods the evaluation is carried out in three parts first the calculated smi was compared with the aircraft sm from the smapvex15 and smapvex16 ia second they were assessed with in situ measurement sm during the same period of aircraft campaigns in the third part the various smis were evaluated by using them to downscale the smap sm from 9 km to 500 m which was briefly called the evaluation with satellite sm in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r between the smis and in situ sm or aircraft sm was utilized as an evaluation index since the remote sensing index of sm describes the relative condition of sm rather than the absolute value the greater value of r shows a better performance of the smi as compared with the measured sm in addition a linear regression test is used to test the performance of varied smis it can be expressed as follows 14 θ a smi b where θ is in situ sm or aircraft sm a and b represent linear fitting slope and intercept the performance of smi in the linear regression can be measured by multiple indexes such as the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae normalized rmse nrmse and f test f statistically speaking the higher values of the r2 and f and the smaller values of mae and rmse nrmse indicate the better performance of smi the specific calculation expressions of these indicators can be further found in sun and cui 2021 to compare with the aircraft or in situ sm we also evaluate the smi as a factor in downscaling the smap sm data the machine learning method is utilized to conduct the downscaling process which can be simply expressed as 15 sm f smi a 1 a 2 a 3 where f represents a machine learning algorithm here the classical random forest rf algorithm is employed smi a 1 a 2 and a 3 represent various downscaling factors including fvc black sky albedo and white sky albedo the original 9 km smap sm products were the data to be downscaled they were employed as the dependent variable in the above expression to train the rf algorithm with the downscaling factors averagely aggregated to the spatial resolution of 9 km the trained rf algorithm was then employed to generate higher resolution sm with higher resolution downscaling factors to evaluate the performance of different smis in the downscaling only one thermal optical smi was employed in each experiment while the other downscaling factors remained constant note that the original spatial resolution of lst and solo lst based ts based composite smis is 1 km while that of fvc and black white sky albedos is 500 m the aircraft sm data from smapvex15 and smapvex16 ia also have a spatial resolution of 500 m consequently the above 1 km data were resampled to 500 m serving as the 500 m higher resolution downscaling factors via the nearest neighbour resampling method during the comparison between the downscaled sm and the referenced sm the r ubrmse rmse and bias were used as quantitative evaluation indicators whose calculation expression can be further found in sun and cui 2021 4 results 4 1 evaluation with aircraft sm figs 4 and 5 show the overall spatial distribution of various smis and aircraft sm during the smapvex15 experiment on august 16 2015 and the smapvex16 ia experiment on june 5 2016 respectively in order to uniformly display the spatial changes of different smis we have adjusted the colour tables of all sub figures the sub figure a is the aircraft sm where the soil moisture varied from 0 03 to 0 30 m3 m3 the sub figure b is the spatial distribution of the lee index the sub figure c to sub figure f are see1 terra see1 aqua see2 terra and see2 aqua respectively the sub figure g and sub figure h show tvmdi calculated using the terra and aqua satellites respectively the sub figure i and sub figure j are nlst terra and nlst aqua while the sub figure k and figure l are vsdi terra and vsdi aqua the distributions of the aircraft sm and various smis show that the overall performance of the see1 and see2 is the best as compared to the aircraft sm the spatial distribution of the nlst also looks similar to that of aircraft sm the spatial distribution of the tvmdi is a little fuzzy and not as clear as the former three the spatial distributions of vsdi and lee differ greatly from that of the aircraft sm in other words they have the lowest similarity with the aircraft sm to comprehensively evaluate the smis we made a statistic of all r values between aircraft sm and various smis with a violin plot fig 6 a is the result during the smapvex15 experiment fig 6 b is the result during the smapvex16 ia experiment and fig 6 c is the result of all experiments on the whole see1 and see2 perform the best because the area with the largest kernel density value has the largest value and the mean values are also higher than other indices vsdi and lee have the worst performance while the performance of nlst and tvmdi varies between them finally we performed linear regression tests on various smis table 3 lists the average values of r2 rmse nrmse mae and f and are sorted by r2 value the ranking results are consistent with the above statistics with the violin plot the r2 and f values of see1 see2 are the largest while the rmse nrmse and mae are the lowest the second are the nlst and the tvmdi ranks the third with the lowest r2 and f value and the largest rmse and mae vsdi gets the worst performance to sum up the above evaluation shows that compared with the aircraft sm the see1 see2 derived by the lst fvc space has the best overall performance in statistics and the second best is the nlst and tvmdi among them vsdi and lee indicators have the lowest consistency with aircraft sm 4 2 evaluation with in situ sm fig 7 illustrates the scatterplot of the in situ sm with different smis during the smapvex15 experiment on august 16 2015 except for the abnormal performance of the vsdi aqua the other smis are positively correlated with the in situ sm similar to the evaluation results with aircraft sm the best performance is found for see1 and see2 calculated using lst fvc feature space with the r value greater than 0 6 and the r2 greater than 0 4 in contrast the r values of the other smis are all less than 0 6 and the r2 values are all less than 0 4 additionally we evaluated the correlation between smis and in situ sm from a temporal variation it is at each site to calculate the r between the smis and in situ sm over the whole time series and then plot a violin statistical plot over all sites as shown in fig 8 statistical data shows that the median and mean r values of see1 see2 are higher than that of other smis in other words the see1 see2 still got the best performance when compared with the in situ sm to sum up the quantitative evaluation result with the in situ sm is the same as that with the aircraft sm 4 3 evaluation with satellite sm fig 9 shows the spatial distributions of aircraft sm original smap sm and varied downscaled sm with the smis during the smapvex15 experiment as shown in the figure more detailed changes in the spatial distribution of sm can be provided through the downscaling method compared with the original 9 km smap sm the downscaled sm are more similar to the spatial distribution of aircraft sm especially located in the northeast of the study area where the aircraft sm shows drier and the downscaled sm can more accurately display similar low value areas and changing areas of course the downscaling effect of different smis is different overall the downscaled sm with see nlst and tvmdi have a more similar spatial distribution to the aircraft sm the downscale sm with vsdi and lee have less similarity for evaluating the downscaling results as a whole we first calculated the r ubrmse rmse and bias values between downscaled sm and aircraft sm and displayed them in the form of violin plots as shown in fig 10 according to the r statistics the see1 see2 performed the best overall when used as downscaling factors their r values were statistically greater than that of the other smis for either the terra or aqua satellites fig 10 b and c show the statistics of ubrmse and rmse the smaller of them the better the performance the values of see1 and see2 are the lowest overall indicating that their deviations from the aircraft sm are the smallest fig 10 d shows the statistics of bias there is little difference in the mean value of different factors but the distribution of see1 see2 is more concentrated indicating that their performance is more stable experimental results with vsdi and lee as downscaling factors perform worse than that with see1 see2 additionally the downscaled sm data were evaluated with the in situ sm observations since there were more valid values for terra modis and very few valid values for aqua modis at the sites of in situ sm the thermal and optical smis derived from the terra modis were employed in the evaluation the evaluation results are shown in fig 11 which indicated that the statistical results are basically the same as those evaluated by aircraft sm the correlation coefficient of see1 see2 is the highest overall and their rmse and ubrmse metrics are the lowest the performance of different smis as downscaling factors can be roughly summarized as see1 see2 nlst tvmdi lee vsdi this result is consistent with the evaluations in section 4 1 and section 4 2 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity analysis since the proposed method for calculating the see requires some input parameters a sensitivity analysis was implemented using aircraft sm data to characterize the impact and corresponding importance of each input parameter the specific input parameters involved in the analysis include lst t a fvc αs αv sd and wind speed ws the sensitivity analysis was conducted by adding the relative error to each variable with equal gradients and measuring the correlation between aircraft sm and the new see calculated with the new variable the sensitivity analysis results are shown in fig 12 the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that lst and t a rank at the top sensitive variables fvc is the second most sensitive this result is in line with the basic theory of the model for calculating see as presented in the section 3 1 the model is mainly based on the feature space consisting of surface temperature lst vegetation coverage fvc and air temperature t a hence the lst t a and fvc present a strong sensitivity for the remaining input parameters wind speed ws soil albedo αs and solar shortwave downward radiation sd showed a lesser degree of sensitivity while the vegetable albedo αv showed the lowest sensitivity among the analysed variables these sensitivity analysis results imply that lst and t a are the main input variables that control the accuracy of see calculation which is consistent with the research results of sun and zhao 2022 in addition the reasonable calculation of fvc is also important followed by the accuracy of ws αs sd and αv this conclusion can not only show the rationality of the current method of see but also provide some references for the practical application of the method in the future especially for the collocation and selection of lst and t a 5 2 implications and advantages the above results show that the overall performance of the thermal remote sensing smis is better than that of the optical remote sensing smis since the former have higher consistency than the latter in comparison with aircraft sm and in situ sm as well as in downscaling satellite microwave sm among the thermal remote sensing smis the ts based indices i e either see1 or see2 performed better than the solo lst based indices i e daytime lst and the composite index of lst and optical smis i e tvmdi the above results demonstrate the necessity of obtaining ts based smis for downscaling microwave satellite sm with the microwave and thermal optical fusion as we have reviewed in the introduction the ts based smis are generally derived from the lst fvc space where the calculation of the wet dry edges is crucial as we know visual recognition automatic ﬁtting and theoretical calculation are three main categories of the calculation of wet dry edges whereas the first two are empirical methods fig 13 shows a conceptual map of the calculation of wet dry edges based on the visual recognition method firstly a two dimensional distribution of lst and fvc was established subsequently the temperature endmembers and wet dry edges were determined by artificial visual recognition finally an indicator of sm was calculated by the visually recognized boundaries i e obtaining region wise see in addition to the above visual recognition method the wet dry edges can also be obtained by linear regression i e the automatic fitting method this can be implemented by subdividing the horizontal axis fvc into several subintervals and collecting the maximum and minimum values of the vertical axis lst within each subinterval the collected maximum values of lst with the varied values of fvc were then employed to conduct a linear regression to form the expression of the dry edge in the same way the collected minimum lst values and the fvc values were used to form the expression of the wet edge in contrast we contributed a pixel wise calculation way to obtain ts based smi i e see by combining the lst fvc space with meteorological reanalysis data see section 3 1 where the reanalysis data were employed to theoretically calculation of wet dry edges of the lst fvc feature space rather than visual recognition and automatic ﬁtting conversion from the empirical and region wise method to the theoretical and pixel wise method is one important advantage of this suggested method for obtaining ts based smis we compared the empirical region wise see and the theoretical pixel wise see against the aircraft sm since there was a subtle difference between see1 and see2 the see2 was used in the comparisons fig 14 shows the kernel density scatter plots between empirical region wise see and theoretical pixel wise see against aircraft sm during the smapvex15 experiment the scatter plot and its statistics in the figure showed that the statistical distribution trends of the region wise see and pixel wise see are similar which confirmed the reliability of the suggested pixel wise calculating method further the overall distribution of pixel wise see scatter plot is more concentrated the residual sum of squares rss is smaller and the linear fitting result with aircraft sm is better than that of region wise see moreover pearson s r of pixel wise see is generally higher than that of region wise see indicating that the pixel wise calculated see has a stronger relationship with the aircraft sm than the region wise see in summary fig 14 illustrates the validity of our pixel wise way to obtain the ts based smi by combining the lst fvc space with meteorological reanalysis data moreover compared with the region wise empirical methods the pixel wise theoretical method can avoid some man made errors and evaluate the sm situation more objectively such pixel wise calculated see is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave sm through microwave and thermal optical fusion 5 3 disadvantages and directions although the pixel wise theoretical method of see has significant advantages there are some disadvantages that need to be addressed in the future firstly the ts based smis rely on the thermal radiation of soil to depict the soil moisture conditions one of the disadvantages is the cloud contamination issue for thermal remote sensing due to the existence of the cloud the available values of ts or lst may be scarce for example fig 15 shows the lst observed by the aqua and terra satellite on august 5 it can be seen that many areas have no available lst data from the aqua modis leading to the inability to extract see using the lst fvc space another disadvantage is the decoupling effect between soil temperature and soil moisture sun et al 2019b have found that the decoupling effect happens not only in very wet conditions but also in extremely dry situations and the decoupling effect presented adverse effects on the overall efficiency of thermal smis in downscaling satellite microwave sm additionally the utilization of meteorological reanalysis materials would introduce some uncertainties fig 16 shows the box plot statistics of pearson s r between aircraft sm and see calculated by different types of meteorological reanalysis data during the smapvex15 experiment the results clearly show that there was a significant difference when different meteorological reanalysis data were used the see results have the best correlation with the aircraft sm when the merra 2 data participate in the model calculation the highest correlation value of terra see with merra 2 is more than 0 65 and that of aqua see with merra 2 is more than 0 45 however the performance was reduced by using nldas 2 and gldas meteorological reanalysis data such results provide a caution that we need to choose the meteorological reanalysis data carefully for calculating the dry wet edges of the lst fvc space in addition to the caution of selecting appropriate reanalysis data the complex meteorological conditions may also bring adverse effects on obtaining ts based smis for example we counted the overall changes of lst and t a during the smapvex15 experiment fig 17 shows the regional averages of lst and t a observed in the smapvex15 experiment area from august 2 18 2015 under normal conditions the lst and t a should be in a gradual upward trend from local time 10 00 14 00 however it was found that there was an abnormal situation in the study area on august 5 firstly the t a showed an obvious downward trend after 12 00 but the t a on other days increased gradually secondly there was a big difference between the lst and the t a on this day which was different from the other days the lst is significantly higher than the t a value which may be due to the sudden change in the weather resultantly there was no significant consistency between the aircraft sm and see as shown in fig 18 to sum up there are three disadvantages of the ts based smis established in this study i e cloud contamination decoupling effect and uncertainties of meteorological conditions and reanalysis data these are also the directions of future researches 6 conclusion in this paper a feasible way for pixel wise calculating see was provided by integrating remotely sensed lst fvc space and meteorological reanalysis data five typical thermal optical remote sensing smis including the pixel wise calculated see were evaluated with aircraft sm and in situ sm they were also evaluated as significant factors in downscaling smap sm products the results can be summarized as follows 1 compared with the optical remote sensing smis the thermal remote sensing smis presented a higher consistency with aircraft sm and in situ sm the downscaled satellite sm with thermal remote sensing smis also showed higher performance than that with optical smis 2 among the thermal remote sensing smis see1 and see2 are ts based indices that were derived from the two stage trapezoidal and conventional trapezoidal lst fvc spaces both of them showed better performance than the solo lst based index and composite index of lst and optical smis in the overall evaluation with aircraft sm in situ sm and satellite sm 3 the way of pixel wise calculating see was validated with region wise empirically calculated see and with aircraft in situ as well as satellite sm it is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave sm through microwave and thermal optical fusion 4 however the see calculation method relies on available and reliable lst fvc and meteorological reanalysis data cloud contamination decoupling effect and uncertainties brought by meteorological conditions and reanalysis data are key questions that need to be addressed urgently in further researches for the cloud contamination issue we suggest that the lst gaps under clouds should be filled with alternatives that have taken into account the influence of sm on lst for the decoupling effect we think it is necessary to add complementary downscaling factors in the downscaling methods the last uncertainties issue is very tricky we look forward to higher quality meteorological reanalysis data and remotely sensed lst data funding this work was supported by the

9151,in the yellow river delta soil salinization and river sediment are the two factors influence on economic growth a large area of salinization reduces crop yields and dredged river sediment increases management costs this study evaluated the effects of applying sediments under different levels of irrigation on salinity leaching for improving field productivity a three year field experiment from june 2017 to june 2020 was conducted by considering three levels of sediment application a control no sediment added s1 30 mm ha 1 s2 and 60 mm ha 1 s3 and three levels of irrigation water 290 mm 90 mm maize 200 mm wheat w1 385 mm 120 mm maize 265 mm wheat w2 and 480 mm 150 mm maize 330 mm wheat w3 the results exhibited that soil leaching rate was up to 66 3 under 60 mm ha 1 sediment application and 385 mm irrigation after three wheat maize rotation cultivation this irrigation and sediment applied strategy achieved the effect of leaching salt saving water and increasing grain yields the mean yield of wheat and maize in sediment application and irrigation treatment was 18 3 t ha 1 in three year experiment which was significant bigger than the control thus it is a technically feasible and friendly sustainable approach for salinization soil development in the yellow river delta keywords yellow river delta saline alkali land water irrigation applying dredged sediment soil amendment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil salinity and sodicity seriously threaten the productivity of cultivated land all of the world ivits et al 2013 salt affected soil problems appear more than 75 countries up to 1 billion ha in the world accounting for at least 20 of irrigated land ghassemi et al 1995 qadir et al 2014 mao et al 2016 salinization turns soil physical properties to clayey soil structure low hydraulic conductivity and dispersion of soil particles leading to low biological productivity qadir et al 2006 chi et al 2012 yao et al 2013 hu et al 2020 with population and consumption increasing the demand for food will continually raise for more than another 40 years godfray et al 2010 at the current level of agricultural production this means that more and more salt affected soils need to be developed and cropped for food katerji et al 2003 qadir et al 2006 2013 various remediation practices or salinity control measures have been studied over the past thirty years these measures include phytoremediation chemical remediation organic amendment tillage and water leaching sharma and minhas 2005 osman 2013 srivastava et al 2016 mao et al 2016 mbarki et al 2018 li et al 2021 water leaching and gypsum caso4 2 h2o applying are the most common used practices through winter and spring irrigation soil salinity is percolated to deep soil layers that crops can be grown in salt affected land on the other hand applied gypsum is a source of calcium ca2 to take place of surplus sodium na at soil cation exchange sites chaganti et al 2015 uri 2018 mckenna et al 2019 however it is shortage for available water resources and excessive irrigation would result in rising groundwater level and lead to secondary salinization in some regions also the gypsum is expensive that restrictes its widely using mckenna et al 2019 natural zeolite and biochar were also studied for salt affected soil remediation yet the high cost is still a big problem that especially limits its promotion in developing countries industrial wastes such as coal mining slags were also applied as soil amendments for improving soil physical properties in salt affected soils but farmers fear the high levels of pollution in industrial wastes that limits these industrial byproducts application pandey et al 2009 the area of saline soil in china is 34 87 million ha even if it is removed coastal beaches and the exploitable areas saline alkali land is also up to 13 3 million ha shi and song 2016 totally about 7 of farmlands are affected by excessive salts yellow river delta yrd is one of the widely affected by soil salinization regions where is the largest river delta in china with the implement of high efficiency ecological economic zone in yellow river the development and utilization of saline alkali land has become a national strategy in yellow river delta the remediation of saline alkali land covers about 70 for sustainable development in the yellow river delta shao et al 2019 local governments demand for a series of measures to improve saline alkali land productivity according to local characteristics comparing the reported remediation measures the easy to accomplish method of water leaching is the most commonly used in this region with the expansion of cropland more and more water is required while it is not enough flood irrigation is not applicable in this region another effective measure of improving saline soil physical properties is returning adequate crop residue to field however using crop residues e g maize and corn as remediation in upper layer of soil would cause plant disease during straw decomposition the microorganisms will complete with crop seedlings for nutrients meanwhile straw incorporation will promote the organic acid accumulation especially under flooded soil condition in addition the returning straw itself has larvae and carrier bacteria these reasons would cause crop disease li et al 2018 thus the best soil amelioration option is comprehensive consideration of economic social environmental influences and promotion values yellow river is well known as the most sediment laden river on earth that every year about 1 6 billion tons sediment transports to bohai sea and yellow sea zhou et al 2020b while the irrigation in the yellow river delta consumes 80 river water and the rest is used by the industries and cities along the river sedimentation is a serious problem for water diversion and conveyance systems in the yellow river delta baosheng et al 2004 in addition it is a financial waste to dredge the sediment and a tremendous amount of dredged sediment would make ecological problems if not managed properly every year totally 450 million tons sediments are deposited in the bin zhou and dong ying cities where are located in central of yellow river delta every year local governments spend about 1 billion yuan 154 million dollar in cleaning irrigation canals sediments because of prevention flood hazard the government prefers to focus their energy in mian channel few regulations and measures are implemented for dealing with the dredged sediment in the fields eventually the dredged sediment is kept along the canals or randomly piled in a central location if not effective management the sediment would be washed away by heavy rainfall or blew away by wind leading to serious ecological problems even though some researches has been performed to find ways to turn the sediments into treasures mao et al 2016 2018 li 2020 irrigation regimes and applied sediment amount were not considered in winter wheat maize rotation system which was mostly cultivated in this region and what about the impact of applying sediment and irrigation on salinity leaching is little discussed winter wheat and maize are the main crops in the northern china due to the limitation of soil salinity these crops produce little it is of great significance for local economy and ecological protection to improve crop yield by improving productivity of saline alkali land this research attempt to study soil salinity dynamics under different irrigation regimes with river sediment amendment to saline soils by three year field trials in particular the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the impacts of sediment application on both crops growth and soil salinity in the yellow river delta 2 to ascertain how and to what extent irrigation affects salinity leaching and 3 to develop sediments application and irrigation scheduling that can maintain crop production and simultaneously increase salinity leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description this field experiment was conducted at the xiaokai river saline alkali land improvement experimental station 3 7 41 42 n 11 7 45 47 e in binzhou city shandong province china fig 1 from june 2017 to june 2020 while soil salinities were sampled from june 2017 to june 2020 experimental site is located in the yellow river delta with a typical sub humid temperate continental monsoon climate with warm wet summers and cold winters the mean annual temperature and total precipitation are 12 7 c and 564 8 mm respectively approximately 80 of the total precipitation occurs from july to september fig 2 and the groundwater level is 3 m below the soil surface in this region the main cropping system is a rotation of winter wheat and maize winter wheat is often planted at the beginning of october and harvested in the middle of june and maize is planted immediately after wheat harvested the growth period of maize is almost three months and harvests at the end of september the typical soil type in this region is clayey saline soil in june 2017 before the establishment of the experiment soil physical and chemical properties down to 140 cm depths were measured and shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design this experiments studied three levels of irrigation including controlled irrigation w1 intermittent irrigation w2 and adequate irrigation w3 besides this experiments were used three levels of sediment application including controlled sediment no sediment s1 i e ck 30 mm ha 1 s2 and 60 mm ha 1 s3 table 2 thus totally nine treatments were designed experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block with nine treatments and three replicates the plots were separated by plastic film to a depth of 200 cm with 1 m between each plot there are thus a total of 27 plots fig 1 with each being 45 m2 15 m 3 m a local common wheat cultivar jimai 22 was used with sowing amount of 225 kg seeds ha 1 a row space width of 12 cm and a sowing width of 5 cm fig 3 the maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was selected and planted immediately following the wheat harvest the distances between maize rows and plants were 60 cm and 30 cm respectively fig 3 in order to accurately reflect the salinity dynamics of cultivated lands in this intensive cropping system the irrigation amount and time were controlled strictly for all the treatments and performed in accordance with local farmers practices other cropping management practices such as pesticide and herbicide application were consistent with those used by local farmers the tillage planting harvest and irrigation schedule for all treatments are shown in table 3 the river sediments salinity contents were below 0 5 g l 1 were collected from the canal beside the experimental station fig 1 then they were air dried and sifted organic residues such as grass seeds and plant straws prior to sowing the 30 mm s2 and 60 mm s3 depths of sediment were uniformly spread on the land surface and then tilled into the soil about 30 cm in depth using a rotary disc only applied river sediment once before planting maize in 2017 this mixing method got a good effect on the 30 cm soil layer which was used by most researchers on applying sediment to amend soil quality all plots received the same tillage 2 3 sample collection and measurement prior to experiment soil samples were taken on 15 may 2017 in each plot to establish the pre treatment condition after planting crops soil samples were taken from three sites in each plot at five depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using an hand auger inner diameter 2 0 cm from june 2017 to june 2020 fig 3 the three samples from each plot at the same depth were mixed thoroughly to produce one composite sample soil samples were collected at 7 day intervals from april to september and at 14 day intervals from october to next march the soil moisture was determined after drying at 105 c for 24 h from the air dried soil samples 10 g weighed soil was ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve and used for preparing saturated soil extracts with 1 5 of soil water soil electric conductivity ec measurement dds 308a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument inc shanghai china was conducted with the soil extracts the relationship between salt content and electrical conductivity was determined by dry residue method he et al 2015 the relationship was obtained from the following equation 1 y 0 0032 e c 0 19 r 2 0 99 where y g kg 1 is the soil salinity ec us cm 1 is electrical conductivity in order to quantify the long term effects of sediment application and irrigation on soil physical structure and macropores soil macropores and saturated hydrologic conductivity k f were measured after wheat harvest in june 14th 2020 it s five wheat maize rotation periods since river sediment has been applied the methodes of measurement of soil macropores and calculation of k f referred to mao et al 2018 2016 soil macropores pores 0 03 mm were estimated with volumetric displacement of water under the soil water matric potential of 10 kpa of undisturbed soil samples k f was measured using the hood infiltrometer manufactured by umwelt geräte technik gmbh hood 2700 in the field every treatment was measured at three locations that was consistent with soil sampling at wheat harvest plants covering an area of 2 m2 2 m 1 m were randomly selected and harvested from each plot at maize harvest samples were selected from 10 plants per plot after air drying grain yields were weighed and expressed in dry weight all wheat straw was returned to the soil and all maize straw was removed from field 2 4 irrigation treatments and precipitation the irrigation treatment amounts were totally 200 mm w1 265 mm w2 and 330 mm w3 for the wheat season and totally 90 mm w1 120 mm w2 and 150 mm for the maize season respectively table 2 the wheat was irrigated four times with 20 30 30 and 20 of irrigation amount and the maize was irrigated once during the growing season the schedule of irrigation is shown by table 3 irrigation water was taken from the groundwater of the test station and the salinity contents were below 0 5 g l 1 in total precipitation that beyond 10 mm each event during the wheat growing season was 175 2 mm 33 9 mm and 94 5 mm in 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively corresponding to wheat the amount of precipitation during maize growing season was 286 7 mm 277 3 mm and 292 7 mm in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively there was one heavy precipitation event of 170 5 mm in 11 12 august 2019 maize growing season 2 5 data calculations and analysis soil salt balance was defined by the relationship between the mass of salt entering and leaving soli layers scofield 1940 thayalakumaran et al 2007 hu et al 2002 proposed soil salt balance model used in unsaturated soil zone and expressed as 2 δ s s p s i s q 1 s g s f s q 2 s c s x where δs t ha 1 is the change of soil salt in unsaturated zone s p t ha 1 is the amount of salt brought by precipitation s i t ha 1 is the amount of salt brought in by irrigation water s q1 is the amount of salt brought in by lateral flow s g t ha 1 is the salt accumulated by phreatic evaporation s f t ha 1 is the amount of salt brought in by chemical fertilizer s c t ha 1 is the amount of salt taken away by crop harvest s q2 t ha 1 is the amount of salt carried away by lateral flow s x t ha 1 is the soil salt taken away by recharging groundwater considering soil salt was brought in or out by lateral flow s q1 s q2 the values were basically negligible in this experimental field because different plots were separated by plastic film after wheat harvest the straw was returned and salinity was input by wheat straw as s w besides the salinity of precipitation is very small that the values of s p was ignored therefore apparent soil salinity loss δs in 0 100 cm depth soil profile was used as an important index for evaluating effects of irrigation and applying sediment on salinity status δs was calculated as 3 δ s s i s g s f s w s c s x soil salinity residual ssr t ha 1 amount at maize and wheat harvest to a depth of 100 cm was calculated using equation 4 s s r s i b d s d 0 1 where s i g kg 1 is the soil salinity concentration of soil samples at maize harvest to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm intervals bd g cm 3 is soil bulk density and sd 20 cm is soil depths cm soil salinity leaching rate during the maize wheat rotation was obtained using equation 5 n s s r 1 s s r 2 s s r 1 where ssr 1 t ha 1 is initial value of soil salinity residual and ssr 2 t ha 1 is the final value of soil salinity residual after applying sediment and irrigation amendment over the three years all data were collected and analyzed using microsoft excel 2010 the significance of differenc ewere tested by analysis of variance anova using sas 8 0 in which multiple comparisons of means were proformed using the least significant difference at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 grain yields of wheat and maize during the three year researching periods the grain yields of wheat and maize were significantly affected by the applying sediment and irrigation table 4 in general under the same irrigation conditions the maize wheat grain yields of applying 30 mm ha 1 sediments s2 and 60 mm ha 1 sediments s3 treatments were increased by 3 8 8 9 and 14 8 20 0 that compared with no sediments application s1 respectively by contrast under the same applying sediments conditions the yields of 385 mm irrigation w2 and 480 mm irrigation w3 treatments were increased by 32 1 37 1 and 62 9 72 6 that compared with control irrigation treatments w1 290 mm respectively under coupling effects of irrigation and sediment application the highest yield of w3s3 treatment were increased 98 9 that compared with the lowest yield of w1s1 treatment obviously the yields of maize were greater than that of wheat and compared with w1s1 treatment the average maize and wheat yields in w3s3 treatments were significantly increased 139 6 and 43 6 respectively in the three year experiments the average maize yields increased from 8 3 to 8 9 t ha 1 and the average wheat yields increased from 8 3 to 8 9 t ha 1 under amendment of sediments applying and irrigation during 2017 2020 3 2 soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity the soil macropores 0 03 mm were significantly different under applied sediment treatments p 0 05 fig 4a compared with no sediments applied treatments s1 the values of macropores were increased in applying sediment treatments s2 and s3 the average macroporesity value of no sediments treatments s1 was 6 0 while the average values of 30 mm ha 1 sediments applied s2 and 60 mm ha 1 sediments applied treatments s3 were 6 6 and 9 1 respectively the values of macroporosity were increased by 12 3 and 54 1 in s2 and s3 compared with no sediments applied treatments s1 respectively however fig 4a illustrates that irrigation treatments have no significant difference between different treatments the effects of applying sediments on saturated hydraulic conductivity k f were also significantly different p 0 05 compared with no sediments applied treatments s1 the values of k f were increased with sediments applied fig 4b the mean k f values of s1 s2 and s3 treatments were 22 4 cm day 1 33 4 cm day 1 and 63 1 cm day 1 respectively the values of k f were increased by 49 1 and 181 7 with the addition of sediments respectively sediments applying have changed soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity 3 3 soil salinity residual in soil at harvest the soil salinity residual in 0 100 cm soil profiles were observed after crop harvest during the six growing seasons 2017 2020 fig 5 the values of soil salinity residual were significantly decreased in all treatments with improvement measures of sediments application and irrigation the mean value of soil salinity residual in 0 100 cm soil profiles was 48 4 t ha 1 in 2017 and it was decreased to 35 4 t ha 1 in 2020 therefore almost 36 7 soil salinity in 0 100 cm depth was decreased in the three year experiment the values of soil salinity residual were ranged from 30 3 to 46 8 t ha 1 after three maize growing seasons and these values were ranged from 26 1 to 47 2 t ha 1 after three wheat growing seasons the fluctuation of soil salinity residual after wheat harvest was larger that of maize under the same sediments applied condition the values of soil salinity residual were decreased with increment of irrigation amount w2 w3 that compared to controlled irrigation treatments w1 under the same irrigation condition the values of salinity residual significantly decreased with the increment of sediments application but that reducing effect was week than irrigation furthermore the value of salinity residual in none sediments application and low irrigation amount treatment w1s1 was 1 76 times bigger than w3s3 treatment high irrigation and 60 mm sediment application affected by precipitation and meteorological factors the values of salinity residual in w2s2 and w2s3 treatments were minimum after maize harvest in 2018 3 4 apparent salinity budget the apparent total budget of salt inputs and outputs in the soil crop system are shown in table 5 more water irrigation and sediments application promoted crops growth and yields formation that resulted in a high uptake of soil salinity the uptake of salinity in w3s3 treatment was the maximum 8 3 t ha 1 while the value of w1s1 treatment was the minimum 4 3 t ha 1 under the same sediments application the uptake of salinity by crops in w2 and w3 treatments were increased by 37 7 and 76 1 that compared with w1 treatments respectively under the same irrigation the uptake of salinity by crops in s2 and s3 treatments were increased by 10 8 and 5 1 that compared with s1 treatments respectively the value of salinity taken away by recharging groundwater was maximum in w2s3 without obvious law in this study the values of apparent salinity loss in all of the treatments were positive this indicated that the salinities in 0 100 cm soil profile were gradually decreased in all treatments considering of salinity leaching factors the highest value was up to 75 7 in w3s3 treatment even the minimum value of w1s2 treatment was exceeded 55 under the same irrigation amount of 480 mm w3 treatments the values of salinity leaching factor were increased by 1 9 and 4 3 in w3s2 and w3s3 treatments respectively salinity leaching processes were promoted by sediments application while this leaching effecs were weaker than irrigation that were consistent with previous results 3 5 soil water and salinity dynamics the soil salinity and moisture in 0 40 cm depth soil profile were dynamically displayed the processes of salinity leaching fig 6 shows effects of sediments application precipitation and irrigation on soil moisture and soil salinity in 0 40 cm depth soil profile during the three wheat maize rotations from 2017 to 2020 the measures of irrigation and sediments application promoted soil salinity leaching generally the tendency of soil salinity and moisture was presented in opposite situation after irrigation and precipitation the values of salinity were sharply declined and the values of soil moisture content were increased since the precipitation was generally less than the irrigation amount the effects of irrigation on soil salinity were more significant than that of precipitation the w3s3 treatment had the lowest soil salinity and the highest soil moisture content on the contrary w1s1 treatment had the lowest water moisture content and the highest soil salinity among all of the treatments although soil salinity demonstrated a sharply fluctuated in the three year experiment it still showed a obvious interannual variation law fig 6a generally the value of average salinity in 0 40 cm depth soil was significantly decreased in the first year of field experiment comparing with initial condition of experiment the soil salinity was leached away almost 56 during 2017 2018 growing seasons the changeable patterns of soil salinity in the last two years were similar with the first year of experiment however the leaching of salinity was not as big as that in the first year according to rainfall characteristics and maize wheat growing periods the values of soil salinity were reached minimum in july the soil salinity dynamics in wheat growing periods were more obvious and the values of soil moisture content were persistently declining from october to march of the second year in these treatments the values of soil salinity in w1s1 treatment were the highest except in the late stage of maize growth the values of salinity in w3s3 treatment which had more irrigation and sediments application were the lowest compared with soil salinity the fluctuations of soil moisture content were more obvious that were directly related to irrigation and rainfall in this study the values of average soil moisture content in the larger irrigation treatments w3 480 mm and w2 285 mm were higher than the lower irrigation treatments w1 290 mm there was also a similar law in the interannual change the statistical characteristics of soil salinity and moisture are shown by box and whisker diagram fig 7 the mean values of soil salinity were gradually decreasing with increment of sediment application and irrigation as w1s1 w1s2 w1s3 w2s1 w2s2 w2s3 w3s1 w3s2 w3s3 comparing with soil salinity sediment application and irrigation gradually enhanced soil moisture as w1s1 w1s2 w1s3 w2s1 w2s2 w2s3 w3s1 w3s2 w3s3 the sediment application and irrigation provided a good soil salt water environment by improving soil moisture and decreasing soil salinity 3 6 seasonal salinity leaching losses there was obvious variation in soil salinity leaching losses in the three year experiment from 2017 to 2020 fig 8 the growth period of wheat was twice as long as that of maize while the effective rainfall during the growth period was far lower than that of maize the soil salinity sharply decreased after maize harvest in 2017 and the leaching loss of salinity in w3s3 treatment was significantly higher than that of other treatments among six growth seasons of wheat maize rotation salinity leaching losses were the lowest after wheat harvest in 2020 and the variation laws of salinity leaching losses were not obvious after maize harvest in 2017 for example the w2s2 treatment had the best salinity leaching effect in 2018 while low water irrigation w1s1 w1s3 had the best salinity leaching effect between wheat and maize the leaching effect of maize in the growth period was better than that in wheat growth period the average soil salinity of 0 100 cm depth in wheat growth period had decreased by 6 5 t ha 1 while it had decreased by 17 8 t ha 1 in maize growth period 4 discussion 4 1 effects of sediments application rate on crops growth and soil salinity soil s physical structure and macropores are essential to water movement directly affecting salt dissolution and movement allaire leung et al 2000 adding sediment is the physical improvement of soil structure and saturated hydraulic conductivity pereira et al 2014 this ultimately affects the leaching process of soil salinity qadir et al 2014 therefore the amount of sediment applied and the variation of soil structure are critical issues to be determined for soil amendment by river sediments in this experiment the 30 mm ha 1 s2 and 60 mm ha 1 s3 sediments treatments increased soil macropores by 12 3 and 54 1 respectively since pores in soil are channels for water migration the saturated hydraulic conductivity increases with the increase of soil pores strudley et al 2008 the mean value of saturated hydraulic conductivity increased by 32 9 and 64 5 in s2 and s3 treatments respectively these two indicators significantly increase under the application of sediments which have been confirmed in laboratory sun et al 2022 li 2021 song et al 2010 and field experiments li 2019 zhang et al 2014 mao et al 2016 here comes a fundamental question how much sediment is reasonable from the soil column experiment perspective chi and wang 2009 revealed that adding more than 30 sediments could effectively improve the saturated hydraulic conductivity of alkaline soil and promote soil salt leaching simultaneously song et al 2010 indicated that the soil s infiltration capacity could be significantly improved when sediments were added to more than 25 and the evaporation capacity of the soil could be significantly weakened when sediments were added more than 75 as the rise of soil capillary water was obstructed by sediment macropores structure so that the evaporation of soil water was significantly reduced yuan et al 2008 yan et al 2016 researched on the amount of sediment mixed with 0 25 and found that adding 20 sediments had the most excellent effect on soil bulk density and ventilation porosity which were increased by 10 1 and 112 0 respectively with the growth in demand for the reclamation of low yield fields improving soil salinity leaching efficiency by adding river sediment has become a research hotspot in recent years zhang et al 2019 indicated that 15 of mixed sediments had the best effect of reducing salt compared with no sediment applied the study was shown that the soil salinity in the 30 cm soil layers was reduced by more than 90 when the proportions of sediment were applied between 18 and 24 which could also ensure the desalination capacity and water holding capacity at the same time zhou et al 2020a qi et al 2021 studied saline soil mixed with 30 50 sand and found that adding sand in that range could effectively promote the disintegration of saline soil blocks and improve the soil infiltration rate and salt leaching efficiency laboratory experiments suggest that adding 15 50 sediments could significantly change the soil structure and improve the soil s physical chemical properties unlike laboratory experiments with controllable conditions field research has many uncontrollable interfering factors prolonged periods and high costs but it is closer to reality and the results are more credible for promotion ye et al 2013 added sandy soil into heavy texture red soil and found that the balance of soil nutrient was improved adding 10 20 mm ha 1 sand got the maximum yields while adding 50 100 mm ha 1 sand reduced soil production zhang et al 2014 improved the soil properties in the 0 40 cm depth layers by adding 25 mm ha 1 of sediments and promoted the transformation of soil porosity from severely saline alkali land to mildly saline alkali land mao et al 2016 2018 carried out experiments applying yellow river sediment on cotton and wheat fields the sediment mixing amounts were between 4 5 mm and 13 3 mm ha 1 compared with the control treatment soil properties and yields were improved and the yields were increased with the increment of applying sediments however the effects of more sediments applying on soil structure and crop growth were not discussed ma et al 2017 added 30 mm ha 1 sand and increased ventilation porosity and production by 48 7 and 8 83 respectively li 2020 applied 70 mm ha 1 sand and the production was increased by 18 the amounts of sediments applied in fields were 4 5 100 mm ha 1 among different regions and crops in this study applying 30 mm ha 1 and 60 mm ha 1 sediments made a better soil environment and harvested more crop yields excluding the influence of irrigation the average yields of wheat and maize were increased by 7 3 and 16 7 with 30 mm and 60 mm applied respectively the average yield of wheat and maize increased by 33 9 and 66 9 with 30 mm and 60 mm respectively this was consistent with previous studies that applied sediments increased production in addition the amounts of sediment we used were reasonable between the ranges of previous laboratory and field studies furthermore the 60 mm ha 1 treatments were better than the 30 mm ha 1 treatments so what happens if we continue to increase the amount of sediment hu et al 2022 and duo and hu 2018 studied filling the yellow river sediment to reclaim low lying areas of wastelands improving the fertility of cultivated land this showed crops could grow in thorough yellow river sediment soil but the yields were not high thus a threshold in sediments was applied to improve soil properties and crop yields in this study the results showed that applying sediment threshold exceeded 60 mm ha 1 we suggest that a larger amount of sediments 60 150 mm ha 1 should be used for finding the threshold in the future applying sediment is more like the fertilizer which is an accessorial effect on soil water and salt environment this also explained why the effect of applying sediments in the first year was better than in the last two years perhaps applying sediments every year would be a more appropriate choice nevertheless it is not clear whether it will bring other problems this question was the next step we planned to solve 4 2 effects of irrigation treatments on soil salinity leaching environmental factors such as geology meteorology geomorphology hydrogeology soil and plants all affect the process of soil salinization li 2020 among them rainfall and flood irrigation can greatly affect the distribution of soil water and salt thus flood irrigation is one of the most practical methods for improvement of saline soils in yrd xie et al 2011 liu et al 2005 studied full irrigation and controlled deficit irrigation scheduling strategies for wheat and maize the results showed that full irrigation and deficit irrigation schedulings were 414 mm wheat 343 mm maize 71 mm and 288 mm wheat 227 mm maize 61 mm respectively in this study we seted up 3 levels irrigation amount as 290 mm wheat 200 mm maize 90 mm 385 mm wheat 265 maize 120 and 480 mm wheat 330 maize 150 respectively the experimental setup was covered both full irrigation and deficit irrigation it was also below the irrigation quotas wheat 348 mm maize 135 mm which was given by quota for agricultural water of shandong province db37 t 3772 2019 in the three year experiment soil salinity residuals in 0 100 cm were all decreased by irrigation and sediment applied treatments the range of soil salinity loss was up to 63 9 81 0 t ha 1 the loss salinity had two ways deeper soil layers and taken away by crops in this stdy the w3s3 treatment s crop uptaked 8 3 t ha 1 this value was related to plant dry matter and yield the lowest yield w1s1 treatment only uptaked only 4 3 t ha 1 which was a half of w3s3 treatment however nearly 90 of the salt was leached into deeper layers this aspect showed that the adopted irrigation treatments could save water and leaching salt but the long term controlled irrigation has also left hidden dangers for salt outbreaks the use of water conservancy measures such as underground salt drainage can be combined with irrigation and sand application to achieve the best effect of saline alkali land improvement ondrasek and rengel 2021 zhou et al 2020a this study only roughly analyzed the salinity state by using the soil salinity balance and there may be some observation errors in the observation of the data in the future a large number of accurate observations are still needed to reveal the law of salinity distribution 4 3 effects of optimizing sediments application and irrigation treatments on grain yields and soil salinity the addition of sediment reduces soil salinity in two ways the first is to improve soil s physical and chemical properties and promote water infiltration the second is to inhibit evaporation and reduce salt accumulation on the surface layer here we are more concerned about whether applying sediment could replace irrigation to reduce soil salinity to save water resources in the yrd mao et al 2018 studied sediment 100 and 200 mg ha approximately equal to 6 5 and 13 mm ha 1 applying in the wheat field under regular irrigation leaching salt these results showed sediment application resulted in soil salinity below the threshold of wheat zhang et al 2019 explored the effect of saline alkali improvement by yellow river sediment applying with surface soil 0 20 cm in yrd this study also illustrated that the average desalination rate with 15 sediment applied was increased by 7 65 than that of the control no sediment applied treatment similarly zhou et al 2020a found that the soil salinity in the 30 cm soil layer was reduced by more than 90 after 20 days in the treatment with the sand addition ratio of 18 24 compared with the treatment without sand addition thus it is feasible to increase the efficiency of irrigation desalination by adding sediment and reducing the amount of irrigation in this study under irrigation and sediment the salinity leaching factor was up to 75 7 in w3s3 treatment the value was increased by 8 6 compared with the w1s1 treatment previous studies have shown that salinity leaching increases dramatically with higher irrigation levels letey et al 2011 this was consistent with the results of this experiment the effect of applying sediment was investigated by keeping the same amount of irrigation only in high irrigation treatments w3 with the increment of sediment from 30 to 60 mm ha 1 the values of salinity leaching factor were increased by 1 9 4 4 compared with no sediment applied in the deficit irrigation w1 the values of the salinity leaching factor in the application of sediment were even below no sediment applied we speculated that the desalination effect of sediment depends on the irrigation amount the greater the amount of irrigation the more enhanced the desalination effect of the application of sediment more irrigation enhanced the desalination effect of the application of sediment although irrigation still played a significant role in reducing soil salinity the appropriate amount of sediment applied could save water resources which were a shortage in this region the optimal amount of irrigated sediments should comprehensively consider grain yields and soil salinity in terms of grain yield irrigation and applying sediment could all increase grain yields water resources are the limiting factor in yrd and there is a lot of river sediment in areas with stricter water restrictions the amount of irrigation could be 385 mm and the amount of sediment could be 60 mm ha 1 w2s3 treatment in terms of salinity leaching the w2s3 treatment also effectively improved soil physical characteristics and increased the salinity leaching factor therefore considering influences of soil structure macroporosity crop yield and irrigation factors we recommended that the amount of sediment applied was 60 mm ha 1 conservatively 385 mm w2 was enough for crop growth and soil improvement if it would like to get the maximum yield and desalination effect 60 mm sediment application and 480 mm irrigation strategy was recommended 4 4 annual difference during the experimental period soil moisture and salinity were annually changed during the experimental period the salt was concentrated in autumn and spring a critical period for wheat emergence and yield formation it was leached into the deeper layer in the summer a crucial period for maize the soil salinity was more evident leaching in the first year of planting and the effect was weak in the later planting this may be caused by rainfall and irrigation the soil salinity leaching needed the bigger irrigation or precipitation per event in this study compared with maize the growth period of wheat is two times longer that of maize maize grew between june and october with relatively heavy rainfall during this period in 2018 2019 and 2020 the rainfall was 286 7 mm 277 3 mm and 292 7 mm respectively however the rainfall during the growing period of wheat is less than haft that of maize there were two critical growth periods in wheat the precipitation was 47 8 mm 20 8 mm and 27 4 mm in 2017 2019 during october to december respectively and the rainfall was 169 3 mm 59 1 mm and 83 7 mm in 2018 2020 during march to may respectively heavy rainfall in first year may have contributed to dramatic changes in salinity under the influence of soil water and salinity grain yields increased from 2017 to 2019 especially maize yields increased dramatically proper irrigation and gradual reduction of soil salinity are significant factors in yield increase soil salinity is critical for plants a suitable salt environment can promote the growth of plants shrivastava and kumar 2015 5 conclusions water resources shortage and soil salinization are two limiting factors for agricultural economic development in the yellow river delta this study illustrated that effects of applying sediment and irrigation on grain yields and soil salinity leaching in three year field experiment river sediment mixing saline soil enhanced salt leaching and improved soil texture leading to increment of macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity river sediment applying saline soil enhanced salinity leaching and improved soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity soil leaching rate was up to 75 7 under 60 mm ha 1 sediment application and 480 mm irrigation after three wheat maize rotation cultivation however considering grain yields soil salinity and water saving the amount of sediment applied was 60 mm ha 1 and the irrigation amount of 385 mm was recommended in the yellow river delta the mean yield of wheat and maize in sediment application and irrigation treatment was 18 3 t ha 1 in three year experiment which was significant bigger than the control applying river sediment in saline soil improved field productivity and provided an approach for sustainable management of dredged sediment and saving water resources in the yellow river delta declaration of

9151,in the yellow river delta soil salinization and river sediment are the two factors influence on economic growth a large area of salinization reduces crop yields and dredged river sediment increases management costs this study evaluated the effects of applying sediments under different levels of irrigation on salinity leaching for improving field productivity a three year field experiment from june 2017 to june 2020 was conducted by considering three levels of sediment application a control no sediment added s1 30 mm ha 1 s2 and 60 mm ha 1 s3 and three levels of irrigation water 290 mm 90 mm maize 200 mm wheat w1 385 mm 120 mm maize 265 mm wheat w2 and 480 mm 150 mm maize 330 mm wheat w3 the results exhibited that soil leaching rate was up to 66 3 under 60 mm ha 1 sediment application and 385 mm irrigation after three wheat maize rotation cultivation this irrigation and sediment applied strategy achieved the effect of leaching salt saving water and increasing grain yields the mean yield of wheat and maize in sediment application and irrigation treatment was 18 3 t ha 1 in three year experiment which was significant bigger than the control thus it is a technically feasible and friendly sustainable approach for salinization soil development in the yellow river delta keywords yellow river delta saline alkali land water irrigation applying dredged sediment soil amendment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil salinity and sodicity seriously threaten the productivity of cultivated land all of the world ivits et al 2013 salt affected soil problems appear more than 75 countries up to 1 billion ha in the world accounting for at least 20 of irrigated land ghassemi et al 1995 qadir et al 2014 mao et al 2016 salinization turns soil physical properties to clayey soil structure low hydraulic conductivity and dispersion of soil particles leading to low biological productivity qadir et al 2006 chi et al 2012 yao et al 2013 hu et al 2020 with population and consumption increasing the demand for food will continually raise for more than another 40 years godfray et al 2010 at the current level of agricultural production this means that more and more salt affected soils need to be developed and cropped for food katerji et al 2003 qadir et al 2006 2013 various remediation practices or salinity control measures have been studied over the past thirty years these measures include phytoremediation chemical remediation organic amendment tillage and water leaching sharma and minhas 2005 osman 2013 srivastava et al 2016 mao et al 2016 mbarki et al 2018 li et al 2021 water leaching and gypsum caso4 2 h2o applying are the most common used practices through winter and spring irrigation soil salinity is percolated to deep soil layers that crops can be grown in salt affected land on the other hand applied gypsum is a source of calcium ca2 to take place of surplus sodium na at soil cation exchange sites chaganti et al 2015 uri 2018 mckenna et al 2019 however it is shortage for available water resources and excessive irrigation would result in rising groundwater level and lead to secondary salinization in some regions also the gypsum is expensive that restrictes its widely using mckenna et al 2019 natural zeolite and biochar were also studied for salt affected soil remediation yet the high cost is still a big problem that especially limits its promotion in developing countries industrial wastes such as coal mining slags were also applied as soil amendments for improving soil physical properties in salt affected soils but farmers fear the high levels of pollution in industrial wastes that limits these industrial byproducts application pandey et al 2009 the area of saline soil in china is 34 87 million ha even if it is removed coastal beaches and the exploitable areas saline alkali land is also up to 13 3 million ha shi and song 2016 totally about 7 of farmlands are affected by excessive salts yellow river delta yrd is one of the widely affected by soil salinization regions where is the largest river delta in china with the implement of high efficiency ecological economic zone in yellow river the development and utilization of saline alkali land has become a national strategy in yellow river delta the remediation of saline alkali land covers about 70 for sustainable development in the yellow river delta shao et al 2019 local governments demand for a series of measures to improve saline alkali land productivity according to local characteristics comparing the reported remediation measures the easy to accomplish method of water leaching is the most commonly used in this region with the expansion of cropland more and more water is required while it is not enough flood irrigation is not applicable in this region another effective measure of improving saline soil physical properties is returning adequate crop residue to field however using crop residues e g maize and corn as remediation in upper layer of soil would cause plant disease during straw decomposition the microorganisms will complete with crop seedlings for nutrients meanwhile straw incorporation will promote the organic acid accumulation especially under flooded soil condition in addition the returning straw itself has larvae and carrier bacteria these reasons would cause crop disease li et al 2018 thus the best soil amelioration option is comprehensive consideration of economic social environmental influences and promotion values yellow river is well known as the most sediment laden river on earth that every year about 1 6 billion tons sediment transports to bohai sea and yellow sea zhou et al 2020b while the irrigation in the yellow river delta consumes 80 river water and the rest is used by the industries and cities along the river sedimentation is a serious problem for water diversion and conveyance systems in the yellow river delta baosheng et al 2004 in addition it is a financial waste to dredge the sediment and a tremendous amount of dredged sediment would make ecological problems if not managed properly every year totally 450 million tons sediments are deposited in the bin zhou and dong ying cities where are located in central of yellow river delta every year local governments spend about 1 billion yuan 154 million dollar in cleaning irrigation canals sediments because of prevention flood hazard the government prefers to focus their energy in mian channel few regulations and measures are implemented for dealing with the dredged sediment in the fields eventually the dredged sediment is kept along the canals or randomly piled in a central location if not effective management the sediment would be washed away by heavy rainfall or blew away by wind leading to serious ecological problems even though some researches has been performed to find ways to turn the sediments into treasures mao et al 2016 2018 li 2020 irrigation regimes and applied sediment amount were not considered in winter wheat maize rotation system which was mostly cultivated in this region and what about the impact of applying sediment and irrigation on salinity leaching is little discussed winter wheat and maize are the main crops in the northern china due to the limitation of soil salinity these crops produce little it is of great significance for local economy and ecological protection to improve crop yield by improving productivity of saline alkali land this research attempt to study soil salinity dynamics under different irrigation regimes with river sediment amendment to saline soils by three year field trials in particular the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the impacts of sediment application on both crops growth and soil salinity in the yellow river delta 2 to ascertain how and to what extent irrigation affects salinity leaching and 3 to develop sediments application and irrigation scheduling that can maintain crop production and simultaneously increase salinity leaching 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil description this field experiment was conducted at the xiaokai river saline alkali land improvement experimental station 3 7 41 42 n 11 7 45 47 e in binzhou city shandong province china fig 1 from june 2017 to june 2020 while soil salinities were sampled from june 2017 to june 2020 experimental site is located in the yellow river delta with a typical sub humid temperate continental monsoon climate with warm wet summers and cold winters the mean annual temperature and total precipitation are 12 7 c and 564 8 mm respectively approximately 80 of the total precipitation occurs from july to september fig 2 and the groundwater level is 3 m below the soil surface in this region the main cropping system is a rotation of winter wheat and maize winter wheat is often planted at the beginning of october and harvested in the middle of june and maize is planted immediately after wheat harvested the growth period of maize is almost three months and harvests at the end of september the typical soil type in this region is clayey saline soil in june 2017 before the establishment of the experiment soil physical and chemical properties down to 140 cm depths were measured and shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design this experiments studied three levels of irrigation including controlled irrigation w1 intermittent irrigation w2 and adequate irrigation w3 besides this experiments were used three levels of sediment application including controlled sediment no sediment s1 i e ck 30 mm ha 1 s2 and 60 mm ha 1 s3 table 2 thus totally nine treatments were designed experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block with nine treatments and three replicates the plots were separated by plastic film to a depth of 200 cm with 1 m between each plot there are thus a total of 27 plots fig 1 with each being 45 m2 15 m 3 m a local common wheat cultivar jimai 22 was used with sowing amount of 225 kg seeds ha 1 a row space width of 12 cm and a sowing width of 5 cm fig 3 the maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was selected and planted immediately following the wheat harvest the distances between maize rows and plants were 60 cm and 30 cm respectively fig 3 in order to accurately reflect the salinity dynamics of cultivated lands in this intensive cropping system the irrigation amount and time were controlled strictly for all the treatments and performed in accordance with local farmers practices other cropping management practices such as pesticide and herbicide application were consistent with those used by local farmers the tillage planting harvest and irrigation schedule for all treatments are shown in table 3 the river sediments salinity contents were below 0 5 g l 1 were collected from the canal beside the experimental station fig 1 then they were air dried and sifted organic residues such as grass seeds and plant straws prior to sowing the 30 mm s2 and 60 mm s3 depths of sediment were uniformly spread on the land surface and then tilled into the soil about 30 cm in depth using a rotary disc only applied river sediment once before planting maize in 2017 this mixing method got a good effect on the 30 cm soil layer which was used by most researchers on applying sediment to amend soil quality all plots received the same tillage 2 3 sample collection and measurement prior to experiment soil samples were taken on 15 may 2017 in each plot to establish the pre treatment condition after planting crops soil samples were taken from three sites in each plot at five depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using an hand auger inner diameter 2 0 cm from june 2017 to june 2020 fig 3 the three samples from each plot at the same depth were mixed thoroughly to produce one composite sample soil samples were collected at 7 day intervals from april to september and at 14 day intervals from october to next march the soil moisture was determined after drying at 105 c for 24 h from the air dried soil samples 10 g weighed soil was ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve and used for preparing saturated soil extracts with 1 5 of soil water soil electric conductivity ec measurement dds 308a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument inc shanghai china was conducted with the soil extracts the relationship between salt content and electrical conductivity was determined by dry residue method he et al 2015 the relationship was obtained from the following equation 1 y 0 0032 e c 0 19 r 2 0 99 where y g kg 1 is the soil salinity ec us cm 1 is electrical conductivity in order to quantify the long term effects of sediment application and irrigation on soil physical structure and macropores soil macropores and saturated hydrologic conductivity k f were measured after wheat harvest in june 14th 2020 it s five wheat maize rotation periods since river sediment has been applied the methodes of measurement of soil macropores and calculation of k f referred to mao et al 2018 2016 soil macropores pores 0 03 mm were estimated with volumetric displacement of water under the soil water matric potential of 10 kpa of undisturbed soil samples k f was measured using the hood infiltrometer manufactured by umwelt geräte technik gmbh hood 2700 in the field every treatment was measured at three locations that was consistent with soil sampling at wheat harvest plants covering an area of 2 m2 2 m 1 m were randomly selected and harvested from each plot at maize harvest samples were selected from 10 plants per plot after air drying grain yields were weighed and expressed in dry weight all wheat straw was returned to the soil and all maize straw was removed from field 2 4 irrigation treatments and precipitation the irrigation treatment amounts were totally 200 mm w1 265 mm w2 and 330 mm w3 for the wheat season and totally 90 mm w1 120 mm w2 and 150 mm for the maize season respectively table 2 the wheat was irrigated four times with 20 30 30 and 20 of irrigation amount and the maize was irrigated once during the growing season the schedule of irrigation is shown by table 3 irrigation water was taken from the groundwater of the test station and the salinity contents were below 0 5 g l 1 in total precipitation that beyond 10 mm each event during the wheat growing season was 175 2 mm 33 9 mm and 94 5 mm in 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively corresponding to wheat the amount of precipitation during maize growing season was 286 7 mm 277 3 mm and 292 7 mm in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively there was one heavy precipitation event of 170 5 mm in 11 12 august 2019 maize growing season 2 5 data calculations and analysis soil salt balance was defined by the relationship between the mass of salt entering and leaving soli layers scofield 1940 thayalakumaran et al 2007 hu et al 2002 proposed soil salt balance model used in unsaturated soil zone and expressed as 2 δ s s p s i s q 1 s g s f s q 2 s c s x where δs t ha 1 is the change of soil salt in unsaturated zone s p t ha 1 is the amount of salt brought by precipitation s i t ha 1 is the amount of salt brought in by irrigation water s q1 is the amount of salt brought in by lateral flow s g t ha 1 is the salt accumulated by phreatic evaporation s f t ha 1 is the amount of salt brought in by chemical fertilizer s c t ha 1 is the amount of salt taken away by crop harvest s q2 t ha 1 is the amount of salt carried away by lateral flow s x t ha 1 is the soil salt taken away by recharging groundwater considering soil salt was brought in or out by lateral flow s q1 s q2 the values were basically negligible in this experimental field because different plots were separated by plastic film after wheat harvest the straw was returned and salinity was input by wheat straw as s w besides the salinity of precipitation is very small that the values of s p was ignored therefore apparent soil salinity loss δs in 0 100 cm depth soil profile was used as an important index for evaluating effects of irrigation and applying sediment on salinity status δs was calculated as 3 δ s s i s g s f s w s c s x soil salinity residual ssr t ha 1 amount at maize and wheat harvest to a depth of 100 cm was calculated using equation 4 s s r s i b d s d 0 1 where s i g kg 1 is the soil salinity concentration of soil samples at maize harvest to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm intervals bd g cm 3 is soil bulk density and sd 20 cm is soil depths cm soil salinity leaching rate during the maize wheat rotation was obtained using equation 5 n s s r 1 s s r 2 s s r 1 where ssr 1 t ha 1 is initial value of soil salinity residual and ssr 2 t ha 1 is the final value of soil salinity residual after applying sediment and irrigation amendment over the three years all data were collected and analyzed using microsoft excel 2010 the significance of differenc ewere tested by analysis of variance anova using sas 8 0 in which multiple comparisons of means were proformed using the least significant difference at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 grain yields of wheat and maize during the three year researching periods the grain yields of wheat and maize were significantly affected by the applying sediment and irrigation table 4 in general under the same irrigation conditions the maize wheat grain yields of applying 30 mm ha 1 sediments s2 and 60 mm ha 1 sediments s3 treatments were increased by 3 8 8 9 and 14 8 20 0 that compared with no sediments application s1 respectively by contrast under the same applying sediments conditions the yields of 385 mm irrigation w2 and 480 mm irrigation w3 treatments were increased by 32 1 37 1 and 62 9 72 6 that compared with control irrigation treatments w1 290 mm respectively under coupling effects of irrigation and sediment application the highest yield of w3s3 treatment were increased 98 9 that compared with the lowest yield of w1s1 treatment obviously the yields of maize were greater than that of wheat and compared with w1s1 treatment the average maize and wheat yields in w3s3 treatments were significantly increased 139 6 and 43 6 respectively in the three year experiments the average maize yields increased from 8 3 to 8 9 t ha 1 and the average wheat yields increased from 8 3 to 8 9 t ha 1 under amendment of sediments applying and irrigation during 2017 2020 3 2 soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity the soil macropores 0 03 mm were significantly different under applied sediment treatments p 0 05 fig 4a compared with no sediments applied treatments s1 the values of macropores were increased in applying sediment treatments s2 and s3 the average macroporesity value of no sediments treatments s1 was 6 0 while the average values of 30 mm ha 1 sediments applied s2 and 60 mm ha 1 sediments applied treatments s3 were 6 6 and 9 1 respectively the values of macroporosity were increased by 12 3 and 54 1 in s2 and s3 compared with no sediments applied treatments s1 respectively however fig 4a illustrates that irrigation treatments have no significant difference between different treatments the effects of applying sediments on saturated hydraulic conductivity k f were also significantly different p 0 05 compared with no sediments applied treatments s1 the values of k f were increased with sediments applied fig 4b the mean k f values of s1 s2 and s3 treatments were 22 4 cm day 1 33 4 cm day 1 and 63 1 cm day 1 respectively the values of k f were increased by 49 1 and 181 7 with the addition of sediments respectively sediments applying have changed soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity 3 3 soil salinity residual in soil at harvest the soil salinity residual in 0 100 cm soil profiles were observed after crop harvest during the six growing seasons 2017 2020 fig 5 the values of soil salinity residual were significantly decreased in all treatments with improvement measures of sediments application and irrigation the mean value of soil salinity residual in 0 100 cm soil profiles was 48 4 t ha 1 in 2017 and it was decreased to 35 4 t ha 1 in 2020 therefore almost 36 7 soil salinity in 0 100 cm depth was decreased in the three year experiment the values of soil salinity residual were ranged from 30 3 to 46 8 t ha 1 after three maize growing seasons and these values were ranged from 26 1 to 47 2 t ha 1 after three wheat growing seasons the fluctuation of soil salinity residual after wheat harvest was larger that of maize under the same sediments applied condition the values of soil salinity residual were decreased with increment of irrigation amount w2 w3 that compared to controlled irrigation treatments w1 under the same irrigation condition the values of salinity residual significantly decreased with the increment of sediments application but that reducing effect was week than irrigation furthermore the value of salinity residual in none sediments application and low irrigation amount treatment w1s1 was 1 76 times bigger than w3s3 treatment high irrigation and 60 mm sediment application affected by precipitation and meteorological factors the values of salinity residual in w2s2 and w2s3 treatments were minimum after maize harvest in 2018 3 4 apparent salinity budget the apparent total budget of salt inputs and outputs in the soil crop system are shown in table 5 more water irrigation and sediments application promoted crops growth and yields formation that resulted in a high uptake of soil salinity the uptake of salinity in w3s3 treatment was the maximum 8 3 t ha 1 while the value of w1s1 treatment was the minimum 4 3 t ha 1 under the same sediments application the uptake of salinity by crops in w2 and w3 treatments were increased by 37 7 and 76 1 that compared with w1 treatments respectively under the same irrigation the uptake of salinity by crops in s2 and s3 treatments were increased by 10 8 and 5 1 that compared with s1 treatments respectively the value of salinity taken away by recharging groundwater was maximum in w2s3 without obvious law in this study the values of apparent salinity loss in all of the treatments were positive this indicated that the salinities in 0 100 cm soil profile were gradually decreased in all treatments considering of salinity leaching factors the highest value was up to 75 7 in w3s3 treatment even the minimum value of w1s2 treatment was exceeded 55 under the same irrigation amount of 480 mm w3 treatments the values of salinity leaching factor were increased by 1 9 and 4 3 in w3s2 and w3s3 treatments respectively salinity leaching processes were promoted by sediments application while this leaching effecs were weaker than irrigation that were consistent with previous results 3 5 soil water and salinity dynamics the soil salinity and moisture in 0 40 cm depth soil profile were dynamically displayed the processes of salinity leaching fig 6 shows effects of sediments application precipitation and irrigation on soil moisture and soil salinity in 0 40 cm depth soil profile during the three wheat maize rotations from 2017 to 2020 the measures of irrigation and sediments application promoted soil salinity leaching generally the tendency of soil salinity and moisture was presented in opposite situation after irrigation and precipitation the values of salinity were sharply declined and the values of soil moisture content were increased since the precipitation was generally less than the irrigation amount the effects of irrigation on soil salinity were more significant than that of precipitation the w3s3 treatment had the lowest soil salinity and the highest soil moisture content on the contrary w1s1 treatment had the lowest water moisture content and the highest soil salinity among all of the treatments although soil salinity demonstrated a sharply fluctuated in the three year experiment it still showed a obvious interannual variation law fig 6a generally the value of average salinity in 0 40 cm depth soil was significantly decreased in the first year of field experiment comparing with initial condition of experiment the soil salinity was leached away almost 56 during 2017 2018 growing seasons the changeable patterns of soil salinity in the last two years were similar with the first year of experiment however the leaching of salinity was not as big as that in the first year according to rainfall characteristics and maize wheat growing periods the values of soil salinity were reached minimum in july the soil salinity dynamics in wheat growing periods were more obvious and the values of soil moisture content were persistently declining from october to march of the second year in these treatments the values of soil salinity in w1s1 treatment were the highest except in the late stage of maize growth the values of salinity in w3s3 treatment which had more irrigation and sediments application were the lowest compared with soil salinity the fluctuations of soil moisture content were more obvious that were directly related to irrigation and rainfall in this study the values of average soil moisture content in the larger irrigation treatments w3 480 mm and w2 285 mm were higher than the lower irrigation treatments w1 290 mm there was also a similar law in the interannual change the statistical characteristics of soil salinity and moisture are shown by box and whisker diagram fig 7 the mean values of soil salinity were gradually decreasing with increment of sediment application and irrigation as w1s1 w1s2 w1s3 w2s1 w2s2 w2s3 w3s1 w3s2 w3s3 comparing with soil salinity sediment application and irrigation gradually enhanced soil moisture as w1s1 w1s2 w1s3 w2s1 w2s2 w2s3 w3s1 w3s2 w3s3 the sediment application and irrigation provided a good soil salt water environment by improving soil moisture and decreasing soil salinity 3 6 seasonal salinity leaching losses there was obvious variation in soil salinity leaching losses in the three year experiment from 2017 to 2020 fig 8 the growth period of wheat was twice as long as that of maize while the effective rainfall during the growth period was far lower than that of maize the soil salinity sharply decreased after maize harvest in 2017 and the leaching loss of salinity in w3s3 treatment was significantly higher than that of other treatments among six growth seasons of wheat maize rotation salinity leaching losses were the lowest after wheat harvest in 2020 and the variation laws of salinity leaching losses were not obvious after maize harvest in 2017 for example the w2s2 treatment had the best salinity leaching effect in 2018 while low water irrigation w1s1 w1s3 had the best salinity leaching effect between wheat and maize the leaching effect of maize in the growth period was better than that in wheat growth period the average soil salinity of 0 100 cm depth in wheat growth period had decreased by 6 5 t ha 1 while it had decreased by 17 8 t ha 1 in maize growth period 4 discussion 4 1 effects of sediments application rate on crops growth and soil salinity soil s physical structure and macropores are essential to water movement directly affecting salt dissolution and movement allaire leung et al 2000 adding sediment is the physical improvement of soil structure and saturated hydraulic conductivity pereira et al 2014 this ultimately affects the leaching process of soil salinity qadir et al 2014 therefore the amount of sediment applied and the variation of soil structure are critical issues to be determined for soil amendment by river sediments in this experiment the 30 mm ha 1 s2 and 60 mm ha 1 s3 sediments treatments increased soil macropores by 12 3 and 54 1 respectively since pores in soil are channels for water migration the saturated hydraulic conductivity increases with the increase of soil pores strudley et al 2008 the mean value of saturated hydraulic conductivity increased by 32 9 and 64 5 in s2 and s3 treatments respectively these two indicators significantly increase under the application of sediments which have been confirmed in laboratory sun et al 2022 li 2021 song et al 2010 and field experiments li 2019 zhang et al 2014 mao et al 2016 here comes a fundamental question how much sediment is reasonable from the soil column experiment perspective chi and wang 2009 revealed that adding more than 30 sediments could effectively improve the saturated hydraulic conductivity of alkaline soil and promote soil salt leaching simultaneously song et al 2010 indicated that the soil s infiltration capacity could be significantly improved when sediments were added to more than 25 and the evaporation capacity of the soil could be significantly weakened when sediments were added more than 75 as the rise of soil capillary water was obstructed by sediment macropores structure so that the evaporation of soil water was significantly reduced yuan et al 2008 yan et al 2016 researched on the amount of sediment mixed with 0 25 and found that adding 20 sediments had the most excellent effect on soil bulk density and ventilation porosity which were increased by 10 1 and 112 0 respectively with the growth in demand for the reclamation of low yield fields improving soil salinity leaching efficiency by adding river sediment has become a research hotspot in recent years zhang et al 2019 indicated that 15 of mixed sediments had the best effect of reducing salt compared with no sediment applied the study was shown that the soil salinity in the 30 cm soil layers was reduced by more than 90 when the proportions of sediment were applied between 18 and 24 which could also ensure the desalination capacity and water holding capacity at the same time zhou et al 2020a qi et al 2021 studied saline soil mixed with 30 50 sand and found that adding sand in that range could effectively promote the disintegration of saline soil blocks and improve the soil infiltration rate and salt leaching efficiency laboratory experiments suggest that adding 15 50 sediments could significantly change the soil structure and improve the soil s physical chemical properties unlike laboratory experiments with controllable conditions field research has many uncontrollable interfering factors prolonged periods and high costs but it is closer to reality and the results are more credible for promotion ye et al 2013 added sandy soil into heavy texture red soil and found that the balance of soil nutrient was improved adding 10 20 mm ha 1 sand got the maximum yields while adding 50 100 mm ha 1 sand reduced soil production zhang et al 2014 improved the soil properties in the 0 40 cm depth layers by adding 25 mm ha 1 of sediments and promoted the transformation of soil porosity from severely saline alkali land to mildly saline alkali land mao et al 2016 2018 carried out experiments applying yellow river sediment on cotton and wheat fields the sediment mixing amounts were between 4 5 mm and 13 3 mm ha 1 compared with the control treatment soil properties and yields were improved and the yields were increased with the increment of applying sediments however the effects of more sediments applying on soil structure and crop growth were not discussed ma et al 2017 added 30 mm ha 1 sand and increased ventilation porosity and production by 48 7 and 8 83 respectively li 2020 applied 70 mm ha 1 sand and the production was increased by 18 the amounts of sediments applied in fields were 4 5 100 mm ha 1 among different regions and crops in this study applying 30 mm ha 1 and 60 mm ha 1 sediments made a better soil environment and harvested more crop yields excluding the influence of irrigation the average yields of wheat and maize were increased by 7 3 and 16 7 with 30 mm and 60 mm applied respectively the average yield of wheat and maize increased by 33 9 and 66 9 with 30 mm and 60 mm respectively this was consistent with previous studies that applied sediments increased production in addition the amounts of sediment we used were reasonable between the ranges of previous laboratory and field studies furthermore the 60 mm ha 1 treatments were better than the 30 mm ha 1 treatments so what happens if we continue to increase the amount of sediment hu et al 2022 and duo and hu 2018 studied filling the yellow river sediment to reclaim low lying areas of wastelands improving the fertility of cultivated land this showed crops could grow in thorough yellow river sediment soil but the yields were not high thus a threshold in sediments was applied to improve soil properties and crop yields in this study the results showed that applying sediment threshold exceeded 60 mm ha 1 we suggest that a larger amount of sediments 60 150 mm ha 1 should be used for finding the threshold in the future applying sediment is more like the fertilizer which is an accessorial effect on soil water and salt environment this also explained why the effect of applying sediments in the first year was better than in the last two years perhaps applying sediments every year would be a more appropriate choice nevertheless it is not clear whether it will bring other problems this question was the next step we planned to solve 4 2 effects of irrigation treatments on soil salinity leaching environmental factors such as geology meteorology geomorphology hydrogeology soil and plants all affect the process of soil salinization li 2020 among them rainfall and flood irrigation can greatly affect the distribution of soil water and salt thus flood irrigation is one of the most practical methods for improvement of saline soils in yrd xie et al 2011 liu et al 2005 studied full irrigation and controlled deficit irrigation scheduling strategies for wheat and maize the results showed that full irrigation and deficit irrigation schedulings were 414 mm wheat 343 mm maize 71 mm and 288 mm wheat 227 mm maize 61 mm respectively in this study we seted up 3 levels irrigation amount as 290 mm wheat 200 mm maize 90 mm 385 mm wheat 265 maize 120 and 480 mm wheat 330 maize 150 respectively the experimental setup was covered both full irrigation and deficit irrigation it was also below the irrigation quotas wheat 348 mm maize 135 mm which was given by quota for agricultural water of shandong province db37 t 3772 2019 in the three year experiment soil salinity residuals in 0 100 cm were all decreased by irrigation and sediment applied treatments the range of soil salinity loss was up to 63 9 81 0 t ha 1 the loss salinity had two ways deeper soil layers and taken away by crops in this stdy the w3s3 treatment s crop uptaked 8 3 t ha 1 this value was related to plant dry matter and yield the lowest yield w1s1 treatment only uptaked only 4 3 t ha 1 which was a half of w3s3 treatment however nearly 90 of the salt was leached into deeper layers this aspect showed that the adopted irrigation treatments could save water and leaching salt but the long term controlled irrigation has also left hidden dangers for salt outbreaks the use of water conservancy measures such as underground salt drainage can be combined with irrigation and sand application to achieve the best effect of saline alkali land improvement ondrasek and rengel 2021 zhou et al 2020a this study only roughly analyzed the salinity state by using the soil salinity balance and there may be some observation errors in the observation of the data in the future a large number of accurate observations are still needed to reveal the law of salinity distribution 4 3 effects of optimizing sediments application and irrigation treatments on grain yields and soil salinity the addition of sediment reduces soil salinity in two ways the first is to improve soil s physical and chemical properties and promote water infiltration the second is to inhibit evaporation and reduce salt accumulation on the surface layer here we are more concerned about whether applying sediment could replace irrigation to reduce soil salinity to save water resources in the yrd mao et al 2018 studied sediment 100 and 200 mg ha approximately equal to 6 5 and 13 mm ha 1 applying in the wheat field under regular irrigation leaching salt these results showed sediment application resulted in soil salinity below the threshold of wheat zhang et al 2019 explored the effect of saline alkali improvement by yellow river sediment applying with surface soil 0 20 cm in yrd this study also illustrated that the average desalination rate with 15 sediment applied was increased by 7 65 than that of the control no sediment applied treatment similarly zhou et al 2020a found that the soil salinity in the 30 cm soil layer was reduced by more than 90 after 20 days in the treatment with the sand addition ratio of 18 24 compared with the treatment without sand addition thus it is feasible to increase the efficiency of irrigation desalination by adding sediment and reducing the amount of irrigation in this study under irrigation and sediment the salinity leaching factor was up to 75 7 in w3s3 treatment the value was increased by 8 6 compared with the w1s1 treatment previous studies have shown that salinity leaching increases dramatically with higher irrigation levels letey et al 2011 this was consistent with the results of this experiment the effect of applying sediment was investigated by keeping the same amount of irrigation only in high irrigation treatments w3 with the increment of sediment from 30 to 60 mm ha 1 the values of salinity leaching factor were increased by 1 9 4 4 compared with no sediment applied in the deficit irrigation w1 the values of the salinity leaching factor in the application of sediment were even below no sediment applied we speculated that the desalination effect of sediment depends on the irrigation amount the greater the amount of irrigation the more enhanced the desalination effect of the application of sediment more irrigation enhanced the desalination effect of the application of sediment although irrigation still played a significant role in reducing soil salinity the appropriate amount of sediment applied could save water resources which were a shortage in this region the optimal amount of irrigated sediments should comprehensively consider grain yields and soil salinity in terms of grain yield irrigation and applying sediment could all increase grain yields water resources are the limiting factor in yrd and there is a lot of river sediment in areas with stricter water restrictions the amount of irrigation could be 385 mm and the amount of sediment could be 60 mm ha 1 w2s3 treatment in terms of salinity leaching the w2s3 treatment also effectively improved soil physical characteristics and increased the salinity leaching factor therefore considering influences of soil structure macroporosity crop yield and irrigation factors we recommended that the amount of sediment applied was 60 mm ha 1 conservatively 385 mm w2 was enough for crop growth and soil improvement if it would like to get the maximum yield and desalination effect 60 mm sediment application and 480 mm irrigation strategy was recommended 4 4 annual difference during the experimental period soil moisture and salinity were annually changed during the experimental period the salt was concentrated in autumn and spring a critical period for wheat emergence and yield formation it was leached into the deeper layer in the summer a crucial period for maize the soil salinity was more evident leaching in the first year of planting and the effect was weak in the later planting this may be caused by rainfall and irrigation the soil salinity leaching needed the bigger irrigation or precipitation per event in this study compared with maize the growth period of wheat is two times longer that of maize maize grew between june and october with relatively heavy rainfall during this period in 2018 2019 and 2020 the rainfall was 286 7 mm 277 3 mm and 292 7 mm respectively however the rainfall during the growing period of wheat is less than haft that of maize there were two critical growth periods in wheat the precipitation was 47 8 mm 20 8 mm and 27 4 mm in 2017 2019 during october to december respectively and the rainfall was 169 3 mm 59 1 mm and 83 7 mm in 2018 2020 during march to may respectively heavy rainfall in first year may have contributed to dramatic changes in salinity under the influence of soil water and salinity grain yields increased from 2017 to 2019 especially maize yields increased dramatically proper irrigation and gradual reduction of soil salinity are significant factors in yield increase soil salinity is critical for plants a suitable salt environment can promote the growth of plants shrivastava and kumar 2015 5 conclusions water resources shortage and soil salinization are two limiting factors for agricultural economic development in the yellow river delta this study illustrated that effects of applying sediment and irrigation on grain yields and soil salinity leaching in three year field experiment river sediment mixing saline soil enhanced salt leaching and improved soil texture leading to increment of macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity river sediment applying saline soil enhanced salinity leaching and improved soil macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity soil leaching rate was up to 75 7 under 60 mm ha 1 sediment application and 480 mm irrigation after three wheat maize rotation cultivation however considering grain yields soil salinity and water saving the amount of sediment applied was 60 mm ha 1 and the irrigation amount of 385 mm was recommended in the yellow river delta the mean yield of wheat and maize in sediment application and irrigation treatment was 18 3 t ha 1 in three year experiment which was significant bigger than the control applying river sediment in saline soil improved field productivity and provided an approach for sustainable management of dredged sediment and saving water resources in the yellow river delta declaration of

9152,irrigation and nitrogen application can not only increase wheat yield but also cause nitrogen loss and soil nitrate accumulation this study aimed to assess the effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the soil no3 n distribution and nitrogen absorption and utilization of winter wheat triticum aestivum l during the 2015 2020 growth season in the north china plain the experiments were designed in split plot arrangement with irrigation amount w0 no irrigation w1 60 mm irrigation at jointing and w2 60 mm irrigation at jointing and anthesis as the main plots and nitrogen application rate n0 0 n120 120 kg ha 1 and n240 240 kg ha 1 as the subplots the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 showed no significant difference in yield throughout the experimental period with the decrease in soil total nitrogen content the yield difference between the plants under n0 and those under n120 and n240 gradually increased throughout the experimental period compared with that of the plants under w2n240 the mean no3 n content of the plants under w2n120 in the 0 1 m and 1 2 m soil layers decreased by 17 4 and 19 2 respectively in 2018 2020 the no3 n concentration decreased with increasing soil depth and the no3 n concentration in each soil layer increased with increasing nitrogen application rate irrigation and nitrogen application increased nitrogen accumulation in vegetative organs at anthesis and nitrogen transport to grains compared with those of the plants under w2n240 the mean nitrogen uptake efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen fertilizer productivity and nitrogen harvest index of the plants under w2n120 increased by 91 3 2 6 95 5 and 1 9 respectively these results suggest that applying 120 kg ha 1 nitrogen and irrigating 60 mm at jointing and anthesis are the optimal measures for winter wheat in the north china plain keywords irrigation and nitrogen application winter wheat no3 n nitrogen absorption and utilization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the north china plain is a major production area of winter wheat triticum aestivum l in china with less cultivated land nbsc 2019 the annual rainfall in this area is 520 900 mm and the precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat is only 150 300 mm which is not enough to provide adequate water for wheat growth and development fang et al 2010 therefore the groundwater is used for farmland irrigation which leads to the continuous decline of groundwater level and increasing shortage of water resources zhong et al 2017 in addition sufficient irrigation or flood irrigation causes the leaching of soil nutrients sun et al 2018 nitrogen is a key limiting factor affecting winter wheat growth and development rational application of nitrogen can promote root development enhance soil water content and nitrogen absorption and increase grain yield jiang et al 2017 however excessive nitrogen application results in residual nitrogen accumulation or ammonia volatilization in the soil which not only reduces the yield increase effect of nitrogen fertilizer and soil hardening but also pollutes groundwater through nitrate leaching and other ways lu et al 2019 wang et al 2015a 2015b it also reduces nitrogen use efficiency nue xu et al 2020 and water absorption from deep soil chen et al 2018 therefore understanding the effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the soil no3 n utilization of and nitrogen absorption transport and distribution in winter wheat before and after anthesis is important for sustainable wheat production nitrogen accumulation distribution and transport in vegetative organs of winter wheat are closely related to grain yield and quality pask et al 2012 soon et al 2008 found that a moderate amount of nitrogen application improves the uptake of nitrogen by wheat and the transport of nitrogen to the grain before and after anthesis excessive nitrogen application can delay wheat greening and considerable reduce grain yield and nue cui et al 2013 appropriate nitrogen application can increase the vertical distribution gradient of nitrogen between leaves in winter wheat canopy improve the transport amount and contribution rate of nitrogen to grains and enhance nue and grain quality wang et al 2012 liang et al 2017 found that high nitrogen conditions reduce the amounts of assimilates and nitrogen transported to grains because of the material consumption required for the vigorous growth of vegetative organs such as stems and leaves jiang et al 2017 found that high nitrogen application rates promote wheat growth and increase shoot dry matter weight and nitrogen content but reduce nitrogen absorption rate when the absorption threshold is exceeded a large amount of no3 n accumulates in the soil duan et al 2019 in the intensive production area of wheat in the north china plain the amount of nitrogen is generally more than 270 kg ha 1 which is considered excessive in many studies cui et al 2013 reported that the optimal rate for wheat plant nitrogen uptake in the north china plain is 128 kg ha 1 and zhang et al 2017 found that the optimal nitrogen rate for a high yield ranges from 180 to 240 kg ha 1 thus achieving high wheat yield under appropriate nitrogen reduction is important appropriate irrigation can promote the absorption and utilization efficiencies of nitrogen fertilizers li et al 2019 the nitrogen uptake amount in wheat plants increases by 15 kg ha 1 when the irrigation amount is doubled rossella et al 2010 nitrogen uptake significantly increases before and after anthesis with increasing irrigation amount and frequency meng et al 2016 the leaching amount of no3 n also increases gheysari et al 2009 considering these problems several studies assessed different irrigation systems and found that deficit irrigation is an effective method liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 this method has been used to determine the irrigation pattern of winter wheat in the north china plain 60 75 mm irrigation at jointing and anthesis during the growth season of winter wheat li et al 2010 nevertheless groundwater overuse and other problems still exist sun et al 2015 therefore whether further reducing the irrigation amount will increase yield should be explored in the present study we aimed to 1 explore the distribution and accumulation characteristics of soil no3 n under different irrigation amounts and nitrogen application rates and 2 evaluate the nitrogen absorption and utilization and crop yield of wheat under deficit irrigation and nitrogen application in the north china plain this study provides an experimental basis for improving the nitrogen absorption and utilization efficiencies and balancing the high efficiency and yield of wheat in the intensive wheat production area of the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a long term field experiment was conducted at the baogaofeng experimental station of hebei agricultural university in 2015 2020 li et al 2021 the experimental station was established in xinji 37 48 18 n 115 18 40 e with an average elevation of 40 m the rotating of winter wheat and summer maize is implemented as the typical cropping system in the north china plain the average annual temperature and precipitation in this area are 13 c and 466 4 mm respectively the region has a typical semi arid monsoon climate and 70 of the annual precipitation occurs from july to september a weather station for collecting meteorological data was built nearby the monthly total rainfall and mean monthly air temperature during the growth period are shown in fig 1 and table s1 the soil in the experimental station was classified as an aquic inceptisol with a sandy loam texture according to the u s soil taxonomy the topsoil 0 20 cm chemical parameters at the beginning of the experiment had a ph of 7 86 and a bulk density of 1 20 g cm 3 levels of soil organic matter total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium were 18 70 g kg 1 0 60 g kg 1 37 05 mg kg 1 and 165 74 mg kg 1 respectively li et al 2021 2 2 experimental design the experiment was designed in split plot arrangement with irrigation amount w0 no irrigation w1 60 mm irrigation at jointing and w2 60 mm irrigation at jointing and anthesis as the main plots and nitrogen application rate n0 0 n120 120 kg ha 1 and n240 240 kg ha 1 as the subplots li et al 2021 irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate are shown in table 1 the local recommended irrigation method is to irrigate 60 75 mm at jointing and anthesis and apply a nitrogen fertilizer at a rate of 240 270 kg ha 1 we halved the irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate and then compared the resulting yield and nitrogen absorption and utilization efficiencies of winter wheat under these reduced conditions with those of winter wheat under the conditions recommended by local authorities to verify the feasibility of reduced irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate the main plots of irrigation amount were 45 17 m in size and the subplots of nitrogen application rate were 15 17 m in size in addition a buffer zone of 1 m was reserved between the plots to eliminate the error caused by water flow li et al 2021 nine treatments were composed of three main plots and three subplots and were replicated three times the water meter was used to accurately control the irrigation amount and the groundwater was used for flood irrigation the experimental field was leveled before sowing in each growth season to ensure uniform irrigation the winter wheat jimai 585 a late maturing semi winter variety seeds were sown at a rate of 150 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 15 cm in growth seasons the sowing dates were october 15 2015 october 15 2016 october 24 2017 october 9 2018 and october 14 2019 and the maturity dates were june 4 2016 june 6 2017 june 5 2018 june 7 2019 and june 5 2020 comminuted maize straw was plowed into soil and the same amount of chemical fertilizer 135 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 k2o was applied before planting every year meanwhile 50 of the total nitrogen urea ch4n2o application amount of w1 and w2 treatment was applied before sowing and the other 50 was applied at jointing since no irrigation during the whole growth period of wheat all nitrogen fertilizer of w0 treatment was applied before rotary tilling pesticides and herbicides were selected according to the actual situation in the field to keep wheat away from pests diseases and weeds 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 water storage and total nitrogen of soil soil samples were collected by drilling holes in the 0 200 cm soil layers at maturity and the soil at every 20 cm depth was stored in an aluminum round sample box wang et al 2015a 2015b soil samples were sieved to remove stones weeds and other debris and dried at 105 c for 48 h to a constant weight soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method soil water storage sws was calculated as follows 1 sws mm soil water content soil bulk density soil depth 10 etc was calculated as follows peng et al 2020 2 etc i p swd r cr d where etc is the seasonal crop evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation mm swd is the sws mm at the time of sowing minus that at maturity for the 0 200 cm depth r is the surface runoff mm cr is the capillary rise to the root zone and d is the drainage from the root zone r was considered negligible because it was blocked by boundary dikes around each plot the groundwater table is more than 4 m below the ground surface thus cr and d were also considered negligible fang et al 2018 soil total nitrogen in 0 20 cm at maturity was analyzed using the semi kjeldahl method 2 3 2 soil no3 n content soil samples were collected by drilling holes in the 0 200 cm soil layers at sowing jointing anthesis and maturity and the soil at every 20 cm depth was stored in an aluminum round sample box guo et al 2014 after removing crop roots the soil samples were mixed immediately placed into centrifuge tubes and then stored at 20 c the frozen soil samples were taken back to the laboratory for thawing and mixing and then the no3 n contents were determined after that 25 ml 0 01 mol l 1 cacl2 solution was added to 2 5 g of mixed soil sample shaken for 0 5 h and then filtered spectrophotometer was used to determine the no3 n contents in soil extracts then the no3 n contents of dry soil samples were calculated according to the soil water contents to avoid potential errors caused by soil moisture sublimation wang et al 2015a 2015b 2 3 3 nitrogen content of plants two adjacent rows with a length of 100 cm were selected as the sampling area in the plots the aboveground parts of wheat in the sampling area were cut off at anthesis and maturity respectively the plant samples were divided into different organs at anthesis stem sheath leaf and spike and maturity stem sheath leaf rachis glume and grain respectively the organs were dried to constant weight at 75 c the nitrogen concentration of the dried samples were determined using the micro kjeldahl method and their nitrogen accumulation and translocation amounts were calculated as follows wang et al 2015a 2015b 3 nitrogen accumulation amount in each organ naao kg ha 1

version 19 0 spss chicago illinois usa 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the overall trend of monthly average temperature during the five growth seasons was consistent and no extreme weather occurred fig 1 the rainfall amounts during the five growth seasons fluctuated greatly the annual precipitation in july august and september accounted for approximately 70 of the total amount table s1 which also provided water supply for winter wheat sowing less precipitation occurred during the wheat growth season and significant precipitation occurred after jointing the precipitation in most months during the growth season was less than 20 mm the precipitation in june only slightly affected winter wheat because this crop generally needs less water at the end of its growth period low rainfall emphasizes the importance of irrigation and effective use of irrigation water to stabilize and increase yield the precipitation in october 2017 2018 reached 109 mm which delayed sowing in addition the precipitation amounts in april and may 2018 were 98 6 and 58 2 mm respectively extreme precipitation significantly affected the yields in 2017 2018 but no significant difference in yield was found between the plants under w2 and w1 fig 3 the impact of extreme rainfall on winter wheat yield indicates the importance of adjusting the irrigation strategy 3 2 soil total nitrogen etc and grain yield in 2015 2020 the soil total nitrogen content 0 20 cm at maturity and etc are shown in fig 2 and table s2 in 2019 2020 the soil total nitrogen of the plants under n0 decreased by 24 94 compared with that in 2015 2016 the plants under n1 and n2 showed no significant changes during the five growth seasons after harvest the wheat grains absorbed a large amount of nitrogen which decreased the soil total nitrogen content etc showed no significant increase or decrease but those under w0 and w2 fluctuated these results suggest that etc is closely related to the annual grain yield fig 4 irrigation amount w nitrogen application rate n and their interaction w n significantly affected the grain yields during the five growth seasons except during 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 table s3 in each growth season irrigation can significantly increase the yield compared with w0 w1 and w2 increased the grain yields by 1 2 89 2 and 10 127 1 respectively fig 3 the difference in grain yield of the plants under various nitrogen treatments increased with the growth period compared with n0 n1 and n2 increased the grain yield by 2 9 22 1 and 9 6 13 5 respectively in 2015 2016 however by 2019 2020 these values had reached 121 4 150 7 and 143 8 164 1 respectively the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 showed higher grain yields than those under the other treatments during the five growth seasons as shown in fig 4 grain yield and soil total nitrogen content were significantly p 0 01 correlated in the last four growth seasons and this correlation increased with the growth period the r2 value between grain yield and soil total nitrogen was 0 38 in 2018 2019 and 0 52 in 2019 2020 indicating that the high nitrogen application rate increased the grain yield and soil total nitrogen content grain yield was significantly p 0 01 correlated with etc with a high r2 in each growth season indicating that the amount of water consumed of winter wheat increased with increasing yield in addition the yield difference of the plants under different nitrogen application treatments was significantly higher in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 than in the earlier growth periods therefore we explored the nitrogen absorption and utilization of winter wheat and the distribution of no3 n in soil during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 3 3 no3 n concentration in the 0 200 cm soil layer during 2015 2020 the soil no3 n concentrations under different treatments varied between 1 24 and 28 24 mg kg 1 in the 0 200 cm soil layer at maturity during 2015 2020 fig 5 the no3 n concentration increased with increasing nitrogen application rate and decreased with increasing soil depth compared with the no3 n concentration in the deep soil layer of the plants under n0 that in the deep soil layer of the plants under n240 increased with the growth period and irrigation played a role in this phenomenon the no3 n concentration in the upper soil layer of the plants under n0 significantly decreased and the concentration in 2020 was only 58 of that in 2016 with increasing irrigation amount the no3 n concentration decreased in the 0 120 cm soil layer and increased in the 140 200 cm soil layer this result shows that irrigation promoted the movement of nitrate nitrogen to the deep soil layer and that nitrogen application increased the total nitrate nitrogen content of soil thus the no3 n concentrations in the deep and upper soil layers of the plants remained higher under w2n240 than under w2n0 in the 2015 2016 growth season the no3 n concentration of each soil layer of the plants was 210 higher under w2n240 than under w0n0 which reached 371 at maturity in 2020 this result also revealed that the nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 exceeded the absorption of wheat bringing excessive no3 n to the soil 3 4 no3 n content in the 0 100 and 100 200 cm soil layers during 2018 2020 the soil no3 n contents varied between 37 50 and 443 84 kg ha 1 in the 0 100 cm layer and 31 53 222 11 kg ha 1 in the 100 200 cm layer during two growth seasons in 2018 2020 fig 6 the no3 n contents in the 0 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers enhanced with increasing nitrogen application rate with the growth of wheat the no3 n content generally decreased under different treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the no3 n contents in the 0 100 cm soil layer under n240 decreased by 33 5 and 43 0 respectively at maturity compared with those at sowing although the soil no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil layer under n240 significantly decreased it still exceeded 200 kg ha 1 at maturity in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the soil no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer was generally lower than that in the 0 100 cm soil layer but it presented the same trend as that in the 0 100 cm soil layer the results showed that wheat absorbed and utilized no3 n in the growth process and that the large amount of no3 n promoted the nitrogen absorption of wheat but also caused nitrogen accumulation in the soil 3 5 nitrogen distribution in different organs of winter wheat in 2018 2020 as shown in table 2 w n and w n significantly affected the nitrogen distribution in various organs in both growth seasons irrigation and nitrogen application increased nitrogen accumulation in organs and plants the nitrogen accumulation in each organ and plant at anthesis and maturity generally increased with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate in 2018 2019 during 2019 2020 the difference in nitrogen accumulation between the plants under n240 and n120 decreased and the grain nitrogen accumulation of the plants under w2n240 was only 0 22 higher than that of the plants under w2n120 even at anthesis the nitrogen accumulation in the stems sheath and spikes of the plants was higher under w2n120 than under w2n240 therefore the nitrogen accumulation in the plants under w2n120 was higher than that in the plants under w2n240 at anthesis at maturity the nitrogen accumulation in the plants under w2n240 was only 1 75 higher than that in the plants under w2n120 the above results showed that the long term effect of w2n240 on soil affected the nitrogen transport of wheat and this effect was significant in 2020 the nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 did not increase nitrogen uptake and transport and resulted in the same amount of nitrogen accumulation in the grains as the nitrogen application rate of 120 kg ha 1 3 6 nitrogen uptake and translocation in 2018 2020 as shown in table 3 w n and w n significantly affected the assimilation and translocation to grains of nitrogen accumulated in both growth seasons but the effects of w on prntr in 2018 2019 and w n on ponac in 2019 2020 were not significant the leaves and stems sheath were the main supply organs of grain nitrogen the prntas of various organs in both growth seasons enhanced with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate however the stems sheath and spikes of the plants under w2n120 had higher prntas than those of the plants under w2n240 in 2019 2020 thus the prntas prntrs and prntcs of the plants under w2n120 were higher than those of the plants under w2n240 hence twice irrigation and nitrogen application of 240 kg ha 1 in 2019 2020 inhibited nitrogen transport before anthesis the prntr did not considerably change with increasing irrigation amount it generally decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate but the prntrs of the plants under w1n120 were higher than those of the plants under w1n0 and w1n240 this result revealed that the residual nitrogen amount in the vegetative organs increased with the increase of nitrogen application in addition the prntcs of the plants significantly increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and irrigation amount the ponaas of the plants under w1n0 and w1n120 were higher than those of the plants under w1n240 in 2018 2019 but the ponaas of the plants under n120 and n240 were significantly higher than those of the plants under n0 in both growth seasons the ponac decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate however the ponacs of the plants under w0 in 2018 2019 and w2 in 2019 2020 can be ranked as follows n240 n0 n120 the plants under w2n240 had the highest ponaa in 2019 2020 however no difference in grain nitrogen accumulation was found between the plants under w2n240 and w2n120 because of the decrease in prnta table 2 3 7 yield components in 2018 2020 w n and w n significantly affected the spike number and grain number per spike in both growth seasons table 4 but the effect of irrigation amount on grain number per spike in 2018 2019 was not significant in addition the 1000 grain weight was significantly affected by irrigation amount but not by nitrogen application rate the grain numbers per spike of the plants under w1 and w2 were higher than those of the plants under w0 in 2019 2020 but not in 2018 2019 the grain numbers per spike of the plants under n120 and n240 were higher than those of the plants under n0 during both growth seasons the spike number and grain yield increased with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate during both growth seasons the plants under w2n240 had the highest spike number but the plants under w2n120 had the highest grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight in 2019 2020 which caused the plants under w2n120 to have higher yields than those under w2n240 fig 3 3 8 gnc nupe nue nfp and nhi in 2018 2020 w n and w n significantly affected most nitrogen indices in both growth seasons table 5 however the effects of w n on gnc in 2018 2019 and on nhi in 2019 2020 were not significant the nupes nues nfps and nhis of the plants decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate the gncs of the plants under n120 and n240 were significantly higher than those of the plants under n0 with increasing irrigation amount the gncs nupes and nfps of the plants increased but their nues and nhis decreased analysis of the nitrogen indices of the plants under w2n240 and w2n120 during the two growth seasons showed that the plants under w2n120 achieved the highest values of all indices except for gnc which was highest in the plants under w2n240 in 2019 2020 4 discussion water and nitrogen are essential to improve crop yield du et al 2021 the properties of surface soil are vulnerable to the impacts of tillage irrigation fertilization and other measures pirmoradian et al 2005 this finding explains why the soil total nitrogen contents of the mature plants under different nitrogen application rates significantly changed during the first growth season fig 2 long term application of a large amount of urea increases soil total nitrogen content jones et al 2009 however the soil total nitrogen contents of the plants under n240 and n120 did not significantly increase during the five growth seasons in the present study this result indicated that the annual nitrogen cycle in the soil was stable for a short time that is the difference between the amounts of nitrogen input and output was the same during the five growth seasons however the soil total nitrogen contents and grain yields of the plants under n0 significantly decreased because of the consumption of wheat growth and absence of nitrogen supplement fig 3 compared with the low nitrogen application rate the high nitrogen application rate increased the wheat yield high yield also promoted nitrogen uptake and soil nitrogen content that is the nitrogen absorbed by wheat and the residual nitrogen in soil increased simultaneously this is not an antagonistic process but a process of common increase therefore this result explains why the correlation between soil total nitrogen content and yield gradually increased fig 4 the etc in the different growth seasons fluctuated slightly and did not significantly change during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growth seasons the grain yields of the plants under n0 decreased significantly which caused the demand for etc to sharply decrease and lengthened the box plot a significant positive correlation was found between yield and etc however this correlation was significantly lower during 2017 2018 than during the other growth seasons the main reason is that the yield difference between different treatments decreased because of three abnormal rainfall events 109 0 mm october 2017 98 6 mm april 2018 and 55 2 mm may 2018 in 2017 2018 table s1 some studies showed that the grain yield would increase slowly after reaching a certain value inflection point with increasing etc rathor et al 2017 si et al 2020 in other words the water production efficiency wp would decrease when etc increases to a certain value however in the present study the grain yield showed a linear relationship with etc and its growth rate did not slow down this result proved that under the current situation the grain yield has the potential to increase before the decline of wp irrigation and nitrogen application exerted different effects on grain yield during the five growth seasons in the present study in 2015 2016 the difference in grain yield between plants under various irrigation treatments was significant but the difference in grain yield between plants under various nitrogen application treatments was not significant fig 3 the main reason is that the high nitrogen residue local traditional nitrogen application rate 240 270 kg ha 1 in soil can still meet the growth needs of wheat for a short time in addition water can significantly affect wheat yield for a short time because of its importance in growth and development soil fertility can compensate for the lack of nitrogen fertilizer in the short term and irrigation can alleviate the negative impact of the lack of nitrogen fertilizer in a certain range he et al 2007 as the growth period was prolonged insufficient nitrogen application decreased soil fertility and crop yield by the fourth growth season the grain yield of n0 significantly decreased and was not affected by irrigation indicating that the soil nitrogen content significantly decreased to levels that are difficult for wheat to absorb the highest yield was obtained in the plants under w2n240 and w2n120 during the five growth seasons as for the optimal irrigation and nitrogen combination we will analyze it with nue in the last chapter of this section the no3 n concentration in each soil layer of the plants under n120 was basically lower than that of the plants under n240 at maturity fig 5 under the influence of urea fertilization the no3 n concentration of different nitrogen fertilization treatments in shallow soil varies greatly because this layer is easily disturbed pirmoradian et al 2005 this experiment started in 2015 but in 2016 the no3 n concentration in the shallow soil of mature wheat without nitrogen application decreased to below 12 mg kg 1 indicating that urea is the main source of no3 n the mobility of no3 n was also one of the reasons for its fast reduction due to the water solubility of nitrate nitrogen irrigation promotes its movement to deep soil hondebrink et al 2017 li et al 2015 liu et al 2019b wheat roots mainly absorb no3 n from 0 to 100 cm soil depth zhang et al 2009 thus the no3 n content from the 0 100 cm soil layer significantly decreased during the growth season fig 6 the no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer was mainly lost through leaching the no3 n concentration of the plants under n0 continued to decline because of the lack of additional supplement and absorption the shallow soil of the plants under w2n0 decreased more significantly under the drive of irrigation however w2n0 also decreased no3 n accumulation in the deep soil because of the low total nitrogen by contrast w2n240 maintained the high no3 n concentration in each soil layer and its accumulation in the deep soil under irrigation zhang et al 2018 obviously the nitrogen application amount of 240 kg ha 1 exceeds the absorption amount of wheat which agrees with the results of most studies fang et al 2006 liu et al 2019a lu et al 2019 a study in canada showed that the soil residual no3 n is low when the nitrogen application rate is less than 112 kg ha 1 but significantly increases when the nitrogen application rate exceeds 168 kg ha 1 malhi et al 2003 this finding is consistent with our results that the no3 n concentration in each soil layer under n120 was significantly lower than that in each soil layer under n240 moreover n120 achieved considerable grain yield the grain yields of the plants under w2n120 were higher than those of the plants under w2n240 during 2019 2020 consistent with the findings by hao et al 2014 these results suggest that w2n120 is obviously an ideal farming regimen due to weather the amount of nitrogen accumulation at anthesis was largest in the leaves during 2018 2019 and in the stems sheath during 2019 2020 table 2 under drought conditions appropriate water supplement can promote the accumulation of nitrogen in the leaves sinclair et al 2000 from jointing to anthesis during 2018 2019 the precipitation reached 38 2 mm which is much higher than 14 2 mm in 2019 2020 thus the nitrogen accumulation in the leaves during 2018 2019 was higher than that in the stems sheath rainfall is accompanied by overcast days the light from jointing to anthesis in 2018 2019 was significantly lower than that in 2019 2020 the rainy and low light at jointing contribute to the dry matter accumulation of the leaves allowing them to absorb more nitrogen spyridon et al 2012 wheat grain nitrogen has two major sources the translocation from prnta and ponaa in most treatments prnta was higher than ponaa which was consistent with the results of palta et al 2011 irrigation and nitrogen application increased prnta although the ponaas of the plants fluctuated with increasing irrigation and nitrogen application the nitrogen accumulation in the grains generally increased this result indicates the importance of using nitrogen in vegetative organs and the dominant position of prnta in grain nitrogen in grain crops the transport of nitrogen from vegetative organs can buffer the impact of adverse climatic conditions during grain filling tahir and nakata 2005 the highest prnta in 2018 2019 was obtained under w2n240 whereas that in 2019 2020 was obtained under w2n120 as a result the nitrogen accumulation of grains showed no difference between the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 in 2019 2020 and the nitrogen accumulation of the plants under w2n240 was only 6 higher than that of the plants under w2n120 in 2018 2019 we speculate that the high nitrogen accumulation in soil limited the nitrogen absorption of the plants under w2n240 thus the prntas of the plants under w2n240 did not significantly increase compared with those of the plants under w2n120 hébert et al 2001 another reason was the decrease in prntr caused by excessive residual nitrogen in the vegetative organs the plants under w2n240 had the lowest prntr in both growth seasons although some studies have shown that excessive irrigation reduces nitrogen transport to grains plaut et al 2004 xu et al 2005 this phenomenon did not occur in this study this result suggests that the current irrigation regime w2 is conducive to the absorption of nitrogen in grains and may not maximize the potential of wheat water and nitrogen are the most important constraints to achieving high crop yields mueller et al 2012 given the low precipitation in the experimental area of the present study sufficient irrigation combined with increased nitrogen fertilizer can significantly improve spike number and grain number per spike the grain numbers per spike of the plants under n120 and n240 were significantly higher than those of the plants under n0 but no significant difference was observed between n120 and n240 table 4 the increase in nitrogen application rate leads to wheat overproduction which is not conducive to spike development thus limiting the increase in grain number per spike sufficient water supply at jointing can promote the growth of vegetative organs and increase grain number per spike meng et al 2016 therefore in treatments with nitrogen application the grain numbers per spike of the plants under w1 and w2 were significantly higher than those of the plants under w0 grain filling is the key stage of grain weight formation shi et al 2016 thus irrigation at anthesis can considerably affect grain weight which may explain why the 1000 grain weights of the plants under w2 were higher than those of the plants under w1 optimized irrigation can enhance the nitrogen absorption of wheat maximize fertilizer efficiency improve nitrogen availability and increase wheat yield garnett et al 2009 excessive irrigation reduces the utilization rate of nitrogen lu et al 2019 in the present study nfp increased with increasing irrigation in 2018 2020 which may be due to the low precipitation amounts of 75 7 and 139 9 mm table 5 these results indicate that w2 has not reached the excessive level of irrigation van sanford and mackown 1987 found that the nhi ranges from 0 7 to 0 8 which is consistent with the present results the decrease in nhi is accompanied by the simultaneous occurrence of nupe nue and nfp with increasing nitrogen application the lower nupe indicated the loss of nitrogen some of which accumulated in the deep soil in the form of nitrate nitrogen with the decrease in nupe the content of soil no3 n increased fig 6 therefore the yield nitrogen absorption and utilization efficiencies should be considered when establishing a tillage regime przulj and momcilovic 2001 found that a rate of 240 kg ha 1 of nitrogen results in the maximum gnc and decreases the nfp to 27 7 kg kg 1 which is 60 lower than 70 0 kg kg 1 when the application rate of nitrogen is 80 kg ha 1 the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 had higher gncs but the nupe nue nfp and nhi of the plants under w2n120 were significantly higher than those of the plants under w2n240 in the present study in addition the yields of the plants under w2n120 were slightly higher than those of the plants under w2n240 in 2019 2020 these results indicate that w2n120 is more reasonable than other treatments to increase the wheat production in the north china plain with low precipitation this study explored the rationality of the farming regime for reducing water and nitrogen the results of this 5 year experiment confirmed that w2n120 is more in line with local conditions but some improvements are still needed twice irrigation had not optimized the wp nfp and prnta however the high irrigation amount increased the accumulation of no3 n in the deep soil thus various factors should be considered and the irrigation schedule should be reasonably adjusted although n120 performed better than n240 in nitrate nitrogen accumulation and nue the grain yields of the plants under n120 were still far from the local high yield standard of 9000 kg ha 1 thus a more appropriate amount of nitrogen between 120 and 240 kg ha 1 warrants further exploration 5 conclusion in the short term 2015 2016 first growth season of experiment the effect of deficit irrigation on wheat grain yield was greater than that of deficit nitrogen application due to the nitrogen absorption of wheat the soil without nitrogen application gradually lost its support for the construction of grain yield the no3 n concentration in each soil layer significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application rate when the irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate were increased the nitrogen accumulation amount in grains prnta and gnc increased significantly but the nupe nue nfp and nhi significantly decreased moreover the yield difference between the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 was not significant within 5 years therefore the combination of applying 120 kg ha 1 nitrogen and irrigating 60 mm at jointing and anthesis was the optimal regimen to increase the grain yield of winter wheat in the north china plain with low precipitation the shortcomings of this measure need to be overcome in future

9152,irrigation and nitrogen application can not only increase wheat yield but also cause nitrogen loss and soil nitrate accumulation this study aimed to assess the effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the soil no3 n distribution and nitrogen absorption and utilization of winter wheat triticum aestivum l during the 2015 2020 growth season in the north china plain the experiments were designed in split plot arrangement with irrigation amount w0 no irrigation w1 60 mm irrigation at jointing and w2 60 mm irrigation at jointing and anthesis as the main plots and nitrogen application rate n0 0 n120 120 kg ha 1 and n240 240 kg ha 1 as the subplots the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 showed no significant difference in yield throughout the experimental period with the decrease in soil total nitrogen content the yield difference between the plants under n0 and those under n120 and n240 gradually increased throughout the experimental period compared with that of the plants under w2n240 the mean no3 n content of the plants under w2n120 in the 0 1 m and 1 2 m soil layers decreased by 17 4 and 19 2 respectively in 2018 2020 the no3 n concentration decreased with increasing soil depth and the no3 n concentration in each soil layer increased with increasing nitrogen application rate irrigation and nitrogen application increased nitrogen accumulation in vegetative organs at anthesis and nitrogen transport to grains compared with those of the plants under w2n240 the mean nitrogen uptake efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen fertilizer productivity and nitrogen harvest index of the plants under w2n120 increased by 91 3 2 6 95 5 and 1 9 respectively these results suggest that applying 120 kg ha 1 nitrogen and irrigating 60 mm at jointing and anthesis are the optimal measures for winter wheat in the north china plain keywords irrigation and nitrogen application winter wheat no3 n nitrogen absorption and utilization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the north china plain is a major production area of winter wheat triticum aestivum l in china with less cultivated land nbsc 2019 the annual rainfall in this area is 520 900 mm and the precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat is only 150 300 mm which is not enough to provide adequate water for wheat growth and development fang et al 2010 therefore the groundwater is used for farmland irrigation which leads to the continuous decline of groundwater level and increasing shortage of water resources zhong et al 2017 in addition sufficient irrigation or flood irrigation causes the leaching of soil nutrients sun et al 2018 nitrogen is a key limiting factor affecting winter wheat growth and development rational application of nitrogen can promote root development enhance soil water content and nitrogen absorption and increase grain yield jiang et al 2017 however excessive nitrogen application results in residual nitrogen accumulation or ammonia volatilization in the soil which not only reduces the yield increase effect of nitrogen fertilizer and soil hardening but also pollutes groundwater through nitrate leaching and other ways lu et al 2019 wang et al 2015a 2015b it also reduces nitrogen use efficiency nue xu et al 2020 and water absorption from deep soil chen et al 2018 therefore understanding the effects of irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the soil no3 n utilization of and nitrogen absorption transport and distribution in winter wheat before and after anthesis is important for sustainable wheat production nitrogen accumulation distribution and transport in vegetative organs of winter wheat are closely related to grain yield and quality pask et al 2012 soon et al 2008 found that a moderate amount of nitrogen application improves the uptake of nitrogen by wheat and the transport of nitrogen to the grain before and after anthesis excessive nitrogen application can delay wheat greening and considerable reduce grain yield and nue cui et al 2013 appropriate nitrogen application can increase the vertical distribution gradient of nitrogen between leaves in winter wheat canopy improve the transport amount and contribution rate of nitrogen to grains and enhance nue and grain quality wang et al 2012 liang et al 2017 found that high nitrogen conditions reduce the amounts of assimilates and nitrogen transported to grains because of the material consumption required for the vigorous growth of vegetative organs such as stems and leaves jiang et al 2017 found that high nitrogen application rates promote wheat growth and increase shoot dry matter weight and nitrogen content but reduce nitrogen absorption rate when the absorption threshold is exceeded a large amount of no3 n accumulates in the soil duan et al 2019 in the intensive production area of wheat in the north china plain the amount of nitrogen is generally more than 270 kg ha 1 which is considered excessive in many studies cui et al 2013 reported that the optimal rate for wheat plant nitrogen uptake in the north china plain is 128 kg ha 1 and zhang et al 2017 found that the optimal nitrogen rate for a high yield ranges from 180 to 240 kg ha 1 thus achieving high wheat yield under appropriate nitrogen reduction is important appropriate irrigation can promote the absorption and utilization efficiencies of nitrogen fertilizers li et al 2019 the nitrogen uptake amount in wheat plants increases by 15 kg ha 1 when the irrigation amount is doubled rossella et al 2010 nitrogen uptake significantly increases before and after anthesis with increasing irrigation amount and frequency meng et al 2016 the leaching amount of no3 n also increases gheysari et al 2009 considering these problems several studies assessed different irrigation systems and found that deficit irrigation is an effective method liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 this method has been used to determine the irrigation pattern of winter wheat in the north china plain 60 75 mm irrigation at jointing and anthesis during the growth season of winter wheat li et al 2010 nevertheless groundwater overuse and other problems still exist sun et al 2015 therefore whether further reducing the irrigation amount will increase yield should be explored in the present study we aimed to 1 explore the distribution and accumulation characteristics of soil no3 n under different irrigation amounts and nitrogen application rates and 2 evaluate the nitrogen absorption and utilization and crop yield of wheat under deficit irrigation and nitrogen application in the north china plain this study provides an experimental basis for improving the nitrogen absorption and utilization efficiencies and balancing the high efficiency and yield of wheat in the intensive wheat production area of the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a long term field experiment was conducted at the baogaofeng experimental station of hebei agricultural university in 2015 2020 li et al 2021 the experimental station was established in xinji 37 48 18 n 115 18 40 e with an average elevation of 40 m the rotating of winter wheat and summer maize is implemented as the typical cropping system in the north china plain the average annual temperature and precipitation in this area are 13 c and 466 4 mm respectively the region has a typical semi arid monsoon climate and 70 of the annual precipitation occurs from july to september a weather station for collecting meteorological data was built nearby the monthly total rainfall and mean monthly air temperature during the growth period are shown in fig 1 and table s1 the soil in the experimental station was classified as an aquic inceptisol with a sandy loam texture according to the u s soil taxonomy the topsoil 0 20 cm chemical parameters at the beginning of the experiment had a ph of 7 86 and a bulk density of 1 20 g cm 3 levels of soil organic matter total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium were 18 70 g kg 1 0 60 g kg 1 37 05 mg kg 1 and 165 74 mg kg 1 respectively li et al 2021 2 2 experimental design the experiment was designed in split plot arrangement with irrigation amount w0 no irrigation w1 60 mm irrigation at jointing and w2 60 mm irrigation at jointing and anthesis as the main plots and nitrogen application rate n0 0 n120 120 kg ha 1 and n240 240 kg ha 1 as the subplots li et al 2021 irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate are shown in table 1 the local recommended irrigation method is to irrigate 60 75 mm at jointing and anthesis and apply a nitrogen fertilizer at a rate of 240 270 kg ha 1 we halved the irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate and then compared the resulting yield and nitrogen absorption and utilization efficiencies of winter wheat under these reduced conditions with those of winter wheat under the conditions recommended by local authorities to verify the feasibility of reduced irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate the main plots of irrigation amount were 45 17 m in size and the subplots of nitrogen application rate were 15 17 m in size in addition a buffer zone of 1 m was reserved between the plots to eliminate the error caused by water flow li et al 2021 nine treatments were composed of three main plots and three subplots and were replicated three times the water meter was used to accurately control the irrigation amount and the groundwater was used for flood irrigation the experimental field was leveled before sowing in each growth season to ensure uniform irrigation the winter wheat jimai 585 a late maturing semi winter variety seeds were sown at a rate of 150 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 15 cm in growth seasons the sowing dates were october 15 2015 october 15 2016 october 24 2017 october 9 2018 and october 14 2019 and the maturity dates were june 4 2016 june 6 2017 june 5 2018 june 7 2019 and june 5 2020 comminuted maize straw was plowed into soil and the same amount of chemical fertilizer 135 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 k2o was applied before planting every year meanwhile 50 of the total nitrogen urea ch4n2o application amount of w1 and w2 treatment was applied before sowing and the other 50 was applied at jointing since no irrigation during the whole growth period of wheat all nitrogen fertilizer of w0 treatment was applied before rotary tilling pesticides and herbicides were selected according to the actual situation in the field to keep wheat away from pests diseases and weeds 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 water storage and total nitrogen of soil soil samples were collected by drilling holes in the 0 200 cm soil layers at maturity and the soil at every 20 cm depth was stored in an aluminum round sample box wang et al 2015a 2015b soil samples were sieved to remove stones weeds and other debris and dried at 105 c for 48 h to a constant weight soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method soil water storage sws was calculated as follows 1 sws mm soil water content soil bulk density soil depth 10 etc was calculated as follows peng et al 2020 2 etc i p swd r cr d where etc is the seasonal crop evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation mm swd is the sws mm at the time of sowing minus that at maturity for the 0 200 cm depth r is the surface runoff mm cr is the capillary rise to the root zone and d is the drainage from the root zone r was considered negligible because it was blocked by boundary dikes around each plot the groundwater table is more than 4 m below the ground surface thus cr and d were also considered negligible fang et al 2018 soil total nitrogen in 0 20 cm at maturity was analyzed using the semi kjeldahl method 2 3 2 soil no3 n content soil samples were collected by drilling holes in the 0 200 cm soil layers at sowing jointing anthesis and maturity and the soil at every 20 cm depth was stored in an aluminum round sample box guo et al 2014 after removing crop roots the soil samples were mixed immediately placed into centrifuge tubes and then stored at 20 c the frozen soil samples were taken back to the laboratory for thawing and mixing and then the no3 n contents were determined after that 25 ml 0 01 mol l 1 cacl2 solution was added to 2 5 g of mixed soil sample shaken for 0 5 h and then filtered spectrophotometer was used to determine the no3 n contents in soil extracts then the no3 n contents of dry soil samples were calculated according to the soil water contents to avoid potential errors caused by soil moisture sublimation wang et al 2015a 2015b 2 3 3 nitrogen content of plants two adjacent rows with a length of 100 cm were selected as the sampling area in the plots the aboveground parts of wheat in the sampling area were cut off at anthesis and maturity respectively the plant samples were divided into different organs at anthesis stem sheath leaf and spike and maturity stem sheath leaf rachis glume and grain respectively the organs were dried to constant weight at 75 c the nitrogen concentration of the dried samples were determined using the micro kjeldahl method and their nitrogen accumulation and translocation amounts were calculated as follows wang et al 2015a 2015b 3 nitrogen accumulation amount in each organ naao kg ha 1

version 19 0 spss chicago illinois usa 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the overall trend of monthly average temperature during the five growth seasons was consistent and no extreme weather occurred fig 1 the rainfall amounts during the five growth seasons fluctuated greatly the annual precipitation in july august and september accounted for approximately 70 of the total amount table s1 which also provided water supply for winter wheat sowing less precipitation occurred during the wheat growth season and significant precipitation occurred after jointing the precipitation in most months during the growth season was less than 20 mm the precipitation in june only slightly affected winter wheat because this crop generally needs less water at the end of its growth period low rainfall emphasizes the importance of irrigation and effective use of irrigation water to stabilize and increase yield the precipitation in october 2017 2018 reached 109 mm which delayed sowing in addition the precipitation amounts in april and may 2018 were 98 6 and 58 2 mm respectively extreme precipitation significantly affected the yields in 2017 2018 but no significant difference in yield was found between the plants under w2 and w1 fig 3 the impact of extreme rainfall on winter wheat yield indicates the importance of adjusting the irrigation strategy 3 2 soil total nitrogen etc and grain yield in 2015 2020 the soil total nitrogen content 0 20 cm at maturity and etc are shown in fig 2 and table s2 in 2019 2020 the soil total nitrogen of the plants under n0 decreased by 24 94 compared with that in 2015 2016 the plants under n1 and n2 showed no significant changes during the five growth seasons after harvest the wheat grains absorbed a large amount of nitrogen which decreased the soil total nitrogen content etc showed no significant increase or decrease but those under w0 and w2 fluctuated these results suggest that etc is closely related to the annual grain yield fig 4 irrigation amount w nitrogen application rate n and their interaction w n significantly affected the grain yields during the five growth seasons except during 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 table s3 in each growth season irrigation can significantly increase the yield compared with w0 w1 and w2 increased the grain yields by 1 2 89 2 and 10 127 1 respectively fig 3 the difference in grain yield of the plants under various nitrogen treatments increased with the growth period compared with n0 n1 and n2 increased the grain yield by 2 9 22 1 and 9 6 13 5 respectively in 2015 2016 however by 2019 2020 these values had reached 121 4 150 7 and 143 8 164 1 respectively the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 showed higher grain yields than those under the other treatments during the five growth seasons as shown in fig 4 grain yield and soil total nitrogen content were significantly p 0 01 correlated in the last four growth seasons and this correlation increased with the growth period the r2 value between grain yield and soil total nitrogen was 0 38 in 2018 2019 and 0 52 in 2019 2020 indicating that the high nitrogen application rate increased the grain yield and soil total nitrogen content grain yield was significantly p 0 01 correlated with etc with a high r2 in each growth season indicating that the amount of water consumed of winter wheat increased with increasing yield in addition the yield difference of the plants under different nitrogen application treatments was significantly higher in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 than in the earlier growth periods therefore we explored the nitrogen absorption and utilization of winter wheat and the distribution of no3 n in soil during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 3 3 no3 n concentration in the 0 200 cm soil layer during 2015 2020 the soil no3 n concentrations under different treatments varied between 1 24 and 28 24 mg kg 1 in the 0 200 cm soil layer at maturity during 2015 2020 fig 5 the no3 n concentration increased with increasing nitrogen application rate and decreased with increasing soil depth compared with the no3 n concentration in the deep soil layer of the plants under n0 that in the deep soil layer of the plants under n240 increased with the growth period and irrigation played a role in this phenomenon the no3 n concentration in the upper soil layer of the plants under n0 significantly decreased and the concentration in 2020 was only 58 of that in 2016 with increasing irrigation amount the no3 n concentration decreased in the 0 120 cm soil layer and increased in the 140 200 cm soil layer this result shows that irrigation promoted the movement of nitrate nitrogen to the deep soil layer and that nitrogen application increased the total nitrate nitrogen content of soil thus the no3 n concentrations in the deep and upper soil layers of the plants remained higher under w2n240 than under w2n0 in the 2015 2016 growth season the no3 n concentration of each soil layer of the plants was 210 higher under w2n240 than under w0n0 which reached 371 at maturity in 2020 this result also revealed that the nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 exceeded the absorption of wheat bringing excessive no3 n to the soil 3 4 no3 n content in the 0 100 and 100 200 cm soil layers during 2018 2020 the soil no3 n contents varied between 37 50 and 443 84 kg ha 1 in the 0 100 cm layer and 31 53 222 11 kg ha 1 in the 100 200 cm layer during two growth seasons in 2018 2020 fig 6 the no3 n contents in the 0 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers enhanced with increasing nitrogen application rate with the growth of wheat the no3 n content generally decreased under different treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the no3 n contents in the 0 100 cm soil layer under n240 decreased by 33 5 and 43 0 respectively at maturity compared with those at sowing although the soil no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil layer under n240 significantly decreased it still exceeded 200 kg ha 1 at maturity in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the soil no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer was generally lower than that in the 0 100 cm soil layer but it presented the same trend as that in the 0 100 cm soil layer the results showed that wheat absorbed and utilized no3 n in the growth process and that the large amount of no3 n promoted the nitrogen absorption of wheat but also caused nitrogen accumulation in the soil 3 5 nitrogen distribution in different organs of winter wheat in 2018 2020 as shown in table 2 w n and w n significantly affected the nitrogen distribution in various organs in both growth seasons irrigation and nitrogen application increased nitrogen accumulation in organs and plants the nitrogen accumulation in each organ and plant at anthesis and maturity generally increased with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate in 2018 2019 during 2019 2020 the difference in nitrogen accumulation between the plants under n240 and n120 decreased and the grain nitrogen accumulation of the plants under w2n240 was only 0 22 higher than that of the plants under w2n120 even at anthesis the nitrogen accumulation in the stems sheath and spikes of the plants was higher under w2n120 than under w2n240 therefore the nitrogen accumulation in the plants under w2n120 was higher than that in the plants under w2n240 at anthesis at maturity the nitrogen accumulation in the plants under w2n240 was only 1 75 higher than that in the plants under w2n120 the above results showed that the long term effect of w2n240 on soil affected the nitrogen transport of wheat and this effect was significant in 2020 the nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 did not increase nitrogen uptake and transport and resulted in the same amount of nitrogen accumulation in the grains as the nitrogen application rate of 120 kg ha 1 3 6 nitrogen uptake and translocation in 2018 2020 as shown in table 3 w n and w n significantly affected the assimilation and translocation to grains of nitrogen accumulated in both growth seasons but the effects of w on prntr in 2018 2019 and w n on ponac in 2019 2020 were not significant the leaves and stems sheath were the main supply organs of grain nitrogen the prntas of various organs in both growth seasons enhanced with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate however the stems sheath and spikes of the plants under w2n120 had higher prntas than those of the plants under w2n240 in 2019 2020 thus the prntas prntrs and prntcs of the plants under w2n120 were higher than those of the plants under w2n240 hence twice irrigation and nitrogen application of 240 kg ha 1 in 2019 2020 inhibited nitrogen transport before anthesis the prntr did not considerably change with increasing irrigation amount it generally decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate but the prntrs of the plants under w1n120 were higher than those of the plants under w1n0 and w1n240 this result revealed that the residual nitrogen amount in the vegetative organs increased with the increase of nitrogen application in addition the prntcs of the plants significantly increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and irrigation amount the ponaas of the plants under w1n0 and w1n120 were higher than those of the plants under w1n240 in 2018 2019 but the ponaas of the plants under n120 and n240 were significantly higher than those of the plants under n0 in both growth seasons the ponac decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate however the ponacs of the plants under w0 in 2018 2019 and w2 in 2019 2020 can be ranked as follows n240 n0 n120 the plants under w2n240 had the highest ponaa in 2019 2020 however no difference in grain nitrogen accumulation was found between the plants under w2n240 and w2n120 because of the decrease in prnta table 2 3 7 yield components in 2018 2020 w n and w n significantly affected the spike number and grain number per spike in both growth seasons table 4 but the effect of irrigation amount on grain number per spike in 2018 2019 was not significant in addition the 1000 grain weight was significantly affected by irrigation amount but not by nitrogen application rate the grain numbers per spike of the plants under w1 and w2 were higher than those of the plants under w0 in 2019 2020 but not in 2018 2019 the grain numbers per spike of the plants under n120 and n240 were higher than those of the plants under n0 during both growth seasons the spike number and grain yield increased with increasing irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate during both growth seasons the plants under w2n240 had the highest spike number but the plants under w2n120 had the highest grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight in 2019 2020 which caused the plants under w2n120 to have higher yields than those under w2n240 fig 3 3 8 gnc nupe nue nfp and nhi in 2018 2020 w n and w n significantly affected most nitrogen indices in both growth seasons table 5 however the effects of w n on gnc in 2018 2019 and on nhi in 2019 2020 were not significant the nupes nues nfps and nhis of the plants decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate the gncs of the plants under n120 and n240 were significantly higher than those of the plants under n0 with increasing irrigation amount the gncs nupes and nfps of the plants increased but their nues and nhis decreased analysis of the nitrogen indices of the plants under w2n240 and w2n120 during the two growth seasons showed that the plants under w2n120 achieved the highest values of all indices except for gnc which was highest in the plants under w2n240 in 2019 2020 4 discussion water and nitrogen are essential to improve crop yield du et al 2021 the properties of surface soil are vulnerable to the impacts of tillage irrigation fertilization and other measures pirmoradian et al 2005 this finding explains why the soil total nitrogen contents of the mature plants under different nitrogen application rates significantly changed during the first growth season fig 2 long term application of a large amount of urea increases soil total nitrogen content jones et al 2009 however the soil total nitrogen contents of the plants under n240 and n120 did not significantly increase during the five growth seasons in the present study this result indicated that the annual nitrogen cycle in the soil was stable for a short time that is the difference between the amounts of nitrogen input and output was the same during the five growth seasons however the soil total nitrogen contents and grain yields of the plants under n0 significantly decreased because of the consumption of wheat growth and absence of nitrogen supplement fig 3 compared with the low nitrogen application rate the high nitrogen application rate increased the wheat yield high yield also promoted nitrogen uptake and soil nitrogen content that is the nitrogen absorbed by wheat and the residual nitrogen in soil increased simultaneously this is not an antagonistic process but a process of common increase therefore this result explains why the correlation between soil total nitrogen content and yield gradually increased fig 4 the etc in the different growth seasons fluctuated slightly and did not significantly change during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growth seasons the grain yields of the plants under n0 decreased significantly which caused the demand for etc to sharply decrease and lengthened the box plot a significant positive correlation was found between yield and etc however this correlation was significantly lower during 2017 2018 than during the other growth seasons the main reason is that the yield difference between different treatments decreased because of three abnormal rainfall events 109 0 mm october 2017 98 6 mm april 2018 and 55 2 mm may 2018 in 2017 2018 table s1 some studies showed that the grain yield would increase slowly after reaching a certain value inflection point with increasing etc rathor et al 2017 si et al 2020 in other words the water production efficiency wp would decrease when etc increases to a certain value however in the present study the grain yield showed a linear relationship with etc and its growth rate did not slow down this result proved that under the current situation the grain yield has the potential to increase before the decline of wp irrigation and nitrogen application exerted different effects on grain yield during the five growth seasons in the present study in 2015 2016 the difference in grain yield between plants under various irrigation treatments was significant but the difference in grain yield between plants under various nitrogen application treatments was not significant fig 3 the main reason is that the high nitrogen residue local traditional nitrogen application rate 240 270 kg ha 1 in soil can still meet the growth needs of wheat for a short time in addition water can significantly affect wheat yield for a short time because of its importance in growth and development soil fertility can compensate for the lack of nitrogen fertilizer in the short term and irrigation can alleviate the negative impact of the lack of nitrogen fertilizer in a certain range he et al 2007 as the growth period was prolonged insufficient nitrogen application decreased soil fertility and crop yield by the fourth growth season the grain yield of n0 significantly decreased and was not affected by irrigation indicating that the soil nitrogen content significantly decreased to levels that are difficult for wheat to absorb the highest yield was obtained in the plants under w2n240 and w2n120 during the five growth seasons as for the optimal irrigation and nitrogen combination we will analyze it with nue in the last chapter of this section the no3 n concentration in each soil layer of the plants under n120 was basically lower than that of the plants under n240 at maturity fig 5 under the influence of urea fertilization the no3 n concentration of different nitrogen fertilization treatments in shallow soil varies greatly because this layer is easily disturbed pirmoradian et al 2005 this experiment started in 2015 but in 2016 the no3 n concentration in the shallow soil of mature wheat without nitrogen application decreased to below 12 mg kg 1 indicating that urea is the main source of no3 n the mobility of no3 n was also one of the reasons for its fast reduction due to the water solubility of nitrate nitrogen irrigation promotes its movement to deep soil hondebrink et al 2017 li et al 2015 liu et al 2019b wheat roots mainly absorb no3 n from 0 to 100 cm soil depth zhang et al 2009 thus the no3 n content from the 0 100 cm soil layer significantly decreased during the growth season fig 6 the no3 n content in the 100 200 cm soil layer was mainly lost through leaching the no3 n concentration of the plants under n0 continued to decline because of the lack of additional supplement and absorption the shallow soil of the plants under w2n0 decreased more significantly under the drive of irrigation however w2n0 also decreased no3 n accumulation in the deep soil because of the low total nitrogen by contrast w2n240 maintained the high no3 n concentration in each soil layer and its accumulation in the deep soil under irrigation zhang et al 2018 obviously the nitrogen application amount of 240 kg ha 1 exceeds the absorption amount of wheat which agrees with the results of most studies fang et al 2006 liu et al 2019a lu et al 2019 a study in canada showed that the soil residual no3 n is low when the nitrogen application rate is less than 112 kg ha 1 but significantly increases when the nitrogen application rate exceeds 168 kg ha 1 malhi et al 2003 this finding is consistent with our results that the no3 n concentration in each soil layer under n120 was significantly lower than that in each soil layer under n240 moreover n120 achieved considerable grain yield the grain yields of the plants under w2n120 were higher than those of the plants under w2n240 during 2019 2020 consistent with the findings by hao et al 2014 these results suggest that w2n120 is obviously an ideal farming regimen due to weather the amount of nitrogen accumulation at anthesis was largest in the leaves during 2018 2019 and in the stems sheath during 2019 2020 table 2 under drought conditions appropriate water supplement can promote the accumulation of nitrogen in the leaves sinclair et al 2000 from jointing to anthesis during 2018 2019 the precipitation reached 38 2 mm which is much higher than 14 2 mm in 2019 2020 thus the nitrogen accumulation in the leaves during 2018 2019 was higher than that in the stems sheath rainfall is accompanied by overcast days the light from jointing to anthesis in 2018 2019 was significantly lower than that in 2019 2020 the rainy and low light at jointing contribute to the dry matter accumulation of the leaves allowing them to absorb more nitrogen spyridon et al 2012 wheat grain nitrogen has two major sources the translocation from prnta and ponaa in most treatments prnta was higher than ponaa which was consistent with the results of palta et al 2011 irrigation and nitrogen application increased prnta although the ponaas of the plants fluctuated with increasing irrigation and nitrogen application the nitrogen accumulation in the grains generally increased this result indicates the importance of using nitrogen in vegetative organs and the dominant position of prnta in grain nitrogen in grain crops the transport of nitrogen from vegetative organs can buffer the impact of adverse climatic conditions during grain filling tahir and nakata 2005 the highest prnta in 2018 2019 was obtained under w2n240 whereas that in 2019 2020 was obtained under w2n120 as a result the nitrogen accumulation of grains showed no difference between the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 in 2019 2020 and the nitrogen accumulation of the plants under w2n240 was only 6 higher than that of the plants under w2n120 in 2018 2019 we speculate that the high nitrogen accumulation in soil limited the nitrogen absorption of the plants under w2n240 thus the prntas of the plants under w2n240 did not significantly increase compared with those of the plants under w2n120 hébert et al 2001 another reason was the decrease in prntr caused by excessive residual nitrogen in the vegetative organs the plants under w2n240 had the lowest prntr in both growth seasons although some studies have shown that excessive irrigation reduces nitrogen transport to grains plaut et al 2004 xu et al 2005 this phenomenon did not occur in this study this result suggests that the current irrigation regime w2 is conducive to the absorption of nitrogen in grains and may not maximize the potential of wheat water and nitrogen are the most important constraints to achieving high crop yields mueller et al 2012 given the low precipitation in the experimental area of the present study sufficient irrigation combined with increased nitrogen fertilizer can significantly improve spike number and grain number per spike the grain numbers per spike of the plants under n120 and n240 were significantly higher than those of the plants under n0 but no significant difference was observed between n120 and n240 table 4 the increase in nitrogen application rate leads to wheat overproduction which is not conducive to spike development thus limiting the increase in grain number per spike sufficient water supply at jointing can promote the growth of vegetative organs and increase grain number per spike meng et al 2016 therefore in treatments with nitrogen application the grain numbers per spike of the plants under w1 and w2 were significantly higher than those of the plants under w0 grain filling is the key stage of grain weight formation shi et al 2016 thus irrigation at anthesis can considerably affect grain weight which may explain why the 1000 grain weights of the plants under w2 were higher than those of the plants under w1 optimized irrigation can enhance the nitrogen absorption of wheat maximize fertilizer efficiency improve nitrogen availability and increase wheat yield garnett et al 2009 excessive irrigation reduces the utilization rate of nitrogen lu et al 2019 in the present study nfp increased with increasing irrigation in 2018 2020 which may be due to the low precipitation amounts of 75 7 and 139 9 mm table 5 these results indicate that w2 has not reached the excessive level of irrigation van sanford and mackown 1987 found that the nhi ranges from 0 7 to 0 8 which is consistent with the present results the decrease in nhi is accompanied by the simultaneous occurrence of nupe nue and nfp with increasing nitrogen application the lower nupe indicated the loss of nitrogen some of which accumulated in the deep soil in the form of nitrate nitrogen with the decrease in nupe the content of soil no3 n increased fig 6 therefore the yield nitrogen absorption and utilization efficiencies should be considered when establishing a tillage regime przulj and momcilovic 2001 found that a rate of 240 kg ha 1 of nitrogen results in the maximum gnc and decreases the nfp to 27 7 kg kg 1 which is 60 lower than 70 0 kg kg 1 when the application rate of nitrogen is 80 kg ha 1 the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 had higher gncs but the nupe nue nfp and nhi of the plants under w2n120 were significantly higher than those of the plants under w2n240 in the present study in addition the yields of the plants under w2n120 were slightly higher than those of the plants under w2n240 in 2019 2020 these results indicate that w2n120 is more reasonable than other treatments to increase the wheat production in the north china plain with low precipitation this study explored the rationality of the farming regime for reducing water and nitrogen the results of this 5 year experiment confirmed that w2n120 is more in line with local conditions but some improvements are still needed twice irrigation had not optimized the wp nfp and prnta however the high irrigation amount increased the accumulation of no3 n in the deep soil thus various factors should be considered and the irrigation schedule should be reasonably adjusted although n120 performed better than n240 in nitrate nitrogen accumulation and nue the grain yields of the plants under n120 were still far from the local high yield standard of 9000 kg ha 1 thus a more appropriate amount of nitrogen between 120 and 240 kg ha 1 warrants further exploration 5 conclusion in the short term 2015 2016 first growth season of experiment the effect of deficit irrigation on wheat grain yield was greater than that of deficit nitrogen application due to the nitrogen absorption of wheat the soil without nitrogen application gradually lost its support for the construction of grain yield the no3 n concentration in each soil layer significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application rate when the irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate were increased the nitrogen accumulation amount in grains prnta and gnc increased significantly but the nupe nue nfp and nhi significantly decreased moreover the yield difference between the plants under w2n120 and w2n240 was not significant within 5 years therefore the combination of applying 120 kg ha 1 nitrogen and irrigating 60 mm at jointing and anthesis was the optimal regimen to increase the grain yield of winter wheat in the north china plain with low precipitation the shortcomings of this measure need to be overcome in future

9153,low efficiency of irrigation is a major problem with surface irrigation methods mainly due to poor management and improper design the objective of this study was to evaluate and improve the performance of different surge and alternate furrow irrigation methods a field experiment was conducted during the grain maize growing season in the jayedar plain of poldokhtar city southwest of iran in the years 2020 and 2021 five different furrow irrigation methods including conventional furrow irrigation cfi surge irrigation with on off cycle ratios of 1 and 0 5 sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 respectively fixed alternate irrigation ffi and variable alternate irrigation afi were investigated a total of 15 irrigation evaluations were performed at the initial middle and end of the growing season by measuring inflow rate cutoff time outflow rate infiltration and advance time the length and spacing of experimental furrows were 120 and 0 75 m respectively and the inflow rate of furrows and the flow cutoff times at the initial 3rd irrigation middle 6th irrigation and end 9th irrigation of the season were 0 28 l s and 240 min 0 42 l s and 360 min 0 35 l s and 300 min respectively the winsrfr 3 1 software was calibrated and applied using field data based on the zero inertia model the results of the furrow irrigation sensitivity analysis with winsrfr 3 1 software demonstrated that furrow irrigation in the studied area was most sensitive to the inflow rate cutoff time and infiltration parameters respectively there were high correlations between the measured and simulated values of runoff infiltration and advance time coefficient of determination of 1 0 0 94 and 0 97 respectively the relative error values in estimating runoff infiltration and advance time were 5 60 5 09 and 2 14 respectively mean performance indices of different furrow irrigation methods under field experiments showed that the highest values of application efficiency 78 7 potential application efficiency of the minimum 69 5 and potential application efficiency of low quarter 74 1 were observed under the afi method by optimizing the inflow rate and flow cutoff time application efficiencies of 66 6 80 7 were obtained for different irrigation methods the results of this study show that afi is a more suitable method for maize irrigation in the study area keywords furrow irrigation performance evaluation application efficiency infiltration winsrfr software data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface irrigation is the oldest and the most common irrigation method pressurized irrigation systems usually have high irrigation efficiency but due to rising energy and equipment costs many researchers carry out significant research to increase efficiency of surface irrigation systems and propose this method as a proper alternative to pressurized irrigation methods proper design and management of surface irrigation will improve irrigation performance indices and increase water productivity and reduce agrochemical pollution ebrahimian and playán 2014 lalehzari et al 2015 mazarei et al 2020 in iran 37 8 of the total studies of irrigation systems are related to furrow irrigation and its application efficiency and uniformity are reported as 49 and 76 respectively abbasi and sohrab 2011 one of the ways to improve the performance of furrow irrigation is to complement field experiments with simulation models the major benefits of mathematical simulation models for surface irrigation include high speed low cost investigation of various combinations of design parameters without the need for extensive and high cost field experiments and a rapid review of new surface irrigation schemes in a wide range bassett 1972 smith et al 2018 abbasi et al 2003 ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 investigated the performance of three mathematical models hydrodynamics zero inertia and kinematic wave for furrow and border irrigation methods based on the results a non significant difference was found between hydrodynamic and zero inertia models in estimating advance and recession times infiltration and runoff for both furrow and border irrigation methods gillies and smith 2015 developed the sisco software to evaluate and improve surface irrigation performance they reported the suitability of the software to evaluate furrow and border irrigation performance in australia sayari et al 2017 evaluated the furrow irrigation system with different inflow rates using the winsrfr software bautista et al 2009 they found that the kinematic wave model was less accurate than the zero inertia model the lowest error in estimating advance time was 1 2 constant inflow rate and the highest error was 11 2 incremental inflow rate the highest water application efficiency and the lowest amount of runoff 72 and 28 respectively corresponded to the cut back inflow regime mazarei et al 2020 applied the winsrfr software to optimize furrow irrigation performance in sugarcane farms southwestern iran under different inflow rates and geometric parameters they suggested a flow rate of 3 l s and a cut off time of 379 5 min to achieve the highest irrigation performance in their conditions ismail et al 2021 evaluated and optimized the performance of furrow irrigation systems in egypt using the winsrfr software they concluded that increasing the furrow length reduced irrigation performance and the optimal combination of inflow rate and cut off time resulted in increased application efficiency and reduced deep percolation losses yadeta et al 2022 assessed the furrow irrigation performance using the winsrfr software in ethiopia the results indicated that changing decision variables inflow rate and cut off time significantly improved performance indices such as application efficiency and deep percolation but the uniformity of distribution remained unchanged the performance calculated by the software was better than the performance determined in the irrigation evaluation wu et al 2017 investigated the accuracy of the sirmod model in the simulation of alternate furrow irrigation afi and conventional furrow irrigation cfi and stated that the simulations were done with very good accuracy in both cases ahmadabadi et al 2020 investigated various scenarios using the sirmod model to improve furrow irrigation application efficiency in sugar beet fields located in the moghan plain of ardabil province iran the results demonstrated that using different scenarios could significantly reduce water losses in the field ebrahimian et al 2020 used various methods to estimate infiltration parameters of furrow irrigation the results demonstrated that the elliott and walker method was the most accurate among the various two point methods the multi level calibration method was the most accurate method for estimating the infiltration coefficients compared to other computer based models their sensitivity analysis demonstrated that changes of errors in estimating infiltration parameters were a function of soil texture furrow length inflow and field slope chen et al 2012 reported that proper flow rate could improve application efficiency of furrow irrigation system in north china plain by 27 anwar et al 2016 akbar et al 2016 and nie et al 2019 also demonstrated that a proper combination of inflow and cutoff time increased application efficiency to the 75 90 range by the hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation winsrfr software is able to determine the optimal performance and select a solution that is more compatible with implementation constraints bautista et al 2009 to evaluate the performance of the surface irrigation simulation models and obtain reliable results the field parameters of the model need to be measured with an acceptable level of accuracy the simulation accuracy of the model depends on the input factors especially the inflow rate the infiltration equation coefficients and the manning s roughness coefficient ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 for the proper design of a surface irrigation systems many variables need to be considered operations irrigation variables are limited to cut off time and inflow rate in this situation iso performance curves are considered a suitable tool to improve the performance of the system bautista et al 2019 due to the need to improve furrow irrigation performance in the jayder plain of southwest of iran this study was conducted during the grain maize growing season using five different furrow irrigation methods including one conventional two alternate and two surge methods with the following goals 1 perform a sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation for key input parameters with winsrfr software 2 parameterize the winsrfr software to improve different furrow irrigation methods conventional surge and alternate 3 compare the performance of different furrow irrigation methods 4 determine the optimized inflow rate and cutoff time parameters based on the performance indicators of the irrigation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area field experiments were conducted in the jayder plain of poldakhtar city located in the southwest of lorestan province iran at a longitude of 47 41 e a latitude of 33 and 6 n and an altitude of 686 m above sea level the study area has a hot and dry climate with dry summers and mild winters the average precipitation is 414 mm according to statistics for 55 years 1966 67 2020 21 from the poldakhtar meteorological station near the project site fig 1 shows the geographical location of the study area on the iran map 2 2 field data soil texture was obtained using the hydrometer method and the textural class was determined using the usda method the soil bulk density was measured using the cylinder method soil moisture at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp was determined in the pressure heads of 33 and 1500 kpa respectively using a pressure plate apparatus and a pressure membrane respectively the results of the soil physicochemical analyses are presented in table 1 furrows at 0 75 m spacing and a length of 120 m were made after plowing disc fertilizing and re disc operations the experimental field was then prepared under grain maize cultivation single cross 704 with an furrow irrigation system the crop was sown in the third week of march 2021 and harvested in mid july 2021 the longitudinal and cross slopes of the field were determined at 0 0085 and 0 0022 m m respectively by a using survey equipment five furrow irrigation methods including conventional furrow irrigation cfi surge furrow irrigation with on off cycle ratios of 1 and 0 5 sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 respectively and fixed and variable alternate furrow irrigation ffi and afi respectively were investigated in total 20 furrows were established fig 2 the lateral furrows of each treatment acted as buffer furrows to eliminate lateral flow error of measuring from the lateral furrows and the required parameters were measured in the middle furrow a schematic map of the experimental furrows is displayed in fig 2 due to changes in soil infiltration characteristics during the growing season a total of three evaluations were carried out at the beginning third irrigation middle sixth irrigation and end ninth irrigation of the season in each irrigation evaluation inflow rate and cutoff time runoff infiltration and advance time were recorded the maximum non erosive inflow rate 0 7 l s of the experimental furrows was determined using the bohr 1976 equation in all irrigation methods inflow rates and cutoff times were 0 28 l s and 240 min 0 42 l s and 360 min and 0 35 l s and 300 min in the third sixth and ninth irrigations respectively the inflow and outflow rates of the furrows were measured using wsc flumes advance time was measured and recorded at nailed points at 10 m spacing along the experimental furrows the geometric dimensions of the experimental furrows are presented in table 2 2 3 crop water requirements the crop water requirements during the growth period were calculated by eq 1 allen et al 1998 1 etc k c k p e p a n where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and k p denotes the pan coefficient and e pan indicates the evaporation rate from class a pan in mm day the pan evaporation data were obtained from the poldakhtar synoptic meteorological station near the study area it should be noted that no effective precipitation occurred during the plant growth period the k p was considered 0 7 on average the growth period of the crop was 141 days and the initial developmental mid and final stages lasted 27 27 51 and 36 days respectively the k c values in four stages were on average 0 55 0 94 1 15 and 0 6 respectively it should be noted that it is quite easy for the local farmers to use the pan evaporation for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto due to the metrological data scarcity 2 4 infiltration equation the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation is largely used in the design and evaluation of surface irrigation systems hanson et al 1993 2 z kta fot where z is the cumulative infiltration depth mm f o denotes the basic infiltration mm hr t represents time hr k mm hra and a are the empirical parameters of the equation in different irrigation methods the inflow outflow method was used to determine the basic infiltration rate walker and skogerboe 1987 the two point method was also used to determine the coefficients a and k walker and skogerboe 1987 in surge irrigation two types of infiltration equations are considered one for the dry state the first surge irrigation of the furrows and the other for the wet state of the furrows the second third or more irrigation the coefficients of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation of surge irrigation were calculated based on the walker humpherys method walker and humpherys 1983 for furrows in the wet state 3 6 and 9 irrigations events given that irrigation is applied continuously after the end of the advance phase in surge irrigation the storage depletion and recession times are determined based on the continuous flow parameters and the flow cutoff time is also calculated after completing the storage period walker and skogerboe 1987 2 5 manning s roughness coefficient manning s equation was used to estimate the roughness coefficient assuming uniform flow and reaching the depth of flow to the normal depth the assumption of uniform flow is proposed for relatively high slopes and this method will not be effective on slopes less than 0 001 elliott and walker 1982 kamali et al 2018 3 n a 2 3 s q p 2 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient a is the area of cross section m2 p is the wetted perimeter m s is the longitudinal slope of the water surface m m and q is the inflow rate m3 s the flow cross sectional area and wetted perimeter of the experimental furrows were measured using a cross sectional measuring device walker and skogerboe 1987 at three points the beginning middle and end of the furrows then the manning s equation was used to estimate the mean value of n when infiltration rate reached steady state condition 2 6 winsrfr software winsrfr software is based on the numerical solution of the saint venant equations this software assumes inflow characteristics as a variable relative to the space from the beginning of the farm or relative to the time from the beginning of irrigation it performs calculations with zero inertia and kinematic wave models with the numerical solution method strelkoff et al 1998 the implementation of winsrfr software has four parts event analysis performance analysis physical design and simulation in event analysis the model evaluates field data and then uses the miriam keller field infiltration data and elliott and walker two point methods to estimate the infiltration parameters the performance analysis part consists of testing various applied scenarios of the system these tests suggest different combinations of inflow rate and cutoff time for a system with specific dimensions slopes and soil characteristics to evaluate the performance of the irrigation system the various performance parameters analyzed by the model such as the uniformity of distribution water application efficiency deep percolation and runoff minimum infiltrated depth and total applied water depth in the design part the physical dimensions of the field length and width are determined using field data to achieve acceptable performance in the simulation part the model simulates the data given in the event analysis physical design and performance to run the simulation scenarios alternatively strelkoff et al 1996 bautista et al 2012 in the present study the zero inertia model was used in the winsrfr3 1 software the main inputs of the software include the length and slope of the field the geometric characteristics of the furrow cross section the inflow rate and infiltration and manning s roughness coefficients 2 6 1 calibration of the winsrfr software to calibrate the software the required data such as furrow geometry manning s roughness coefficient inflow and outflow hydrograph and advance time were input data to the software to evaluate the winsrfr software the simulated values of runoff infiltration and advance time were compared with the measured values the volume of infiltrated water was calculated using the volumes of inflow and outflow from the field runoff the calibration of the software under the field conditions was done using different evaluation criteria including relative error re root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 4 x p λ x m 5 re x p x m x m 100 6 rmse i 1 n x mi x pi 2 n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n x m x p 2 i 1 n x m x m 2 where x p is the simulated value x m is the measured value x m is the average measured value n is the number of measurements and λ is the slope of the fitting line equation if λ is less than 1 the software underestimated and if λ is greater than 1 the software overestimated the λ value close to 1 and an re value close to zero indicate a good estimate by the software 2 6 2 sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation with winsrfr software the sensitivity of the furrow irrigation to winsrfr software input parameters including cutoff time the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation coefficients manning s roughness coefficient slope and inflow rate was analyzed in this study the effects of the abovementioned input parameters were investigated on the output parameters including water application efficiency runoff deep percolation distribution uniformity irrigation adequacy and advance time the sensitivity of a specific input parameter was analyzed based on changing the value of that parameter while keeping other input parameters constant and investigating the change in the output parameters in the sensitivity analysis of each input parameter the value of that parameter change was considered equal to 50 and 25 followed by running the model the model outputs in the initial state without changing the values of each parameter were assumed to be the base output the sensitivity of each input parameter was expressed using the equation proposed by liu et al 2007 8 s c o o i i 1 where s c is the sensitivity coefficient of a specific input parameter on a specific output parameter o is a given output parameter change before and after the change o is the arithmetic mean of the output parameter i is the difference of the input parameter before and after the change and ī is the arithmetic mean of the input parameter s c values of 0 0 0 3 0 3 1 5 and 1 5 indicate insensitivity low sensitivity medium sensitivity and high sensitivity respectively 2 6 3 irrigation performance indicators the performance evaluation of different furrow irrigation methods was done using the different performance indicators including application efficiency ae runoff ro deep percolation dp minimum uniformity distribution du min low quarter distribution uniformity du lq minimum irrigation adequacy ad min low quarter irrigation

were used to optimize inflow rate q and cutoff time t co bautista and schlegel 2019 the iso performance curves created by the software operation analysis are water application efficiency ae minimum distribution uniformity du min runoff ro applied depth d app and deep percolation dp in general a combination of q and t co is optimal when it maximizes the application efficiency and distribution uniformity in this situation an option is to assume the maximization conditions of the total application efficiency and distribution uniformity as the optimal design on the d req d min line another option is to consider a minimum value for distribution uniformity and this assumption will extract a combination of q and t co that will maximize the application efficiency in this research the iso performance curves of application efficiency and distribution uniformity were investigated by considering the du min of field trials and the minimum infiltration depth as the required depth d min d req 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameters of the infiltration equation table 3 presents the values of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation coefficients and the manning s roughness coefficient for all irrigation methods at different times of the growing season in the third sixth and ninth irrigations the basic infiltration value in surge and alternate methods is higher than the conventional method also by increasing the value of the parameter k the value of the parameter a decreased in different irrigation methods the same trend was observed for the values of the parameter a in all experiments during the growing season and the maximum and minimum values did not differ substantially the trend of changes in the parameter k was different in all irrigation methods during the season and the maximum and minimum values also had large difference the range of the parameters a k and f 0 are 0 231 0 487 2 648 11 925 mm hr a and 3 33 7 69 mm hr 1 respectively showing that k had greater changes than the other parameters as reported by fu et al 2019 the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation can accurately determine the cumulative infiltration under different conditions however it is difficult to calculate its coefficients due to changes in boundary conditions dialameh et al 2017 in the current research changes in the inflow discharge influenced the coefficients of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation and the infiltration rate increased by increasing inflow discharge the effect of inflow rate on infiltration was also reported be several researchers rodríguez 2003 2020 3 2 manning s roughness coefficient an increase in inflow rate increases the water advance speed in the furrow and reduces the water advance time and manning s roughness coefficient n mean values of manning s roughness coefficient were 0 038 0 024 and 0 029 in the third sixth and ninth irrigation events respectively for each irrigation event the lowest value of manning s roughness coefficient belongs to the alternate and surge irrigation methods increasing the inflow rate from 0 28 the third irrigation to 0 35 the ninth irrigation and 0 42 l s the sixth irrigation reduced manning s roughness coefficient n by 20 and 33 4 respectively the higher the discharge the higher the flow depth and the lower the value of manning n similar results were reported by xu et al 2019 according to the studies of mailapali et al 2008 and kamali et al 2018 the manning s roughness coefficient in bare and vegetated furrows has an inverse relationship with inflow discharge on the other side the manning equation eq 3 demonstrates that there is an inverse relationship between the inflow rate and the manning s roughness coefficient which is consistent with the results of the present study however the effect of successive irrigation on the smoothness of the furrow soil surface is another reason of decreasing the value of the manning n during the growing season the number of successive irrigations typically reduces the value of the manning n 3 3 parameterization of the model for irrigation events the observed and estimated values of runoff infiltration and advance time are presented in table 4 the software simulated runoff infiltration and advance time with a high correlation r 2 of 1 0 9445 and 0 9708 respectively fig 3 the re values were 5 60 5 09 and 2 14 in estimating runoff infiltration and advance time respectively table 5 previous studies bautista et al 2012 gillies et al 2010 anwar et al 2016 indicated that the winsrfr software could predict the advance time and runoff of furrow irrigation systems with acceptable accuracy which is consistent with the results of this research in our particular experiments the software overestimates the runoff λ 1 056 and the advance time λ 1 0214 but it underestimates infiltration λ 0 9491 the value of λ close to 1 and re close to zero indicate a good performance of the software the highest accuracy in estimating runoff belong to the afi sfi1 1 sfi1 2 ffi and cfi methods respectively table 5 the highest accuracies in infiltration estimation are related to the afi ffi sfi1 2 sfi1 1 and cfi methods respectively table 5 therefore the best and poorest estimates of runoff and infiltration are related to the afi and cfi methods respectively the highest model accuracy in estimating advance time was obtained for sfi1 1 sfi1 2 cfi ffi and afi methods irrigation respectively table 5 hence sfi1 1 and afi methods represent the best and weakest model estimates for the advance time the mean value of rmse in estimating advance time was 4 6 4 6 4 7 6 3 and 5 8 min for the cfi sfi1 1 sfi1 2 ffi and afi methods respectively table 6 accordingly the software simulated the advance times of the surge irrigation methods with higher accuracy than those of the alternate methods chen et al 2012 sayari et al 2017 and xu et al 2019 also reported that the winsrfr software had good accuracy and small error in simulating advance times 3 4 sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation with winsrfr software the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 7 the highest sensitivity effects on the application efficiency ae belong to inflow rate 0 98 and the cutoff time 0 61 the lowest effect on ae was obtained for the furrow slope with a sensitivity coefficient of 0 001 the manning s roughness coefficient had no effect on ae the results showed that among the parameters of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation the highest sensitivity is related to the final infiltration rate the highest effect of the final infiltration rate is on the deep percolation and minimum irrigation adequacy with a sensitivity coefficient of 0 67 based on the sensitivity analysis of the manning s roughness coefficient this coefficient has a negligible effect on the other output parameters except for the advance time the results of the sensitivity analysis in this study are consistent with previous similar studies zerihun et al 1996 ebrahimian et al 2020 3 5 furrow irrigation performance indicators table 8 presents the furrow irrigation performance indicators the average performance indices of the five furrow irrigation methods were compared between three irrigation events the results revealed that the minimum and maximum values of ae pae min and pae lq were obtained in cfi 62 0 60 3 and 61 9 respectively and afi 78 7 69 5 and 74 1 respectively respectively the average values of runoff and deep percolation losses were 35 7 and 2 3 in cfi respectively these values were 19 5 and 1 8 in afi respectively the lowest and highest values of du lq belonged to afi 92 5 and cfi 96 9 respectively in the afi method the high ae and the low difference between du lq and pae lq are due to the proper management and the appropriate use of the irrigation system the high difference 35 0 of these two parameters in cfi indicates poor irrigation management and caused large water losses in the field in addition to ae and du irrigation adequacy is also important in the design and assessment of irrigation systems the values of ae ro dp pae min and pae lq were 64 9 33 7 1 4 61 8 and 63 6 for sfi1 1 and 64 2 34 2 1 6 61 1 and 62 7 for sfi1 2 respectively after the afi method sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 had better performance the values of ad min were 97 8 94 6 and 94 9 in the cfi sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 methods respectively indicating that deficit irrigation did not occur in these irrigation methods because of the high consumed water more than the requirement level in the ffi and afi methods however the mean values of ad min were 92 3 and 86 6 respectively suggesting the occurrence of deficit irrigation in the alternate methods under water shortage conditions deficit irrigation increases both the area under cultivation and water productivity leading to water savings the highest 98 6 and the least 92 7 ad lq values were observed in the cfi and afi methods some studies smith et al 2005 lalehzari et al 2015 kifle et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 reported that increasing the flow cutoff time increased irrigation losses particularly runoff and reduced ae by exceeding the required irrigation depth in this study ae showed a descending trend in the third ninth and sixth assessment times in the different irrigation methods due to increasing the inflow rate and cutoff times rising trends were also observed in distribution uniformity and irrigation adequacy the present study revealed that afi and cfi were the best and worst furrow irrigation methods respectively the low values of the performance indices particularly ae in the cfi method were caused by the difference between the values of du lq and pae lq suggesting poor irrigation management thus proper measures such as proper determination of irrigation depth and inflow rate cutoff time furrow length time based on the field specifications as well as training farmers and irrigators are among the strategies for improving the ae level consequently performance evaluation of irrigation systems awareness of the status quo and providing applicable solutions in the field will help provide more uniform and effective use of water in the field 3 6 analysis of furrow irrigation performance to increase ae and du and reduce dp and runoff losses furrow irrigation performance indicators ae and du under the experimental field conditions were compared with the values optimized with the iso performance curves of the winsrfr software table 9 ae values under the field conditions were between 62 0 cfi and 78 7 afi assuming the minimum uniformity of distribution in the current conditions field experiments is maintained between 86 5 afi and 94 5 cfi and by combining the contour map of application efficiency and distribution uniformity the optimal application efficiency of different irrigation treatments was varied between 66 6 cfi and 80 7 afi ae could not be increased more than this value 80 7 regarding the field properties such as furrow geometry and soil characteristics the greatest improvement in application efficiency was observed in cfi sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 by 8 2 8 1 and 8 respectively in the current research the iso performance curves of the irrigation system were employed as a new and effective management tool to improve the irrigation system performance in studies on optimizing inflow rate and cutoff time khatri et al 2007 morris et al 2015 anwar et al 2016 akbar et al 2016 nie et al 2019 it was concluded that the management of inflow rate and cutoff time could improve furrow irrigation performance which is in agreement with our results 4 conclusion the present study examined and analyzed sensitivity of furrow irrigation to winsrfr software input parameters and performance of different furrow irrigation methods we also evaluated the parametrization of the winsrfr software to improve the performance of different furrow irrigation systems in the southwest iran sensitivity analysis revealed that furrow irrigation was the most sensitive to inflow rate cutoff time and the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation parameters to achieve reliable results therefore these parameters should be measured with acceptable accuracy the highest effect of manning s roughness coefficient was obtained on the flow advance time by conducting the field experiments and software parameterization software could simulate runoff infiltration and advance time with good accuracy at relative errors of 5 60 5 09 and 2 14 respectively in estimating runoff and infiltration the best and poorest performance of the software were observed for the afi and cfi methods respectively the software estimated the advance time with the highest and lowest accuracies in the sfi1 1 and afi methods respectively the performance of different surge and alternate furrow irrigation methods is evaluated using the winsrfr software according to the results the best and poorest performance corresponded to the variable alternate irrigation and conventional furrow irrigation methods respectively hence afi is recommended in the studied area after the afi method the sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 methods had better performance than the cfi and ffi methods changing the inflow rate from 0 35 to 0 34 l s and the cutoff time from 300 to 304 min increased the application efficiency from 62 0 to 66 6 in cfi also changing the inflow rate from 0 35 to 0 34 l s and the cutoff time from 300 to 320 min in sfi1 1 increased the application efficiency from 64 9 to 69 7 thus furrow irrigation performance was improved by managing the cutoff time and the inflow rate in this study winsrfr software was well established and parameterized which led to sufficient agreement between the field observations and the model outputs for furrow irrigation this software improved the performance of the different furrow irrigation methods conventional surge and alternate in the study area declaration of competing

9153,low efficiency of irrigation is a major problem with surface irrigation methods mainly due to poor management and improper design the objective of this study was to evaluate and improve the performance of different surge and alternate furrow irrigation methods a field experiment was conducted during the grain maize growing season in the jayedar plain of poldokhtar city southwest of iran in the years 2020 and 2021 five different furrow irrigation methods including conventional furrow irrigation cfi surge irrigation with on off cycle ratios of 1 and 0 5 sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 respectively fixed alternate irrigation ffi and variable alternate irrigation afi were investigated a total of 15 irrigation evaluations were performed at the initial middle and end of the growing season by measuring inflow rate cutoff time outflow rate infiltration and advance time the length and spacing of experimental furrows were 120 and 0 75 m respectively and the inflow rate of furrows and the flow cutoff times at the initial 3rd irrigation middle 6th irrigation and end 9th irrigation of the season were 0 28 l s and 240 min 0 42 l s and 360 min 0 35 l s and 300 min respectively the winsrfr 3 1 software was calibrated and applied using field data based on the zero inertia model the results of the furrow irrigation sensitivity analysis with winsrfr 3 1 software demonstrated that furrow irrigation in the studied area was most sensitive to the inflow rate cutoff time and infiltration parameters respectively there were high correlations between the measured and simulated values of runoff infiltration and advance time coefficient of determination of 1 0 0 94 and 0 97 respectively the relative error values in estimating runoff infiltration and advance time were 5 60 5 09 and 2 14 respectively mean performance indices of different furrow irrigation methods under field experiments showed that the highest values of application efficiency 78 7 potential application efficiency of the minimum 69 5 and potential application efficiency of low quarter 74 1 were observed under the afi method by optimizing the inflow rate and flow cutoff time application efficiencies of 66 6 80 7 were obtained for different irrigation methods the results of this study show that afi is a more suitable method for maize irrigation in the study area keywords furrow irrigation performance

method pressurized irrigation systems usually have high irrigation efficiency but due to rising energy and equipment costs many researchers carry out significant research to increase efficiency of surface irrigation systems and propose this method as a proper alternative to pressurized irrigation methods proper design and management of surface irrigation will improve irrigation performance indices and increase water productivity and reduce agrochemical pollution ebrahimian and playán 2014 lalehzari et al 2015 mazarei et al 2020 in iran 37 8 of the total studies of irrigation systems are related to furrow irrigation and its application efficiency and uniformity are reported as 49 and 76 respectively abbasi and sohrab 2011 one of the ways to improve the performance of furrow irrigation is to complement field experiments with simulation models the major benefits of mathematical simulation models for surface irrigation include high speed low cost investigation of various combinations of design parameters without the need for extensive and high cost field experiments and a rapid review of new surface irrigation schemes in a wide range bassett 1972 smith et al 2018 abbasi et al 2003 ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 investigated the performance of three mathematical models hydrodynamics zero inertia and kinematic wave for furrow and border irrigation methods based on the results a non significant difference was found between hydrodynamic and zero inertia models in estimating advance and recession times infiltration and runoff for both furrow and border irrigation methods gillies and smith 2015 developed the sisco software to evaluate and improve surface irrigation performance they reported the suitability of the software to evaluate furrow and border irrigation performance in australia sayari et al 2017 evaluated the furrow irrigation system with different inflow rates using the winsrfr software bautista et al 2009 they found that the kinematic wave model was less accurate than the zero inertia model the lowest error in estimating advance time was 1 2 constant inflow rate and the highest error was 11 2 incremental inflow rate the highest water application efficiency and the lowest amount of runoff 72 and 28 respectively corresponded to the cut back inflow regime mazarei et al 2020 applied the winsrfr software to optimize furrow irrigation performance in sugarcane farms southwestern iran under different inflow rates and geometric parameters they suggested a flow rate of 3 l s and a cut off time of 379 5 min to achieve the highest irrigation performance in their conditions ismail et al 2021 evaluated and optimized the performance of furrow irrigation systems in egypt using the winsrfr software they concluded that increasing the furrow length reduced irrigation performance and the optimal combination of inflow rate and cut off time resulted in increased application efficiency and reduced deep percolation losses yadeta et al 2022 assessed the furrow irrigation performance using the winsrfr software in ethiopia the results indicated that changing decision variables inflow rate and cut off time significantly improved performance indices such as application efficiency and deep percolation but the uniformity of distribution remained unchanged the performance calculated by the software was better than the performance determined in the irrigation evaluation wu et al 2017 investigated the accuracy of the sirmod model in the simulation of alternate furrow irrigation afi and conventional furrow irrigation cfi and stated that the simulations were done with very good accuracy in both cases ahmadabadi et al 2020 investigated various scenarios using the sirmod model to improve furrow irrigation application efficiency in sugar beet fields located in the moghan plain of ardabil province iran the results demonstrated that using different scenarios could significantly reduce water losses in the field ebrahimian et al 2020 used various methods to estimate infiltration parameters of furrow irrigation the results demonstrated that the elliott and walker method was the most accurate among the various two point methods the multi level calibration method was the most accurate method for estimating the infiltration coefficients compared to other computer based models their sensitivity analysis demonstrated that changes of errors in estimating infiltration parameters were a function of soil texture furrow length inflow and field slope chen et al 2012 reported that proper flow rate could improve application efficiency of furrow irrigation system in north china plain by 27 anwar et al 2016 akbar et al 2016 and nie et al 2019 also demonstrated that a proper combination of inflow and cutoff time increased application efficiency to the 75 90 range by the hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation winsrfr software is able to determine the optimal performance and select a solution that is more compatible with implementation constraints bautista et al 2009 to evaluate the performance of the surface irrigation simulation models and obtain reliable results the field parameters of the model need to be measured with an acceptable level of accuracy the simulation accuracy of the model depends on the input factors especially the inflow rate the infiltration equation coefficients and the manning s roughness coefficient ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 for the proper design of a surface irrigation systems many variables need to be considered operations irrigation variables are limited to cut off time and inflow rate in this situation iso performance curves are considered a suitable tool to improve the performance of the system bautista et al 2019 due to the need to improve furrow irrigation performance in the jayder plain of southwest of iran this study was conducted during the grain maize growing season using five different furrow irrigation methods including one conventional two alternate and two surge methods with the following goals 1 perform a sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation for key input parameters with winsrfr software 2 parameterize the winsrfr software to improve different furrow irrigation methods conventional surge and alternate 3 compare the performance of different furrow irrigation methods 4 determine the optimized inflow rate and cutoff time parameters based on the performance indicators of the irrigation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area field experiments were conducted in the jayder plain of poldakhtar city located in the southwest of lorestan province iran at a longitude of 47 41 e a latitude of 33 and 6 n and an altitude of 686 m above sea level the study area has a hot and dry climate with dry summers and mild winters the average precipitation is 414 mm according to statistics for 55 years 1966 67 2020 21 from the poldakhtar meteorological station near the project site fig 1 shows the geographical location of the study area on the iran map 2 2 field data soil texture was obtained using the hydrometer method and the textural class was determined using the usda method the soil bulk density was measured using the cylinder method soil moisture at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp was determined in the pressure heads of 33 and 1500 kpa respectively using a pressure plate apparatus and a pressure membrane respectively the results of the soil physicochemical analyses are presented in table 1 furrows at 0 75 m spacing and a length of 120 m were made after plowing disc fertilizing and re disc operations the experimental field was then prepared under grain maize cultivation single cross 704 with an furrow irrigation system the crop was sown in the third week of march 2021 and harvested in mid july 2021 the longitudinal and cross slopes of the field were determined at 0 0085 and 0 0022 m m respectively by a using survey equipment five furrow irrigation methods including conventional furrow irrigation cfi surge furrow irrigation with on off cycle ratios of 1 and 0 5 sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 respectively and fixed and variable alternate furrow irrigation ffi and afi respectively were investigated in total 20 furrows were established fig 2 the lateral furrows of each treatment acted as buffer furrows to eliminate lateral flow error of measuring from the lateral furrows and the required parameters were measured in the middle furrow a schematic map of the experimental furrows is displayed in fig 2 due to changes in soil infiltration characteristics during the growing season a total of three evaluations were carried out at the beginning third irrigation middle sixth irrigation and end ninth irrigation of the season in each irrigation evaluation inflow rate and cutoff time runoff infiltration and advance time were recorded the maximum non erosive inflow rate 0 7 l s of the experimental furrows was determined using the bohr 1976 equation in all irrigation methods inflow rates and cutoff times were 0 28 l s and 240 min 0 42 l s and 360 min and 0 35 l s and 300 min in the third sixth and ninth irrigations respectively the inflow and outflow rates of the furrows were measured using wsc flumes advance time was measured and recorded at nailed points at 10 m spacing along the experimental furrows the geometric dimensions of the experimental furrows are presented in table 2 2 3 crop water requirements the crop water requirements during the growth period were calculated by eq 1 allen et al 1998 1 etc k c k p e p a n where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and k p denotes the pan coefficient and e pan indicates the evaporation rate from class a pan in mm day the pan evaporation data were obtained from the poldakhtar synoptic meteorological station near the study area it should be noted that no effective precipitation occurred during the plant growth period the k p was considered 0 7 on average the growth period of the crop was 141 days and the initial developmental mid and final stages lasted 27 27 51 and 36 days respectively the k c values in four stages were on average 0 55 0 94 1 15 and 0 6 respectively it should be noted that it is quite easy for the local farmers to use the pan evaporation for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto due to the metrological data scarcity 2 4 infiltration equation the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation is largely used in the design and evaluation of surface irrigation systems hanson et al 1993 2 z kta fot where z is the cumulative infiltration depth mm f o denotes the basic infiltration mm hr t represents time hr k mm hra and a are the empirical parameters of the equation in different irrigation methods the inflow outflow method was used to determine the basic infiltration rate walker and skogerboe 1987 the two point method was also used to determine the coefficients a and k walker and skogerboe 1987 in surge irrigation two types of infiltration equations are considered one for the dry state the first surge irrigation of the furrows and the other for the wet state of the furrows the second third or more irrigation the coefficients of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation of surge irrigation were calculated based on the walker humpherys method walker and humpherys 1983 for furrows in the wet state 3 6 and 9 irrigations events given that irrigation is applied continuously after the end of the advance phase in surge irrigation the storage depletion and recession times are determined based on the continuous flow parameters and the flow cutoff time is also calculated after completing the storage period walker and skogerboe 1987 2 5 manning s roughness coefficient manning s equation was used to estimate the roughness coefficient assuming uniform flow and reaching the depth of flow to the normal depth the assumption of uniform flow is proposed for relatively high slopes and this method will not be effective on slopes less than 0 001 elliott and walker 1982 kamali et al 2018 3 n a 2 3 s q p 2 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient a is the area of cross section m2 p is the wetted perimeter m s is the longitudinal slope of the water surface m m and q is the inflow rate m3 s the flow cross sectional area and wetted perimeter of the experimental furrows were measured using a cross sectional measuring device walker and skogerboe 1987 at three points the beginning middle and end of the furrows then the manning s equation was used to estimate the mean value of n when infiltration rate reached steady state condition 2 6 winsrfr software winsrfr software is based on the numerical solution of the saint venant equations this software assumes inflow characteristics as a variable relative to the space from the beginning of the farm or relative to the time from the beginning of irrigation it performs calculations with zero inertia and kinematic wave models with the numerical solution method strelkoff et al 1998 the implementation of winsrfr software has four parts event analysis performance analysis physical design and simulation in event analysis the model evaluates field data and then uses the miriam keller field infiltration data and elliott and walker two point methods to estimate the infiltration parameters the performance analysis part consists of testing various applied scenarios of the system these tests suggest different combinations of inflow rate and cutoff time for a system with specific dimensions slopes and soil characteristics to evaluate the performance of the irrigation system the various performance parameters analyzed by the model such as the uniformity of distribution water application efficiency deep percolation and runoff minimum infiltrated depth and total applied water depth in the design part the physical dimensions of the field length and width are determined using field data to achieve acceptable performance in the simulation part the model simulates the data given in the event analysis physical design and performance to run the simulation scenarios alternatively strelkoff et al 1996 bautista et al 2012 in the present study the zero inertia model was used in the winsrfr3 1 software the main inputs of the software include the length and slope of the field the geometric characteristics of the furrow cross section the inflow rate and infiltration and manning s roughness coefficients 2 6 1 calibration of the winsrfr software to calibrate the software the required data such as furrow geometry manning s roughness coefficient inflow and outflow hydrograph and advance time were input data to the software to evaluate the winsrfr software the simulated values of runoff infiltration and advance time were compared with the measured values the volume of infiltrated water was calculated using the volumes of inflow and outflow from the field runoff the calibration of the software under the field conditions was done using different evaluation criteria including relative error re root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 4 x p λ x m 5 re x p x m x m 100 6 rmse i 1 n x mi x pi 2 n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n x m x p 2 i 1 n x m x m 2 where x p is the simulated value x m is the measured value x m is the average measured value n is the number of measurements and λ is the slope of the fitting line equation if λ is less than 1 the software underestimated and if λ is greater than 1 the software overestimated the λ value close to 1 and an re value close to zero indicate a good estimate by the software 2 6 2 sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation with winsrfr software the sensitivity of the furrow irrigation to winsrfr software input parameters including cutoff time the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation coefficients manning s roughness coefficient slope and inflow rate was analyzed in this study the effects of the abovementioned input parameters were investigated on the output parameters including water application efficiency runoff deep percolation distribution uniformity irrigation adequacy and advance time the sensitivity of a specific input parameter was analyzed based on changing the value of that parameter while keeping other input parameters constant and investigating the change in the output parameters in the sensitivity analysis of each input parameter the value of that parameter change was considered equal to 50 and 25 followed by running the model the model outputs in the initial state without changing the values of each parameter were assumed to be the base output the sensitivity of each input parameter was expressed using the equation proposed by liu et al 2007 8 s c o o i i 1 where s c is the sensitivity coefficient of a specific input parameter on a specific output parameter o is a given output parameter change before and after the change o is the arithmetic mean of the output parameter i is the difference of the input parameter before and after the change and ī is the arithmetic mean of the input parameter s c values of 0 0 0 3 0 3 1 5 and 1 5 indicate insensitivity low sensitivity medium sensitivity and high sensitivity respectively 2 6 3 irrigation performance indicators the performance evaluation of different furrow irrigation methods was done using the different performance indicators including application efficiency ae runoff ro deep percolation dp minimum uniformity distribution du min low quarter distribution uniformity du lq minimum irrigation adequacy ad min low quarter irrigation adequacy ad lq minimum potential application efficiency pae min and low quarter minimum potential application efficiency pae lq bautista et al 2009 the iso performance curves of the winsrfr software were used to optimize inflow rate q and cutoff time t co bautista and schlegel 2019 the iso performance curves created by the software operation analysis are water application efficiency ae minimum distribution uniformity du min runoff ro applied depth d app and deep percolation dp in general a combination of q and t co is optimal when it maximizes the application efficiency and distribution uniformity in this situation an option is to assume the maximization conditions of the total application efficiency and distribution uniformity as the optimal design on the d req d min line another option is to consider a minimum value for distribution uniformity and this assumption will extract a combination of q and t co that will maximize the application efficiency in this research the iso performance curves of application efficiency and distribution uniformity were investigated by considering the du min of field trials and the minimum infiltration depth as the required depth d min d req 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameters of the infiltration equation table 3 presents the values of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation coefficients and the manning s roughness coefficient for all irrigation methods at different times of the growing season in the third sixth and ninth irrigations the basic infiltration value in surge and alternate methods is higher than the conventional method also by increasing the value of the parameter k the value of the parameter a decreased in different irrigation methods the same trend was observed for the values of the parameter a in all experiments during the growing season and the maximum and minimum values did not differ substantially the trend of changes in the parameter k was different in all irrigation methods during the season and the maximum and minimum values also had large difference the range of the parameters a k and f 0 are 0 231 0 487 2 648 11 925 mm hr a and 3 33 7 69 mm hr 1 respectively showing that k had greater changes than the other parameters as reported by fu et al 2019 the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation can accurately determine the cumulative infiltration under different conditions however it is difficult to calculate its coefficients due to changes in boundary conditions dialameh et al 2017 in the current research changes in the inflow discharge influenced the coefficients of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation and the infiltration rate increased by increasing inflow discharge the effect of inflow rate on infiltration was also reported be several researchers rodríguez 2003 2020 3 2 manning s roughness coefficient an increase in inflow rate increases the water advance speed in the furrow and reduces the water advance time and manning s roughness coefficient n mean values of manning s roughness coefficient were 0 038 0 024 and 0 029 in the third sixth and ninth irrigation events respectively for each irrigation event the lowest value of manning s roughness coefficient belongs to the alternate and surge irrigation methods increasing the inflow rate from 0 28 the third irrigation to 0 35 the ninth irrigation and 0 42 l s the sixth irrigation reduced manning s roughness coefficient n by 20 and 33 4 respectively the higher the discharge the higher the flow depth and the lower the value of manning n similar results were reported by xu et al 2019 according to the studies of mailapali et al 2008 and kamali et al 2018 the manning s roughness coefficient in bare and vegetated furrows has an inverse relationship with inflow discharge on the other side the manning equation eq 3 demonstrates that there is an inverse relationship between the inflow rate and the manning s roughness coefficient which is consistent with the results of the present study however the effect of successive irrigation on the smoothness of the furrow soil surface is another reason of decreasing the value of the manning n during the growing season the number of successive irrigations typically reduces the value of the manning n 3 3 parameterization of the model for irrigation events the observed and estimated values of runoff infiltration and advance time are presented in table 4 the software simulated runoff infiltration and advance time with a high correlation r 2 of 1 0 9445 and 0 9708 respectively fig 3 the re values were 5 60 5 09 and 2 14 in estimating runoff infiltration and advance time respectively table 5 previous studies bautista et al 2012 gillies et al 2010 anwar et al 2016 indicated that the winsrfr software could predict the advance time and runoff of furrow irrigation systems with acceptable accuracy which is consistent with the results of this research in our particular experiments the software overestimates the runoff λ 1 056 and the advance time λ 1 0214 but it underestimates infiltration λ 0 9491 the value of λ close to 1 and re close to zero indicate a good performance of the software the highest accuracy in estimating runoff belong to the afi sfi1 1 sfi1 2 ffi and cfi methods respectively table 5 the highest accuracies in infiltration estimation are related to the afi ffi sfi1 2 sfi1 1 and cfi methods respectively table 5 therefore the best and poorest estimates of runoff and infiltration are related to the afi and cfi methods respectively the highest model accuracy in estimating advance time was obtained for sfi1 1 sfi1 2 cfi ffi and afi methods irrigation respectively table 5 hence sfi1 1 and afi methods represent the best and weakest model estimates for the advance time the mean value of rmse in estimating advance time was 4 6 4 6 4 7 6 3 and 5 8 min for the cfi sfi1 1 sfi1 2 ffi and afi methods respectively table 6 accordingly the software simulated the advance times of the surge irrigation methods with higher accuracy than those of the alternate methods chen et al 2012 sayari et al 2017 and xu et al 2019 also reported that the winsrfr software had good accuracy and small error in simulating advance times 3 4 sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation with winsrfr software the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 7 the highest sensitivity effects on the application efficiency ae belong to inflow rate 0 98 and the cutoff time 0 61 the lowest effect on ae was obtained for the furrow slope with a sensitivity coefficient of 0 001 the manning s roughness coefficient had no effect on ae the results showed that among the parameters of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation the highest sensitivity is related to the final infiltration rate the highest effect of the final infiltration rate is on the deep percolation and minimum irrigation adequacy with a sensitivity coefficient of 0 67 based on the sensitivity analysis of the manning s roughness coefficient this coefficient has a negligible effect on the other output parameters except for the advance time the results of the sensitivity analysis in this study are consistent with previous similar studies zerihun et al 1996 ebrahimian et al 2020 3 5 furrow irrigation performance indicators table 8 presents the furrow irrigation performance indicators the average performance indices of the five furrow irrigation methods were compared between three irrigation events the results revealed that the minimum and maximum values of ae pae min and pae lq were obtained in cfi 62 0 60 3 and 61 9 respectively and afi 78 7 69 5 and 74 1 respectively respectively the average values of runoff and deep percolation losses were 35 7 and 2 3 in cfi respectively these values were 19 5 and 1 8 in afi respectively the lowest and highest values of du lq belonged to afi 92 5 and cfi 96 9 respectively in the afi method the high ae and the low difference between du lq and pae lq are due to the proper management and the appropriate use of the irrigation system the high difference 35 0 of these two parameters in cfi indicates poor irrigation management and caused large water losses in the field in addition to ae and du irrigation adequacy is also important in the design and assessment of irrigation systems the values of ae ro dp pae min and pae lq were 64 9 33 7 1 4 61 8 and 63 6 for sfi1 1 and 64 2 34 2 1 6 61 1 and 62 7 for sfi1 2 respectively after the afi method sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 had better performance the values of ad min were 97 8 94 6 and 94 9 in the cfi sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 methods respectively indicating that deficit irrigation did not occur in these irrigation methods because of the high consumed water more than the requirement level in the ffi and afi methods however the mean values of ad min were 92 3 and 86 6 respectively suggesting the occurrence of deficit irrigation in the alternate methods under water shortage conditions deficit irrigation increases both the area under cultivation and water productivity leading to water savings the highest 98 6 and the least 92 7 ad lq values were observed in the cfi and afi methods some studies smith et al 2005 lalehzari et al 2015 kifle et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 reported that increasing the flow cutoff time increased irrigation losses particularly runoff and reduced ae by exceeding the required irrigation depth in this study ae showed a descending trend in the third ninth and sixth assessment times in the different irrigation methods due to increasing the inflow rate and cutoff times rising trends were also observed in distribution uniformity and irrigation adequacy the present study revealed that afi and cfi were the best and worst furrow irrigation methods respectively the low values of the performance indices particularly ae in the cfi method were caused by the difference between the values of du lq and pae lq suggesting poor irrigation management thus proper measures such as proper determination of irrigation depth and inflow rate cutoff time furrow length time based on the field specifications as well as training farmers and irrigators are among the strategies for improving the ae level consequently performance evaluation of irrigation systems awareness of the status quo and providing applicable solutions in the field will help provide more uniform and effective use of water in the field 3 6 analysis of furrow irrigation performance to increase ae and du and reduce dp and runoff losses furrow irrigation performance indicators ae and du under the experimental field conditions were compared with the values optimized with the iso performance curves of the winsrfr software table 9 ae values under the field conditions were between 62 0 cfi and 78 7 afi assuming the minimum uniformity of distribution in the current conditions field experiments is maintained between 86 5 afi and 94 5 cfi and by combining the contour map of application efficiency and distribution uniformity the optimal application efficiency of different irrigation treatments was varied between 66 6 cfi and 80 7 afi ae could not be increased more than this value 80 7 regarding the field properties such as furrow geometry and soil characteristics the greatest improvement in application efficiency was observed in cfi sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 by 8 2 8 1 and 8 respectively in the current research the iso performance curves of the irrigation system were employed as a new and effective management tool to improve the irrigation system performance in studies on optimizing inflow rate and cutoff time khatri et al 2007 morris et al 2015 anwar et al 2016 akbar et al 2016 nie et al 2019 it was concluded that the management of inflow rate and cutoff time could improve furrow irrigation performance which is in agreement with our results 4 conclusion the present study examined and analyzed sensitivity of furrow irrigation to winsrfr software input parameters and performance of different furrow irrigation methods we also evaluated the parametrization of the winsrfr software to improve the performance of different furrow irrigation systems in the southwest iran sensitivity analysis revealed that furrow irrigation was the most sensitive to inflow rate cutoff time and the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation parameters to achieve reliable results therefore these parameters should be measured with acceptable accuracy the highest effect of manning s roughness coefficient was obtained on the flow advance time by conducting the field experiments and software parameterization software could simulate runoff infiltration and advance time with good accuracy at relative errors of 5 60 5 09 and 2 14 respectively in estimating runoff and infiltration the best and poorest performance of the software were observed for the afi and cfi methods respectively the software estimated the advance time with the highest and lowest accuracies in the sfi1 1 and afi methods respectively the performance of different surge and alternate furrow irrigation methods is evaluated using the winsrfr software according to the results the best and poorest performance corresponded to the variable alternate irrigation and conventional furrow irrigation methods respectively hence afi is recommended in the studied area after the afi method the sfi1 1 and sfi1 2 methods had better performance than the cfi and ffi methods changing the inflow rate from 0 35 to 0 34 l s and the cutoff time from 300 to 304 min increased the application efficiency from 62 0 to 66 6 in cfi also changing the inflow rate from 0 35 to 0 34 l s and the cutoff time from 300 to 320 min in sfi1 1 increased the application efficiency from 64 9 to 69 7 thus furrow irrigation performance was improved by managing the cutoff time and the inflow rate in this study winsrfr software was well established and parameterized which led to sufficient agreement between the field observations and the model outputs for furrow irrigation this software improved the performance of the different furrow irrigation methods conventional surge and alternate in the study area declaration of competing

9154,efficient irrigation scheduling is crucial for both improving crop production and saving irrigation water use in arid semi arid agricultural regions threatened by water shortage and soil salinity however irrigation scheduling optimization is hindered by the uncertainties of data and optimization model and adopting the optimal irrigation scheduling is subject to farmers acceptance to effectively tackle these challenges this paper presents a novel human machine interactive framework for real time irrigation scheduling ris the developed modeling framework couples a simulation optimization model irrigation farmers and a data assimilation procedure within the human machine interactive framework for ris the proposed approach is capable of 1 searching optimal irrigation scheduling through the simulation optimization model 2 making actual irrigation decisions based on farmers experiences knowledge behaviors or optimal solutions and 3 updating soil water content based on the model simulations and real time observations at each time period the ris is applied to a real world case in a typical arid agricultural region of china based on the comparisons with historical irrigation records and a tradition simulation optimization model the proposed ris can not only achieve higher economic benefit with less irrigation water allocation quotas but also improve irrigation efficiency this study contributes to the methodology by integrating computer model real time observations and farmers experiences to optimization modeling framework for supporting sustainable irrigation water management keywords irrigation scheduling optimization data assimilation human machine interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally increasing population and water scarcity have put enormous pressure on food production which relies heavily on irrigation to avoid yield loss especially in arid and semi arid areas playán and mateos 2006 we need to improve the irrigation water use efficiency for a sustainable crop production system roy et al 2019 besides irrigation technology advances optimizing irrigation scheduling i e when and how much water to irrigate is an important issue for both research and practice li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 irrigation scheduling is challenging due to the complex interactions between crop yield and profit crop water requirement weather forecast as well as farmers attitude and acceptance to scientifically based recommendations this paper presents a real time irrigation scheduling ris method based on optimization simulation modeling soil moisture observation and assimilation and human machine interaction numerous simulation optimization and coupled simulation optimization models approaches have been widely used to address irrigation scheduling problem akhtar et al 2013 allam et al 2016 li 2018 singh 2012 wen et al 2017 process based simulation models e g aquacrop model linker et al 2016 pawar et al 2017 environmental policy integrated climate model gao et al 2017a and soil water assessment tool swat model chen et al 2019 sun and ren 2014 search for the optimal irrigation scheduling by testing numerous scenarios of irrigation timing by the models optimization models determine the optimal irrigation scheduling given prescribed objective s and constraints using the various algorithms such as dynamic programming epperson et al 1993 linear nonlinear programming garg and dadhich 2014 stochastic programming li et al 2019 and procedures based artificial intelligence gonzález perea et al 2016 noory et al 2012 to improve the reality of modeling results singh 2015 simulation and optimization models are coupled to decide irrigation scheduling cai et al 2003 chen et al 2016 li et al 2018 nguyen et al 2017 wen et al 2017 one outstanding issue to use these models for real time irrigation scheduling is the accuracy of their results which are often subject to systematic bias data assimilation da is an efficient approach to assimilate real time observation data and to dynamically reconcile the modeling states multiple da algorithms have been used to improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulations and crop modeling dumedah and walker 2017 fu et al 2014 2019 2022 nair and indu 2019 silvestro et al 2017 yu et al 2014 lu et al 2021 rahman et al 2022 kwon et al 2022 for example huang et al 2016 proposed an advanced data assimilation method enks ensemble kalman smoother to estimate soil moisture soil temperature and surface turbulent fluxes abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 developed an integrated particle batch smooth data assimilation approach and applied it to land surface model to simulate soil moisture and predict daily to seasonal irrigation amount the ensemble kalman filter enkf is a computationally efficient algorithm that can deal with nonlinearity and high dimensionality in soil dynamics and has been one of the most commonly used algorithms in soil moisture assimilation additional applications on soil moisture and irrigation modeling in some popularly used models include wit and diepen 2007 assimilated soil moisture observations into the wofost crop model li et al 2017 used enkf to assimilate the soil moisture from soil moisture active passive smap into boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps for improving the estimation of the global gross primary production irmak and kamble 2009 developed an et data assimilation scheme to optimize the parameters of soil water atmosphere plant swap for irrigation management li et al 2018 assimilated soil water content measured into community land model by local ensemble transform kalman filter for real time irrigation scheduling scheme despite the wide applications of da in soil moisture modeling according to the authors knowledge few studies use da with an integrated simulation optimization model to support real time irrigation scheduling furthermore previous irrigation scheduling studies provide useful guidelines to farmers for their real world irrigation scheduling decisions however these studies do not make their model directly interact with the decision makers at all time windows during the irrigation season thus they are limited in supporting real time irrigation scheduling in the real world farmers rarely follow the model suggested time and amount of irrigation application through the entire irrigation season the actual irrigation decision making by farmers depend on many factors some of which are difficult to be considered in a computer based optimization model such as policies bontemps and couture 2002 brown and rogers 2006 and the various impacts of farmers age education attitude and knowledge toward irrigation scheduling karami 2006 moreno et al 2007 thus farmers still largely rely on their own experiences knowledge behavior in real irrigation scheduling in addition farmers feedbacks to the irrigation scheduling suggestions from the optimization model are usually ignored hence such suggestions are not widely accepted in practice rose et al 2016 tapsuwan et al 2015 although some efforts have been undertaken to reduce the gap between simulation models and farmers irrigation decision support needs pande and savenije 2016 van emmerik et al 2014 little progress has been made in incorporating sufficient mental details of farmers into computer models bierkens 2015 especially optimization models as indicated by o keeffe et al 2018 incorporating the insights and experiences of farmers directly into an irrigation scheduling decision support model can improve the model s realism to this end a real time irrigation schedule ris based on human machine interactive is proposed in this study to allow online interactions between the models and the decision makers in each time window such a human machine interaction method has been demonstrated in other agricultural decision support systems rose et al 2018 and reservoir operation support systems zhang et al 2021 in summary this study integrates process based simulation model computer model a data assimilation method and a human computer interaction method into an optimization framework to support real time irrigation scheduling this method will allow the assimilation of soil moisture observations and incorporation of farmers choices into the modeling which is expected to improve the model realism and meanwhile to provide farmers with the improved and more realistic recommendations of irrigation timing and amount during the irrigation seasons to demonstrate its applicability the proposed ris is applied to a real world case study area in the hetao irrigation district located in northeastern china 2 methodology 2 1 overview the ris framework consists of four major components 1 an optimization module 2 a human computer interactive process 3 a simulation module based on the process based modeling and 4 data assimilation fig 1 shows a flow chart of the framework especially the connection and information flow among all the components optimal daily irrigation scheduling will be derived from the simulation optimization model with the given objective function and various constraints including irrigation rules in existing real time irrigation scheduling models it is usually assumed that farmers will adopt the optimal irrigation schedule from the optimization model however in the real decision making process even with an effective model available farmers may not follow the optimal irrigation schedules from the optimization model thus the actual irrigation decisions i e a series of irrigation events during the irrigation season are determined via the human computer interactive method based on the results from the simulation optimization model as well as farmers choices based on their experiences knowledge and behaviors fig 1 in this paper as an illustrative example we set a testing rule for farmers to adopt the computer recommended application i e when the daily harvest index is less than a threshold harvest index which reflects farmers expectation for crop yield based on history records farmers will make their own decision otherwise farmers will follow the computer recommendations other testing rules can be considered which eventually depend on farmers experiences with the modeling framework actual irrigation application in a time window is used as input for the agro hydrological simulation model enhanced by soil moisture observation through data assimilation specifically the initial states of the simulation optimization model at the next time period will be updated through data assimilation based on soil moisture observations and the actual irrigation application within the current time period this method is new by directly linking irrigation farmers with a real time integrated optimization and simulation model via assimilation of soil moisture observations the computer model runs by rolling time windows for each time window one day it assimilates the observation of soil moisture and adopts the actual irrigation application farmers make which can be the same or different from the model recommendations at the end of the time window and then moves to next meanwhile the user a farmer checks the recommended application including no irrigation release from the model during each time window and decides to take it or not based on their own justification framers actual application of water for irrigation at some time windows will affect soil moisture which will be observed by soil moisture sensors and assimilated to the crop water simulation modeling thus the data assimilation procedure plays a key linkage between human and machine previously published irrigation scheduling decision support systems dss also tackled irrigation scheduling using optimization simulation and data assimilation e g ines et al 2006 combined remote sensing simulation modeling and genetic algorithm optimization for irrigation water management options han et al 2016 update soil hydraulic properties together with soil moisture in the community land model clm using the local ensemble transform kalman filter to obtain irrigation scheduling however those dsss usually assume that the optimal irrigation scheduling is strictly followed by the farmers and mainly aim to tackle the uncertainties of process based modeling and observations rather than the uncertainties of farmers irrigation decision making they can provide decision support information which can be used or not by the real user a farmer but they do not track the actual decisions made by the users 2 2 real time simulation optimization model optimization algorithms have been proved to be effective to find the optimal irrigation strategies with an explicit objective function such as maximizing economic benefits subject to essential and constraints cai and rosegrant 2004 cai et al 2003 li et al 2020 in this paper a rule based irrigation schedule is optimized to provide irrigation decisions based on daily soil water content information the rules are based on a water stress indicator and the crop yield simulated by the environmental policy integrated climate epic model williams and j c a 1989 which is involved in the objective function of the optimization model in the process of irrigation decision making the optimized irrigation schedule is obtained through the optimization model the iterative simulation model is used to take the irrigation schedule as the input and output of simulation model is performed as the state variable of the irrigation decision model in the next time period 2 2 1 epic model the epic model is a comprehensive dynamic processed based model for quantitative evaluation of the climate soil crop management system which has been widely used in the world the crop growth module is a mechanism model based on the physiological and ecological processes of crops which simulates the daily phenological development of crops the parameters data required by the epic crop module have been verified by a number of studies gao et al 2017b liu 2020

also foretells the future irrigation applications based on a normal weather climate projection in the rest of the irrigation season iw t 1 iw t which will be updated in days t 1 t respectively the normal irrigation season iw t 1 iw t is obtained by simulation optimization model based on daily meteorological data on day t 1 day t the objective function of the optimization model is to maximize

bounds for irrigation water amount maximum available irrigation water amount q and salt accumulation during the growth stage for the case study area this paper assumes that soil salt accumulation should be less than 640 mg l from the crop planting day to the harvest day based on the assessment in li et al 2020 2b i w min i w t i w max 2c t 1 t i w t q 2d c sr beg c s r e n d 640 where iwt is

the ratio of ma at a time period and the saturated soil moisture content mf water stress means the soil water content reduce below the saturated soil moisture content λ is used to determine whether irrigation is needed based on an empirical threshold e g 60 80 of mf for the case study area based on farmers experiences and expert suggestions in the area which can be changed based on users input if λ an empirical threshold then irrigation with the amount to be determined by ris else 2e 2 2 3 no irrigation a genetic algorithm ga is used in this study to find the optimal daily irrigation water

the field and their impacts on crop yield an integrated model has been developed to describe the complexly coupled agro hydrological water salt dynamic and crop production processes here we employed the agricultural water productivity model for shallow groundwater awpm sg gao et al 2017a to calculate water salt dynamic recharge between soil and groundwater the soil profile is divided into soil

accuracy of simulation models is still a challenge in addition in order to obtain a more accurate result data assimilation da is used to utilize information gained from both hydrological models and observations synergistically the soil moisture that couples atmospheric and crop growth processes is usually changed significantly by irrigation gravimetric method sensors neutron scattering technique satellite based observation products etc have been applied to measuring soil moisture bittelli 2011 in the paper the data assimilation method assimilates the soil moisture observations with the agro hydrological simulation model to update the soil water content at the next period the ensemble kalman filter enkf combines the prior model uncertainty and observational uncertainty to improve estimation of the model state i e soil water content the enkf is a two step process consisting of forecasting and updating processes given by the following 4a ψ t 1 t n f ψ t t n γ ω t n ω t n n 0 u t

specified diagonal covariance matrix r t 1 the standard derivation of model state errors and observation errors are set as 0 05 and 0 01 respectively the observation errors 0 01 comes from sensors data comparatively we assume the standard derivation of model state errors is 0 05 the assumption needs additional work to test and it is worth studying in the future h is the measurement operator which maps the state to the observation in enkf the updated states may violate some constraints such as nonnegativity and maximum water availability in the study the forecast and updated ensemble member of the soil water content are constraint below the field capacity so constrained ensemble kalman filter cenkf is proposed to deal with the violations wang et al 2009 cenkf with the accept reject method developed by wang et al 2009 is an efficient algorithm with good performances in estimation quality and the computational time cenkf could check the violation of all the constraints in the forecasted and updated states respectively we set the ensemble size to 100 and the assimilation interval to one day 3 case study 3 1 study area the hetao irrigation distract hid 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e is located in the upper reach of the yellow river basin of northwestern china the hid has a total irrigation area of 570 000 ha and a very flat slopes of 0 02 xu et al 2010 as the third largest irrigation district in china hid is one of the major sunflower production regions a sunflower field from shahaoqu experimental station in hid fig 3 is selected to test the ris the area has an arid and semi arid climate with annual average precipitation of 160 mm and mean yearly pan evaporation of 2200 mm irrigation in the hid mainly depends on the yellow river with annual 4 7 109 m3 chen et al 2020 the groundwater level is relatively shallow ranging from 0 5 to 3 0 m during a year due to massive water pumping and poor drainage the groundwater mainly moves vertically because of the low gradient currently soil salinization has been a key issue for the agro ecosystems of the area under saline yellow river irrigation water and saline shallow groundwater 3 2 data the sunflower field is planted on june 1 2017 and june 5 2018 harvest on september 15 in both years covering 2213 m2 daily meteorological data such as air temperature relative humidity wind speed is obtained by the weather station at the shahaoqu experimental station the daily average soil water content observations in 2018 and 2017 are provided at the depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm during the growth stage by using hydra probe soil sensors stevens water monitoring system inc portland or usa liu et al 2020 the time step in the simulation process was also set to one day and the actual root zone observed soil moisture data were assimilated into the dynamic soil water flow salt simulation model for each assimilation interval the real time soil water content observations are the combination of historical observations and virtual observations optimal soil water content table 1 provides a list of parameters used in the modeling framework the soil is assumed to be homogeneous the crop net price pc comes from agricultural product price net in china yield responses factory comes from allen et al 1998 and the other parameters data comes from gao et al 2017b and liu 2020 4 results the irrigation scheduling derived from the proposed ris is compared to that from a traditional simulation optimization model i e without data assimilation and human computer interaction as well as the historical irrigation records in real world hereafter we refer the irrigation scheduling from the traditional simulation optimization as optimal solution as mentioned before in the study we assume that farmers follow a recommended irrigation application when the harvest index eq 1b is higher than the harvest index threshold otherwise they decide if and how much to irrigation within a particular time window based on their own justification in the paper as an illustrative example in the optimal module of the developed model and the automatic optimal model irrigation is applied when the λ is lower than 0 7 equation 1e specially in 2017 the soil salt accumulation constraint eq 2d is used by the c s r end c s r beg 640 because the soil salt accumulation increased under water shortage of 255 mm total available water quotas the irrigation scheduling from the ris simulation optimization model and the historical records in 2018 and 2017 are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 in 2018 the historical records fig 4c include five irrigation applications on days 16 20 41 48 and 88 and with irrigation depths of 134 mm 60 mm 114 mm 40 mm and 130 mm respectively the total irrigation water amount is 4780 m3 ha and the profit is 24 750 5 yuan ha the optimal solution fig 4b with a constraint of 478 mm total available water quotas results in three irrigation applications on days 16 53 80 with irrigation depths of 139 9 mm 149 9 mm and 148 7 mm of water application respectively the total irrigation water amount is 4389 m3 ha and the profit is 23 470 4 yuan ha compared to the historical record the simulation optimization model achieves an 8 irrigation water saving but a 5 decrease in the profit such results follow the constraint of total water availability and a maximum allowed soil salinity accumulation set in the optimization model due to the salinity constraint a certain amount of water is used for salt leaching the soil salt accumulation change of 1 48 g l i e the salt concentration is reduced during the growth stage from the simulation optimization model satisfies the soil salt accumulation constraint 0 64 g l the optimal solution shows larger salinity leaching than the historical record 1 21 g l less amount of water use 4389 m3 ha vs 4780 m3 ha and slightly lower profit 23 470 40 yuan ha vs 24 750 53 yuan ha in the real world farmers in the irrigation district use large amount of water for leaching which may cause groundwater level increase i e waterlogging and bring additional salt to crop root zone ren et al 2019 the irrigation scheduling from the ris fig 4a suggests six irrigation applications on days 16 20 44 58 75 and 76 with irrigation depths of 152 50 mm 60 mm 152 19 mm 39 82 mm 7 80 mm and 44 64 mm respectively note that the application on day 20 follows the historical record all other applications follow the optimal solutions with some slight differences which are probably caused by the randomness of the ga solution and or the improved simulation by the data assimilation procedures the total irrigation water amount is 4572 m3 ha and the profit is 25 008 80 yuan ha compared to the historical records the ris ends with a lower irrigation water use and a higher profit compared to the traditional simulation optimization model the proposed modeling framework increases the profit by 7 with 4 increase of irrigation water use the ris solution shows slightly smaller salinity leaching 1 14 g l than the historical record 1 21 g l less amount of water use 4572 m3 ha vs 4780 m3 ha and higher profit 25 008 80 yuan ha vs 24 750 53 yuan ha in 2017 the historical records have two irrigation applications on days 26 53 and with irrigation depths of 134 mm 121 mm respectively fig 5c the total irrigation water amount is 2551 m3 ha and the profit is 24 094 10 yuan ha the optimal solution with a constraint of 255 mm total available water quotas results in four irrigation applications on days 27 45 79 90 with irrigation depths of 120 0 mm 106 1 mm 19 5 mm and 9 1 mm respectively fig 5b the total irrigation water amount is 2548 m3 ha and the profit is 24 127 60 yuan ha the soil salt increased 0 34 g l during the growth stage compared to the historical record the simulation optimization model have higher profit the soil salt accumulation 0 23 g l is less during the growth stage from the simulation optimization model the irrigation scheduling from the ris suggests four irrigation applications on days 26 48 66 98 with irrigation depths of 134 0 mm 86 5 mm 26 3 mm and 7 4 mm respectively fig 5a note that the application on day 26 follows the historical record all other applications follow the optimal solutions the total irrigation water amount is 2543 m3 ha and the profit is 24 381 52 yuan ha compared to the historical records the ris ends with a higher profit and the soil salt accumulation change of 0 18 g l is less than the historical records during the growth stage from the ris model overall the ris combines simulation optimization model observation human consideration and ends with higher profit 5 discussion 5 1 model performance comparison under different water availability conditions we further investigate the results of the ris and the simulation optimization model under different irrigation water availability levels in 2018 fig 6 and table 2 and 2017 fig 7 and table 3 which are set as 100 80 and 60 of the total historical irrigation water use the objective function for the optimization model are the same as in section 2 2 1 the results suggest that the irrigation quotas significantly affect irrigation timing as well as the crop yield and profit figs 6 7 and tables 2 3 similar to the results in section 4 ris combines some irrigation applications recommended by the simulation optimization model and some from the historical records as shown in fig 6a under a 20 reduction of irrigation quota ris suggests five irrigation applications the farmer chooses to follow the recommended application on day 16 switches to their own choices on day 20 when the crop harvest index is lower than the threshold and comes back to follow the recommended applications on days 45 56 and 72 under a 40 reduction of the irrigation quota fig 6b the number of irrigation applications recommended by the proposed model increases to nine but with a less irrigation depth in each of the application events the number of irrigation applications with reduced water availability from the ris is larger than that with the 100 water quota and the irrigation depth decreases largely for each applications this suggests that more frequent applications should be taken even with small water depths when the total amount of water available for irrigation is limited this is reasonable since small amount of water applications can reduce drainage and deep percolation and thus increase field irrigation efficiency and reduce waterlogging which brings salt from groundwater to the crop root zone as shown in table 2 the yield with less irrigation depths from the ris is larger than that from the simulation optimization model this is consistent from previous studies e g aujla et al 2007 singandhupe et al 2003 who stated that low volume but more frequent irrigation applications tended to increase crop yield and save water table 2 shows total irrigation water amount salt accumulation crop yield and profit from the optimization model and ris under 100 80 and 60 of water use of the historical records of 2018 compared to the numbers from the historical records compared to the optimal solution the ris is able to produce more profit with less water under the two scenarios with reduced irrigation water quotas compared to the historical scheduling ris results in a large amount of water saving at a relatively small expense of profit specifically with ris the total irrigation water use is reduced by 28 with 6 of profit loss with the 80 water quota scenario the irrigation water saving reaches to 42 with 10 profit loss under the 60 water quota scenario as shown in table 2 the salt accumulation from ris decreases from 1 14 to 0 67 g l when the irrigation amount is reduced from 4572 m3 ha to 2756 m3 ha the irrigation water amount reduced will increase salt accumulation also it is found that further reducing the irrigation water quota will cause a violation of the soil salinity constraints the implies that the soil salinity control puts an upper limit for irrigation water saving especially in regions with shallow saline groundwater differently 60 of the total historical irrigation water use is too few for plant growth and do not satisfied the salt constraints similar to the results in section 4 ris combines some irrigation applications recommended by the simulation optimization model and some from the historical records in 2017 historical records as shown in fig 7a under a 20 reduction of irrigation quota ris suggests three irrigation applications the farmer chooses to their own choices on day 26 and comes back to follow the recommended applications on days 49 85 as shown in table 3 with ris the total irrigation water use is reduced by 20 with 5 of profit loss with the 80 water quota scenario but the salt accumulation from ris increases 0 46 g l it means less irrigation water quota will cause soil salt accumulation 5 2 crop water productivity vs irrigation water productivity under different water availability conditions in the study crop water productivity cwp is defined as the yield per unit of evapotranspiration irrigation water productivity iwp is defined as the yield per unit of irrigation water use during the crop growth season sadras 2009 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 significant differences were found in the water productivity in different irrigation scheduling in 2018 and 2017 fig 8 the crop water productivity from optimal solution under 100 80 and 60 irrigation water quotas in 2018 is 1 93 kg m 3 1 91 kg m 3 and 1 88 kg m 3 respectively which are close to the values from ris 1 93 kg m 3 1 90 kg m 3 and 1 87 kg m 3 also the crop water productivity from optimal solution under 100 80 irrigation water quotas in 2017 is 1 86 kg m 3 1 79 kg m 3 respectively which are close to the values from ris 1 90 kg m 3 1 90 kg m 3 the crop water productivity from the historical record is 1 93 kg m 3 and 1 88 kg m 3 in 2018 and 2017 the decrease of water quota reduces crop water productivity the irrigation water productivity from the historical record in 2018 and 2017 is 1 32 kg m 3 and 2 38 kg m 3 in comparison the irrigation water productivity from ris is significantly higher than that of historical record and the optimal solution under 100 80 and 60 irrigation water quotas in all years we also identify a significant increasing trend of iwp with declining irrigation water quota which is consistent with previous studies huo et al 2012 sun et al 2006 i e iwp can be improved with moderate deficit irrigation among the investigated irrigation scheduling the one generated from ris under 80 irrigation water quota of 2017 has the highest irrigation water productivity these results thus indicate that the proposed ris performs better under more restricted irrigation water availability 6 conclusions in this study we develop a human machine interactive method for real time irrigation scheduling ris the method is based simulation optimization model that includes complex agro hydrology system interactions between crop growth soil water groundwater and soil salinity and link the model directly with irrigation farmers via assimilating soil moisture observations this method combines model observation and human justification into an online rolling over framework throughout the irrigation season the method is applied to a case study site in hetao irrigation district in northwestern china with arid semi arid climate and shallow saline groundwater the results from the ris are compared to the optimal solution from the simulation optimization model and the historical irrigation records it is found that ris can use less irrigation water and result in larger profit than the historical records while remaining similar salt leaching results overall the ris ends with higher irrigation water productivity the ris based on human machine interactions can be applied to other irrigation districts with soil moisture observation to support more effective real time irrigation scheduling in future studies the proposed method will be tested to a real time irrigation season in the case study area with farmers involvement in particular farmers behaviors in irrigation decisions underlying weather uncertainty policy regulation and market variability will be addressed to develop more

9154,efficient irrigation scheduling is crucial for both improving crop production and saving irrigation water use in arid semi arid agricultural regions threatened by water shortage and soil salinity however irrigation scheduling optimization is hindered by the uncertainties of data and optimization model and adopting the optimal irrigation scheduling is subject to farmers acceptance to effectively tackle these challenges this paper presents a novel human machine interactive framework for real time irrigation scheduling ris the developed modeling framework couples a simulation optimization model irrigation farmers and a data assimilation procedure within the human machine interactive framework for ris the proposed approach is capable of 1 searching optimal irrigation scheduling through the simulation optimization model 2 making actual irrigation decisions based on farmers experiences knowledge behaviors or optimal solutions and 3 updating soil water content based on the model simulations and real time observations at each time period the ris is applied to a real world case in a typical arid agricultural region of china based on the comparisons with historical irrigation records and a tradition simulation optimization model the proposed ris can not only achieve higher economic benefit with less irrigation water allocation quotas but also improve irrigation efficiency this study contributes to the methodology by integrating computer model real time observations and farmers experiences to optimization modeling framework for supporting sustainable irrigation water management keywords irrigation scheduling optimization data assimilation human machine interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally increasing population and water scarcity have put enormous pressure on food production which relies heavily on irrigation to avoid yield loss especially in arid and semi arid areas playán and mateos 2006 we need to improve the irrigation water use efficiency for a sustainable crop production system roy et al 2019 besides irrigation technology advances optimizing irrigation scheduling i e when and how much water to irrigate is an important issue for both research and practice li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 irrigation scheduling is challenging due to the complex interactions between crop yield and profit crop water requirement weather forecast as well as farmers attitude and acceptance to scientifically based recommendations this paper presents a real time irrigation scheduling ris method based on optimization simulation modeling soil moisture observation and assimilation and human machine interaction numerous simulation optimization and coupled simulation optimization models approaches have been widely used to address irrigation scheduling problem akhtar et al 2013 allam et al 2016 li 2018 singh 2012 wen et al 2017 process based simulation models e g aquacrop model linker et al 2016 pawar et al 2017 environmental policy integrated climate model gao et al 2017a and soil water assessment tool swat model chen et al 2019 sun and ren 2014 search for the optimal irrigation scheduling by testing numerous scenarios of irrigation timing by the models optimization models determine the optimal irrigation scheduling given prescribed objective s and constraints using the various algorithms such as dynamic programming epperson et al 1993 linear nonlinear programming garg and dadhich 2014 stochastic programming li et al 2019 and procedures based artificial intelligence gonzález perea et al 2016 noory et al 2012 to improve the reality of modeling results singh 2015 simulation and optimization models are coupled to decide irrigation scheduling cai et al 2003 chen et al 2016 li et al 2018 nguyen et al 2017 wen et al 2017 one outstanding issue to use these models for real time irrigation scheduling is the accuracy of their results which are often subject to systematic bias data assimilation da is an efficient approach to assimilate real time observation data and to dynamically reconcile the modeling states multiple da algorithms have been used to improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulations and crop modeling dumedah and walker 2017 fu et al 2014 2019 2022 nair and indu 2019 silvestro et al 2017 yu et al 2014 lu et al 2021 rahman et al 2022 kwon et al 2022 for example huang et al 2016 proposed an advanced data assimilation method enks ensemble kalman smoother to estimate soil moisture soil temperature and surface turbulent fluxes abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 developed an integrated particle batch smooth data assimilation approach and applied it to land surface model to simulate soil moisture and predict daily to seasonal irrigation amount the ensemble kalman filter enkf is a computationally efficient algorithm that can deal with nonlinearity and high dimensionality in soil dynamics and has been one of the most commonly used algorithms in soil moisture assimilation additional applications on soil moisture and irrigation modeling in some popularly used models include wit and diepen 2007 assimilated soil moisture observations into the wofost crop model li et al 2017 used enkf to assimilate the soil moisture from soil moisture active passive smap into boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps for improving the estimation of the global gross primary production irmak and kamble 2009 developed an et data assimilation scheme to optimize the parameters of soil water atmosphere plant swap for irrigation management li et al 2018 assimilated soil water content measured into community land model by local ensemble transform kalman filter for real time irrigation scheduling scheme despite the wide applications of da in soil moisture modeling according to the authors knowledge few studies use da with an integrated simulation optimization model to support real time irrigation scheduling furthermore previous irrigation scheduling studies provide useful guidelines to farmers for their real world irrigation scheduling decisions however these studies do not make their model directly interact with the decision makers at all time windows during the irrigation season thus they are limited in supporting real time irrigation scheduling in the real world farmers rarely follow the model suggested time and amount of irrigation application through the entire irrigation season the actual irrigation decision making by farmers depend on many factors some of which are difficult to be considered in a computer based optimization model such as policies bontemps and couture 2002 brown and rogers 2006 and the various impacts of farmers age education attitude and knowledge toward irrigation scheduling karami 2006 moreno et al 2007 thus farmers still largely rely on their own experiences knowledge behavior in real irrigation scheduling in addition farmers feedbacks to the irrigation scheduling suggestions from the optimization model are usually ignored hence such suggestions are not widely accepted in practice rose et al 2016 tapsuwan et al 2015 although some efforts have been undertaken to reduce the gap between simulation models and farmers irrigation decision support needs pande and savenije 2016 van emmerik et al 2014 little progress has been made in incorporating sufficient mental details of farmers into computer models bierkens 2015 especially optimization models as indicated by o keeffe et al 2018 incorporating the insights and experiences of farmers directly into an irrigation scheduling decision support model can improve the model s realism to this end a real time irrigation schedule ris based on human machine interactive is proposed in this study to allow online interactions between the models and the decision makers in each time window such a human machine interaction method has been demonstrated in other agricultural decision support systems rose et al 2018 and reservoir operation support systems zhang et al 2021 in summary this study integrates process based simulation model computer model a data assimilation method and a human computer interaction method into an optimization framework to support real time irrigation scheduling this method will allow the assimilation of soil moisture observations and incorporation of farmers choices into the modeling which is expected to improve the model realism and meanwhile to provide farmers with the improved and more realistic recommendations of irrigation timing and amount during the irrigation seasons to demonstrate its applicability the proposed ris is applied to a real world case study area in the hetao irrigation district located in northeastern china 2 methodology 2 1 overview the ris framework consists of four major components 1 an optimization module 2 a human computer interactive process 3 a simulation module based on the process based modeling and 4 data assimilation fig 1 shows a flow chart of the framework especially the connection and information flow among all the components optimal daily irrigation scheduling will be derived from the simulation optimization model with the given objective function and various constraints including irrigation rules in existing real time irrigation scheduling models it is usually assumed that farmers will adopt the optimal irrigation schedule from the optimization model however in the real decision making process even with an effective model available farmers may not follow the optimal irrigation schedules from the optimization model thus the actual irrigation decisions i e a series of irrigation events during the irrigation season are determined via the human computer interactive method based on the results from the simulation optimization model as well as farmers choices based on their experiences knowledge and behaviors fig 1 in this paper as an illustrative example we set a testing rule for farmers to adopt the computer recommended application i e when the daily harvest index is less than a threshold harvest index which reflects farmers expectation for crop yield based on history records farmers will make their own decision otherwise farmers will follow the computer recommendations other testing rules can be considered which eventually depend on farmers experiences with the modeling framework actual irrigation application in a time window is used as input for the agro hydrological simulation model enhanced by soil moisture observation through data assimilation specifically the initial states of the simulation optimization model at the next time period will be updated through data assimilation based on soil moisture observations and the actual irrigation application within the current time period this method is new by directly linking irrigation farmers with a real time integrated optimization and simulation model via assimilation of soil moisture observations the computer model runs by rolling time windows for each time window one day it assimilates the observation of soil moisture and adopts the actual irrigation application farmers make which can be the same or different from the model recommendations at the end of the time window and then moves to next meanwhile the user a farmer checks the recommended application including no irrigation release from the model during each time window and decides to take it or not based on their own justification framers actual application of water for irrigation at some time windows will affect soil moisture which will be observed by soil moisture sensors and assimilated to the crop water simulation modeling thus the data assimilation procedure plays a key linkage between human and machine previously published irrigation scheduling decision support systems dss also tackled irrigation scheduling using optimization simulation and data assimilation e g ines et al 2006 combined remote sensing simulation modeling and genetic algorithm optimization for irrigation water management options han et al 2016 update soil hydraulic properties together with soil moisture in the community land model clm using the local ensemble transform kalman filter to obtain irrigation scheduling however those dsss usually assume that the optimal irrigation scheduling is strictly followed by the farmers and mainly aim to tackle the uncertainties of process based modeling and observations rather than the uncertainties of farmers irrigation decision making they can provide decision support information which can be used or not by the real user a farmer but they do not track the actual decisions made by the users 2 2 real time simulation optimization model optimization algorithms have been proved to be effective to find the optimal irrigation strategies with an explicit objective function such as maximizing economic benefits subject to essential and constraints cai and rosegrant 2004 cai et al 2003 li et al 2020 in this paper a rule based irrigation schedule is optimized to provide irrigation decisions based on daily soil water content information the rules are based on a water stress indicator and the crop yield simulated by the environmental policy integrated climate epic model williams and j c a 1989 which is involved in the objective function of the optimization model in the process of irrigation decision making the optimized irrigation schedule is obtained through the optimization model the iterative simulation model is used to take the irrigation schedule as the input and output of simulation model is performed as the state variable of the irrigation decision model in the next time period 2 2 1 epic model the epic model is a comprehensive dynamic processed based model for quantitative evaluation of the climate soil crop management system which has been widely used in the world the crop growth module is a mechanism model based on the physiological and ecological processes of crops which simulates the daily phenological development of crops the parameters data required by the epic crop module have been verified by a number of studies gao et al 2017b liu 2020

also foretells the future irrigation applications based on a normal weather climate projection in the rest of the irrigation season iw t 1 iw t which will be updated in days t 1 t respectively the normal irrigation season iw t 1 iw t is obtained by simulation optimization model based on daily meteorological data on day t 1 day t the objective function of the optimization model is to maximize

bounds for irrigation water amount maximum available irrigation water amount q and salt accumulation during the growth stage for the case study area this paper assumes that soil salt accumulation

the ratio of ma at a time period and the saturated soil moisture content mf water stress means the soil water content reduce below the saturated soil moisture content λ is used to determine whether irrigation is needed based on an empirical threshold e g 60 80 of mf for the case study area based on farmers experiences and expert suggestions in the area which can be changed based on users input if λ an empirical threshold then irrigation with the amount to be determined by ris else 2e 2 2 3 no irrigation a genetic algorithm ga is used in this study to find the optimal daily irrigation water

the field and their impacts on crop yield an integrated model has been developed to describe the complexly coupled agro hydrological water salt dynamic and crop production processes here we employed the agricultural water productivity model for shallow groundwater awpm sg gao et al 2017a to calculate water salt dynamic recharge between soil and groundwater the soil profile is divided into soil

accuracy of simulation models is still a challenge in addition in order to obtain a more accurate result data assimilation da is used to utilize information gained from both hydrological models and observations synergistically the soil moisture that couples atmospheric and crop growth processes is usually changed significantly by irrigation gravimetric method sensors neutron scattering technique satellite based observation products etc have been applied to measuring soil moisture bittelli 2011 in the paper the data assimilation method assimilates the soil moisture observations with the agro hydrological simulation model to update the soil water content at the next period the ensemble kalman filter enkf combines the prior model uncertainty and observational uncertainty to improve estimation of the model state i e soil water content the enkf is a two step process consisting of forecasting and updating processes given by the following 4a ψ t 1 t n f ψ t t n γ ω t n ω t n n 0 u t

specified diagonal covariance matrix r t 1 the standard derivation of model state errors and observation errors are set as 0 05 and 0 01 respectively the observation errors 0 01 comes from sensors data comparatively we assume the standard derivation of model state errors is 0 05 the assumption needs additional work to test and it is worth studying in the future h is the measurement operator which maps the state to the observation in enkf the updated states may violate some constraints such as nonnegativity and maximum water availability in the study the forecast and updated ensemble member of the soil water content are constraint below the field capacity so constrained ensemble kalman filter cenkf is proposed to deal with the violations wang et al 2009 cenkf with the accept reject method developed by wang et al 2009 is an efficient algorithm with good performances in estimation quality and the computational time cenkf could check the violation of all the constraints in the forecasted and updated states respectively we set the ensemble size to 100 and the assimilation interval to one day 3 case study 3 1 study area the hetao irrigation distract hid 40 19 41 18 n 106 20 109 19 e is located in the upper reach of the yellow river basin of northwestern china the hid has a total irrigation area of 570 000 ha and a very flat slopes of 0 02 xu et al 2010 as the third largest irrigation district in china hid is one of the major sunflower production regions a sunflower field from shahaoqu experimental station in hid fig 3 is selected to test the ris the area has an arid and semi arid climate with annual average precipitation of 160 mm and mean yearly pan evaporation of 2200 mm irrigation in the hid mainly depends on the yellow river with annual 4 7 109 m3 chen et al 2020 the groundwater level is relatively shallow ranging from 0 5 to 3 0 m during a year due to massive water pumping and poor drainage the groundwater mainly moves vertically because of the low gradient currently soil salinization has been a key issue for the agro ecosystems of the area under saline yellow river irrigation water and saline shallow groundwater 3 2 data the sunflower field is planted on june 1 2017 and june 5 2018 harvest on september 15 in both years covering 2213 m2 daily meteorological data such as air temperature relative humidity wind speed is obtained by the weather station at the shahaoqu experimental station the daily average soil water content observations in 2018 and 2017 are provided at the depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm during the growth stage by using hydra probe soil sensors stevens water monitoring system inc portland or usa liu et al 2020 the time step in the simulation process was also set to one day and the actual root zone observed soil moisture data were assimilated into the dynamic soil water flow salt simulation model for each assimilation interval the real time soil water content observations are the combination of historical observations and virtual observations optimal soil water content table 1 provides a list of parameters used in the modeling framework the soil is assumed to be homogeneous the crop net price pc comes from agricultural product price net in china yield responses factory comes from allen et al 1998 and the other parameters data comes from gao et al 2017b and liu 2020 4 results the irrigation scheduling derived from the proposed ris is compared to that from a traditional simulation optimization model i e without data assimilation and human computer interaction as well as the historical irrigation records in real world hereafter we refer the irrigation scheduling from the traditional simulation optimization as optimal solution as mentioned before in the study we assume that farmers follow a recommended irrigation application when the harvest index eq 1b is higher than the harvest index threshold otherwise they decide if and how much to irrigation within a particular time window based on their own justification in the paper as an illustrative example in the optimal module of the developed model and the automatic optimal model irrigation is applied when the λ is lower than 0 7 equation 1e specially in 2017 the soil salt accumulation constraint eq 2d is used by the c s r end c s r beg 640 because the soil salt accumulation increased under water shortage of 255 mm total available water quotas the irrigation scheduling from the ris simulation optimization model and the historical records in 2018 and 2017 are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 in 2018 the historical records fig 4c include five irrigation applications on days 16 20 41 48 and 88 and with irrigation depths of 134 mm 60 mm 114 mm 40 mm and 130 mm respectively the total irrigation water amount is 4780 m3 ha and the profit is 24 750 5 yuan ha the optimal solution fig 4b with a constraint of 478 mm total available water quotas results in three irrigation applications on days 16 53 80 with irrigation depths of 139 9 mm 149 9 mm and 148 7 mm of water application respectively the total irrigation water amount is 4389 m3 ha and the profit is 23 470 4 yuan ha compared to the historical record the simulation optimization model achieves an 8 irrigation water saving but a 5 decrease in the profit such results follow the constraint of total water availability and a maximum allowed soil salinity accumulation set in the optimization model due to the salinity constraint a certain amount of water is used for salt leaching the soil salt accumulation change of 1 48 g l i e the salt concentration is reduced during the growth stage from the simulation optimization model satisfies the soil salt accumulation constraint 0 64 g l the optimal solution shows larger salinity leaching than the historical record 1 21 g l less amount of water use 4389 m3 ha vs 4780 m3 ha and slightly lower profit 23 470 40 yuan ha vs 24 750 53 yuan ha in the real world farmers in the irrigation district use large amount of water for leaching which may cause groundwater level increase i e waterlogging and bring additional salt to crop root zone ren et al 2019 the irrigation scheduling from the ris fig 4a suggests six irrigation applications on days 16 20 44 58 75 and 76 with irrigation depths of 152 50 mm 60 mm 152 19 mm 39 82 mm 7 80 mm and 44 64 mm respectively note that the application on day 20 follows the historical record all other applications follow the optimal solutions with some slight differences which are probably caused by the randomness of the ga solution and or the improved simulation by the data assimilation procedures the total irrigation water amount is 4572 m3 ha and the profit is 25 008 80 yuan ha compared to the historical records the ris ends with a lower irrigation water use and a higher profit compared to the traditional simulation optimization model the proposed modeling framework increases the profit by 7 with 4 increase of irrigation water use the ris solution shows slightly smaller salinity leaching 1 14 g l than the historical record 1 21 g l less amount of water use 4572 m3 ha vs 4780 m3 ha and higher profit 25 008 80 yuan ha vs 24 750 53 yuan ha in 2017 the historical records have two irrigation applications on days 26 53 and with irrigation depths of 134 mm 121 mm respectively fig 5c the total irrigation water amount is 2551 m3 ha and the profit is 24 094 10 yuan ha the optimal solution with a constraint of 255 mm total available water quotas results in four irrigation applications on days 27 45 79 90 with irrigation depths of 120 0 mm 106 1 mm 19 5 mm and 9 1 mm respectively fig 5b the total irrigation water amount is 2548 m3 ha and the profit is 24 127 60 yuan ha the soil salt increased 0 34 g l during the growth stage compared to the historical record the simulation optimization model have higher profit the soil salt accumulation 0 23 g l is less during the growth stage from the simulation optimization model the irrigation scheduling from the ris suggests four irrigation applications on days 26 48 66 98 with irrigation depths of 134 0 mm 86 5 mm 26 3 mm and 7 4 mm respectively fig 5a note that the application on day 26 follows the historical record all other applications follow the optimal solutions the total irrigation water amount is 2543 m3 ha and the profit is 24 381 52 yuan ha compared to the historical records the ris ends with a higher profit and the soil salt accumulation change of 0 18 g l is less than the historical records during the growth stage from the ris model overall the ris combines simulation optimization model observation human consideration and ends with higher profit 5 discussion 5 1 model performance comparison under different water availability conditions we further investigate the results of the ris and the simulation optimization model under different irrigation water availability levels in 2018 fig 6 and table 2 and 2017 fig 7 and table 3 which are set as 100 80 and 60 of the total historical irrigation water use the objective function for the optimization model are the same as in section 2 2 1 the results suggest that the irrigation quotas significantly affect irrigation timing as well as the crop yield and profit figs 6 7 and tables 2 3 similar to the results in section 4 ris combines some irrigation applications recommended by the simulation optimization model and some from the historical records as shown in fig 6a under a 20 reduction of irrigation quota ris suggests five irrigation applications the farmer chooses to follow the recommended application on day 16 switches to their own choices on day 20 when the crop harvest index is lower than the threshold and comes back to follow the recommended applications on days 45 56 and 72 under a 40 reduction of the irrigation quota fig 6b the number of irrigation applications recommended by the proposed model increases to nine but with a less irrigation depth in each of the application events the number of irrigation applications with reduced water availability from the ris is larger than that with the 100 water quota and the irrigation depth decreases largely for each applications this suggests that more frequent applications should be taken even with small water depths when the total amount of water available for irrigation is limited this is reasonable since small amount of water applications can reduce drainage and deep percolation and thus increase field irrigation efficiency and reduce waterlogging which brings salt from groundwater to the crop root zone as shown in table 2 the yield with less irrigation depths from the ris is larger than that from the simulation optimization model this is consistent from previous studies e g aujla et al 2007 singandhupe et al 2003 who stated that low volume but more frequent irrigation applications tended to increase crop yield and save water table 2 shows total irrigation water amount salt accumulation crop yield and profit from the optimization model and ris under 100 80 and 60 of water use of the historical records of 2018 compared to the numbers from the historical records compared to the optimal solution the ris is able to produce more profit with less water under the two scenarios with reduced irrigation water quotas compared to the historical scheduling ris results in a large amount of water saving at a relatively small expense of profit specifically with ris the total irrigation water use is reduced by 28 with 6 of profit loss with the 80 water quota scenario the irrigation water saving reaches to 42 with 10 profit loss under the 60 water quota scenario as shown in table 2 the salt accumulation from ris decreases from 1 14 to 0 67 g l when the irrigation amount is reduced from 4572 m3 ha to 2756 m3 ha the irrigation water amount reduced will increase salt accumulation also it is found that further reducing the irrigation water quota will cause a violation of the soil salinity constraints the implies that the soil salinity control puts an upper limit for irrigation water saving especially in regions with shallow saline groundwater differently 60 of the total historical irrigation water use is too few for plant growth and do not satisfied the salt constraints similar to the results in section 4 ris combines some irrigation applications recommended by the simulation optimization model and some from the historical records in 2017 historical records as shown in fig 7a under a 20 reduction of irrigation quota ris suggests three irrigation applications the farmer chooses to their own choices on day 26 and comes back to follow the recommended applications on days 49 85 as shown in table 3 with ris the total irrigation water use is reduced by 20 with 5 of profit loss with the 80 water quota scenario but the salt accumulation from ris increases 0 46 g l it means less irrigation water quota will cause soil salt accumulation 5 2 crop water productivity vs irrigation water productivity under different water availability conditions in the study crop water productivity cwp is defined as the yield per unit of evapotranspiration irrigation water productivity iwp is defined as the yield per unit of irrigation water use during the crop growth season sadras 2009 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 significant differences were found in the water productivity in different irrigation scheduling in 2018 and 2017 fig 8 the crop water productivity from optimal solution under 100 80 and 60 irrigation water quotas in 2018 is 1 93 kg m 3 1 91 kg m 3 and 1 88 kg m 3 respectively which are close to the values from ris 1 93 kg m 3 1 90 kg m 3 and 1 87 kg m 3 also the crop water productivity from optimal solution under 100 80 irrigation water quotas in 2017 is 1 86 kg m 3 1 79 kg m 3 respectively which are close to the values from ris 1 90 kg m 3 1 90 kg m 3 the crop water productivity from the historical record is 1 93 kg m 3 and 1 88 kg m 3 in 2018 and 2017 the decrease of water quota reduces crop water productivity the irrigation water productivity from the historical record in 2018 and 2017 is 1 32 kg m 3 and 2 38 kg m 3 in comparison the irrigation water productivity from ris is significantly higher than that of historical record and the optimal solution under 100 80 and 60 irrigation water quotas in all years we also identify a significant increasing trend of iwp with declining irrigation water quota which is consistent with previous studies huo et al 2012 sun et al 2006 i e iwp can be improved with moderate deficit irrigation among the investigated irrigation scheduling the one generated from ris under 80 irrigation water quota of 2017 has the highest irrigation water productivity these results thus indicate that the proposed ris performs better under more restricted irrigation water availability 6 conclusions in this study we develop a human machine interactive method for real time irrigation scheduling ris the method is based simulation optimization model that includes complex agro hydrology system interactions between crop growth soil water groundwater and soil salinity and link the model directly with irrigation farmers via assimilating soil moisture observations this method combines model observation and human justification into an online rolling over framework throughout the irrigation season the method is applied to a case study site in hetao irrigation district in northwestern china with arid semi arid climate and shallow saline groundwater the results from the ris are compared to the optimal solution from the simulation optimization model and the historical irrigation records it is found that ris can use less irrigation water and result in larger profit than the historical records while remaining similar salt leaching results overall the ris ends with higher irrigation water productivity the ris based on human machine interactions can be applied to other irrigation districts with soil moisture observation to support more effective real time irrigation scheduling in future studies the proposed method will be tested to a real time irrigation season in the case study area with farmers involvement in particular farmers behaviors in irrigation decisions underlying weather uncertainty policy regulation and market variability will be addressed to develop more
