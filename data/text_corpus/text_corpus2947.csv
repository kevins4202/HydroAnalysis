14735,treatment wetlands tws are an efficient technology for removing microplastics mps from wastewater according to previous studies this study investigates the dynamics and fate of mps in two wastewater treatment plants wwtps using tws one with horizontal subsurface flow hf and another with a floating plant system fs special attention is paid to the retention produced in the sludge and the role of macrophyte roots the abundance of mps in the influent to the wwtps was on average 20 3 0 85 mp l and 8 4 1 13 mp l in hf and fs respectively while the effluent had 0 58 0 07 mp l and 0 17 0 06 mp l thus giving overall efficiencies of 97 42 and 98 13 respectively in the hf wetland sludge samples near the inlet and the outlet were taken distinguishing between sludge adhered to gravel and sludge attached to roots in the floating macrophytes sludge samples from secondary and tertiary treatments were taken the results indicate that roots play a significant role in mps retention in the hf wetland the complex formed by roots and gravel attached more mps than gravel alone in the final zone of the wetland in the fs roots retained a significant quantity of mps both in the secondary and tertiary treatments thus giving rise to a sludge less concentrated in mps this study aims to improve the knowledge of mps behavior and fate in full scale tws providing valuable information to enhance retention efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland roots vegetation nature based solutions sludge polymers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics have been recognized as a worldwide environmental problem for decades carpenter and smith 1972 however plastic materials are very advantageous being more malleable durable and cost effective andrady and neal 2009 this is why millions of tons of plastic are produced annually and have been increasing over recent years plastic europe 2021 as a consequence a wide range of plastic debris are accumulating in the biosphere terrestrial and marine which can be fragmented into smaller pieces due to the influence of different agents sunlight wind mechanical biological or chemical forces silva et al 2018 plastic particles smaller than 5 mm are considered microplastics mps and are classified into primary and secondary mps according to their origin thompson et al 2004 once in the environment mps can act as a means of transportation for other pollutants such as heavy metals sarkar et al 2021 or persistent organic pollutants pops among others furthermore due to its small size mps can be consumed by a variety of aquatic fauna indeed mps have been detected in more than 150 different plant or animal species jabeen et al 2017 infiltrating the food chain additionally some studies have shown that the presence of mps in organisms can cause reduction of growth and photosynthesis hinder reproductive ability damage intestines and even cause death lu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 nowadays researchers have found that one of the main sources of mps to the marine habitats are wastewaters conley et al 2019 mps coming from cosmetics or toothpaste that contains microbeads fibers from synthetic textiles that are released in washing machines boucher and friot 2017 and other articles like glitter tires and cleaners or painting products sheavly and register 2007 reach the wastewater treatment plants wwtp once there most are removed from wastewater given that the efficiency varies between 80 and 99 prata 2018 despite this even if the mp output concentrations are low the high discharge flow rates of wwtps result in a significant number of mps being released into the natural environment causing considerable pollution throughout the day moreover if the wwtps removal of mps are effective it means that mps are transferred into sewage sludge van der berg et al 2020 indeed the concentration in the sludge is higher than influent wastewaters xu et al 2020 when the sludge is then applied in farmlands it represents a major input to the environment hernández arenas et al 2021 for instance mps may reach water bodies through runoff from the farmlands for a long time treatment wetlands tws have been investigated as a method to remove pollutants in wastewater tws are designed systems to treat wastewater and other pollution sources with low maintenance and operation cost vymazal 2010 they represent a nature based solution for wastewater treatment in small villages for tertiary treatment in bigger plants and for dealing with stormwater rousseau et al 2008 tws have demonstrated to be competent in the reduction of mps with an efficiency between 88 95 when they are used as a tertiary treatment adding to its already known benefits wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 bydalek et al 2023 previous researchers have found a good interception of mps by vegetation in natural wetlands whether in leaves roots or attached in form of biofilm yin et al 2021 duan et al 2021 macroinvertebrates found in tws mainly worms can also play a significant role in the distribution of the mps wang et al 2020 furthermore other studies have shown that worms may transport mps and break them down even further bacteria present in the gut of the earthworms digest the mps into their simpler more volatile compounds lwanga et al 2018 in addition there is a need to focus on further improving the legislative and policy system to eliminate mps at source xu et al 2022 although the literature about microplastics is growing exponentially zhou et al 2021 tws are still a domain that needs to be investigated to gain a better understanding of the processes and the benefits that they can provide in this field the general objective of this study is to shed more light on the potential of tws to remove mps from wastewaters and evaluate the role of vegetation roots as well as the fate of microplastics along the tws to better understand the complex mechanisms involved to this end two different wwtps with tws have been evaluated including horizontal subsurface flow wetlands and floating wetlands to the best of our knowledge this is the first study addressing these issues in full scale tws additionally this study looks at the degradation of mps from a qualitative point of view the two main degradation processes for mps under research are biodegradation and photocatalysis pan et al 2022 it can be hypothesized that mps in tws may be degraded by biodegradation processes due to the long residence time of solid particles retained inside tws and because of the activity of their biological community including bacteria protozoans and worms among others 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites 2 1 1 carrícola s wwtp carrícola s wwtp valencia spain serves a community of 115 population equivalents p e the scheme of this plant is a pretreatment grids followed by two imhoff settlers 18 m3 connected in series with pipes to the inlet of two horizontal subsurface flow tws operating in parallel of 200 m2 each and a depth of 0 35 m they are filled with coarse gravel φ 40 mm from the inlet to a distance of one meter and then are followed by a mix of coarse and fine gravel 10 25 mm they are filled with common reed plants phragmites there is a second tw of the same configuration tw2 following tw1 to extend the exposer time of the water fig 1 previous studies report an average daily inflow of 16 m3 day a total suspended solids tss removal efficiency of 98 with an average value of 3 1 3 7 mg l in the final effluent and chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 94 with an average value of 42 19 mg l in the final effluent the global hydraulic retention time hrt is 9 days on average hernández crespo et al 2022b 2 1 2 monasterios wwtp los monasterios wwtp valencia spain is serving a population of 1500 pe the pretreatment consists in a screening and grit chamber the secondary treatment is an aerated biological reactor with floating helophytes 176 m3 4 m depth the plants are a mixture of typha and phragmites situated upon a buoyant structure this biological reactor works in extended aeration mode with sludge recirculation and is followed by a sedimentation tank 48 m3 aeration is intermittent and controlled by dissolved oxygen probes finally it has a tertiary treatment for disinfection formed by a floating tw 348 m2 of area and a volume of 557 m3 composed of vegetation growing on a buoyant surface the buoyant or floating structure is placed into a pond and planted with helophyte cattails and reed to create the floating wetland the floating structure is the same as in the bioreactor and with the same plant species to illustrate the system two pictures of the structure alone and the structure planted inside the floating tw are included in si fig s1 followed by a horizontal subsurface flow tw 68 m2 and 18 m3 of area and volume respectively with coarse gravel 2 3 cm and planted with common reed fig 2 it treats a flow of 100 120 m3 day and 100 of the treated water is reused for irrigation of gardens it has a cod and tss removal efficiencies of 97 and 94 respectively the mean hrt is 1 6 days in the biological reactor 5 1 days in the floating tw and 0 2 days in the horizontal flow tw 2 2 wastewater and sludge sampling water samples were collected from different points in each treatment plant in carrícola wwtp four sites were sampled raw wastewater point 1 the effluent of the primary treatment point 2 the outlet of tw1 point 3 and finally the outlet of the treatment plant point 4 see fig 1 in los monasterios wwtp three different locations were sampled the influent to the treatment plant point 1 the outlet of the secondary treatment point 2 and the outlet of the subsurface tw and thereof the treatment plant point 3 two sampling campaigns were performed in each wwtp different volumes were taken for analysis 2 5 l for the raw wastewater 7 5 l for the tw influent 100 l for the tws effluent in carrícola just 60 l from the effluent of tw2 were taken point 4 because of some difficulties in collecting the sample in the first sampling campaign all the samples were taken in duplicate with a metal bucket and filtered by a stack of sieves 5600 μm 425 μm 75 μm 40 μm in situ in the second sampling one sample was taken at each point because the variability in the duplicates in the first sampling was low and only the smallest sieve was used because these samples were taken for examination with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the residue remaining on the sieves was transferred into glass beakers covered with aluminum foil and transported to the laboratory for further processing sludge samples were also collected from different sites in carrícola wwtp one sampling point was at the beginning of the tw1 2 m from the inlet distribution channel and another site at the end of the tw1 3 m before the outlet in both sites a depth between 10 and 15 cm was excavated and samples were taken in duplicate samples with and without roots were taken from the same depth where roots were most developed at each sampling point one sludge sample was collected from the gravel and a second was collected from sludge attached to the roots excavating in the lower area where a plant was found in los monasterios wwtp two kind of sludge samples were taken from the biological reactor secondary treatment suspended sludge and sludge attached to the roots of the floating macrophytes the sludge samples were collected during the aeration process to ensure an optimally mixed sludge roots from the floating tw tertiary treatment were also sampled in all cases two replicas were extracted a shovel and a pick were needed for sludge samples all tools were made of metal and wood to avoid plastic and furthermore samples were transported in glass jars covered with aluminum foil to process them in the laboratory once in the laboratory both the gravel and roots samples were placed on a 5 mm sieve and cleaned with distilled water placing another sieve of smaller size 40 μm under the 5 mm sieve to collect the sludge samples in the case of the roots we dug around a plant and collected all the roots in the area along with the sludge adhered to them 2 3 microplastics extraction procedure for the extraction of mps from the water samples the same procedure as wang et al 2020 was followed in summary the beakers were dried below 70 c munno et al 2018 once dried a digestion with h2o2 30 solution was applied and the residue was dried again and then a two step density separation was performed first step was done with cacl2 1 34 g cm3 and a second step was done with a higher density solution of ki 1 72 g cm3 to ensure that all the high density microplastics were recovered zhang et al 2020 otherwise mps with higher density than that of the solution could not be counted prata et al 2019 the vials containing the density solution were centrifugated 5 min 3500 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through glass fiber filters pore size of 1 μm and a diameter of 47 mm then 5 ml of rose bengal was applied to stain natural fragments or fibers in the case of the sludge samples the samples were washed over the sieve of 40 μm to collect the sludge adhered to the roots or the gravel after the samples were obtained the rest of the process is the same as the water samples except for the digestion process which required more volume of h2o2 30 and took more time due to the large amount of organic material 2 4 microplastics counting and characterization the filters obtained in the previous step were examined following an orderly route starting at the top from left to right down and back in a right to left direction under stereomicroscopes with augmentations between x20 and x40 sz30 olympus japan following the guidelines marked by hidalgo ruz et al 2012 the mps were identified also with help of the hot needle test for some particles that were unclear upon being touched with the needle the plastic items should curve or melt otherwise the organic particles usually break under the pressure of the hot needle during the counting mps were classified into fibers particles and films additionally they were categorized by size according to the sieve from which the filter came as mentioned above in the second sampling campaign the samples were sieved only through the 40 μm sieve subjected to the same digestion and density separation process and analyzed with micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μftir thermo scientific nicolet in 10 the data base used included the nicolet polymer and common materials set in addition to the hummel polymer library 2 5 quality assurance and contamination prevention to avoid contamination during the sampling and experimentation quality control measures were adopted the use of plastic materials was avoided as much as possible the beakers were covered by aluminum foil after sampling and every time that they were stored another aluminum foil was placed to protect during all the steps including sampling laboratory cotton coat and latex gloves were used all the working space and equipment were cleaned thoroughly before and after use at each sampling point an in situ blank was prepared and two laboratory blanks were conducted during the observation of filters to quantify mps pollution in the lab environment the blanks went through the same steps as the other samples and were also counted under a stereomicroscope in the end nine particles were found in the carrícola field blank and fifteen were found in los monasterios in a 10 l distilled water sample these mp quantities were not subtracted from the sample results due to uncertainty regarding whether all samples were equally contaminated as most of the contamination in the blanks comes from airborne sources instead the blank concentrations were used as a detection limit smyth et al 2021 as similar results were found in previous studies conley et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition a recovery test was performed for this mps were artificially prepared from plastic utensils of a different color clothes bags and bottle lid by scraping with a knife or scissors the test was performed four times with the following quantity of mps ten fibers ten particles and five films with a medium size of 350 μm the whole procedure was applied including sieving extraction density separation and visual examination the following average recovery percentages were obtained 97 5 for fibers 87 5 for particles fragments and 75 for films as blanks concentrations this process is carried out to quantify the imperfections of the method but not to alter the results since it cannot be ensured that it affects all samples equally 2 6 statistical analysis an abundance of mps were measured as mps l in water samples and mps g dry weight of sludge in the sludge samples statistical analysis was performed using statgraphics software version 18 0 statgraphics technologies inc the plains virginia the concentration size and shape distributions were compared using parametric tests anova if normality was satisfied and nonparametric otherwise kruskal wallis in all tests the results were only considered statistically significant when p value was below 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater microplastics concentrations and removal efficiencies mp concentrations presented a high degree of variability at the inlet between 17 2 and 23 4 mps l in carrícola wwtp and between 4 0 and 12 8 mps l in los monasterios wwtp see fig 3 that variability was highly attenuated in the effluent highlighting the buffering capacity of wetlands a property noted in numerous studies hernández crespo et al 2022a b the effluent concentrations varied between 0 18 and 0 98 mps l in carrícola and from 0 04 to 0 29 mps l in los monasterios being significantly lower than the influent concentrations p 0 05 moreover it should be noted that the variability of the samples during the same sampling campaign was significantly lower than the variability between samplings as reflected by the error bars of the points in which a duplicate was taken in connection with the characteristics of both influents it should be noted that the results of the second sampling could have been influenced by rainfall events during previous days which could have provoked a flush of the sewage network zhou et al 2022 causing to a reduction in mps arrivals on subsequent days the mp removal efficiency for imhoff tanks resulted on average in 17 4 for carrícola furthermore the removal efficiency of tw1 was on average 98 6 it can be seen that in carrícola the concentration increases slightly after point 3 in tw2 which may be caused by a sludge drain operation of the pipe system that is carried out monthly and the effluent of this operation is taken to the final part of tw2 which can cause a transport of mps previously sedimented inside the pipes on the other hand the average mp removal efficiency after the secondary treatment in monasterios was 53 3 the removal efficiency of the tw system was on average 96 2 in los monasterios in terms of global removal efficiency carrícola presented an average of 97 4 and los monasterios 98 1 these global efficiencies are higher than those obtained in small standard pre treatment primary secondary wwtps where efficiencies lower than 90 are typical sun et al 2019 furthermore in comparison with other studies where tw based technology is also used especially those operated as a tertiary treatment the removal efficiencies reached in this study are similar and sometimes higher as can be noted in table 1 moreover it has been demonstrated that full scale tw both working as secondary and tertiary treatment can efficiently reduce the number of mps in wastewater at first it was hypothesized that in a modern and more urban population such as los monasterios the concentration of mps in the influent to the wwtp would be higher however the influent concentrations to carrícola wwtp were substantially higher this may be due among other causes to the fact that it is common to find higher concentrations of pollutants in the wastewater of small villages as they usually use a lower quantity of water and there are less uses commercial industry that can dilute these pollutants huertas et al 2013 this can be corroborated with the cod and tss concentrations of the influents of each wwtp while in los monasterios we found average values of 357 and 82 mg l respectively in carrícola values of 794 and 266 mg l were registered similarly this was confirmed in other studies such as wei et al 2020 who analyzed different treatment plants located in different areas near cities in rural areas and in mountainous areas far from large urban centers their results indicated that wastewater concentration was higher in less urbanized areas however it should be noted that other studies in wwtps in the city show very wide ranges qiu et al 2020 therefore mps concentration does not depend on the served population mahon et al 2017 greater attention should be paid to the lifestyle of each community the shape and size distribution of mps in wastewater are shown in figs 4 and 5 regarding the shape distribution the plastics found were divided into groups fibers particles and films as in other contemporary studies long et al 2022 wang et al 2020 the predominant form was the fiber in both influent and effluent the removal efficiency was 97 5 for fibers in both wwtps films were the second most typical form in both wwtps which is not in accordance with other studies that show it is usually the smallest proportion bydaleck et al 2023 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 regarding particles their removal is complete which may be because particles are more likely to be retained by the filtering effect of tw given that fibers are the most abundant fraction it is advisable to carry out campaigns to raise awareness of this problem previous studies have proposed installing filters in washing machines and using natural fiber clothing among other measures prata 2018 likewise simple actions such as removing fibers from our feet before entering the shower can help to reduce the fiber content in wastewater in this sense treating greywater separately could help to reduce the mp load into wastewater as it is considered a significant source of microfiber pollution sotiropoulou et al 2023 in addition it is necessary to consider the important effect that the biofilm plays in the retention of mps in tws since retention and adsorption are important mechanisms for pollutant removal in wetlands hernández crespo et al 2017 the colonization of mps by biofilm is a facilitator mechanism for the retention of mps in wetlands increasing their surface area and their density moreover the biofilm adhered to the vegetation and the roots of the wetlands also improves retention this effect is of great importance in the retention of fibers due to their high surface area to volume ratio the fibers are more likely to be colonized by microorganisms than other forms of mps chen et al 2021 this colonization also becomes very important when dealing with low density polymers less than water that might escape from settlers by flotation during this study fibers colonized by biofilm could be observed fig s2 which could indicate a first symptom of potential biodegradation a mechanism described as feasible by previous studies du et al 2021 signs of degradation in the mps such as bites flakes etc were also observed during this study after passing through the wetlands fig s3 in addition the fibers are susceptible to entanglement which is positive because it helps to improve their retention in the wetland gravels and their sedimentation since their density and surface area increase fig s4 the results show a clear trend regarding the categorization by mps size this was one of the initial hypotheses as mps pass through the treatment system especially in the tw their size distribution shifts towards smaller dimensions in both cases as shown in fig 5 mps collected in the larger sieve were reduced in proportion as they progressed through the system and in turn the smaller mps increase in percentage after passing through the tws this may be explained by a number of mechanisms physical filtration size reduction by earthworm digestion and size reduction due to the mechanical wear suffered by the mps as they pass through the gravel therefore a design recommendation that can be drawn from the results is the desirability of reducing the size of the filter material in the end zone of the wetlands in order to retain these small size mps or design a multistage system varying the filter porous material this will ensure that mps are removed at different stages of the process thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the cw among other general recommendations to ensure the long term effectiveness of tws as optimize the hydraulic load monitor and maintain the system if smaller mps are kept within the tws it may promote their biodegradation potential specifically the mps can be consumed by the macroinvertebrates inhabiting the wetlands such as earthworms as observed by wang et al 2021 the microorganisms present in both the earthworms and the wetlands could then facilitate the biodegradation process as reported by lwanga et al 2018 and yuan et al 2020 furthermore previous studies paid attention to finding a correlation between tss and mps because if a strong correlation is found the concentrations of tss could be used as an indicator of mps content currently the tss variable has not yet been used as an indicator because there are a variety of opinions on the matter and the relationships obtained are different in each study hence there is still no agreed empirical equation there are studies that found a strong correlation wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 while others did not find a strong enough correlation to use as an indicator bydalek et al 2023 in this study the correlation is weak fig 6 although statistically significant p 0 05 which gives an indication of the interest in pursuing such relationships a graph including the data from this study and previous ones has been made in order to further analyze this correlation as can be seen in fig 6 the results of several studies fit this linear relationship in a statistically significant way p 0 05 and with a considerably high goodness of fit see r2 in fig 6 even those data for which the relationship was weak when included in this graph are within the point cloud formed by the set of values a very interesting parameter to quantify is the number of mps that each treatment plant is releasing into the natural environment per inhabitant which is known as emission of mps per capita in this study only for carrícola this parameter could be calculated in the case of los monasterios there was no precise information available to calculate this parameter with a flow rate of 14 000 l d and a population of 115 pe the emission rate would be 71 mps capita day the data obtained are lower than those showed in other studies such as that of wang et al 2020 where emissions of mps per capita were also calculated resulting in 428 mps capita day for a population of 494 pe these variations may be due to the different forms of consumption in the different societies studied 3 2 sludge microplastics retention different sludge samples were taken to check the role of the roots to capture mps both in tw and by introducing floating macrophytes in the bioreactor regarding the fate of mps in carricola s tw fig 7 indicates a higher accumulation of mps in the inlet zone this is an accordance with the higher accumulation of tss in the inlet zone of tws garcía et al 2003 2005 as it can be seen in fig 7 for carrícola the initial hypothesis cannot be accepted at the inlet of the tw comparing both inlets gravel sludge had a higher concentration of mps per dry gram of sludge this may be due to the ease of flow through the lower part of the wetland below the roots which is why more mps are dragged to that area moreover in this zone a high quantity of solids and biofilm are present so the gravel can be as efficient as roots conversely in the outlet the concentration of mps of the sludge attached to the roots was higher than in gravel so here the hypothesis is fulfilled it must be highlighted that the difference between roots and gravel concentration is in relative terms greater at the outlet than in the inlet this shows the relevant role of roots in enhancing the retention mechanism gersberg et al 1986 in the case of los monasterios fig 7 shows the high difference more than double that exists between the concentrations measured in the root sludge and the sludge suspended in the bioreactor this highlights the positive role of vegetation since the concentration of mps in the sludge is being reduced thanks to the capture by macrophytes thus helping to reduce the load of mps introduced in the environment when sewage sludge is used in agriculture apart from other additional benefits provided by the macrophytes in the reactor gersberg et al 1986 regarding the root samples from the floating tw the results indicate that roots continue playing a crucial role in the tertiary treatment trapping a noticeable quantity of mps in the floating tw intercepted mps could remain attached to the roots for a long time since roots are not removed when the macrophytes are harvested this being a positive factor to facilitate their potential degradation a recently published study that characterized the sediment of five tws in australia lu et al 2022 reported values of mps in the sediments varying between 736 335 and 3480 4330 mp kg dry sediment it is clear that sediment and sludge are not directly comparable but serve as a reference in this case study higher values of mps in the sludge were observed but also the input loads to the tws were significantly higher within the research conducted there is a wide range of results also depending on many factors such as the type of tw operation population served size of filter used as mentioned by hidalgo ruz et al 2012 among others higher values than those obtained in this study can be found in magni et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 both authors reported values of 113 57 mps g dry sludge and 240 3 31 4 mps g dry sludge respectively in one wwtp in italy and another one in china similar values are reported by li et al 2018 where 79 sludge samples were collected from 28 different wwtps in china obtaining results ranging from 1 6 to 56 4 mps g dry sludge with regards to levels in roots other authors yin et al 2021 duan et al 2021 reported amounts of 4 mps g and 5 11 2 95 mps g of dry sludge respectively although those studies were carried out in a natural environment which is likely to be less polluted however the concentrations at the outlet do resemble those found in the natural environment in these studies and are even lower 3 3 microplastic polymer types in treatment wetlands systems seven different types of polymers were the most commonly found in both water and sludge samples including polyethylene terephthalate pet polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pur polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polytrimethylene terephthalate ptt other types of polymers were also found to a lesser extent other e g polystyrene polyester polyamide see fig 8 the most dominant component in water samples were pet which is in third place overall pp and pvc were the most predominant polymers in the sludge being significant in both wwtps as in other studies lu et al 2022 huang et al 2020 the higher proportion of pp and pvc in the sludge is in line with the production data of plastics since the most produced plastics are in this order pp pe and pvc mainly for their uses as packaging and in the construction and automotive industry plastic europe 2021 followed by pet so it is not surprising that they are the most common as in other sediment studies where pp prevails yuan et al 2020 lu et al 2022 olesen et al 2019 in the water samples fig 8 a large amount of pet is found especially in carrícola where it reaches almost 60 of the total polymers found in the influent pet is a material widely used in textiles and packaging so it is very common to find in addition to pe which is also very important in the monasterios influent which may be contributing a large amount of the fibers found in the water samples it should be noted that both materials are the most predominant after passing through the primary treatments as can be seen in points 2 a high percentage of pvc is also found in both treatment plants at the inlet although this type of polymers is satisfactorily removed along the wwtp it should be noted that point 3 is not very relevant due to the small quantities of mps found there the polymer most adhered to roots both in carrícola s inlet roots and in the monasterios tw roots fig 9 is pp the lowest density polymer registered this highlights the important role of the roots in the retention of lower density mps which could otherwise be escaping from the wwtps by flotation in addition the roots seem to play a key role in intercepting pet which is usually referred to as polyester in textile products this coincides with the higher proportion of fibers in this sludge samples fig s5 as well as in the effluent samples fig 4 on the other hand in the suspended sludge the polymer compound with the highest presence is pvc one of those with the highest density in both wwtps other studies reported different results where the pe and pp fragments were predominantly recorded in the sediment hence the density cannot be considered as the only factor in the distribution of mps in the medium lu et al 2022 although in this case it does seem to be relevant moreover it should be noted that not all studies use the same extraction procedure and this could lead to different results conclusions the following conclusions can be deduced from the study carried out treatment wetlands tws have significant potential for reducing the discharge of mps into the natural environment functioning as both secondary and tertiary treatment fibers are the most common form of influent and effluent of both wwtps presenting the greatest challenge for mp pollution control actions aimed at reducing their arrival at wwtps such as washing machine filters and promoting the use of natural textiles are highly recommended smaller particles predominate at the final stage and it is recommended to have a final zone or wetland cell with a finer filtering material to further reduce mp emissions once these smaller mps are retained inside the wetland their biodegradation becomes more feasible mps are largely concentrated in the sludge from sewage treatment plants roots play a positive role in capturing more mps both in tws and in floating macrophytes in the bioreactor therefore it is important to maintain an adequate vegetation density in tws and to install floating macrophytes in the biological reactors of wwtps mps and tss exhibit similar behavior in the tws being mostly retained in the initial zone and are significantly correlated further study of their relationship can provide an estimation tool for mps content pooling data from different studies can provide a more solid relationship the importance of root retention in capturing lower density mps that could escape from wwtps is once again demonstrated in polymer retention additionally the correlation between the different materials observed pet and pe in the water samples and the main forms i e fibers can be appreciated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

durable and cost effective andrady and neal 2009 this is why millions of tons of plastic are produced annually and have been increasing over recent years plastic europe 2021 as a consequence a wide range of plastic debris are accumulating in the biosphere terrestrial and marine which can be fragmented into smaller pieces due to the influence of different agents sunlight wind mechanical biological or chemical forces silva et al 2018 plastic particles smaller than 5 mm are considered microplastics mps and are classified into primary and secondary mps according to their origin thompson et al 2004 once in the environment mps can act as a means of transportation for other pollutants such as heavy metals sarkar et al 2021 or persistent organic pollutants pops among others furthermore due to its small size mps can be consumed by a variety of aquatic fauna indeed mps have been detected in more than 150 different plant or animal species jabeen et al 2017 infiltrating the food chain additionally some studies have shown that the presence of mps in organisms can cause reduction of growth and photosynthesis hinder reproductive ability damage intestines and even cause death lu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 nowadays researchers have found that one of the main sources of mps to the marine habitats are wastewaters conley et al 2019 mps coming from cosmetics or toothpaste that contains microbeads fibers from synthetic textiles that are released in washing machines boucher and friot 2017 and other articles like glitter tires and cleaners or painting products sheavly and register 2007 reach the wastewater treatment plants wwtp once there most are removed from wastewater given that the efficiency varies between 80 and 99 prata 2018 despite this even if the mp output concentrations are low the high discharge flow rates of wwtps result in a significant number of mps being released into the natural environment causing considerable pollution throughout the day moreover if the wwtps removal of mps are effective it means that mps are transferred into sewage sludge van der berg et al 2020 indeed the concentration in the sludge is higher than influent wastewaters xu et al 2020 when the sludge is then applied in farmlands it represents a major input to the environment hernández arenas et al 2021 for instance mps may reach water bodies through runoff from the farmlands for a long time treatment wetlands tws have been investigated as a method to remove pollutants in wastewater tws are designed systems to treat wastewater and other pollution sources with low maintenance and operation cost vymazal 2010 they represent a nature based solution for wastewater treatment in small villages for tertiary treatment in bigger plants and for dealing with stormwater rousseau et al 2008 tws have demonstrated to be competent in the reduction of mps with an efficiency between 88 95 when they are used as a tertiary treatment adding to its already known benefits wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 bydalek et al 2023 previous researchers have found a good interception of mps by vegetation in natural wetlands whether in leaves roots or attached in form of biofilm yin et al 2021 duan et al 2021 macroinvertebrates found in tws mainly worms can also play a significant role in the distribution of the mps wang et al 2020 furthermore other studies have shown that worms may transport mps and break them down even further bacteria present in the gut of the earthworms digest the mps into their simpler more volatile compounds lwanga et al 2018 in addition there is a need to focus on further improving the legislative and policy system to eliminate mps at source xu et al 2022 although the literature about microplastics is growing exponentially zhou et al 2021 tws are still a domain that needs to be investigated to gain a better understanding of the processes and the benefits that they can provide in this field the general objective of this study is to shed more light on the potential of tws to remove mps from wastewaters and evaluate the role of vegetation roots as well as the fate of microplastics along the tws to better understand the complex mechanisms involved to this end two different wwtps with tws have been evaluated including horizontal subsurface flow wetlands and floating wetlands to the best of our knowledge this is the first study addressing these issues in full scale tws additionally this study looks at the degradation of mps from a qualitative point of view the two main degradation processes for mps under research are biodegradation and photocatalysis pan et al 2022 it can be hypothesized that mps in tws may be degraded by biodegradation processes due to the long residence time of solid particles retained inside tws and because of the activity of their biological community including bacteria protozoans and worms among others 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites 2 1 1 carrícola s wwtp carrícola s wwtp valencia spain serves a community of 115 population equivalents p e the scheme of this plant is a pretreatment grids followed by two imhoff settlers 18 m3 connected in series with pipes to the inlet of two horizontal subsurface flow tws operating in parallel of 200 m2 each and a depth of 0 35 m they are filled with coarse gravel φ 40 mm from the inlet to a distance of one meter and then are followed by a mix of coarse and fine gravel 10 25 mm they are filled with common reed plants phragmites there is a second tw of the same configuration tw2 following tw1 to extend the exposer time of the water fig 1 previous studies report an average daily inflow of 16 m3 day a total suspended solids tss removal efficiency of 98 with an average value of 3 1 3 7 mg l in the final effluent and chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 94 with an average value of 42 19 mg l in the final effluent the global hydraulic retention time hrt is 9 days on average hernández crespo et al 2022b 2 1 2 monasterios wwtp los monasterios wwtp valencia spain is serving a population of 1500 pe the pretreatment consists in a screening and grit chamber the secondary treatment is an aerated biological reactor with floating helophytes 176 m3 4 m depth the plants are a mixture of typha and phragmites situated upon a buoyant structure this biological reactor works in extended aeration mode with sludge recirculation and is followed by a sedimentation tank 48 m3 aeration is intermittent and controlled by dissolved oxygen probes finally it has a tertiary treatment for disinfection formed by a floating tw 348 m2 of area and a volume of 557 m3 composed of vegetation growing on a buoyant surface the buoyant or floating structure is placed into a pond and planted with helophyte cattails and reed to create the floating wetland the floating structure is the same as in the bioreactor and with the same plant species to illustrate the system two pictures of the structure alone and the structure planted inside the floating tw are included in si fig s1 followed by a horizontal subsurface flow tw 68 m2 and 18 m3 of area and volume respectively with coarse gravel 2 3 cm and planted with common reed fig 2 it treats a flow of 100 120 m3 day and 100 of the treated water is reused for irrigation of gardens it has a cod and tss removal efficiencies of 97 and 94 respectively the mean hrt is 1 6 days in the biological reactor 5 1 days in the floating tw and 0 2 days in the horizontal flow tw 2 2 wastewater and sludge sampling water samples were collected from different points in each treatment plant in carrícola wwtp four sites were sampled raw wastewater point 1 the effluent of the primary treatment point 2 the outlet of tw1 point 3 and finally the outlet of the treatment plant point 4 see fig 1 in los monasterios wwtp three different locations were sampled the influent to the treatment plant point 1 the outlet of the secondary treatment point 2 and the outlet of the subsurface tw and thereof the treatment plant point 3 two sampling campaigns were performed in each wwtp different volumes were taken for analysis 2 5 l for the raw wastewater 7 5 l for the tw influent 100 l for the tws effluent in carrícola just 60 l from the effluent of tw2 were taken point 4 because of some difficulties in collecting the sample in the first sampling campaign all the samples were taken in duplicate with a metal bucket and filtered by a stack of sieves 5600 μm 425 μm 75 μm 40 μm in situ in the second sampling one sample was taken at each point because the variability in the duplicates in the first sampling was low and only the smallest sieve was used because these samples were taken for examination with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the residue remaining on the sieves was transferred into glass beakers covered with aluminum foil and transported to the laboratory for further processing sludge samples were also collected from different sites in carrícola wwtp one sampling point was at the beginning of the tw1 2 m from the inlet distribution channel and another site at the end of the tw1 3 m before the outlet in both sites a depth between 10 and 15 cm was excavated and samples were taken in duplicate samples with and without roots were taken from the same depth where roots were most developed at each sampling point one sludge sample was collected from the gravel and a second was collected from sludge attached to the roots excavating in the lower area where a plant was found in los monasterios wwtp two kind of sludge samples were taken from the biological reactor secondary treatment suspended sludge and sludge attached to the roots of the floating macrophytes the sludge samples were collected during the aeration process to ensure an optimally mixed sludge roots from the floating tw tertiary treatment were also sampled in all cases two replicas were extracted a shovel and a pick were needed for sludge samples all tools were made of metal and wood to avoid plastic and furthermore samples were transported in glass jars covered with aluminum foil to process them in the laboratory once in the laboratory both the gravel and roots samples were placed on a 5 mm sieve and cleaned with distilled water placing another sieve of smaller size 40 μm under the 5 mm sieve to collect the sludge samples in the case of the roots we dug around a plant and collected all the roots in the area along with the sludge adhered to them 2 3 microplastics extraction procedure for the extraction of mps from the water samples the same procedure as wang et al 2020 was followed in summary the beakers were dried below 70 c munno et al 2018 once dried a digestion with h2o2 30 solution was applied and the residue was dried again and then a two step density separation was performed first step was done with cacl2 1 34 g cm3 and a second step was done with a higher density solution of ki 1 72 g cm3 to ensure that all the high density microplastics were recovered zhang et al 2020 otherwise mps with higher density than that of the solution could not be counted prata et al 2019 the vials containing the density solution were centrifugated 5 min 3500 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through glass fiber filters pore size of 1 μm and a diameter of 47 mm then 5 ml of rose bengal was applied to stain natural fragments or fibers in the case of the sludge samples the samples were washed over the sieve of 40 μm to collect the sludge adhered to the roots or the gravel after the samples were obtained the rest of the process is the same as the water samples except for the digestion process which required more volume of h2o2 30 and took more time due to the large amount of organic material 2 4 microplastics counting and characterization the filters obtained in the previous step were examined following an orderly route starting at the top from left to right down and back in a right to left direction under stereomicroscopes with augmentations between x20 and x40 sz30 olympus japan following the guidelines marked by hidalgo ruz et al 2012 the mps were identified also with help of the hot needle test for some particles that were unclear upon being touched with the needle the plastic items should curve or melt otherwise the organic particles usually break under the pressure of the hot needle during the counting mps were classified into fibers particles and films additionally they were categorized by size according to the sieve from which the filter came as mentioned above in the second sampling campaign the samples were sieved only through the 40 μm sieve subjected to the same digestion and density separation process and analyzed with micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μftir thermo scientific nicolet in 10 the data base used included the nicolet polymer and common materials set in addition to the hummel polymer library 2 5 quality assurance and contamination prevention to avoid contamination during the sampling and experimentation quality control measures were adopted the use of plastic materials was avoided as much as possible the beakers were covered by aluminum foil after sampling and every time that they were stored another aluminum foil was placed to protect during all the steps including sampling laboratory cotton coat and latex gloves were used all the working space and equipment were cleaned thoroughly before and after use at each sampling point an in situ blank was prepared and two laboratory blanks were conducted during the observation of filters to quantify mps pollution in the lab environment the blanks went through the same steps as the other samples and were also counted under a stereomicroscope in the end nine particles were found in the carrícola field blank and fifteen were found in los monasterios in a 10 l distilled water sample these mp quantities were not subtracted from the sample results due to uncertainty regarding whether all samples were equally contaminated as most of the contamination in the blanks comes from airborne sources instead the blank concentrations were used as a detection limit smyth et al 2021 as similar results were found in previous studies conley et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition a recovery test was performed for this mps were artificially prepared from plastic utensils of a different color clothes bags and bottle lid by scraping with a knife or scissors the test was performed four times with the following quantity of mps ten fibers ten particles and five films with a medium size of 350 μm the whole procedure was applied including sieving extraction density separation and visual examination the following average recovery percentages were obtained 97 5 for fibers 87 5 for particles fragments and 75 for films as blanks concentrations this process is carried out to quantify the imperfections of the method but not to alter the results since it cannot be ensured that it affects all samples equally 2 6 statistical analysis an abundance of mps were measured as mps l in water samples and mps g dry weight of sludge in the sludge samples statistical analysis was performed using statgraphics software version 18 0 statgraphics technologies inc the plains virginia the concentration size and shape distributions were compared using parametric tests anova if normality was satisfied and nonparametric otherwise kruskal wallis in all tests the results were only considered statistically significant when p value was below 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater microplastics concentrations and removal efficiencies mp concentrations presented a high degree of variability at the inlet between 17 2 and 23 4 mps l in carrícola wwtp and between 4 0 and 12 8 mps l in los monasterios wwtp see fig 3 that variability was highly attenuated in the effluent highlighting the buffering capacity of wetlands a property noted in numerous studies hernández crespo et al 2022a b the effluent concentrations varied between 0 18 and 0 98 mps l in carrícola and from 0 04 to 0 29 mps l in los monasterios being significantly lower than the influent concentrations p 0 05 moreover it should be noted that the variability of the samples during the same sampling campaign was significantly lower than the variability between samplings as reflected by the error bars of the points in which a duplicate was taken in connection with the characteristics of both influents it should be noted that the results of the second sampling could have been influenced by rainfall events during previous days which could have provoked a flush of the sewage network zhou et al 2022 causing to a reduction in mps arrivals on subsequent days the mp removal efficiency for imhoff tanks resulted on average in 17 4 for carrícola furthermore the removal efficiency of tw1 was on average 98 6 it can be seen that in carrícola the concentration increases slightly after point 3 in tw2 which may be caused by a sludge drain operation of the pipe system that is carried out monthly and the effluent of this operation is taken to the final part of tw2 which can cause a transport of mps previously sedimented inside the pipes on the other hand the average mp removal efficiency after the secondary treatment in monasterios was 53 3 the removal efficiency of the tw system was on average 96 2 in los monasterios in terms of global removal efficiency carrícola presented an average of 97 4 and los monasterios 98 1 these global efficiencies are higher than those obtained in small standard pre treatment primary secondary wwtps where efficiencies lower than 90 are typical sun et al 2019 furthermore in comparison with other studies where tw based technology is also used especially those operated as a tertiary treatment the removal efficiencies reached in this study are similar and sometimes higher as can be noted in table 1 moreover it has been demonstrated that full scale tw both working as secondary and tertiary treatment can efficiently reduce the number of mps in wastewater at first it was hypothesized that in a modern and more urban population such as los monasterios the concentration of mps in the influent to the wwtp would be higher however the influent concentrations to carrícola wwtp were substantially higher this may be due among other causes to the fact that it is common to find higher concentrations of pollutants in the wastewater of small villages as they usually use a lower quantity of water and there are less uses commercial industry that can dilute these pollutants huertas et al 2013 this can be corroborated with the cod and tss concentrations of the influents of each wwtp while in los monasterios we found average values of 357 and 82 mg l respectively in carrícola values of 794 and 266 mg l were registered similarly this was confirmed in other studies such as wei et al 2020 who analyzed different treatment plants located in different areas near cities in rural areas and in mountainous areas far from large urban centers their results indicated that wastewater concentration was higher in less urbanized areas however it should be noted that other studies in wwtps in the city show very wide ranges qiu et al 2020 therefore mps concentration does not depend on the served population mahon et al 2017 greater attention should be paid to the lifestyle of each community the shape and size distribution of mps in wastewater are shown in figs 4 and 5 regarding the shape distribution the plastics found were divided into groups fibers particles and films as in other contemporary studies long et al 2022 wang et al 2020 the predominant form was the fiber in both influent and effluent the removal efficiency was 97 5 for fibers in both wwtps films were the second most typical form in both wwtps which is not in accordance with other studies that show it is usually the smallest proportion bydaleck et al 2023 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 regarding particles their removal is complete which may be because particles are more likely to be retained by the filtering effect of tw given that fibers are the most abundant fraction it is advisable to carry out campaigns to raise awareness of this problem previous studies have proposed installing filters in washing machines and using natural fiber clothing among other measures prata 2018 likewise simple actions such as removing fibers from our feet before entering the shower can help to reduce the fiber content in wastewater in this sense treating greywater separately could help to reduce the mp load into wastewater as it is considered a significant source of microfiber pollution sotiropoulou et al 2023 in addition it is necessary to consider the important effect that the biofilm plays in the retention of mps in tws since retention and adsorption are important mechanisms for pollutant removal in wetlands hernández crespo et al 2017 the colonization of mps by biofilm is a facilitator mechanism for the retention of mps in wetlands increasing their surface area and their density moreover the biofilm adhered to the vegetation and the roots of the wetlands also improves retention this effect is of great importance in the retention of fibers due to their high surface area to volume ratio the fibers are more likely to be colonized by microorganisms than other forms of mps chen et al 2021 this colonization also becomes very important when dealing with low density polymers less than water that might escape from settlers by flotation during this study fibers colonized by biofilm could be observed fig s2 which could indicate a first symptom of potential biodegradation a mechanism described as feasible by previous studies du et al 2021 signs of degradation in the mps such as bites flakes etc were also observed during this study after passing through the wetlands fig s3 in addition the fibers are susceptible to entanglement which is positive because it helps to improve their retention in the wetland gravels and their sedimentation since their density and surface area increase fig s4 the results show a clear trend regarding the categorization by mps size this was one of the initial hypotheses as mps pass through the treatment system especially in the tw their size distribution shifts towards smaller dimensions in both cases as shown in fig 5 mps collected in the larger sieve were reduced in proportion as they progressed through the system and in turn the smaller mps increase in percentage after passing through the tws this may be explained by a number of mechanisms physical filtration size reduction by earthworm digestion and size reduction due to the mechanical wear suffered by the mps as they pass through the gravel therefore a design recommendation that can be drawn from the results is the desirability of reducing the size of the filter material in the end zone of the wetlands in order to retain these small size mps or design a multistage system varying the filter porous material this will ensure that mps are removed at different stages of the process thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the cw among other general recommendations to ensure the long term effectiveness of tws as optimize the hydraulic load monitor and maintain the system if smaller mps are kept within the tws it may promote their biodegradation potential specifically the mps can be consumed by the macroinvertebrates inhabiting the wetlands such as earthworms as observed by wang et al 2021 the microorganisms present in both the earthworms and the wetlands could then facilitate the biodegradation process as reported by lwanga et al 2018 and yuan et al 2020 furthermore previous studies paid attention to finding a correlation between tss and mps because if a strong correlation is found the concentrations of tss could be used as an indicator of mps content currently the tss variable has not yet been used as an indicator because there are a variety of opinions on the matter and the relationships obtained are different in each study hence there is still no agreed empirical equation there are studies that found a strong correlation wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 while others did not find a strong enough correlation to use as an indicator bydalek et al 2023 in this study the correlation is weak fig 6 although statistically significant p 0 05 which gives an indication of the interest in pursuing such relationships a graph including the data from this study and previous ones has been made in order to further analyze this correlation as can be seen in fig 6 the results of several studies fit this linear relationship in a statistically significant way p 0 05 and with a considerably high goodness of fit see r2 in fig 6 even those data for which the relationship was weak when included in this graph are within the point cloud formed by the set of values a very interesting parameter to quantify is the number of mps that each treatment plant is releasing into the natural environment per inhabitant which is known as emission of mps per capita in this study only for carrícola this parameter could be calculated in the case of los monasterios there was no precise information available to calculate this parameter with a flow rate of 14 000 l d and a population of 115 pe the emission rate would be 71 mps capita day the data obtained are lower than those showed in other studies such as that of wang et al 2020 where emissions of mps per capita were also calculated resulting in 428 mps capita day for a population of 494 pe these variations may be due to the different forms of consumption in the different societies studied 3 2 sludge microplastics retention different sludge samples were taken to check the role of the roots to capture mps both in tw and by introducing floating macrophytes in the bioreactor regarding the fate of mps in carricola s tw fig 7 indicates a higher accumulation of mps in the inlet zone this is an accordance with the higher accumulation of tss in the inlet zone of tws garcía et al 2003 2005 as it can be seen in fig 7 for carrícola the initial hypothesis cannot be accepted at the inlet of the tw comparing both inlets gravel sludge had a higher concentration of mps per dry gram of sludge this may be due to the ease of flow through the lower part of the wetland below the roots which is why more mps are dragged to that area moreover in this zone a high quantity of solids and biofilm are present so the gravel can be as efficient as roots conversely in the outlet the concentration of mps of the sludge attached to the roots was higher than in gravel so here the hypothesis is fulfilled it must be highlighted that the difference between roots and gravel concentration is in relative terms greater at the outlet than in the inlet this shows the relevant role of roots in enhancing the retention mechanism gersberg et al 1986 in the case of los monasterios fig 7 shows the high difference more than double that exists between the concentrations measured in the root sludge and the sludge suspended in the bioreactor this highlights the positive role of vegetation since the concentration of mps in the sludge is being reduced thanks to the capture by macrophytes thus helping to reduce the load of mps introduced in the environment when sewage sludge is used in agriculture apart from other additional benefits provided by the macrophytes in the reactor gersberg et al 1986 regarding the root samples from the floating tw the results indicate that roots continue playing a crucial role in the tertiary treatment trapping a noticeable quantity of mps in the floating tw intercepted mps could remain attached to the roots for a long time since roots are not removed when the macrophytes are harvested this being a positive factor to facilitate their potential degradation a recently published study that characterized the sediment of five tws in australia lu et al 2022 reported values of mps in the sediments varying between 736 335 and 3480 4330 mp kg dry sediment it is clear that sediment and sludge are not directly comparable but serve as a reference in this case study higher values of mps in the sludge were observed but also the input loads to the tws were significantly higher within the research conducted there is a wide range of results also depending on many factors such as the type of tw operation population served size of filter used as mentioned by hidalgo ruz et al 2012 among others higher values than those obtained in this study can be found in magni et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 both authors reported values of 113 57 mps g dry sludge and 240 3 31 4 mps g dry sludge respectively in one wwtp in italy and another one in china similar values are reported by li et al 2018 where 79 sludge samples were collected from 28 different wwtps in china obtaining results ranging from 1 6 to 56 4 mps g dry sludge with regards to levels in roots other authors yin et al 2021 duan et al 2021 reported amounts of 4 mps g and 5 11 2 95 mps g of dry sludge respectively although those studies were carried out in a natural environment which is likely to be less polluted however the concentrations at the outlet do resemble those found in the natural environment in these studies and are even lower 3 3 microplastic polymer types in treatment wetlands systems seven different types of polymers were the most commonly found in both water and sludge samples including polyethylene terephthalate pet polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pur polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polytrimethylene terephthalate ptt other types of polymers were also found to a lesser extent other e g polystyrene polyester polyamide see fig 8 the most dominant component in water samples were pet which is in third place overall pp and pvc were the most predominant polymers in the sludge being significant in both wwtps as in other studies lu et al 2022 huang et al 2020 the higher proportion of pp and pvc in the sludge is in line with the production data of plastics since the most produced plastics are in this order pp pe and pvc mainly for their uses as packaging and in the construction and automotive industry plastic europe 2021 followed by pet so it is not surprising that they are the most common as in other sediment studies where pp prevails yuan et al 2020 lu et al 2022 olesen et al 2019 in the water samples fig 8 a large amount of pet is found especially in carrícola where it reaches almost 60 of the total polymers found in the influent pet is a material widely used in textiles and packaging so it is very common to find in addition to pe which is also very important in the monasterios influent which may be contributing a large amount of the fibers found in the water samples it should be noted that both materials are the most predominant after passing through the primary treatments as can be seen in points 2 a high percentage of pvc is also found in both treatment plants at the inlet although this type of polymers is satisfactorily removed along the wwtp it should be noted that point 3 is not very relevant due to the small quantities of mps found there the polymer most adhered to roots both in carrícola s inlet roots and in the monasterios tw roots fig 9 is pp the lowest density polymer registered this highlights the important role of the roots in the retention of lower density mps which could otherwise be escaping from the wwtps by flotation in addition the roots seem to play a key role in intercepting pet which is usually referred to as polyester in textile products this coincides with the higher proportion of fibers in this sludge samples fig s5 as well as in the effluent samples fig 4 on the other hand in the suspended sludge the polymer compound with the highest presence is pvc one of those with the highest density in both wwtps other studies reported different results where the pe and pp fragments were predominantly recorded in the sediment hence the density cannot be considered as the only factor in the distribution of mps in the medium lu et al 2022 although in this case it does seem to be relevant moreover it should be noted that not all studies use the same extraction procedure and this could lead to different results conclusions the following conclusions can be deduced from the study carried out treatment wetlands tws have significant potential for reducing the discharge of mps into the natural environment functioning as both secondary and tertiary treatment fibers are the most common form of influent and effluent of both wwtps presenting the greatest challenge for mp pollution control actions aimed at reducing their arrival at wwtps such as washing machine filters and promoting the use of natural textiles are highly recommended smaller particles predominate at the final stage and it is recommended to have a final zone or wetland cell with a finer filtering material to further reduce mp emissions once these smaller mps are retained inside the wetland their biodegradation becomes more feasible mps are largely concentrated in the sludge from sewage treatment plants roots play a positive role in capturing more mps both in tws and in floating macrophytes in the bioreactor therefore it is important to maintain an adequate vegetation density in tws and to install floating macrophytes in the biological reactors of wwtps mps and tss exhibit similar behavior in the tws being mostly retained in the initial zone and are significantly correlated further study of their relationship can provide an estimation tool for mps content pooling data from different studies can provide a more solid relationship the importance of root retention in capturing lower density mps that could escape from wwtps is once again demonstrated in polymer retention additionally

14736,the low exposure of active sites and the slow electron transfer rate still restrict the wide application of the photo fenton system of fe based photocatalyst in practical water treatment herein we prepared a hollow fe doped in2o3 nanotube h fe in2o3 catalyst for activating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to remove tetracycline tc and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb incorporation of fe could shorten the band gap and increase the absorption capacity of visible light meanwhile the increase of electron density at the fermi level promotes the interfacial electron transport the large specific surface area of the tubular structure exposes more fe active site and the fe o in site reduces the energy barrier of h2o2 activation resulting in more and faster formation of hydroxyl radicals oh after continuous operation for 600 min the h fe in2o3 reactor still can remove 85 tc and about 3 5 log arb in secondary effluent showing good stability and durability for practical wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photo fenton fe in2o3 nanotubular tetracycline antibiotic resistant bacteria secondary effluent data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the concern with a variety of biological and chemical emerging pollutants have been ubiquitously detected in water environments li et al 2022 spellman et al 2022 especially pharmaceutical residues such as antibiotics due to the influence to increase antibacterial resistance tello et al 2012 in addition traditional wastewater treatment methods have not shown efficiency in fully degrading these compounds or have neglected to disinfect pathogenic bacteria resulting in serious downstream contamination and limitations in the treatment of large amounts of wastewater bai et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to develop safe and effective technologies to achieve the removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb from the aquatic environment in order to achieve the standard of reclaimed water quality required for safe reuse fenton reaction is an advanced oxidation technique to generate reactive oxygen species ros mineralization antibiotics by activating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with fe2 chen et al 2021a liu et al 2022 in the traditional homogeneous fenton process there are some disadvantages such as narrow range of ph value low recovery of fe2 and poor accumulation of iron containing sludge therefore the emerging photo fenton like technology has been widely used in water pollution control giannakis et al 2018 in recent years many studies have focused on exploring heterogeneous catalysts in fenton like technology and the results showed that fe based multiphase catalysis have obvious advantages in the efficient activation of h2o2 shi et al 2022 wu et al 2022 zhao et al adjusted the band gap of the catalyst by means of fe doped titanium dioxide tio2 to accelerate the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers on the visible surface generated more ros to participate in pollutant degradation and improved the synergistic effect between photocatalysis and fenton reaction zhao et al 2023 currently reports on fe based catalysts mostly used post synthesis modification strategies for synthesis resulting in complex preparation processes the metal particles in the material tend to agglomerate the active site less exposed the catalytic activity decreased and the pollutant removal rate was not ideal moreover the material stability was poor and the problem of metal ion leaching was serious it is worth noting that metal organic frameworks mofs are ideal templates for constructing bimetallic oxides due to their adjustable functionality high pore volume and high metal content mo et al 2023 zhang et al 2023 the catalyst prepared from mofs precursor can not only retain the porous structure but also have multiple metal fixing sites mo et al 2022 therefore mofs derived metal oxide catalysts can overcome the shortcomings of low exposure of active site and slow electron transfer rate which is an effective means to achieve efficient heterogeneous photo fenton reaction morphological engineering is regarded as an effective method to improve the catalytic activity and performance of photocatalysts at present two dimensional 2d nanosheets nanoflowers nanorods and other structures are commonly used in the structural design and morphology of catalysts tang et al 2023 among them one dimensional hollow structures have received extensive attention in the field of zinc air batteries electrochemical energy

area 60 57 m2 g 1 stronger light absorption capacity and better charge carrier separation and transfer efficiency and optimized hydrogen evolution rate is about 22 4 folds than that pristine bulk g c3n4 wu et al 2019 dai et al utilized synergetic morphology engineering and band structure engineering in boron doped carbon nitride hollow nanotubes to achieve efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution dai et al 2023 these results indicate that hollow tubular structure can be used as an excellent carrier of iron in heterogeneous photo fenton system inspired by the above considerations we dexterously design and synthesize a mof derived fe doped indium oxide hollow nanotubes h fe in2o3 by combining the advantages of high activity and stable metal sites of mofs with morphology engineering at the same time the formation of the hollow tube structure helps to increase the specific surface area increase the visible light capture ability and enhance the electron transport ability meanwhile the highly dispersed iron active sites on the hollow nanotube structure promoted the adsorption and activation of h2o2 in this case this study aims to investigate the removal of organic pollutants and arbs in wastewater using a continuous flow reactor which provides an effective way for photo fenton sterilization and disinfection of actual wastewater 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of catalysts the h in2o3 and h fe in2o3 were synthesized by two steps through mild hydrothermal method to obtain in fe mil 68 precursor and the continuous annealing precursor by adding different amounts of fe no3 3 9h2o to obtain different fe doped in2o3 which is defined as x fe in2o3 samples x represents the mass percentage of doped fe similarly h in2o3 is also synthetized using the same method without adding fe no3 3 9h2o the details for preparing h in2o3 h fe in2o3 b in2o3 and b fe in2o3 were displayed in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 2 characterizations the

approach was used to modify the intra atomic coulomb interaction among strongly correlated in 4d and fe 3d electrons in the calculations we applied ueff 5 ev walsh et al 2008 and 3 ev for in 4d and fe 3d electrons respectively the energy barriers from h2o2 decomposition to oh in in2o3 and fe in2o3 were estimated using the nudged elastic band neb method 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterizations a series of hollow fe doped in2o3 nanotube h fe in2o3 were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction and a facile calcination of in fe mil 68 precursor fig 1 a by tuning the amount of metal salts table s1 a series of catalysts with different fe contents were synthesized denoted as x h fe in2o3 x represents the mass percentage of doped fe among all samples fe doped in2o3 with 4 fe doping was selected as a typical sample in this study due to the best performance the as prepared hollow in2o3 nanotube h in2o3 and h fe in2o3 samples are identified as an uniform thick walled hollow nanotube structure composed of small particles under tem fig 1b and fig s1 and no fe nanoparticles are observed indicating the highly dispersed of fe element combined with atom force microscope afm and sem fig s2 it can be seen that the diameter of h fe in2o3 nanotube is about 150 200 nm wall thickness is about 60 nm the lattice fringes matched well with the crystal planes of h in2o3 space group la 3 and it is reconfirmed by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 1c eds mapping profiles on h fe in2o3 fig 1d shows the distribution of in o and fe elements indicating the successful doping of fe in h in2o3 similarly bulk in2o3 b in2o3 and bulk fe doped in2o3 b fe in2o3 were successfully prepared fig 1e and fig s3 xrd results revealed the cubic phase of in2o3 over all samples jcpds card no 06 0416 chen et al 2021b without the diffraction peaks of fe related compounds the diffraction peaks of fe doped in2o3 shift toward lower 2θ values fig 1f which may be due to the smaller ionic radius of fe3 0 64 å compared to that of in3 0 80 å so fe ions can be successfully incorporated into the in2o3 lattice by occupying in3 sites without altering the cubic structure alshammari et al 2020 jiang et al 2009 fourier transform infrared resonance ftir and raman spectroscopy also show that fe is successfully doped into in2o3 fig s4 xps was performed to determine the effects of fe doping on the chemical states of in and o elements in nanotubes fig s5 the h in2o3 shows two peaks at 443 97 ev in 3d 5 2 and 451 61 ev in 3d 3 2 which are ascribed to in3 state fig 2 a due to the electronegativity of fe is greater than that of in the electron density around the o atom bonded with fe decreases the shielding effect decreases and then the binding energy of lattice oxygen increases zhu et al 2022 at the same time the electron density of in atom connected with lattice oxygen also decreases the shielding effect decreases and the corresponding binding energy of in atom increases after fe doping oxygen vacancies slightly increase which also improves the performance of fe in2o3 to some extent fig 2b in b fe in2o3 there is no significant shift of binding energy in 3d and o 1s indicating that the change of electron density caused by the introduction of fe in b fe in2o3 is small this may be because the bulk structure of b fe in2o3 leads to poor dispersion of doped fe and part of fe is not doped into the lattice as shown in fig 2c the two peaks at the banding energy of 709 9 ev fe 2p 3 2 and 724 4 ev fe 2p 1 2 with two satellite peaks at 718 8 ev and 729 3 ev are consistent with fe3 species two deconvoluted peaks sited at 711 7 ev and 722 8 ev with the satellite peaks at 714 6 ev and 727 9 ev from fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 spin orbit split respectively are assigned to the presence of fe2 species hou et al 2022 in the meantime fe 2p spectra of h fe in2o3 shifts towards lower binding energy compared with b fe in2o3 fig 2d manifesting that hollow structure is favorable to obtain reaction center fe with higher local electron density xiao et al 2019 3 2 degradation performance of as prepared catalysts to evaluate the photo fenton reaction activity of h fe in2o3 catalysts the oxidative degradation of tetracycline tc was selected as a reaction model the optimal experimental parameters catalyst 0 0 4 g l 1 tc 0 20 mg l 1 h2o2 0 10 mm for the reaction system were also determined fig s6 it is obvious that h fe in2o3 shows excellent catalytic activity and its rate constants kobs 0 0543 min 1 are about 6 7 times that of h in2o3 0 00809 min 1 and 9 2 times that of b fe in2o3 0 00589 min 1 fig 3 a these results indicate that the introduction of fe promotes the degradation of tc by photo fenton and has a higher reactivity of the tubular structure the performance of h fe in2o3 in pollutant degradation was further verified first according to the tc adsorption kinetics fig 3b the equilibrium adsorption of h fe in2o3 and b fe in2o3 were completed within 1 h and the adsorption reached apparent equilibrium within 3 h the pseudo first order model fit well indicating that the hollow nanotube may have a large specific surface area and have the advantage of spatial enrichment and adsorption of pollutants gupta et al 2011 interestingly the h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system can remove 90 4 tc within 30 min and almost 100 tc within 60 min indicating that fe site can rapidly activate h2o2 to degrade tc under visible light demonstrating the interaction between fe and in2o3 fig s7 fig 3c exhibits the relationship between catalysts with different fe loadings and degradation efficiency the catalytic activity does not increase monotonically with fe concentration which may be due to the fact that the doping amount is easy to agglomerate and block the active site it can be observed that the catalyst with 4 fe loading exhibits the best catalytic activity fig s8 and total organic carbon toc removal 61 6 after 5 h which indicates that hollow structure has unique advantages in the process of pollutant degradation and mineralization fig s9 in addition the h fe in2o3 catalyst showed good performance after 5 cycles fig 3e and fig s10 and the properties of the material surface did not change after the reaction proving the recyclability and stability of the material figs s11 s12 the h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system can efficiently oxidize a variety of refractory pollutants in wastewater fig 3f see table s2 for the detailed structure then h fe in2o3 show unexpectedly high catalytic activity in a wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 which is in sharp contrast to previous studies with a narrow ph application range fig s13 moreover the low leakage of iron ions fig s14 which can be attributed to the stabilizing effect of mofs precursors on metal ions effectively mitigates potential environmental hazards caused by material leakage during usage also no remaining tc was detected by uplc ms on the catalyst surface after the degradation process fig s15 indicating that tc was gradually mineralized in the solution based on the reaction intermediates identified by lc ms a possible degradation pathway was proposed fig s16 the prediction results ecosar and test software of the chronic toxicity acute toxicity bioaccumulation factors developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of tc and its catalytic degradation products on aquatic organisms showed that the toxicity was greatly reduced figs s17 18 and tables s3 5 it is worth noting that h fe in2o3 also showed excellent performance under various water conditions fig 3g and can effectively resist the interference of background ions such as ha cl and hco3 fig s19 even in the secondary discharge water of sewage treatment plant tianjin china the efficiency of tc removal can still reach 83 which has certain practical applications considering that the kobs could be affected by the reaction conditions and type of organics a normalized kinetic model k value calculated by dividing the kobs by catalyst dosage and oxidant concentration followed by multiplying the contaminant concentration was introduced to evaluate the removal rate in various heterogeneous fenton like systems he et al 2018 compared with catalysts reported in other literatures the k values of h fe in2o3 is higher indicating that it only requires a small amount of catalyst and h2o2 to achieve a higher pollutant removal rate and has a higher performance among similar catalysts fig 3h and tables s6 s7 an et al 2023 du et al 2018 lai et al 2023 silva et al 2021 xiunan et al 2022 compared with similar catalysts this catalyst is easy to prepare and has a lower cost table s8 making it an excellent catalyst for efficiently degrading pollutants 3 3 activation of h2o2 and identification of the reactive species in order to explore the activation mechanism of h2o2 the surface chemical reaction between catalyst and h2o2 was further investigated first of all h fe in2o3 showed significantly better activation ability of h2o2 than b fe in2o3 91 fig s20 by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a trapping agent fig 4 a the strong epr characteristic signals attribute to dmpo oh adducts verify the generation of oh and the stronger characteristic signal observed in h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system shows that the amount of oh is much more than other systems indicating that tubular structure fe sites can effectively activate h2o2 and generate abundant free radicals chemical quenching experiments also proved above results fig s21 further the oh produced during the reaction was monitored by in situ epr fig 4b shows that the production of oh gradually increases with the extension of time which proves the continuous transfer of electrons and rapid activation of h2o2 in the reaction system oh and superoxide anion radical o2 were quantified with benzoic acid and nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt by high performance liquid chromatography hplc fig 4c and fig s22 zhou et al 2021 the results showed that the oh content of h fe in2o3 was about 4 times that of b fe in2o3 indicating that the activation ability of h fe in2o3 to generate oh was significantly enhanced the main reason is that the tubular structure has the ability to enrich h2o2 and the structural advantage of accelerating the electron transfer at the interface he et al 2016 shang et al 2023 which promotes the efficient activation of h2o2 and generates a large amount of oh the high specific surface area of h fe in2o3 74 533 m2 g 1 is mainly attributed to the hollow tubular structure derived from mof which is conducive to the dispersion of fe active site and the activation of h2o2 fig s23 and table s9 in situ raman fig 4d the weakening of oo stretching vibration peak 874 cm 1 demonstrates the breaking of the oo bond in h2o2 xu et al 2022 while the rapid weakening of the fe o stretching vibration peak 563 cm 1 and the slow weakening of fe oh in fe ooh 632 cm 1 together demonstrate the bridge adsorption activation of h2o2 by fe site the gibbs free energy during the activation of h2o2 were calculated by dft structure models in fig s24 the intermediate structure and corresponding energy distribution are shown in fig 4e where blue and red paths represent activation mechanisms at in o in of in2o3 and in o fe sites of fe in2o3 respectively the adsorption process fig s25 from i to ii indicates that the negative adsorption energy of fe site is larger and h2o2 is more easily adsorbed on fe site which is conducive to accelerating the reduction process and improving the fenton property at this time adjacent metal atoms are easy to adsorb another o atom to form bridge adsorption and the oo bond in h2o2 is instantly elongated to form a transition state ts from process iii to iv which is the rate limiting step of h2o2 activation the gibbs free energy of ts formed by fe in2o3 δe 0 327 ev is significantly less than that of in2o3 δe 1 270 ev so fe o in is more prone to oo fracture and the formation of oh can be evaluated liu et al 2020 finally the energy of the oh desorption process at the fe site is lower than that at the in site therefore the stronger the desorption of oh at the fe site the more oh is produced in conclusion as the active site fe site is more likely to activate h2o2 and generate a large amount of oh 3 4 disinfection performance in addition to the effective removal of antibiotics gram negative bacteria tetracycline resistant escherichia coli tc e coli and gram positive bacteria methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa are used as two types of arb models to evaluate the bactericidal performance of the catalyst the h fe in2o3 can remove about 7 log tc e coli 15 min and mrsa 18 min fig 5 a which is significantly better than b fe in2o3 indicating that one dimensional tubular structures significantly improved the disinfection performance of the catalyst the effects of different catalyst ratios free radical types and h2o2 concentration on the whole experiment were discussed fig s26 dna leakage atp content changes and bacterial morphology at different times evaluated the disinfection performance of h fe in2o3 according to the increase of the absorbance value at 260 nm of the target strain and the intracellular atp content of the bacteria gradually decreased which proved that the impaired membrane permeability intracellular nucleotide flowed out and the loss of inorganic phosphate through the membrane leading to the increase of atp hydrolysis rate fig 5b yang et al 2019 with the increase of time the number of colonies of tc e coli and mrsa gradually decrease fig 5c which proves that the light stimulation produced more free radicals and thus cause more bacteria died sem images and laser confocal experiments during the bacterial reaction process also demonstrated the disinfection performance of the catalyst fig 5d and figs s27 s28 3 5 investigation of photoexcited charge transportation in order to investigate the mechanism of the excellent photocatalytic performance of h fe in2o3 its light absorption capacity and electron transmit capacity were studied uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs shows that h fe in2o3 has enhanced visible light absorption capacity fig 6 a and fig s29 which may be due to the unique tubular hollow structure derived from mofs can realize multiple light scattering reflection of incident light effectively enhancing the light capture ability kang et al 2022 at the same time fe doping leads to a significant shortening of the bandgap fig 5a inset which is conducive to the excitation of electron hole pairs and transport chen et al 2023b therefore the schematic diagram of the band structure obtained by combining valence band xps spectroscopy is shown in figs s30 s31 meanwhile photoluminescence spectroscopy fig 6b shows that the pl emission intensity of h fe in2o3 is significantly weaker indicating that the presence of fe leads to the reduction of carrier recombination rate which is consistent with the results of uv vis this phenomenon is more obvious in tubular structures with higher photocatalytic performance khan et al 2020 in addition trpl spectra shows that the average lifetime of h fe in2o3 6 19 ns is much longer than that of h in2o3 4 86 ns and b fe in2o3 1 53 ns table s10 this indicates that the existence of charge transfer channels formed by the tubular structure derived from mofs inhibits the recombination of charge carriers chen et al 2023a wei et al 2021 at the same time more photoexcited electrons holes can participate in the photochemical catalytic process thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity based on the above studies it is speculated that hollow structure significantly improves the efficiency of carrier separation and transfer which can provide more electrons to participate in the fe3 fe2 cycling and thus activate h2o2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface thus improving the photo fenton h2o2 activation ability of the catalyst zhang et al 2022 fig 6c shows the density of states dos plot for h in2o3 and h fe in2o3 fe doping significantly increases the total state density in the middle of the band gap and the electron density of fe in2o3 samples near the fermi level is higher than that of in2o3 samples chen et al 2022 fe doping introduces two mid gap states into the band gap consisting mainly of the coupling of fe 3d states and o 2p states fig s32 these gap states can act as intermediate levels for electron excitation allowing electrons to first absorb low energy photons to transfer to impurity levels and then to conduction bands at the same time dos also proved that fe doping leads to the narrowing of band gap which is conducive to catalytic reaction qian et al 2023 additionally photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were conducted to gain a deep insight into the charge generation transfer behavior as can be seen from fig 6d the photocurrent of h fe in2o3 is significantly enhanced which indicates that fe doping significantly improves the efficiency of carrier separation and migration and the tubular structure shortens the carrier transport distance and accelerates the transfer of photoelectrons at the interface guan et al 2017 the eis nyquist plots fig 6e showed that h fe in2o3 presents a smaller semicircle and a manifest lower rt value 0 93 kω compared with other catalysts subsequently the carrier density and band potential of the catalyst were calculated by the mott schottky curve fig 6f which provided more evidence for electron transfer in hollow tubes in order to further investigate the mechanism of electron transfer in h fe in2o3 we investigated the changes in the ratio of fe2 fe3 during the reaction the fe2 fe3 ratio of h fe in2o3 increased from 0 86 to 1 21 and decreased to 0 91 after 20 min for xps at different times during the reaction process fig 6g which indicates that the hollow tubular structure promoting fe2 regeneration and efficient fe2 fe3 cycling however the change of fe2 fe3 in the reaction process of b fe in2o3 is not obvious maintaining around 0 8 indicating that the bulk structure inhibits the interfacial electron transfer fig s34 xiao et al 2023 similarly the concentration of fe2 on the catalyst was also verified by color experiment fig 6h the continuous conversion of fe3 to fe2 and oxidation of h2o2 indicate that fe as the center of the active site can carry out rapid electron transfer while fe2 continuously accumulated without h2o2 xu et al 2017 during the reaction of b fe in2o3 the concentration of fe2 changed little which is consistent with the results of xps the charge density differences cdd and bader charge analysis table s11 show that the electron loss ability of fe site fe in2o3 is stronger than that of in site in in2o3 see blue cloud in fig 6i and fig s35 which proves that fe as the active site in fe in2o3 can obtain more electrons and the electron cloud density is higher which is beneficial to the reaction and provides a theoretical basis for the charge transfer the above results prove the reason for more photogenerated electrons in h fe in2o3 and its effective utilization from the intrinsic characteristics 3 6 practical application of continuous flow reactor to evaluate the potential use of h fe in2o3 a continuous flow reactor consisting of h fe in2o3 graphite felt h fe in2o3 gf was used to treat the long term degradation of contaminants and arb the schematic diagram of the device and experimental equipment were shown in figs 7 a and 7b in order to avoid secondary pollution caused by the catalysts gf was used as catalyst carrier and successfully prepared h fe in2o3 gf reactor by in situ growth method the catalyst is stably attached to the gf surface and the catalyst basically did not fall off during the catalytic reaction fig 7c to test the performance of h fe in2o3 gf catalyst we collected the secondary effluent from the nankai university wastewater treatment plant tianjin china cod and nh4 n fig 7d were used to demonstrate the ability to purify secondary effluent after the photocatalytic degradation of wastewater by h fe in2o3 gf the concentrations of cod and nh4 n decreased by 12 9 mg l and 7 4 mg l removal rates were 66 2 and 82 5 showing excellent water purification capacity after continuous operation for 600 min the tc removal rate of h fe in2o3 gf system remains at 97 2 which proves its long term stability and its performance is significantly better than b fe in2o3 gf system which is due to the high exposure active site of mofs derived tubular structure moreover the system can maintain satisfactory toc removal rate and low fe ion leaching rate fig 7f the removal of bacteria from secondary effluent was evaluated and the initial bacteria of about 3 5 log were basically completely removed meeting the discharge standard of secondary effluent fig 7g plate counting method also proves that h fe in2o3 can continuously remove bacteria without cleaning catalyst with good stability and durability fig 7h compared with other practical device applications this continuous flow reactor has lower reaction costs and significant advantages in actual wastewater treatment table s12 the above discussion shows that one dimensional hollow h fe in2o3 nanotubes provide efficiency and stability guarantee for the treatment of large scale antibiotic wastewater and have a wide range of practical applications 4 conclusions in conclusion we take hollow fe doped in2o3 nanotubes as the research object and prove that fe doped in2o3 and hollow tubular structure play an important role in the removal of pollutants and arb in the photo fenton process the experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that fe doping reduces the band gap and promotes the absorption of visible light it also increases the electron density at the fermi level and promotes electron transfer the large specific surface area of the hollow tube exposes more fe active sites which is conducive to the adsorption of h2o2 at the same time the fe sites on the surface reduce the activation energy barrier of h2o2 and promote the production of more and faster oh as a result the h fe in2o3 enables efficient removal and mineralization of pollutants without interference from organic and inorganic compounds under the environmental background ultimately 20 ppm tc can decompose over 90 30 min with a k value of up to 0 27 min 1 m 1 and 7 log of arb can be inactivated within 15 min the h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system shows unexpectedly high catalytic activity in a wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 and has good recyclability after 5 cycles moreover the system reduces the potential environmental risks of tc and intermediate products and the toxicity is greatly reduced it is worth noting that h fe in2o3 flow reactor can achieve effective removal of antibiotics and arb in secondary effluent for continuous 10 h which provides an effective way for photo fenton sterilization and disinfection of actual wastewater credit authorship contribution statement fei li investigation writing original draft formal analysis funding acquisition

14736,the low exposure of active sites and the slow electron transfer rate still restrict the wide application of the photo fenton system of fe based photocatalyst in practical water treatment herein we prepared a hollow fe doped in2o3 nanotube h fe in2o3 catalyst for activating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to remove tetracycline tc and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb incorporation of fe could shorten the band gap and increase the absorption capacity of visible light meanwhile the increase of electron density at the fermi level promotes the interfacial electron transport the large specific surface area of the tubular structure exposes more fe active site and the fe o in site reduces the energy barrier of h2o2 activation resulting in more and faster formation of hydroxyl radicals oh after continuous operation for 600 min the h fe in2o3 reactor still can remove 85 tc and about 3 5 log arb in secondary effluent showing good stability and durability for practical wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photo fenton fe in2o3 nanotubular tetracycline antibiotic resistant bacteria secondary effluent data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the concern with a variety of biological and chemical emerging pollutants have been ubiquitously detected in water environments li et al 2022 spellman et al 2022 especially pharmaceutical residues such as antibiotics due to the influence to increase antibacterial resistance tello et al 2012 in addition traditional wastewater treatment methods have not shown efficiency in fully degrading these compounds or have neglected to disinfect pathogenic bacteria resulting in serious downstream contamination and limitations in the treatment of large amounts of wastewater bai et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to develop safe and effective technologies to achieve the removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb from the aquatic environment in order to achieve the standard of reclaimed water quality required for safe reuse fenton reaction is an advanced oxidation technique to generate reactive oxygen species ros mineralization antibiotics by activating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 with fe2 chen et al 2021a liu et al 2022 in the traditional homogeneous fenton process there are some disadvantages such as narrow range of ph value low recovery of fe2 and poor accumulation of iron containing sludge therefore the emerging photo fenton like technology has been widely used in water pollution control giannakis et al 2018 in recent years many studies have focused on exploring heterogeneous catalysts in fenton like technology and the results showed that fe based multiphase catalysis have obvious advantages in the efficient activation of h2o2 shi et al 2022 wu et al 2022 zhao et al adjusted the band gap of the catalyst by means of fe doped titanium dioxide tio2 to accelerate the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers on the visible surface generated more ros to participate in pollutant degradation and improved the synergistic effect between photocatalysis and fenton reaction zhao et al 2023 currently reports on fe based catalysts mostly used post synthesis modification strategies for synthesis resulting in complex preparation processes the metal particles in the material tend to agglomerate the active site less exposed the catalytic activity decreased and the pollutant removal rate was not ideal moreover the material stability was poor and the problem of metal ion leaching was serious it is worth noting that metal organic frameworks mofs are ideal templates for constructing bimetallic oxides due to their adjustable functionality high pore volume and high metal content mo et al 2023 zhang et al 2023 the catalyst prepared from mofs precursor can not only retain the porous structure but also have multiple metal fixing sites mo et al 2022 therefore mofs derived metal oxide catalysts can overcome the shortcomings of low exposure of active site and slow electron transfer rate which is an effective means to achieve efficient heterogeneous photo fenton reaction morphological engineering is regarded as an effective method to improve the catalytic activity and performance of photocatalysts at present two dimensional 2d nanosheets nanoflowers nanorods and other structures are commonly used in the structural design and morphology of catalysts tang et al 2023 among them one dimensional hollow structures have received extensive attention in the field of zinc air batteries electrochemical energy storage and aqueous contaminants removal fang et al 2021 feng et al 2020 hollow tubular structures have many advantages over other catalysts i it has the ability to enrich pollutants and oxidants enhance light collection and reduce charge recombination lv et al 2017 ii it provides larger specific surface area and more reactive active sites chen et al 2011 iii it can increase the rate of charge transfer along the axis offers a highway channel for the transport of electrons radicals wang et al 2018 compared with bulk g c3n4 the p doped tubular g c3n4 nanostructure has higher specific surface area 60 57 m2 g 1 stronger light absorption capacity and better charge carrier separation and transfer efficiency and optimized hydrogen evolution rate is about 22 4 folds than that pristine bulk g c3n4 wu et al 2019 dai et al utilized synergetic morphology engineering and band structure engineering in boron doped carbon nitride hollow nanotubes to achieve efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution dai et al 2023 these results indicate that hollow tubular structure can be used as an excellent carrier of iron in heterogeneous photo fenton system inspired by the above considerations we dexterously design and synthesize a mof derived fe doped indium oxide hollow nanotubes h fe in2o3 by combining the advantages of high activity and stable metal sites of mofs with morphology engineering at the same time the formation of the hollow tube structure helps to increase the specific surface area increase the visible light capture ability and enhance the electron transport ability meanwhile the highly dispersed iron active sites on the hollow nanotube structure promoted the adsorption and activation of h2o2 in this case this study aims to investigate the removal of organic pollutants and arbs in wastewater using a continuous flow reactor which provides an effective way for photo fenton sterilization and disinfection of actual wastewater 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of catalysts the h in2o3 and h fe in2o3 were synthesized by two steps through mild hydrothermal method to obtain in fe mil 68 precursor and the continuous annealing precursor by adding different amounts of fe no3 3 9h2o to obtain different fe doped in2o3 which is defined as x fe in2o3 samples x represents the mass percentage of doped fe similarly h in2o3 is also synthetized using the same method without adding fe no3 3 9h2o the details for preparing h in2o3 h fe in2o3 b in2o3 and b fe in2o3 were displayed in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 2 characterizations the

approach was used to modify the intra atomic coulomb interaction among strongly correlated in 4d and fe 3d electrons in the calculations we applied ueff 5 ev walsh et al 2008 and 3 ev for in 4d and fe 3d electrons respectively the energy barriers from h2o2 decomposition to oh in in2o3 and fe in2o3 were estimated using the nudged elastic band neb method 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterizations a series of hollow fe doped in2o3 nanotube h fe in2o3 were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction and a facile calcination of in fe mil 68 precursor fig 1 a by tuning the amount of metal salts table s1 a series of catalysts with different fe contents were synthesized denoted as x h fe in2o3 x represents the mass percentage of doped fe among all samples fe doped in2o3 with 4 fe doping was selected as a typical sample in this study due to the best performance the as prepared hollow in2o3 nanotube h in2o3 and h fe in2o3 samples are identified as an uniform thick walled hollow nanotube structure composed of small particles under tem fig 1b and fig s1 and no fe nanoparticles are observed indicating the highly dispersed of fe element combined with atom force microscope afm and sem fig s2 it can be seen that the diameter of h fe in2o3 nanotube is about 150 200 nm wall thickness is about 60 nm the lattice fringes matched well with the crystal planes of h in2o3 space group la 3 and it is reconfirmed by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 1c eds mapping profiles on h fe in2o3 fig 1d shows the distribution of in o and fe elements indicating the successful doping of fe in h in2o3 similarly bulk in2o3 b in2o3 and bulk fe doped in2o3 b fe in2o3 were successfully prepared fig 1e and fig s3 xrd results revealed the cubic phase of in2o3 over all samples jcpds card no 06 0416 chen et al 2021b without the diffraction peaks of fe related compounds the diffraction peaks of fe doped in2o3 shift toward lower 2θ values fig 1f which may be due to the smaller ionic radius of fe3 0 64 å compared to that of in3 0 80 å so fe ions can be successfully incorporated into the in2o3 lattice by occupying in3 sites without altering the cubic structure alshammari et al 2020 jiang et al 2009 fourier transform infrared resonance ftir and raman spectroscopy also show that fe is successfully doped into in2o3 fig s4 xps was performed to determine the effects of fe doping on the chemical states of in and o elements in nanotubes fig s5 the h in2o3 shows two peaks at 443 97 ev in 3d 5 2 and 451 61 ev in 3d 3 2 which are ascribed to in3 state fig 2 a due to the electronegativity of fe is greater than that of in the electron density around the o atom bonded with fe decreases the shielding effect decreases and then the binding energy of lattice oxygen increases zhu et al 2022 at the same time the electron density of in atom connected with lattice oxygen also decreases the shielding effect decreases and the corresponding binding energy of in atom increases after fe doping oxygen vacancies slightly increase which also improves the performance of fe in2o3 to some extent fig 2b in b fe in2o3 there is no significant shift of binding energy in 3d and o 1s indicating that the change of electron density caused by the introduction of fe in b fe in2o3 is small this may be because the bulk structure of b fe in2o3 leads to poor dispersion of doped fe and part of fe is not doped into the lattice as shown in fig 2c the two peaks at the banding energy of 709 9 ev fe 2p 3 2 and 724 4 ev fe 2p 1 2 with two satellite peaks at 718 8 ev and 729 3 ev are consistent with fe3 species two deconvoluted peaks sited at 711 7 ev and 722 8 ev with the satellite peaks at 714 6 ev and 727 9 ev from fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 spin orbit split respectively are assigned to the presence of fe2 species hou et al 2022 in the meantime fe 2p spectra of h fe in2o3 shifts towards lower binding energy compared with b fe in2o3 fig 2d manifesting that hollow structure is favorable to obtain reaction center fe with higher local electron density xiao et al 2019 3 2 degradation performance of as prepared catalysts to evaluate the photo fenton reaction activity of h fe in2o3 catalysts the oxidative degradation of tetracycline tc was selected as a reaction model the optimal experimental parameters catalyst 0 0 4 g l 1 tc 0 20 mg l 1 h2o2 0 10 mm for the reaction system were also determined fig s6 it is obvious that h fe in2o3 shows excellent catalytic activity and its rate constants kobs 0 0543 min 1 are about 6 7 times that of h in2o3 0 00809 min 1 and 9 2 times that of b fe in2o3 0 00589 min 1 fig 3 a these results indicate that the introduction of fe promotes the degradation of tc by photo fenton and has a higher reactivity of the tubular structure the performance of h fe in2o3 in pollutant degradation was further verified first according to the tc adsorption kinetics fig 3b the equilibrium adsorption of h fe in2o3 and b fe in2o3 were completed within 1 h and the adsorption reached apparent equilibrium within 3 h the pseudo first order model fit well indicating that the hollow nanotube may have a large specific surface area and have the advantage of spatial enrichment and adsorption of pollutants gupta et al 2011 interestingly the h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system can remove 90 4 tc within 30 min and almost 100 tc within 60 min indicating that fe site can rapidly activate h2o2 to degrade tc under visible light demonstrating the interaction between fe and in2o3 fig s7 fig 3c exhibits the relationship between catalysts with different fe loadings and degradation efficiency the catalytic activity does not increase monotonically with fe concentration which may be due to the fact that the doping amount is easy to agglomerate and block the active site it can be observed that the catalyst with 4 fe loading exhibits the best catalytic activity fig s8 and total organic carbon toc removal 61 6 after 5 h which indicates that hollow structure has unique advantages in the process of pollutant degradation and mineralization fig s9 in addition the h fe in2o3 catalyst showed good performance after 5 cycles fig 3e and fig s10 and the properties of the material surface did not change after the reaction proving the recyclability and stability of the material figs s11 s12 the h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system can efficiently oxidize a variety of refractory pollutants in wastewater fig 3f see table s2 for the detailed structure then h fe in2o3 show unexpectedly high catalytic activity in a wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 which is in sharp contrast to previous studies with a narrow ph application range fig s13 moreover the low leakage of iron ions fig s14 which can be attributed to the stabilizing effect of mofs precursors on metal ions effectively mitigates potential environmental hazards caused by material leakage during usage also no remaining tc was detected by uplc ms on the catalyst surface after the degradation process fig s15 indicating that tc was gradually mineralized in the solution based on the reaction intermediates identified by lc ms a possible degradation pathway was proposed fig s16 the prediction results ecosar and test software of the chronic toxicity acute toxicity bioaccumulation factors developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of tc and its catalytic degradation products on aquatic organisms showed that the toxicity was greatly reduced figs s17 18 and tables s3 5 it is worth noting that h fe in2o3 also showed excellent performance under various water conditions fig 3g and can effectively resist the interference of background ions such as ha cl and hco3 fig s19 even in the secondary discharge water of sewage treatment plant tianjin china the efficiency of tc removal can still reach 83 which has certain practical applications considering that the kobs could be affected by the reaction conditions and type of organics a normalized kinetic model k value calculated by dividing the kobs by catalyst dosage and oxidant concentration followed by multiplying the contaminant concentration was introduced to evaluate the removal rate in various heterogeneous fenton like systems he et al 2018 compared with catalysts reported in other literatures the k values of h fe in2o3 is higher indicating that it only requires a small amount of catalyst and h2o2 to achieve a higher pollutant removal rate and has a higher performance among similar catalysts fig 3h and tables s6 s7 an et al 2023 du et al 2018 lai et al 2023 silva et al 2021 xiunan et al 2022 compared with similar catalysts this catalyst is easy to prepare and has a lower cost table s8 making it an excellent catalyst for efficiently degrading pollutants 3 3 activation of h2o2 and identification of the reactive species in order to explore the activation mechanism of h2o2 the surface chemical reaction between catalyst and h2o2 was further investigated first of all h fe in2o3 showed significantly better activation ability of h2o2 than b fe in2o3 91 fig s20 by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a trapping agent fig 4 a the strong epr characteristic signals attribute to dmpo oh adducts verify the generation of oh and the stronger characteristic signal observed in h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system shows that the amount of oh is much more than other systems indicating that tubular structure fe sites can effectively activate h2o2 and generate abundant free radicals chemical quenching experiments also proved above results fig s21 further the oh produced during the reaction was monitored by in situ epr fig 4b shows that the production of oh gradually increases with the extension of time which proves the continuous transfer of electrons and rapid activation of h2o2 in the reaction system oh and superoxide anion radical o2 were quantified with benzoic acid and nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt by high performance liquid chromatography hplc fig 4c and fig s22 zhou et al 2021 the results showed that the oh content of h fe in2o3 was about 4 times that of b fe in2o3 indicating that the activation ability of h fe in2o3 to generate oh was significantly enhanced the main reason is that the tubular structure has the ability to enrich h2o2 and the structural advantage of accelerating the electron transfer at the interface he et al 2016 shang et al 2023 which promotes the efficient activation of h2o2 and generates a large amount of oh the high specific surface area of h fe in2o3 74 533 m2 g 1 is mainly attributed to the hollow tubular structure derived from mof which is conducive to the dispersion of fe active site and the activation of h2o2 fig s23 and table s9 in situ raman fig 4d the weakening of oo stretching vibration peak 874 cm 1 demonstrates the breaking of the oo bond in h2o2 xu et al 2022 while the rapid weakening of the fe o stretching vibration peak 563 cm 1 and the slow weakening of fe oh in fe ooh 632 cm 1 together demonstrate the bridge adsorption activation of h2o2 by fe site the gibbs free energy during the activation of h2o2 were calculated by dft structure models in fig s24 the intermediate structure and corresponding energy distribution are shown in fig 4e where blue and red paths represent activation mechanisms at in o in of in2o3 and in o fe sites of fe in2o3 respectively the adsorption process fig s25 from i to ii indicates that the negative adsorption energy of fe site is larger and h2o2 is more easily adsorbed on fe site which is conducive to accelerating the reduction process and improving the fenton property at this time adjacent metal atoms are easy to adsorb another o atom to form bridge adsorption and the oo bond in h2o2 is instantly elongated to form a transition state ts from process iii to iv which is the rate limiting step of h2o2 activation the gibbs free energy of ts formed by fe in2o3 δe 0 327 ev is significantly less than that of in2o3 δe 1 270 ev so fe o in is more prone to oo fracture and the formation of oh can be evaluated liu et al 2020 finally the energy of the oh desorption process at the fe site is lower than that at the in site therefore the stronger the desorption of oh at the fe site the more oh is produced in conclusion as the active site fe site is more likely to activate h2o2 and generate a large amount of oh 3 4 disinfection performance in addition to the effective removal of antibiotics gram negative bacteria tetracycline resistant escherichia coli tc e coli and gram positive bacteria methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa are used as two types of arb models to evaluate the bactericidal performance of the catalyst the h fe in2o3 can remove about 7 log tc e coli 15 min and mrsa 18 min fig 5 a which is significantly better than b fe in2o3 indicating that one dimensional tubular structures significantly improved the disinfection performance of the catalyst the effects of different catalyst ratios free radical types and h2o2 concentration on the whole experiment were discussed fig s26 dna leakage atp content changes and bacterial morphology at different times evaluated the disinfection performance of h fe in2o3 according to the increase of the absorbance value at 260 nm of the target strain and the intracellular atp content of the bacteria gradually decreased which proved that the impaired membrane permeability intracellular nucleotide flowed out and the loss of inorganic phosphate through the membrane leading to the increase of atp hydrolysis rate fig 5b yang et al 2019 with the increase of time the number of colonies of tc e coli and mrsa gradually decrease fig 5c which proves that the light stimulation produced more free radicals and thus cause more bacteria died sem images and laser confocal experiments during the bacterial reaction process also demonstrated the disinfection performance of the catalyst fig 5d and figs s27 s28 3 5 investigation of photoexcited charge transportation in order to investigate the mechanism of the excellent photocatalytic performance of h fe in2o3 its light absorption capacity and electron transmit capacity were studied uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs shows that h fe in2o3 has enhanced visible light absorption capacity fig 6 a and fig s29 which may be due to the unique tubular hollow structure derived from mofs can realize multiple light scattering reflection of incident light effectively enhancing the light capture ability kang et al 2022 at the same time fe doping leads to a significant shortening of the bandgap fig 5a inset which is conducive to the excitation of electron hole pairs and transport chen et al 2023b therefore the schematic diagram of the band structure obtained by combining valence band xps spectroscopy is shown in figs s30 s31 meanwhile photoluminescence spectroscopy fig 6b shows that the pl emission intensity of h fe in2o3 is significantly weaker indicating that the presence of fe leads to the reduction of carrier recombination rate which is consistent with the results of uv vis this phenomenon is more obvious in tubular structures with higher photocatalytic performance khan et al 2020 in addition trpl spectra shows that the average lifetime of h fe in2o3 6 19 ns is much longer than that of h in2o3 4 86 ns and b fe in2o3 1 53 ns table s10 this indicates that the existence of charge transfer channels formed by the tubular structure derived from mofs inhibits the recombination of charge carriers chen et al 2023a wei et al 2021 at the same time more photoexcited electrons holes can participate in the photochemical catalytic process thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity based on the above studies it is speculated that hollow structure significantly improves the efficiency of carrier separation and transfer which can provide more electrons to participate in the fe3 fe2 cycling and thus activate h2o2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface thus improving the photo fenton h2o2 activation ability of the catalyst zhang et al 2022 fig 6c shows the density of states dos plot for h in2o3 and h fe in2o3 fe doping significantly increases the total state density in the middle of the band gap and the electron density of fe in2o3 samples near the fermi level is higher than that of in2o3 samples chen et al 2022 fe doping introduces two mid gap states into the band gap consisting mainly of the coupling of fe 3d states and o 2p states fig s32 these gap states can act as intermediate levels for electron excitation allowing electrons to first absorb low energy photons to transfer to impurity levels and then to conduction bands at the same time dos also proved that fe doping leads to the narrowing of band gap which is conducive to catalytic reaction qian et al 2023 additionally photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were conducted to gain a deep insight into the charge generation transfer behavior as can be seen from fig 6d the photocurrent of h fe in2o3 is significantly enhanced which indicates that fe doping significantly improves the efficiency of carrier separation and migration and the tubular structure shortens the carrier transport distance and accelerates the transfer of photoelectrons at the interface guan et al 2017 the eis nyquist plots fig 6e showed that h fe in2o3 presents a smaller semicircle and a manifest lower rt value 0 93 kω compared with other catalysts subsequently the carrier density and band potential of the catalyst were calculated by the mott schottky curve fig 6f which provided more evidence for electron transfer in hollow tubes in order to further investigate the mechanism of electron transfer in h fe in2o3 we investigated the changes in the ratio of fe2 fe3 during the reaction the fe2 fe3 ratio of h fe in2o3 increased from 0 86 to 1 21 and decreased to 0 91 after 20 min for xps at different times during the reaction process fig 6g which indicates that the hollow tubular structure promoting fe2 regeneration and efficient fe2 fe3 cycling however the change of fe2 fe3 in the reaction process of b fe in2o3 is not obvious maintaining around 0 8 indicating that the bulk structure inhibits the interfacial electron transfer fig s34 xiao et al 2023 similarly the concentration of fe2 on the catalyst was also verified by color experiment fig 6h the continuous conversion of fe3 to fe2 and oxidation of h2o2 indicate that fe as the center of the active site can carry out rapid electron transfer while fe2 continuously accumulated without h2o2 xu et al 2017 during the reaction of b fe in2o3 the concentration of fe2 changed little which is consistent with the results of xps the charge density differences cdd and bader charge analysis table s11 show that the electron loss ability of fe site fe in2o3 is stronger than that of in site in in2o3 see blue cloud in fig 6i and fig s35 which proves that fe as the active site in fe in2o3 can obtain more electrons and the electron cloud density is higher which is beneficial to the reaction and provides a theoretical basis for the charge transfer the above results prove the reason for more photogenerated electrons in h fe in2o3 and its effective utilization from the intrinsic characteristics 3 6 practical application of continuous flow reactor to evaluate the potential use of h fe in2o3 a continuous flow reactor consisting of h fe in2o3 graphite felt h fe in2o3 gf was used to treat the long term degradation of contaminants and arb the schematic diagram of the device and experimental equipment were shown in figs 7 a and 7b in order to avoid secondary pollution caused by the catalysts gf was used as catalyst carrier and successfully prepared h fe in2o3 gf reactor by in situ growth method the catalyst is stably attached to the gf surface and the catalyst basically did not fall off during the catalytic reaction fig 7c to test the performance of h fe in2o3 gf catalyst we collected the secondary effluent from the nankai university wastewater treatment plant tianjin china cod and nh4 n fig 7d were used to demonstrate the ability to purify secondary effluent after the photocatalytic degradation of wastewater by h fe in2o3 gf the concentrations of cod and nh4 n decreased by 12 9 mg l and 7 4 mg l removal rates were 66 2 and 82 5 showing excellent water purification capacity after continuous operation for 600 min the tc removal rate of h fe in2o3 gf system remains at 97 2 which proves its long term stability and its performance is significantly better than b fe in2o3 gf system which is due to the high exposure active site of mofs derived tubular structure moreover the system can maintain satisfactory toc removal rate and low fe ion leaching rate fig 7f the removal of bacteria from secondary effluent was evaluated and the initial bacteria of about 3 5 log were basically completely removed meeting the discharge standard of secondary effluent fig 7g plate counting method also proves that h fe in2o3 can continuously remove bacteria without cleaning catalyst with good stability and durability fig 7h compared with other practical device applications this continuous flow reactor has lower reaction costs and significant advantages in actual wastewater treatment table s12 the above discussion shows that one dimensional hollow h fe in2o3 nanotubes provide efficiency and stability guarantee for the treatment of large scale antibiotic wastewater and have a wide range of practical applications 4 conclusions in conclusion we take hollow fe doped in2o3 nanotubes as the research object and prove that fe doped in2o3 and hollow tubular structure play an important role in the removal of pollutants and arb in the photo fenton process the experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that fe doping reduces the band gap and promotes the absorption of visible light it also increases the electron density at the fermi level and promotes electron transfer the large specific surface area of the hollow tube exposes more fe active sites which is conducive to the adsorption of h2o2 at the same time the fe sites on the surface reduce the activation energy barrier of h2o2 and promote the production of more and faster oh as a result the h fe in2o3 enables efficient removal and mineralization of pollutants without interference from organic and inorganic compounds under the environmental background ultimately 20 ppm tc can decompose over 90 30 min with a k value of up to 0 27 min 1 m 1 and 7 log of arb can be inactivated within 15 min the h fe in2o3 h2o2 vis system shows unexpectedly high catalytic activity in a wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 and has good recyclability after 5 cycles moreover the system reduces the potential environmental risks of tc and intermediate products and the toxicity is greatly reduced it is worth noting that h fe in2o3 flow reactor can achieve effective removal of antibiotics and arb in secondary effluent for continuous 10 h which provides an effective way for photo fenton sterilization and disinfection of actual wastewater credit authorship contribution statement fei li investigation writing original draft formal analysis funding acquisition

14737,removal of low carbon fatty amines lcfas in wastewater treatment poses a significant technical challenge due to their small molecular size high polarity high bond dissociation energy electron deficiency and poor biodegradability moreover their low brønsted acidity deteriorates this issue to address this problem we have developed a novel base induced autocatalytic technique for the highly efficient removal of a model pollutant dimethylamine dma in a homogeneous peroxymonosulfate pms system a high reaction rate constant of 0 32 min 1 and almost complete removal of dma within 12 min are achieved multi scaled characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the in situ constructed c n bond as the crucial active site activates pms to produce abundant 1o2 subsequently 1o2 oxidizes dma through multiple h abstractions accompanied by the generation of another c n structure thus achieving the autocatalytic cycle of pollutant during this process base induced proton transfers of pollutant and oxidant are essential prerequisites for c n fabrication a relevant mechanism of autocatalytic degradation is unraveled and further supported by dft calculations at the molecular level various assessments indicate that this self catalytic technique exhibits a reduced toxicity and volatility process and a low treatment cost 0 47 m3 this technology has strong environmental tolerance especially for the high concentrations of chlorine ion 1775 ppm and humic acid 50 ppm moreover it not only exhibits excellent degradation performance for different amine organics but also for the coexisting common pollutants including ofloxacin phenol and sulforaphane these results fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy for practical application in wastewater treatment overall this autocatalysis technology based on the in situ construction of metal free active site by regulating proton transfer will provide a brand new strategy for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords base induced proton transfers 1o2 mediated autocatalysis c n active site dimethylamine dma peroxymonosulfate activation wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction low carbon c1 c3 fatty amines lcfas discharged from various chemical industries and agricultures processes dai et al 2022 have attracted increasing public attention such organics not only pose a threat to the water environment due to their strong polarity and potential carcinogenicity but also evaporate easily from water into the atmosphere resulting from their high volatility to as the main precursors of ozone and pm2 5 greatly increasing environment and health risks dai et al 2022 lin et al 2021 wu et al 2022 different from common benzene containing unsaturated organics lcfas feature with small molecular volume strong polarity and water solubility high bond dissociation energy e g 365 kj mol of n h 355 kj mol of c n and 392 kj mol of c h for dimethylamine shorted as dma electron deficient state and show resistance to biodegradation du et al 2022 fernandes et al 2019 guo et al 2022 worsely low brønsted acidity of lcfas e g pka 10 7 for dma is far less than the ph of common water matrix makes them predominantly present at a protonated inert state greatly lowering their reactivity hou et al 2022 these characteristics render such contaminants difficult to remove and would inevitably require a lot of energy or chemical input seriously violating the principle of sustainable development dai et al 2022 he and cheng 2016 peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted considerable attention for the oxidation of various organic contaminants in wastewater because of the merits of high oxidation capacity rapid reaction kinetics and wide ph application range lin et al 2022 wang and wang 2018 yang et al 2018 currently pms based aops mainly focus on the introduction of extra energy e g heat ultraviolet and ultrasound and exogenous catalysts including homogeneous e g fe2 and co2 and heterogeneous catalysts e g metal oxide carbon based material and single atom catalyst to activate pms for the generation of various reactive oxygen species ross to attack organics honarmandrad et al 2023 rayaroth et al 2023 ren et al 2022 wei et al 2022 among them heterogeneous catalytic pms system exhibits the most potential for development owing to their relatively lower cost and fewer secondary environmental hazards also this technology has been demonstrated to show good removal performance for lcfas dai et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 however such heterogeneous catalytic systems still encounter the issues of complex catalyst preparation and separation processes in which a great deal of manpower materials and energy will be consumed especially exogenous metal based catalysts have to face inevitable metal ion leaching during the treatment process given these if a metal free active site or catalyst can be constructed in situ in the reaction system to replace the conventional addition of external catalysts it would be a very promising strategy to solve the above problems but remains a huge challenge based on the reported literature on the one hand we found that the c o functional group in the pollutants is the active site of activating pms to produce highly selective singlet oxygen 1o2 gallop and edwards 1981 xiao et al 2021 zhou et al 2015 2017 on the other hand lcfas have been reported to be attacked by ross to produce imine substances with c n bond in the atmospheric environment bunkan et al 2022 inspired by these we speculate that it is a very possible way to explore the in situ construction of the c n bond as an active site in the aqueous lcfas pms system to produce 1o2 for lcfas abatement because of c n bond with a similar structure and properties to c o herein dma is used as the model pollutants of lcfas we have constructed the c n active site in situ by adding only 4 mm of commercial naoh to the dma pms system to induce the proton transfers of pollutant and pms this site indeed effectively activates pms to generate rich 1o2 which further mediates the efficient autocatalytic degradation of dma to unravel the underlying mechanism the effect of base induced proton transfer on the reactivity and reaction pathway of the pollutant was first explored further the autocatalytic degradation mechanism was studied in detail via the quenching experiment electron spin resonance spectrometer esr capture experiments products identification and density functional theory dft theoretical calculation afterward the toxicity and volatility of the intermediates and the treatment cost of our reaction system are evaluated and the effects of various influencing factors in wastewater on catalytic activity have also been investigated finally four machine learning ml models are utilized to establish the relationship between various influencing parameters and catalytic activity and illustrate feature importance to further guide the potential applications different from the previously reported pms activation under an alkaline environment in which base lou et al 2017 qi et al 2016 or benzoquinone intermediates with c o structure from phenolic parents zhou et al 2017 usually act as catalysts for other organics degradation this study is among the first to regulate the proton transfers in the reaction system to trigger the in situ construction of the c n active site thus further inducing the efficient autocatalytic degradation of refractory lcfas through pms activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals detailed information on chemicals and reagents applied can be seen in text s1 of supporting information 2 2 activity evaluation all experiments on the degradation of dma used 150 ml of erlenmeyer flasks sealed with a rubber stopper typically the reaction was initiated by adding

degradation when pms was added to the dma containing solution the ph of the system was immediately decreased to about 4 blue line in fig 1 b in which both pollutant pka 10 7 and pms pka 9 5 presented at dmah and hso5 sates respectively according to their morphology distributions fig 1d in this case dma showed no significant degradation blue line in fig 1a in contrast after the introduction of naoh 4 mm the in situ ph of system ranged from 11 5 to 11 along with the reaction time red line in fig 1b under such alkaline environment both the proton h of dmah and hso5 proton donors transferred into h2o after reacting with oh proton acceptor this process is so called proton transfer legon 1993 and then they were predominantly presented at dma and so5 2 sates respectively after proton transfers around 100 of dma was removed within 12 min with the pseudo first order reaction rate constant k obs of 0 32 min 1 red line in fig 1a and s1i during the same period around 50 of toc removal can be achieved inset in fig 1 moreover the measured dma k obs exhibited an excellent liner relationship r2 0 96 to pms concentrations fig s2 demonstrating the reaction was also first order to pms concentrations thereby the apparent second order rate constant k app for this reaction was determined to be 1 82 0 18 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2018 on the other hand similar to the trend of pollutant degradation pms kept unchanged without the addition of naoh around 42 of pms in 12 min was consumed in the sole presence of naoh 4 mm fig 1c and the introduction of dma into the naoh pms system further accelerated pms decomposition to ca 50 0 06 vs 0 05 min 1 fig s3 this could be assigned to the newly generated intermediate which acts like a catalyst that can effectively activate pms thus leading to improved pms decomposition additionally dma degradation can be triggered at a relatively wider range of basic ph 8 12 fig 1f fernandes et al 2018 2019 to exclude the effect of cation in base the effect of different base types naoh koh and ca oh 2 with the same concentration of oh on catalytic activity was investigated fig s4a results confirmed that the oh induced proton transfers instead of cations play an important role in catalytic activity more details can be found in the supporting information the above findings suggest that the addition of base oh into the dma pms system induces these proton transfers of the pollutant and pms which play crucial roles in triggering the dma degradation differently dma degradation in the dma pms naoh system does not rely on the external catalysts but depends on the in situ formed unique intermediate which acts as an endogenous catalyst to activate pms for the ros generation and ros in turn further accelerates the degradation of pollutant this process is defined as autocatalysis to confirm the above conclusion the influence of the degree of proton transfers on catalytic activity was further investigated with different naoh concentrations as shown in fig 1e f increasing the naoh concentration from 0 to 6 mm in situ ph changed from 4 to 12 correspondingly the proton transfer degree of pollutant i e dma volume fraction increased from 0 to 96 and the proton transfer degree of pms i e so5 2 volume fraction increased from 1 to 99 9 in the same case the k obs of dma increased from 0 to 0 32 min 1 and then decreased to 0 24 min 1 with the increased dosage of naoh moreover both the proton transfer degree of pollutant r2 0 921 fig 1g and pms r2 0 915 fig 1h displayed strong positive correlations with k obs these results substantiated that the base induced proton transfers in pollutant and pms indeed govern the catalytic activity the obtained removal efficiency in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system was higher than the previously reported methods fig 1i and table s1 and catalytic activity is superior to the classical co2 pms 0 02 min 1 and fe2 pms 0 min 1 homogeneous systems fig s5 which are dominated by free radicals pms utilization efficiency was calculated to be 19 in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system huang et al 2021 which was 2 4 fold higher than our previous heterogeneous derived carbon pms dma system fig 3i these findings suggest that the homogeneous self catalytic system shows a better potential for practical application 3 2 identification of ross in deprotonated system to reveal the driving force of efficient dma autocatalytic oxidation in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system quenching tests and in situ esr characterizations were performed to unravel the reactive species in quenching tests tba etoh and ffa were employed as the quenching agents for oh so4 and 1o2 respectively k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 tba 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 k so4 etoh 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 k oh etoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and k ffa 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 ding et al 2020 as displayed in fig 2 a and 2c tba and etoh at different concentrations 100 500 mm presented negligible effects on dma degradation implying that the system is independent of free radical pathways fig 2b right shows that dma degradation was not significantly affected by nb and ba which are the probes of oh and so4 respectively k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 k oh ba 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 and k so4 ba 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020 verifying the non existence of oh and so4 consistent with the results of quenching tests fig 2d left exhibits that no enhanced esr signals of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh were observed in deprotonated dma pms naoh system relative to the control groups also no dmpo ooh adduct was observed by mixed dmpo methanol as the spin trapping agent to screen out ho2 o2 fig 2d right on the contrary dma degradation efficiency was inhibited by 20 after the addition of 20 mm of ffa and the inhibition was further increased to 60 when increased ffa concentration to 80 mm left in fig 2b these results indicate that 1o2 is the main reactive specie considering that ffa cannot fully quench the degradation of dma a minor direct electron transfer for dma removal should exist in the reaction system dai et al 2022 sun et al 2021 to further reveal the origin of 1o2 involved in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system temp was utilized for trapping 1o2 sun et al 2021 as displayed in fig 2e only weak characteristic temp 1o2 signal with the intensity ratios of 1 1 1 can be observed in the co existence of naoh pms system which was assigned to pms self decomposition under alkaline conditions eq 1 note that the rate constant of pms self decomposition is so low 0 2 m 1 s 1 that 1o2 here generated is impossible to become the main active species in the system zhou et al 2015 1 hso5 so5 2 hso4 so4 2 1o2 unexpectedly after the addition of the pollutant into the naoh pms system a strong temp 1o2 signal was discerned this signal showed an increasing trend with the extension of reaction time fig s6 indicating an increased 1o2 generation therefore the newly generated abundant 1o2 should be the major active species in this case the abundant 1o2 generally could originate from dissolved oxygen do or pms activation to exclude the effect of do the experiments in different gas atmospheres n2 o2 and air by pre aeration for 30 min were carried out respectively as shown in fig 2f the gas atmospheres did not significantly influence the removal efficiency of dma suggesting that the rich 1o2 was not derived from do meanwhile the do activation is usually accompanied by the emergence of o2 and oh radicals zheng et al 2023 while these ross were not detected obviously in the dma pms naoh system fig 2d thus further indicating that do did not participate in the reaction system based on these discussions pms activation should be the exclusive source of abundant 1o2 from these results we deduced that a new intermediate should be in situ produced in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system which can efficiently catalyze pms to produce ample 1o2 in an alkaline environment ruling out the base as a catalyst 3 3 origin of base induced proton transfers triggering dma degradation to further explain the reason for base induced proton transfers triggering dma autocatalytic degradation dft calculations were performed to investigate the effect of proton transfer on the reactivity and reaction pathways of the pollutant firstly as shown in fig 3 a the electrostatic potential esp of deprotonated dma presents an uneven distribution compared to that of protonated dmah the highest occupied molecular orbital homo value of dma 6 15 ev is found to be higher than dmah 10 94 ev fig 3b indicating the former has a strong electron donating ability zhu et al 2001 these results show that the proton transfer in pollutant can promote the reactivity of dma furthermore we analyzed the possible reactive sites for deprotonated dma fig 3d exhibits that the n atom of deprotonated dma has the lowest negative condensed dual descriptor cdd value 0 2237 e the highest fukui index ƒ 0 3448 e and the largest condensed local nucleophilicity index cleni 1 023 e ev du et al 2022 frau and glossman mitnik 2018 qi et al 2022 these results suggest that the n atom of deprotonated dma is a potential site for the electrophilic attack of pms the evidence about electrophilic reaction can be found in fig s7 in the supporting information nihemaiti et al 2020 therefore the effect of proton transfer on the n site was further investigated as shown in fig 3c mulliken charges 0 435 e of the n atom in deprotonated dma are much more than that of dmah 0 295 e it suggests that proton transfer is beneficial for the n site to be electrophilic attack by pms which was in good agreement with esp and homo results together these discussions illustrate that proton transfer enhances the reactivity of the contaminant and promotes the electrophilic attack of pms on the n active sites secondly the formation of a relatively stable complex is the premise of electron transfer from pollutant to pms during direct oxidation thus the effect of proton transfer on the binding configuration and energy between pollutant and pms was studied as shown in fig 3e a stronger hydrogen bond length 1 58 å is generated between pms with the n site of deprotonated dma compared with that length 2 69 å pms with h atom connected to c atom of dmah the latter change in binding configuration may result from the enhanced steric hindrance effect caused by hydrogen proton in dmah chen et al 2021 correspondingly the pms dma 56 49 kj mol displays a lower binding energy than that of pms dmah complex 40 84 kj mol these results demonstrate that proton transfer in pollutant facilitates the formation of more stable complexes through pms binding directly to the n active site in deprotonated dma and pms thus benefiting the following reactions since 1o2 is the major active species in the deprotonated system the effect of proton transfer on the pollutant reacting with 1o2 was subsequently investigated in thermodynamics and kinetics considering the electronic energy of 1o2 directly calculated by the common dft method such as b3lyp is not accurate enough we have corrected its electronic energy value ponra et al 2021 thapa et al 2017 our previous study reveals that 1o2 can initiate oxidation reactions through the h abstraction of saturated fatty alcohol lin et al 2021 we speculate that 1o2 reacting with saturated dma dmah may undergo a similar oxidation pathway as shown in fig 3f for deprotonated dma 1o2 undergoes sp3 c h h abstractions and is followed by sp3 n h h abstraction of dma to give rise to n methylmethanimine and h2o2 the first c h h abstraction is the rate limiting step because the c h 392 kj mol bond has a higher bond dissociation energy than the n h bond 365 kj mol guo et al 2022 ye et al 2013 such a reaction is exothermic 1 32 ev and the activation energy barrier 0 03 ev is too low to occur spontaneously at room temperature such a low activation energy barrier can be further supported by the fact that amines are frequently employed as 1o2 quenchers because of their high reaction rate constants encinas et al 1987 zhu et al 2001 furthermore the formed imine and h2o2 are also found in the reaction of asymmetric secondary amines with 1o2 in previous work chen et al 2021 and further verified in our following experiments these results collectively demonstrate the rationality of this reaction on the contrary when 1o2 reacts with protonated dmah the reaction path and relative reaction energy change distinctly the 1o2 experiences only one step sp3 n h h abstraction from protonated dmah to produce ch3 nh ch3 and ooh the reaction is unfavorable both thermodynamically endothermic 1 09 ev and kinetically with a relatively high activation energy barrier 1 82 ev the above findings elaborate that the protonated dmah is highly inert and difficult to degrade by 1o2 based on these proton transfer in the pollutant promotes the dma reaction with 1o2 via reducing the activation energy barrier and is accompanied by the release of more energy further we explored the thermodynamics in the dmah pms system ph 4 and dma pms naoh system ph 11 respectively as shown in fig 3g and fig s8 9 the increased temperature has a more prominent effect on the catalytic activity of the deprotonated system compared to the protonated system demonstrating the important role of proton transfer for dma pms naoh system increasing 25 c to 55 c k obs increased from 0 32 to 0 50 min 1 while increased from near 0 to 0 007 min 1 in the dmah pms system in line with the above theoretical results the apparent activation energies e a test s2 obtained from kinetic experiments under different temperatures also show the same trend according to the arrhenius equation zhang et al 2022 the calculated e a of the deprotonated dma pms naoh system 11 9 kj mol was 17 7 times lower than that of protonated dmah pms system 210 9 kj mol demonstrating that proton transfers can considerably boost dma oxidation through lowering e a notably e a 11 9 kj mol for the deprotonated system was almost lower than all reported homogeneous and even heterogeneous pms systems fig 3h and table s2 such a low e a in the deprotonated system means that dma autocatalytic degradation is a diffusion controlled reaction 10 13 kj mol gong et al 2017 3 4 mechanism of 1o2 mediated dma autocatalysis induced by in situ generation of c n bond activating pms to unravel the mechanism of 1o2 mediated self catalytic degradation of dma in the deprotonated system the possible intermediates were first identified by ic as shown in fig 4 a the products were mainly divided into two carbonaceous and nitrogenous products carbonaceous products included monomethylamine ma formic acid hcooh and acetic acid h3ccooh nitrogenous products were composed of ma ammonia nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 both two types of products show increased trends as a function of time in terms of concentration they follow the trend of hcooh nh4 no3 ma no2 h3ccooh the mass balance for carbon exhibited about a 50 of drop during dma degradation which is attributed to the 50 of co2 produced during the same period inset in fig 1a no significant changes were observed for the nitrogen mass balance as we all know dma is an important precursor of carcinogen nitrosodimethylamine ndma pham et al 2021 rayaroth et al 2022 however the nmr results show that there is no characteristic peak of ndma in the reactants fig s10 indicating that our system will not produce carcinogen to further harm the water environment based on the previous reports zhou et al 2015 2017 the saturated dma ma nh4 no3 and no2 are impossible to directly activate pms for rich 1o2 production as observed in esr fig 2e furthermore the addition of hcooh into naoh pms system showed no enhanced 1o2 signal in esr characterization fig s11 and the yield of h3ccooh did not change significantly over time ruling out that these intermediates were the origin of 1o2 production therefore we infer that a new and trace unsaturated intermediate similar to the c o structure should have been generated in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system according to the previously reported work bunkan et al 2022 and aforementioned dft calculations fig 3f the species should be the n methylmethanimine ch3n ch2 with a c n structure more importantly this substance can be firstly in situ generated due to the deprotonated dma immediate reaction with trace 1o2 from pms self decomposition after naoh addition to further demonstrate the existence of n methylmethanimine in deprotonated dma pms naoh system experimentally nmr and gc ms were employed as shown in fig 4b in the 13c nmr spectrum we indeed observed the characteristic peaks of n methylmethanimine in which peaks located at 50 98 ppm and 161 53 ppm belonged to the sp3 c ch3 and sp 2 c n ch2 of n methylmethanimine respectively these peaks were matched well with the predicted positions inset in fig 4b gc ms detected the obvious molecular ion peak m z 43 of n methylmethanimine fig 4c which further affirmed the n methylmethanimine production moreover we use nmr to reveal the intensity change of n methylmethanimine during the reaction time as shown in fig s12 its intensity increased first and then decreased the initial increase was because of the continuous reaction between dma and 1o2 based on the mechanism proposed below the latter decrease is mainly attributed to 1o2 directly attacking n methylmethanimine when dma was at a relatively low concentration a similar phenomenon has also been observed in benzoquinone mediated homogeneous catalytic systems zhou et al 2017 based on the literature joussot dubien and kadiri 1970 pospisil and prasad 2014 experimental and theoretical results the mechanism of 1o2 driven dma autocatalytic degradation is proposed in fig 4d and relevant key steps are supported by dft calculations firstly the base oh induces the proton transfer of dmah to form deprotonated dma with higher reactivity exothermic 1 49 ev reaction 1 in table s3 synchronously the trace 1o2 is generated via pms self decomposition after proton transfer under alkaline conditions exothermic 0 99 ev reaction 1 in table s3 the limited 1o2 here acts as a crucial inducer to initiate the reaction in which it reacts deprotonated dma through two step continuous h abstractions to in situ produce key intermediates n methylmethanimine with c n bond exothermic 1 32 ev reaction 2 in table s3 the c n bond acts as a new active site to further experience the nucleophilic addition of pms under alkaline conditions to form one dioxirane intermediate exothermic 0 67 ev reaction 3 in table s3 afterward the dioxirane intermediate reacts with two so5 2 to release two 1o2 molecules exothermic 0 36 ev reaction 4 in table s3 and reforms the c n bond at the same time subsequently the abundant 1o2 here continues to react with dma through multiple h abstractions for achieving the autocatalytic degradation of dma and further produces another c n structure with the accumulation of n methylmethanimine more 1o2 can be produced at a given time this conclusion is consistent with the enhancement of the dramatic 1o2 signal of the deprotonated reaction system with time in esr fig 2e apart from that 1o2 can remove dma through the direct autocatalysis 1o2 can also facilitate dma abatement by taking part in the direct electron transfer pathway defined as indirect autocatalysis dma undergoes electron transfer with pms i e electrophilic attack of pms to give rise to ma radicals and alkyl radicals for ma radicals it undergoes h abstraction to form ma and then produce nh3 through demethylation then 1o2 can react directly with nh3 to form no2 exothermic 11 41 ev reaction 6 in table s3 which is further oxidized into no3 exothermic 3 43 ev reaction 6 in table s3 on the other hand the released 1o2 undergoes addition with the methyl radical to form methyl peroxyl radical exothermic 2 66 ev reaction 8 in table s3 which is subsequently oxidized to produce formic acid through h abstraction eventually formic acid goes through 1o2 oxidation into the harmless co2 and h2o exothermic 2 78 ev reaction 9 in table s3 in addition despite that the formed ma has a similar structure to dma it should have a negligible effect on dma autocatalytic degradation fig s13 and reaction 5 in table s3 more discussion can be found at the bottom of fig s13 during the dma autocatalytic process the proposed 1o2 generation pathway through c n bond activating pms and 1o2 oxidizes saturated dma via multiple h abstractions have been rarely reported in previous works especially 1o2 without electron occupation at the 2pπ orbital has been generally considered to be inclined to exclusively react with the electron rich unsaturated organics through electrophilic addition dissociated oxygen via outer sphere type single electron transfer set and addition to heteroatoms barrios et al 2021 3 5 volatilization toxicity and economic evaluations dma is hazardous to the atmosphere and water environment due to its strong volatility and potential toxicity therefore both the toxicity and volatility of its oxidation products need to be further evaluated as shown in fig 5 a f and table s5 6 considering that no2 can rapidly be oxidized into harmless no3 under air condition the acute and chronic toxicities of intermediate products to the fish daphnia and green algae were significantly reduced compared with dma only n methylmethanimine showed a slight increase in chronic toxicity to fish but it can be ignored because of its trace amount secondly the volatility of oxidation products is evaluated based on henry s constant de castilho et al 2020 as shown in fig 5g all henry s constants of intermediates were lower than dma except the trace n methylmethanimine implying decreased volatility thus the degradation of dma in the autocatalytic system belonged to the process of toxicity and volatility reduction further affirming the practical application potential of the eco friendly self catalytic system furthermore we conducted a preliminary cost budget for the catalytic system results showed that the total cost of treatment of our system is approximately 0 47 m3 which is much lower than previously reported works fig 5h i and table s4 it indicates that our technology has a good cost advantage in future industrial applications more calculation details can be found in text s10 3 6 various influencing factors and predictive model based on machine learning to further investigate the potential of autocatalytic systems for practical applications we investigated the effects of various influencing parameters on catalytic activity as shown left in fig 6 a left increasing the pms dosage from 0 9 to 3 3 mm enhanced the dma removal efficiency from 60 to 100 within 12 min this is probably because more 1o2 can be produced with the increased pms concentration based on our proposed mechanism fig 6a right shows that 90 of dma can be removed when pollutant concentration was 20 ppm when the dma concentration was further increased to 50 ppm the removal efficiency of 75 can still be maintained in 12 min suggesting this technology has a wide range of pollutant concentrations fig 6b displays that other amines including linear chain monoethanolamine mea and benzene containing aniline an can almost reach 100 degradation efficiency within 12 min in naoh pms system additionally if the reaction time continued to be prolonged the desired removal of ma was expected based on the degradation trend furthermore dma pms naoh can simultaneously serve as an effective system for degrading other co presented pollutants as shown in fig 6c all 10 ppm of ofloxacin ofx phenol ph and sulforaphane sa can be removed more than 80 within 12 min in dma pms naoh system and dma in the three reaction systems can still maintain 100 degradation during the same period these verify our technology has an excellent universality surprisingly increasing the cl concentration from 0 to 50 mm i e 1775 ppm has no obvious inhibition effect on dma indicating that the self autocatalytic system has strong chlorine resistance fig 6d note that the treatment of high chlorine wastewater is usually difficult in the heterogeneous catalytic system because it is easy to poison the heterogeneous catalyst bi et al 2022 li et al 2022 therefore our homogeneous technology may have a good application prospect in high chlorine wastewater such as landfill leachate feng et al 2022 additionally increasing the concentration of no3 from 0 to 10 mm negligible inhibition was observed in dma removal the reason for the excellent cl and no3 resistance is that they have no effects on the proton transfers of pms and dmah which play significant roles in catalytic activity low concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 5 10 mm show inappreciable inhibitions on dma removal whereas increasing their concentrations to 50 mm reduced dma degradation to 65 the relatively obvious decrease is because the existence of carbonate as a buffer salt can maintain the entire reaction system slightly over 12 after the addition of pms rather than decrease to the optimal value of around 11 fig s14 when the ph of the reaction system is slightly over 12 only less than 0 14 of pms exists in the form of hso5 fig 1d resulting in a decrease in the amount of 1o2 generated by c n activating pms leading to a decrease in the degradation of dma this conclusion is consistent with the result that when the ph of the reaction system exceeds 12 slightly after adding 6 mm of naoh leading to a decrease in the dma degradation fig 1e f as comparisons the negative effects of ca2 and mg2 on catalytic activity were a little pronounced fig 6e two possible reasons 1 the cations tended to bind with electronegative pms through electrostatic interaction forces thus impeding the pms involved reactions 2 high concentrations of mg2 and ca2 consumed oh to produce sediment because of their limited solubility table s9 thus restricting the proton transfers of the reaction system for humic acid ha a representative natural organic matter dom occupying 50 90 of total organic matter in water even at a very high concentration of 50 ppm exerted no considerable inhibition fig 6f this indicates that the system has an excellent ability to resist ha interference far outperforming the previous works li et al 2022 qi et al 2022 fig 6g displays that 2 5 mm of metallic oxides mno2 sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 did not retard dma degradation verifying that our self catalytic system has strong anti interference also in tap water and deionized water the autocatalytic system still maintains high dma removal efficiency 80 fig 6h these above results indicate the autocatalytic system has excellent practical application prospects ml algorithm is a promising technology for assisting industrial applications herein four popular ml models including ann rf xgb and svr were employed to establish the relationships between the aforementioned influencing parameters and catalysis activity k obs these influencing parameters are divided into four types 1 pollutant types described using e homo e lumo pka molecular volume mv chemical potential μ hardness η and global electrophilic index ω 2 initial concentration c 0 3 water conditions anions cations metal oxide types ph and temperature and 4 operating parameters alkali and pms dosages table s7 10 the descriptors of contaminants were firstly selected based on fig 7 a to abate the redundant features table s7 as shown in fig 7b f the ann model exhibits the best performance in predicting the fatty amine removal since it shows the highest r2 r2 train 0 97 r2 test 0 81 and a very low root mean squared error rmse of rmsetrain 0 02 and rmsetest 0 03 these results indicate that the ann model is more suitable for our data set than the other three ml models the feature importance for the results of the ann model is illustrated in fig 7g the importance order follows the trend of water conditions 58 initial concentration of pollutant 17 operating parameters 15 pollutant properties 10 it shows that water quality parameters are the most critical factors in predicting the efficiency of fatty amine removal specifically the influence of cations 36 accounts for the largest proportion fig 7h since cations not only hamper the binding of electronegative pms to dma but also inhibit proton transfers in both oxidant and pollutant resulting in the relatively evident decline of catalytic activity this conclusion is consistent with the experimental result in fig 6e for operation parameters fig 7i the influence of alkali concentration is responsible for the largest proportion since the concentration of oh is a key factor controlling proton transfer in dmah and pms e homo 71 accounts for the highest proportion in the nature of pollutants fig 7j this is understandable because it describes the original reaction activity of pollutants note that pka plays the second important rather than determining role mainly because almost all pollutants have already experienced proton transfer under the ph 11 5 11 of the reaction system table s7 overall these results suggest that the ann model can be used to effectively predict the catalytic activity in the developed autocatalytic system and the results of feature importance analysis can further guide its practical application 4 conclusions this work is the first to propose an efficient autocatalytic technique for lcfa abatement based on proton transfer induced the in situ fabrication of c n active site in the novel self catalytic system 100 of dma 10 ppm can be removed within 12 min and about 50 of toc can be removed synchronously results reveal that the proton transfers of pollutant and oxidant induced by the addition of naoh are the important prerequisite for in situ fabrication of c n active site because it can effectively lower the activation energy barrier of the reaction between inducer tiny 1o2 and pollutant afterward the c n containing n methylmethanimine acting as a catalyst is able to efficiently activate pms to produce rich 1o2 for attacking dma accompanied by generating another new c n bond thus realizing the excellent autocatalytic degradation of dma during the self catalytic process 1o2 oxidizes dma via stepwise sp3 n c h h abstractions the involved autocatalytic mechanism is mapped out and further verified by dft calculations at the molecular level through this autocatalytic process various amines and the other coexisting pollutants are efficiently converted and degraded moreover our developed system exhibits a decreasing biotoxicity and volatility process strong environmental durability and low treatment cost the fabricated ann model can be used to effectively predict the removal efficiency of lcfa in the autocatalytic system with the water conditions especially cations being the most important feature compared with the conventional heterogeneous pms system which often requires the introduction of exogenous catalysts our autocatalytic reaction based on an endogenous active site not only has the advantages of high efficiency and inexpensiveness but also avoids the complicated preparation and separation process of catalyst and its potential secondary environmental hazards therefore this work indicates a promising strategy for the elimination of lcfas with degradation persistent properties meanwhile it provides a brand new metal free

14737,removal of low carbon fatty amines lcfas in wastewater treatment poses a significant technical challenge due to their small molecular size high polarity high bond dissociation energy electron deficiency and poor biodegradability moreover their low brønsted acidity deteriorates this issue to address this problem we have developed a novel base induced autocatalytic technique for the highly efficient removal of a model pollutant dimethylamine dma in a homogeneous peroxymonosulfate pms system a high reaction rate constant of 0 32 min 1 and almost complete removal of dma within 12 min are achieved multi scaled characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the in situ constructed c n bond as the crucial active site activates pms to produce abundant 1o2 subsequently 1o2 oxidizes dma through multiple h abstractions accompanied by the generation of another c n structure thus achieving the autocatalytic cycle of pollutant during this process base induced proton transfers of pollutant and oxidant are essential prerequisites for c n fabrication a relevant mechanism of autocatalytic degradation is unraveled and further supported by dft calculations at the molecular level various assessments indicate that this self catalytic technique exhibits a reduced toxicity and volatility process and a low treatment cost 0 47 m3 this technology has strong environmental tolerance especially for the high concentrations of chlorine ion 1775 ppm and humic acid 50 ppm moreover it not only exhibits excellent degradation performance for different amine organics but also for the coexisting common pollutants including ofloxacin phenol and sulforaphane these results fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy for practical application in wastewater treatment overall this autocatalysis technology based on the in situ construction of metal free active site by regulating proton transfer will provide a brand new strategy for environmental remediation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords base induced proton transfers 1o2 mediated autocatalysis c n active site dimethylamine dma peroxymonosulfate activation wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction low carbon c1 c3 fatty amines lcfas discharged from various chemical industries and agricultures processes dai et al 2022 have attracted increasing public attention such organics not only pose a threat to the water environment due to their strong polarity and potential carcinogenicity but also evaporate easily from water into the atmosphere resulting from their high volatility to as the main precursors of ozone and pm2 5 greatly increasing environment and health risks dai et al 2022 lin et al 2021 wu et al 2022

acidity of lcfas e g pka 10 7 for dma is far less than the ph of common water matrix makes them predominantly present at a protonated inert state greatly lowering their reactivity hou et al 2022 these characteristics render such contaminants difficult to remove and would inevitably require a lot of energy or chemical input seriously violating the principle of sustainable development dai et al 2022 he and cheng 2016 peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted considerable attention for the oxidation of various organic contaminants in wastewater because of the merits of high oxidation capacity rapid reaction kinetics and wide ph application range lin et al 2022 wang and wang 2018 yang et al 2018 currently pms based aops mainly focus on the introduction of

catalyst to activate pms for the generation of various reactive oxygen species ross to attack organics honarmandrad et al 2023 rayaroth et al 2023 ren et al 2022 wei et al 2022 among them heterogeneous catalytic pms system exhibits the most potential for development owing to their relatively lower cost and fewer secondary environmental hazards also this technology has been demonstrated to show good removal performance for lcfas dai et al 2022 zhang et al 2023 however such heterogeneous catalytic systems still encounter the issues of complex catalyst preparation and separation processes in which a great deal of manpower materials and energy will be consumed especially exogenous metal based catalysts have to face inevitable metal ion leaching during the treatment process given these if a metal free active site or catalyst can be constructed in situ in the reaction system to replace the conventional addition of external catalysts it would be a very promising strategy to solve the above problems but remains a huge challenge based on the reported literature on the one hand we found that the c o functional group in the pollutants is the active site of activating pms to produce highly selective singlet oxygen 1o2 gallop and edwards 1981 xiao et al 2021 zhou et al 2015 2017 on the other hand lcfas have been reported to be attacked by ross to produce imine substances with c n bond in the atmospheric environment bunkan et al 2022 inspired by these we speculate that it is a very possible way to explore the in situ construction of the c n bond as an active site in the aqueous lcfas pms system to produce 1o2 for lcfas abatement because of c n bond with a similar structure and properties to c o herein dma is used as the model pollutants of lcfas we have constructed the c n active site in situ by adding only 4 mm of commercial naoh to the dma pms system to induce the proton transfers of pollutant and pms this site indeed effectively activates pms to generate rich 1o2 which further mediates the efficient autocatalytic degradation of dma to unravel the underlying mechanism the effect of base induced proton transfer on the reactivity and reaction pathway of the pollutant was first explored further the autocatalytic degradation mechanism was studied in detail via the quenching experiment electron spin resonance spectrometer esr capture experiments products identification and density functional theory dft theoretical calculation afterward the toxicity and volatility of the intermediates and the treatment cost of our reaction system are evaluated and the effects of various influencing factors in wastewater on catalytic activity have also been investigated finally four machine learning ml models are utilized to establish the relationship between various influencing parameters and catalytic activity and illustrate feature importance to further guide the potential applications different from the previously reported pms activation under an alkaline environment in which base lou et al 2017 qi et al 2016 or benzoquinone intermediates with c o structure from phenolic parents zhou et al 2017 usually act as catalysts for other organics degradation this study is among the first to regulate the proton transfers in the reaction system to trigger the in situ construction of the c n active site thus further inducing the efficient autocatalytic degradation of refractory lcfas through pms activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals detailed information on chemicals and reagents applied can be seen in text s1 of supporting information 2 2 activity evaluation all experiments on the degradation of dma used 150 ml of erlenmeyer flasks sealed with a rubber stopper typically the reaction was initiated by adding pms to the solution containing 10 ppm of dma and 4 mm of naoh the reaction system was kept at 400 r min ensuring it was in a completely mixed state 2 ml sample was taken at the predetermined time intervals after being filtered by 0 22 μm membrane the sample was immediately quenched by na2s2o3 100 ul 1 m dma after being derived by chloroformic acid 9 fluorenylmethyl ester fmoc cl more details

algorithm was included in the pytorch package more details can be found in text s8 9 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 base induced proton transfers triggering dma autocatalytic degradation when pms was added to the dma containing solution the ph of the system was immediately decreased to about 4 blue line in fig 1 b in which both pollutant pka 10 7 and pms pka 9 5 presented at dmah and hso5 sates respectively according to their morphology distributions fig 1d in this case dma showed no significant degradation blue line in fig 1a in contrast after the introduction of naoh 4 mm the in situ ph of system ranged from 11 5 to 11 along with the reaction time red line in fig 1b under such alkaline environment both the proton h of dmah and hso5 proton donors transferred into h2o after reacting with oh proton acceptor this process is so called proton transfer legon 1993 and then they were predominantly presented at dma and so5 2 sates respectively after proton transfers around 100 of dma was removed within 12 min with the pseudo first order reaction rate constant k obs of 0 32 min 1 red line in fig 1a and s1i during the same period around 50 of toc removal can be achieved inset in fig 1 moreover the measured dma k obs exhibited an excellent liner relationship r2 0 96 to pms concentrations fig s2 demonstrating the reaction was also first order to pms concentrations thereby the apparent second order rate constant k app for this reaction was determined to be 1 82 0 18 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2018 on the other hand similar to the trend of pollutant degradation pms kept unchanged without the addition of naoh around 42 of pms in 12 min was consumed in the sole presence of naoh 4 mm fig 1c and the introduction of dma into the naoh pms system further accelerated pms decomposition to ca 50 0 06 vs 0 05 min 1 fig s3 this could be assigned to the newly generated intermediate which acts like a catalyst that can effectively activate pms thus leading to improved pms decomposition additionally dma degradation can be triggered at a relatively wider range of basic ph 8 12 fig 1f fernandes et al 2018 2019 to exclude the effect of cation in base the effect of different base types naoh koh and ca oh 2 with the same concentration of oh on catalytic activity was investigated fig s4a results confirmed that the oh induced proton transfers instead of cations play an important role in catalytic activity more details can be found in the supporting information the above findings suggest that the addition of base oh into the dma pms system induces these proton transfers of the pollutant and pms which play crucial roles in triggering the dma degradation differently dma degradation in the dma pms naoh system does not rely on the external catalysts but depends on the in situ formed unique intermediate which acts as an endogenous catalyst to activate pms for the ros generation and ros in turn further accelerates the degradation of pollutant this process is defined as autocatalysis to confirm the above conclusion the influence of the degree of proton transfers on catalytic activity was further investigated with different naoh concentrations as shown in fig 1e f increasing the naoh concentration from 0 to 6 mm in situ ph changed from 4 to 12 correspondingly the proton transfer degree of pollutant i e dma volume fraction increased from 0 to 96 and the proton transfer degree of pms i e so5 2 volume fraction increased from 1 to 99 9 in the same case the k obs of dma increased from 0 to 0 32 min 1 and then decreased to 0 24 min 1 with the increased dosage of naoh moreover both the proton transfer degree of pollutant r2 0 921 fig 1g and pms r2 0 915 fig 1h displayed strong positive correlations with k obs these results substantiated that the base induced proton transfers in pollutant and pms indeed govern the catalytic activity the obtained removal efficiency in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system was higher than the previously reported methods fig 1i and table s1 and catalytic activity is superior to the classical co2 pms 0 02 min 1 and fe2 pms 0 min 1 homogeneous systems fig s5 which are dominated by free radicals pms utilization efficiency was calculated to be 19 in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system huang et al 2021 which was 2 4 fold higher than our previous heterogeneous derived carbon pms dma system fig 3i these findings suggest that the homogeneous self catalytic system shows a better potential for practical application 3 2 identification of ross in deprotonated system to reveal the driving force of efficient dma autocatalytic oxidation in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system quenching tests and in situ esr characterizations were performed to unravel the reactive species in quenching tests tba etoh and ffa were employed as the quenching agents for oh so4 and 1o2 respectively k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 tba 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 k so4 etoh 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 k oh etoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and k ffa 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 ding et al 2020 as displayed in fig 2 a and 2c tba and etoh at different concentrations 100 500 mm presented negligible effects on dma degradation implying that the system is independent of free radical pathways fig 2b right shows that dma degradation was not significantly affected by nb and ba which are the probes of oh and so4 respectively k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 k oh ba 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 and k so4 ba 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020 verifying the non existence of oh and so4 consistent with the results of quenching tests fig 2d left exhibits that no enhanced esr signals of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh were observed in deprotonated dma pms naoh system relative to the control groups also no dmpo ooh adduct was observed by mixed dmpo methanol as the spin trapping agent to screen out ho2 o2 fig 2d right on the contrary dma degradation efficiency was inhibited by 20 after the addition of 20 mm of ffa and the inhibition was further increased to 60 when increased ffa concentration to 80 mm left in fig 2b these results indicate that 1o2 is the main reactive specie considering that ffa cannot fully quench the degradation of dma a minor direct electron transfer for dma removal should exist in the reaction system dai et al 2022 sun et al 2021 to further reveal the origin of 1o2 involved in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system temp was utilized for trapping 1o2 sun et al 2021 as displayed in fig 2e only weak characteristic temp 1o2 signal with the intensity ratios of 1 1 1 can be observed in the co existence of naoh pms system which was assigned to pms self decomposition under alkaline conditions eq 1 note that the rate constant of pms self decomposition is so low 0 2 m 1 s 1 that 1o2 here generated is impossible to become the main active species in the system zhou et al 2015 1 hso5 so5 2 hso4 so4 2 1o2 unexpectedly after the addition of the pollutant into the naoh pms system a strong temp 1o2 signal was discerned this signal showed an increasing trend with the extension of reaction time fig s6 indicating an increased 1o2 generation therefore the newly generated abundant 1o2 should be the major active species in this case the abundant 1o2 generally could originate from dissolved oxygen do or pms activation to exclude the effect of do the experiments in different gas atmospheres n2 o2 and air by pre aeration for 30 min were carried out respectively as shown in fig 2f the gas atmospheres did not significantly influence the removal efficiency of dma suggesting that the rich 1o2 was not derived from do meanwhile the do activation is usually accompanied by the emergence of o2 and oh radicals zheng et al 2023 while these ross were not detected obviously in the dma pms naoh system fig 2d thus further indicating that do did not participate in the reaction system based on these discussions pms activation should be the exclusive source of abundant 1o2 from these results we deduced that a new intermediate should be in situ produced in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system which can efficiently catalyze pms to produce ample 1o2 in an alkaline environment ruling out the base as a catalyst 3 3 origin of base induced proton transfers triggering dma degradation to further explain the reason for base induced proton transfers triggering dma autocatalytic degradation dft calculations were performed to investigate the effect of proton transfer on the reactivity and reaction pathways of the pollutant firstly as shown in fig 3 a the electrostatic potential esp of deprotonated dma presents an uneven distribution compared to that of protonated dmah the highest occupied molecular orbital homo value of dma 6 15 ev is found to be higher than dmah 10 94 ev fig 3b indicating the former has a strong electron donating ability zhu et al 2001 these results show that the proton transfer in pollutant can promote the reactivity of dma furthermore we analyzed the possible reactive sites for deprotonated dma fig 3d exhibits that the n atom of deprotonated dma has the lowest negative condensed dual descriptor cdd value 0 2237 e the highest fukui index ƒ 0 3448 e and the largest condensed local nucleophilicity index cleni 1 023 e ev du et al 2022 frau and glossman mitnik 2018 qi et al 2022 these results suggest that the n atom of deprotonated dma is a potential site for the electrophilic attack of pms the evidence about electrophilic reaction can be found in fig s7 in the supporting information nihemaiti et al 2020 therefore the effect of proton transfer on the n site was further investigated as shown in fig 3c mulliken charges 0 435 e of the n atom in deprotonated dma are much more than that of dmah 0 295 e it suggests that proton transfer is beneficial for the n site to be electrophilic attack by pms which was in good agreement with esp and homo results together these discussions illustrate that proton transfer enhances the reactivity of the contaminant and promotes the electrophilic attack of pms on the n active sites secondly the formation of a relatively stable complex is the premise of electron transfer from pollutant to pms during direct oxidation thus the effect of proton transfer on the binding configuration and energy between pollutant and pms was studied as shown in fig 3e a stronger hydrogen bond length 1 58 å is generated between pms with the n site of deprotonated dma compared with that length 2 69 å pms with h atom connected to c atom of dmah the latter change in binding configuration may result from the enhanced steric hindrance effect caused by hydrogen proton in dmah chen et al 2021 correspondingly the pms dma 56 49 kj mol displays a lower binding energy than that of pms dmah complex 40 84 kj mol these results demonstrate that proton transfer in pollutant facilitates the formation of more stable complexes through pms binding directly to the n active site in deprotonated dma and pms thus benefiting the following reactions since 1o2 is the major active species in the deprotonated system the effect of proton transfer on the pollutant reacting with 1o2 was subsequently investigated in thermodynamics and kinetics considering the electronic energy of 1o2 directly calculated by the common dft method such as b3lyp is not accurate enough we have corrected its electronic energy value ponra et al 2021 thapa et al 2017 our previous study reveals that 1o2 can initiate oxidation reactions through the h abstraction of saturated fatty alcohol lin et al 2021 we speculate that 1o2 reacting with saturated dma dmah may undergo a similar oxidation pathway as shown in fig 3f for deprotonated dma 1o2 undergoes sp3 c h h abstractions and is followed by sp3 n h h abstraction of dma to give rise to n methylmethanimine and h2o2 the first c h h abstraction is the rate limiting step because the c h 392 kj mol bond has a higher bond dissociation energy than the n h bond 365 kj mol guo et al 2022 ye et al 2013 such a reaction is exothermic 1 32 ev and the activation energy barrier 0 03 ev is too low to occur spontaneously at room temperature such a low activation energy barrier can be further supported by the fact that amines are frequently employed as 1o2 quenchers because of their high reaction rate constants encinas et al 1987 zhu et al 2001 furthermore the formed imine and h2o2 are also found in the reaction of asymmetric secondary amines with 1o2 in previous work chen et al 2021 and further verified in our following experiments these results collectively demonstrate the rationality of this reaction on the contrary when 1o2 reacts with protonated dmah the reaction path and relative reaction energy change distinctly the 1o2 experiences only one step sp3 n h h abstraction from protonated dmah to produce ch3 nh ch3 and ooh the reaction is unfavorable both thermodynamically endothermic 1 09 ev and kinetically with a relatively high activation energy barrier 1 82 ev the above findings elaborate that the protonated dmah is highly inert and difficult to degrade by 1o2 based on these proton transfer in the pollutant promotes the dma reaction with 1o2 via reducing the activation energy barrier and is accompanied by the release of more energy further we explored the thermodynamics in the dmah pms system ph 4 and dma pms naoh system ph 11 respectively as shown in fig 3g and fig s8 9 the increased temperature has a more prominent effect on the catalytic activity of the deprotonated system compared to the protonated system demonstrating the important role of proton transfer for dma pms naoh system increasing 25 c to 55 c k obs increased from 0 32 to 0 50 min 1 while increased from near 0 to 0 007 min 1 in the dmah pms system in line with the above theoretical results the apparent activation energies e a test s2 obtained from kinetic experiments under different temperatures also show the same trend according to the arrhenius equation zhang et al 2022 the calculated e a of the deprotonated dma pms naoh system 11 9 kj mol was 17 7 times lower than that of protonated dmah pms system 210 9 kj mol demonstrating that proton transfers can considerably boost dma oxidation through lowering e a notably e a 11 9 kj mol for the deprotonated system was almost lower than all reported homogeneous and even heterogeneous pms systems fig 3h and table s2 such a low e a in the deprotonated system means that dma autocatalytic degradation is a diffusion controlled reaction 10 13 kj mol gong et al 2017 3 4 mechanism of 1o2 mediated dma autocatalysis induced by in situ generation of c n bond activating pms to unravel the mechanism of 1o2 mediated self catalytic degradation of dma in the deprotonated system the possible intermediates were first identified by ic as shown in fig 4 a the products were mainly divided into two carbonaceous and nitrogenous products carbonaceous products included monomethylamine ma formic acid hcooh and acetic acid h3ccooh nitrogenous products were composed of ma ammonia nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 both two types of products show increased trends as a function of time in terms of concentration they follow the trend of hcooh nh4 no3 ma no2 h3ccooh the mass balance for carbon exhibited about a 50 of drop during dma degradation which is attributed to the 50 of co2 produced during the same period inset in fig 1a no significant changes were observed for the nitrogen mass balance as we all know dma is an important precursor of carcinogen nitrosodimethylamine ndma pham et al 2021 rayaroth et al 2022 however the nmr results show that there is no characteristic peak of ndma in the reactants fig s10 indicating that our system will not produce carcinogen to further harm the water environment based on the previous reports zhou et al 2015 2017 the saturated dma ma nh4 no3 and no2 are impossible to directly activate pms for rich 1o2 production as observed in esr fig 2e furthermore the addition of hcooh into naoh pms system showed no enhanced 1o2 signal in esr characterization fig s11 and the yield of h3ccooh did not change significantly over time ruling out that these intermediates were the origin of 1o2 production therefore we infer that a new and trace unsaturated intermediate similar to the c o structure should have been generated in the deprotonated dma pms naoh system according to the previously reported work bunkan et al 2022 and aforementioned dft calculations fig 3f the species should be the n methylmethanimine ch3n ch2 with a c n structure more importantly this substance can be firstly in situ generated due to the deprotonated dma immediate reaction with trace 1o2 from pms self decomposition after naoh addition to further demonstrate the existence of n methylmethanimine in deprotonated dma pms naoh system experimentally nmr and gc ms were employed as shown in fig 4b in the 13c nmr spectrum we indeed observed the characteristic peaks of n methylmethanimine in which peaks located at 50 98 ppm and 161 53 ppm belonged to the sp3 c ch3 and sp 2 c n ch2 of n methylmethanimine respectively these peaks were matched well with the predicted positions inset in fig 4b gc ms detected the obvious molecular ion peak m z 43 of n methylmethanimine fig 4c which further affirmed the n methylmethanimine production moreover we use nmr to reveal the intensity change of n methylmethanimine during the reaction time as shown in fig s12 its intensity increased first and then decreased the initial increase was because of the continuous reaction between dma and 1o2 based on the mechanism proposed below the latter decrease is mainly attributed to 1o2 directly attacking n methylmethanimine when dma was at a relatively low concentration a similar phenomenon has also been observed in benzoquinone mediated homogeneous catalytic systems zhou et al 2017 based on the literature joussot dubien and kadiri 1970 pospisil and prasad 2014 experimental and theoretical results the mechanism of 1o2 driven dma autocatalytic degradation is proposed in fig 4d and relevant key steps are supported by dft calculations firstly the base oh induces the proton transfer of dmah to form deprotonated dma with higher reactivity exothermic 1 49 ev reaction 1 in table s3 synchronously the trace 1o2 is generated via pms self decomposition after proton transfer under alkaline conditions exothermic 0 99 ev reaction 1 in table s3 the limited 1o2 here acts as a crucial inducer to initiate the reaction in which it reacts deprotonated dma through two step continuous h abstractions to in situ produce key intermediates n methylmethanimine with c n bond exothermic 1 32 ev reaction 2 in table s3 the c n bond acts as a new active site to further experience the nucleophilic addition of pms under alkaline conditions to form one dioxirane intermediate exothermic 0 67 ev reaction 3 in table s3 afterward the dioxirane intermediate reacts with two so5 2 to release two 1o2 molecules exothermic 0 36 ev reaction 4 in table s3 and reforms the c n bond at the same time subsequently the abundant 1o2 here continues to react with dma through multiple h abstractions for achieving the autocatalytic degradation of dma and further produces another c n structure with the accumulation of n methylmethanimine more 1o2 can be produced at a given time this conclusion is consistent with the enhancement of the dramatic 1o2 signal of the deprotonated reaction system with time in esr fig 2e apart from that 1o2 can remove dma through the direct autocatalysis 1o2 can also facilitate dma abatement by taking part in the direct electron transfer pathway defined as indirect autocatalysis dma undergoes electron transfer with pms i e electrophilic attack of pms to give rise to ma radicals and alkyl radicals for ma radicals it undergoes h abstraction to form ma and then produce nh3 through demethylation then 1o2 can react directly with nh3 to form no2 exothermic 11 41 ev reaction 6 in table s3 which is further oxidized into no3 exothermic 3 43 ev reaction 6 in table s3 on the other hand the released 1o2 undergoes addition with the methyl radical to form methyl peroxyl radical exothermic 2 66 ev reaction 8 in table s3 which is subsequently oxidized to produce formic acid through h abstraction eventually formic acid goes through 1o2 oxidation into the harmless co2 and h2o exothermic 2 78 ev reaction 9 in table s3 in addition despite that the formed ma has a similar structure to dma it should have a negligible effect on dma autocatalytic degradation fig s13 and reaction 5 in table s3 more discussion can be found at the bottom of fig s13 during the dma autocatalytic process the proposed 1o2 generation pathway through c n bond activating pms and 1o2 oxidizes saturated dma via multiple h abstractions have been rarely reported in previous works especially 1o2 without electron occupation at the 2pπ orbital has been generally considered to be inclined to exclusively react with the electron rich unsaturated organics through electrophilic addition dissociated oxygen via outer sphere type single electron transfer set and addition to heteroatoms barrios et al 2021 3 5 volatilization toxicity and economic evaluations dma is hazardous to the atmosphere and water environment due to its strong volatility and potential toxicity therefore both the toxicity and volatility of its oxidation products need to be further evaluated as shown in fig 5 a f and table s5 6 considering that no2 can rapidly be oxidized into harmless no3 under air condition the acute and chronic toxicities of intermediate products to the fish daphnia and green algae were significantly reduced compared with dma only n methylmethanimine showed a slight increase in chronic toxicity to fish but it can be ignored because of its trace amount secondly the volatility of oxidation products is evaluated based on henry s constant de castilho et al 2020 as shown in fig 5g all henry s constants of intermediates were lower than dma except the trace n methylmethanimine implying decreased volatility thus the degradation of dma in the autocatalytic system belonged to the process of toxicity and volatility reduction further affirming the practical application potential of the eco friendly self catalytic system furthermore we conducted a preliminary cost budget for the catalytic system results showed that the total cost of treatment of our system is approximately 0 47 m3 which is much lower than previously reported works fig 5h i and table s4 it indicates that our technology has a good cost advantage in future industrial applications more calculation details can be found in text s10 3 6 various influencing factors and predictive model based on machine learning to further investigate the potential of autocatalytic systems for practical applications we investigated the effects of various influencing parameters on catalytic activity as shown left in fig 6 a left increasing the pms dosage from 0 9 to 3 3 mm enhanced the dma removal efficiency from 60 to 100 within 12 min this is probably because more 1o2 can be produced with the increased pms concentration based on our proposed mechanism fig 6a right shows that 90 of dma can be removed when pollutant concentration was 20 ppm when the dma concentration was further increased to 50 ppm the removal efficiency of 75 can still be maintained in 12 min suggesting this technology has a wide range of pollutant concentrations fig 6b displays that other amines including linear chain monoethanolamine mea and benzene containing aniline an can almost reach 100 degradation efficiency within 12 min in naoh pms system additionally if the reaction time continued to be prolonged the desired removal of ma was expected based on the degradation trend furthermore dma pms naoh can simultaneously serve as an effective system for degrading other co presented pollutants as shown in fig 6c all 10 ppm of ofloxacin ofx phenol ph and sulforaphane sa can be removed more than 80 within 12 min in dma pms naoh system and dma in the three reaction systems can still maintain 100 degradation during the same period these verify our technology has an excellent universality surprisingly increasing the cl concentration from 0 to 50 mm i e 1775 ppm has no obvious inhibition effect on dma indicating that the self autocatalytic system has strong chlorine resistance fig 6d note that the treatment of high chlorine wastewater is usually difficult in the heterogeneous catalytic system because it is easy to poison the heterogeneous catalyst bi et al 2022 li et al 2022 therefore our homogeneous technology may have a good application prospect in high chlorine wastewater such as landfill leachate feng et al 2022 additionally increasing the concentration of no3 from 0 to 10 mm negligible inhibition was observed in dma removal the reason for the excellent cl and no3 resistance is that they have no effects on the proton transfers of pms and dmah which play significant roles in catalytic activity low concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 5 10 mm show inappreciable inhibitions on dma removal whereas increasing their concentrations to 50 mm reduced dma degradation to 65 the relatively obvious decrease is because the existence of carbonate as a buffer salt can maintain the entire reaction system slightly over 12 after the addition of pms rather than decrease to the optimal value of around 11 fig s14 when the ph of the reaction system is slightly over 12 only less than 0 14 of pms exists in the form of hso5 fig 1d resulting in a decrease in the amount of 1o2 generated by c n activating pms leading to a decrease in the degradation of dma this conclusion is consistent with the result that when the ph of the reaction system exceeds 12 slightly after adding 6 mm of naoh leading to a decrease in the dma degradation fig 1e f as comparisons the negative effects of ca2 and mg2 on catalytic activity were a little pronounced fig 6e two possible reasons 1 the cations tended to bind with electronegative pms through electrostatic interaction forces thus impeding the pms involved reactions 2 high concentrations of mg2 and ca2 consumed oh to produce sediment because of their limited solubility table s9 thus restricting the proton transfers of the reaction system for humic acid ha a representative natural organic matter dom occupying 50 90 of total organic matter in water even at a very high concentration of 50 ppm exerted no considerable inhibition fig 6f this indicates that the system has an excellent ability to resist ha interference far outperforming the previous works li et al 2022 qi et al 2022 fig 6g displays that 2 5 mm of metallic oxides mno2 sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 did not retard dma degradation verifying that our self catalytic system has strong anti interference also in tap water and deionized water the autocatalytic system still maintains high dma removal efficiency 80 fig 6h these above results indicate the autocatalytic system has excellent practical application prospects ml algorithm is a promising technology for assisting industrial applications herein four popular ml models including ann rf xgb and svr were employed to establish the relationships between the aforementioned influencing parameters and catalysis activity k obs these influencing parameters are divided into four types 1 pollutant types described using e homo e lumo pka molecular volume mv chemical potential μ hardness η and global electrophilic index ω 2 initial concentration c 0 3 water conditions anions cations metal oxide types ph and temperature and 4 operating parameters alkali and pms dosages table s7 10 the descriptors of contaminants were firstly selected based on fig 7 a to abate the redundant features table s7 as shown in fig 7b f the ann model exhibits the best performance in predicting the fatty amine removal since it shows the highest r2 r2 train 0 97 r2 test 0 81 and a very low root mean squared error rmse of rmsetrain 0 02 and rmsetest 0 03 these results indicate that the ann model is more suitable for our data set than the other three ml models the feature importance for the results of the ann model is illustrated in fig 7g the importance order follows the trend of water conditions 58 initial concentration of pollutant 17 operating parameters 15 pollutant properties 10 it shows that water quality parameters are the most critical factors in predicting the efficiency of fatty amine removal specifically the influence of cations 36 accounts for the largest proportion fig 7h since cations not only hamper the binding of electronegative pms to dma but also inhibit proton transfers in both oxidant and pollutant resulting in the relatively evident decline of catalytic activity this conclusion is consistent with the experimental result in fig 6e for operation parameters fig 7i the influence of alkali concentration is responsible for the largest proportion since the concentration of oh is a key factor controlling proton transfer in dmah and pms e homo 71 accounts for the highest proportion in the nature of pollutants fig 7j this is understandable because it describes the original reaction activity of pollutants note that pka plays the second important rather than determining role mainly because almost all pollutants have already experienced proton transfer under the ph 11 5 11 of the reaction system table s7 overall these results suggest that the ann model can be used to effectively predict the catalytic activity in the developed autocatalytic system and the results of feature importance analysis can further guide its practical application 4 conclusions this work is the first to propose an efficient autocatalytic technique for lcfa abatement based on proton transfer induced the in situ fabrication of c n active site in the novel self catalytic system 100 of dma 10 ppm can be removed within 12 min and about 50 of toc can be removed synchronously results reveal that the proton transfers of pollutant and oxidant induced by the addition of naoh are the important prerequisite for in situ fabrication of c n active site because it can effectively lower the activation energy barrier of the reaction between inducer tiny 1o2 and pollutant afterward the c n containing n methylmethanimine acting as a catalyst is able to efficiently activate pms to produce rich 1o2 for attacking dma accompanied by generating another new c n bond thus realizing the excellent autocatalytic degradation of dma during the self catalytic process 1o2 oxidizes dma via stepwise sp3 n c h h abstractions the involved autocatalytic mechanism is mapped out and further verified by dft calculations at the molecular level through this autocatalytic process various amines and the other coexisting pollutants are efficiently converted and degraded moreover our developed system exhibits a decreasing biotoxicity and volatility process strong environmental durability and low treatment cost the fabricated ann model can be used to effectively predict the removal efficiency of lcfa in the autocatalytic system with the water conditions especially cations being the most important feature compared with the conventional heterogeneous pms system which often requires the introduction of exogenous catalysts our autocatalytic reaction based on an endogenous active site not only has the advantages of high efficiency and inexpensiveness but also avoids the complicated preparation and separation process of catalyst and its potential secondary environmental hazards therefore this work indicates a promising strategy for the elimination of lcfas with degradation persistent properties meanwhile it provides a brand new metal free

14738,sulfide control is a significant problem in urban sewer management although in sewer dosing of chemicals has been widely applied it is prone to high chemical consumption and cost a new approach is proposed in this study for effective sulfide control in sewers it involves advanced oxidation of ferrous sulfide fes in sewer sediment to produce hydroxyl radical oh in situ leading to simultaneous sulfide oxidation and reduction of microbial sulfate reducing activity long term operation of three laboratory sewer sediment reactors was used to test the effectiveness of sulfide control the experimental reactor with the proposed in situ advanced fes oxidation substantially reduced sulfide concentration to 3 1 1 8 mg s l this compares to 9 2 2 7 mg s l in a control reactor with sole oxygen supply and 14 1 4 2 mg s l in the other control reactor without either iron or oxygen mechanistic investigations illustrated the critical role of oh produced from the oxidation of sediment iron in regulating microbial communities and the chemical sulfide oxidation reaction together these results demonstrate that incorporating the advanced fes oxidation process in sewer sediment enable superior performance of sulfide control at a much lower iron dosage thereby largely saving chemical use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer system air injection iron dosing advanced oxidation oh sulfide control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewer network is an important infrastructure asset in modern cities lu et al 2020 pikaar et al 2014 however the serviceability of the sewer system is often compromised by hydrogen sulfide h2s induced concrete corrosion resulting in severe rupture hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 2013 li et al 2020 rauch and kleidorfer 2014 zuo et al 2019 additionally h2s is also responsible for the odor nuisance and poses health threats to sewer workers li et al 2020 consequently researchers have developed a variety of approaches for sulfide control buisman et al 1990 gutierrez et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2022 zuo et al 2023 with the dosing of iron salts being a commonly used technique kulandaivelu et al 2020 firer et al 2008 ganigué et al 2018 this approach is mainly achieved by the precipitation of sulfide by ferrous ion fe2 to form insoluble ferrous sulfide fes in sediments eq 1 haanin et al 2005 an industry survey in australia showed that approximately 66 of the sewage flow with chemical dosing in sewer networks was treated by iron salts ganigue et al 2011 although the dosing of iron salts has been widely applied and shown to be outstandingly effective this technique requires a considerable amount of iron chemical for adequate sulfide control see theoretical stoichiometry in eq 1 wang et al 2021 the consumption can be up to 2 ton fe per day in a 20 km sewer pipe oviedo et al 2012 thus causing a significantly high cost in urban water management 1 f e 2 s 2 fes recently the advanced fes oxidation process has attracted attention in redox fluctuation water environments fes oxygenation can drive a fenton like process leading to the production of hydroxyl radical oh a powerful reactive oxygen species cheng et al 2016 he et al 2020 the oh can oxidize most redox sensitive substances for pollutant remediation and act as an antimicrobial agent against various microorganisms han et al 2020 huang et al 2021 ma et al 2019 wang et al 2017 2022 the advanced fes oxidation process has been shown to play an important role in a range of environments including river groundwater interaction zone lakeshores farmlands wetlands and deep aquifers tong et al 2016 while the wide application of iron salts leads to the accumulation of abundant fes in sewer sediments the role of advanced fes oxidation has not been reported in sewer systems to date more importantly the advanced fes oxidation may impact the sulfidgenic activity in sewers as the oh produced may have a biocidal effect on sulfate reducing bacteria srb this will in theory result in an enhanced h2s control performance beyond the chemical precipitation eq 1 however fes oxidation requires oxygen that can be made available in a sewer surface re aeration can bring in a significant amount of oxygen to sewage in pipes with steep slopes while in other pipes oxygen can be introduced designed air injection indeed air injection is often applied for h2s control in sewer networks because oxygen can inhibit sulfide production and oxidize sulfide that has been already formed chen and leung 2000 garcía et al 2017 however the effectiveness of the air injection alone is rather limited for sulfide control as it is difficult for oxygen to penetrate into deeper layers of sewer sediments zuo et al 2021 moreover sulfide oxidation with oxygen is relatively slow leading to a low h2s removal efficiency rathnayake et al 2019 in contrast oh is a much stronger oxidant compared to oxygen with a much faster reaction rate buxton et al 1988 we therefore hypothesize that air injection to iron containing sewer sediments could significantly improve sulfide oxidation via advanced fes oxidation this study proposes a new strategy combining iron dosing and air injection to achieve superior h2s control in sewers beyond the precipitation of h2s achieved with iron salts and the oxidation of h2s achieved by air injection this combined strategy will introduce a previously neglected process i e the advanced fes oxidation for more effective sulfide control in a sewer the oh formed will potentially impact microbial communities decrease sulfidgenic activity and increase sulfide oxidation these are all favourable for sulfide abatement in sewers and have a strong potential to reduce the iron consumption to assess the proposed approach and to unravel the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced h2s removal three reactors were established with one serving as an experimental reactor with combined iron dosing and air injection and two as controls with or without air injection throughout the long term operation dissolved sulfide in effluent and gaseous h2s in the reactor headspace were continuously monitored when stable operation was reached the sulfide production and oxidation rates and microbial communities in the sediments were evaluated the oh produced during air injection was also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of sewer sediment reactors triplicate laboratory sewer sediment reactors namely r1 r2 and r3 were established fig s1 they were made from plexiglas cylinders each with a total volume of 3 33 l including 0 66 l sediment phase 1 19 l liquid phase and 1 48 l gas phase sediment samples were collected from a gravity sanitary sewer and added to the reactors with an initial depth of approximately 5 cm a mechanical stirrer zt 3ik15rgnc with one paddle was positioned in the liquid phase to provide a stirring speed of 40 rpm all reactors were covered with aluminum foil to mimic the dark environment in sewers an h2s sensor modal odalog type l2 australia was placed in the gas phase to monitor the gaseous h2s concentration a ph do probe wtw ph oxi340i was inserted into the reactor to monitor do ph and temperature sewage collected weekly from a municipal sewer network on the campus of tsinghua university beijing china was used as the feed it contained sulfate at 15 50 mg so4 2 s l sulfide at 5 10 mg s2 s l chemical oxygen demand cod at 100 300 mg cod l and volatile fatty acid vfa at 10 30 mg cod l the collected sewage was stored at 4 c in a refrigerator prior to reactor feeding to prevent changes in the sewage characteristics the average temperature of reactors was maintained at 20 2 c the entire operation of sewer reactors lasted for 155 days consisting of two phases 1 baseline phase day 0 66 the three reactors were fed with fresh wastewater in parallel the feeding regime comprised 20 pump events per day with each pumping event lasting for 10 min feeding 180 ml wastewater into each reactor leading to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h this phase lasted for 66 days as baseline to establish stable sulfide production 2 experimental phase day 67 155 r1 was operated under the same conditions as in the baseline phase r2 started to receive air injection and r3 received air injection combined with fecl2 dosing the dissolved oxygen do in the r2 and r3 influent was 7 mg o2 l while that in r1 was negligible a ferrous ion stock solution with an iron concentration of 87 5 mg fe l was prepared which contained 0 01 m hydrochloric acid hcl to avoid ferrous hydroxide precipitation about 10 ml of the fecl2 solution was transported into r3 during each feed event using a peristaltic pump long model bt100 2 j forming a concentration of 4 6 mg fe l in wastewater thus 2 6 mg s l of sulfide in the sewage should theorectically be removed assuming an s2 fe2 of 1 1 eq 1 throughout the operation the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured 4 6 times per week the gaseous h2s concertation in the gas phase was monitored and recorded by the h2s sensor every 5 10 min the surface sediments 0 5 mm were sampled from the three sewer reactors at the end of the experimental phase to perform microbial community analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing text s1 2 2 sulfidogenic activity batch tests were conducted every 1 2 weeks to evaluate the sulfidogenic activity of sewer sediments in three reactors at the beginning of each batch test the reactors were emptied and filled with fresh wastewater no iron salt or air was added into the reactors when determining the sulfidogenic activity each batch test lasted for 2 h and liquid samples were taken every 0 5 h the dissolved sulfide concentration was immediately analyzed after membrane 0 45 μm filtration the linear regression of these concentrations versus time was used to calculate the sulfidogenic activity to further analyze microscale sulfidogenic activity along the depth of sediments a novel in situ monitoring technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was used previous studies have proven that dgt has significant advantages in providing high resolution and two dimensional analysis in sediments ding et al 2010 xu et al 2013 zuo et al 2020a the dgt was prepared according to ding et al 2012 with the probe provided by the easysensor ltd www easysensor net in this experiment three dgt probes were inserted vertically into the sediments of the three reactors on day 100 the sediment water interface was marked with a ceramic knife after 40 min the dgt probes were taken out and the binding gel was removed and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water before surface drying with filter paper details of the dgt analysis methods can be found in text s2 2 3 sulfide oxidation on day 130 batch tests were performed in r1 r3 to evaluate the in situ sulfide oxidation rate of sewer sediments wastewater in all three reactors was drained and reverse osmosis ro water was used to fill the reactors the initial do was rasied to above 7 mg o2 l while the initial sulfide concentration was adjusted to 16 17 mg s l by adding a na2s stock solution of note wastewater was not used in the experiment as otherwise sulfide would be simultanesouly generated in sediments supported by sulfide and cod presence in the wastewater a sampling frequency of 10 min was maintained during the 1 h test for immediate analysis of sulfide the linear regression of sulfide concentration versus time was used to calculate the sulfide oxidation rate of sewer sediments to examine the chemical sulfide oxidation rates batch tests were performed in a sealed reactor 4 l filled with wastewater but without sediments at the beginning of each batch test the reactor was filled with fresh wastewater without any headspace about 50 ml of the 5 g l sodium sulfide na2s stock solution was added to the reactor resulting in an initial sulfide concentration of 16 17 mg s l tests i and ii were to investigate the removal of sulfide by fes dosing and air injection respectively while test iii was to evaluate the synergistic effect of air injection and fes dosing on sulfide removal specifically the initial do concentration in tests ii and iii was 7 mg o2 l by rapid aeration with an air compressor while fes particles prepared according to butler and hayes 1998 text s3 were added in tests i and iii to bring an iron concentration of about 5 mg fe l a mechanical stirrer with one paddle was positioned in the liquid and operated at a stirring speed of 40 rpm a ph do probe wtw ph oxi340i was inserted into the reactor for monitoring ph do and temperature variations each batch test lasted for 60 min and liquid samples were taken every 10 15 min for the immediate measurement of dissolved sulfide all tests were performed in duplicate the linear regression of sulfide concentration versus time was used to estimate chemical sulfide oxidation rate 2 4 oh production in sewer sediments to verify our hypothesis that sewer sediments had a great potential to produce oh about 25 g surface sediment samples 0 0 5 cm were removed from each of the three sewer reactors in the experimental phase the total iron concentration in sediment samples was measured the sediment samples were transported into three cone shaped flasks containing 50 ml of 100 mm sodium benzoic and 200 ml of ultrapure water with temperature controlled at 21 0 5 c ph buffered at 7 0 0 2 with 3 mm piperazine n n bis ethanesulfonic acid pipes aladdin chemistry co ltd china the reaction between pipes and oh is known to be negligible cheng et al 2016 moreover the flasks were covered with aluminum foil to avoid any potential production of oh due to photolysis the liquid was mixed at a stirring speed of 100 rpm and a do probe wtw ph oxi340i was used to monitor do levels in the flasks all three flasks were aerated with an air compressor at a air flow rate of 3 l min to maintain a saturated do concentration during the test 3 ml of suspensions were collected at 0 15 30 60 120 and 180 min and filtered through a 0 22 μm the filtrate was immediately analyzed for the p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba concentration all the above experiments were carried out in duplicate the linear regression of these concentrations versus time was used to calculate oh production rate by sewer sediments 2 5 chemical analysis sulfide and cod concentrations were measured using standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2016 sulfate concentration was measured using ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa the vfa concentration was measured with gas chromatography gc 6890 n agilent usa the oh concentrations were obtained by measuring according to p hba concentration as reported in literature tong et al 2016 specifically the p hba concentration was analyzed in cl 20a hpcl shimadzu equipped with a uv detector and an inter sustain c18 column 4 6 250 mm the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile 65 35 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min with the detection wavelength at 255 nm a conversion factor of 5 87 was used to estimate the cumulative oh concentrations mopper and zhou 1990 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfide control performance the initial 66 days of operation served as the baseline phase without air injection or iron dosing fig s2 the average sulfide concentrations in the r1 r3 effluent were 13 4 3 1 mg s l 14 3 3 1 mg s l and 15 3 2 7 mg s l respectively fig 1 a the similar sulfide concentrations resulted in similar h2s levels in the gas phase which were 130 115 ppm on average fig 1b the average sulfidogenic activity of sewer sediments in r1 r3 were measured to be 6 0 0 8 g s m2 d 5 8 1 1 g s m2 d and 6 6 1 2 g s m2 d respectively fig s3 the rates were similar and close to the sulfidogenic activity previously reported for sewer sediments liu et al 2015 2016 zuo et al 2020b 2021 the differences in effluent sulfide concentration headspace h2s concentration and sulfidogenic activity among r1 r3 were insignificant p 0 05 t test indicating that the sediments in all three sewer reactors had similar capabilities for sulfide production the experimental phase commenced on day 67 air was injected into the influent of r2 and r3 to raise the do concentration to around 7 mg o2 l while r3 also received fecl2 dosing the long term operation showed that the average effluent sulfide concentrations in r2 and r3 decreased to 9 2 2 7 mg s l and 3 1 1 8 mg s l respectively 35 and 78 lower than that of r1 14 1 4 2 mg s l fig 1a the low sulfide concentration in r3 resulted in significantly lower h2s concentration in the gas phase 25 25 ppm demonstrating the high effectiveness of h2s control by combining air injection and iron dosing fig 1b it is worth pointing out that a low dosage of fecl2 was used in r3 at only 4 6 mg fe l which can only remove sulfide of about 2 6 mg s l via fes precipitation eq 1 however in comparison to r2 with air injection the sulfide concentration further decreased by 6 1 mg s l with the addition of fecl2 in r3 which was nearly three times higher than the theoretical value this result suggested that fes precipitation was not the only reason for the enhanced performance of sulfide control in r3 and the whole was clearly greater than the sum of the parts 3 2 inhibition of sulfidogenic activity in the experimental period the sulfidogenic activity of sediments was assessed using batch tests every 1 2 weeks fig 2 a in r2 with air injection the sulfidogenic rate of sediments barely changed compared to the baseline phase the rate of 5 2 0 9 g s m2 d was also close to that of r1 sediment 5 6 0 4 g s m2 d showing that the air injection alone was unable to inhibit sulfidogenic activity likely due to diffusion limitation of oxygen in sediment zuo et al 2021 this also suggested that the reduced sulfide concentration observed in r2 during the long term operation compared to r1 was likely due to the oxidation of sulfide in contrast the sulfidogenic rate of r3 significantly decreased to 3 5 0 5 g s m2 d indicating a 30 40 reduction over r1 and r2 as fes was not found to have any inhibitory effects on the sulfidogenic activity in anaerobic environments text s4 figure s4 these results together suggest that only combining air injection with fecl2 dosing suppressed the sulfidogenic activity on day 100 the dgt technique was applied in the three sewer sediments to measure microscale sulfidogenic activity along the sediment depth similar to previous studies zuo et al 2020b 2021 sediment surface 1 cm was the active zone for sulfide production fig 2b the sulfidogenic activities in the dominant active zones of the three sediments were found to be different as 1 69 0 24 g s m2 d for r1 1 56 0 29 g s m2 d for r2 and 0 90 0 06 s m2 d for r3 the similar sulfidogenic activity between r1 and r2 confirmed that air injection alone had limited impact on the sulfidogenic activity in comparison the sulfidogenic activity of r3 sediment was reduced by around 40 consistent with the batch test results fig 2a 3 3 enhancement of sulfide oxidation rate on day 130 batch tests were performed to determine in situ sulfide oxidation rates in the three sewer sediment reactors the sulfide oxidation rate of sediment in r3 was 0 35 0 07 mg s min nearly three times that in r1 0 12 0 01 mg s min and r2 0 14 0 02 mg s min fig 3 a the results revealed that the combination of air injection and iron dosing significantly increased sulfide oxidation rate moreover a group of sediment free batch tests was designed to investigate the effects of air injection and fes dosing on chemical sulfide oxidation rate in the absence of sediments air injection combined with fes dosing could also enhance the chemical sulfide oxidation rate 0 59 0 15 mg s min which was 2 3 times that achieved in the condition with only air injection 0 28 0 04 mg s min fig 3b the chemical sulfide oxidation rates were higher than in situ sulfide oxidation rates fig 3a because in situ tests in the sediment reactors were usually rate limited by substrate diffusion between the overlying water and sediment zuo et al 2020b however the chemical sulfide oxidation rate and the in situ sulfide oxidation rate measured in r3 were both 2 3 times that in r1 and r2 suggesting that chemical sulfide oxidation was a crucial pathway of in situ sulfide oxidation by sediments as the fes dosing had little impact on chemical sulfide oxidation it is reasonable to speculate that the significant enhancement of sulfide oxidation is attributed to the synergistic effect of air injection and the fes particles 3 4 microbial community analysis sediment samples were collected during stable operation of the experimental phase the microbial communities were analyzed using 16s rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing the resulting dna gene pruning sequence was separated from three samples into 838 otus good s coverage estimator on the otus calculated from each sample showed that the test captured 99 of the sample species the alpha diversity analysis indicated by sobs and shannon index showed that r3 sample had a higher community richness and diversity than r1 and r2 samples fig s5 illustrating the role of air injection combined with fecl2 dosing the community composition analysis revealed that the 10 most abundant genera did not change significantly in the three sediment samples p 0 05 t test in which trichococcus was the dominant genera constituting approximately 41 59 and 33 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively fig s6 the sulfur related genera consisted of three srbs desulforhabdus desulfomicrobium and desulfovibrio and two sobs thiothrix and sulfurospirillum fig s7 similar to previous reports zuo et al 2021 the relative abundances of these srb were similar among the three reactors p 0 05 t test thus the decreased sulfidogenic activity in r3 was likely because srb were inhibited by the combined air injection and iron dosing the two sobs accounted for 1 4 of the total genera in r3 higher than that in r1 and r2 0 5 and 0 5 suggesting that biological sulfide oxidation might also have contributed to the increased rate in r3 3 5 in situ oh production in sediments the oh production in sewer sediments was estimated using batch tests at the end of reactor operation the highest oh production rate of 0 28 µm min was observed in the r3 sediments compared to 0 15 µm min in r1 and 0 16 µm min in r2 fig 4 the r3 sediment was rich in fes particles due to long term iron dosing 0 9 mmol fe g dry sediment as such the oxidation of fes particles likely produced more oh the r1 and r2 sediments can also produce oh because sewer sediments still contained fe even without intentional iron dosing measured as 0 4 0 5 mmol fe g dry sediment for r1 and r2 as a result of the abundant iron in sewer sediments the oh production rate was higher than other water systems such as rivers lakes and wetland fe ii content 0 0 09 mmol g sediment tong et al 2016 3 6 efficient sulfide control by in situ advanced oxidation of sediment iron this study presents a novel approach for sulfide control in sewers by combined use of air injection and iron dosing thus overcoming the disadvantages of low control efficiency of sole air injection and high consumption of iron dosing abundant oh was produced in sewer sediments confirming the occurrence of in situ advanced oxidation of sediment iron in light of the combined results an underlying mechanism was proposed fig 5 in the presence of oxygen and iron usually in the form of fes in sewer sediment in situ advanced fes oxidation occurs leading to the production of oh through a fenton like process this process primarily occurs in the oxic anoxic surface layer of sediment due to limited diffusion of oxygen the oh produced leads to in situ inhibition of sulfidogenic activity and enhancement of sulfide oxidation specifically the oh produced has a biotoxic effect on sulfidogenic activity inhibiting it through for example the dna disruption oxidation of proteins and amino acids and lipid peroxidation of membrane fatty acids girotti 1998 imlay et al 1988 valko et al 2005 as reported in previous studies oh derived from oxygenation of fe ii has an antimicrobial effect of against many bacteria and fungus dixon and stockwell 2014 secondly the oh produced can enhance the chemical sulfide oxidation rate the oh is a much stronger oxidant than oxygen as evidenced by the 2 3 times higher chemical sulfide oxidation rate achieved in the group with fes and oxygen than the group with only oxygen fig 3 it is previously believed that oxygen is the oxidant for sulfide oxidation but this rate is relatively low and is usually utilized by many containmants in wastewater for example biological organic carbon oxidation could consume oxygen faster than the chemical sulfide oxidation rathnayake et al 2019 thus resulting in a low efficiency for sulfide oxidation in comparison the oh formed could preferentially oxidize sulfide as sulfide is highly reductive and react chemically with oh at a higher rate 1 5 1010 l mol 1 s 1 than many organic contaminants such as glucose 1 5 109 l mol 1 s 1 acetic acid 1 6 107 l mol 1 s 1 propionic acid 6 2 108 l mol 1 s 1 etc buxton et al 1988 based on this mechanism the presence of fes makes oxygen more efficient for chemical sulfide oxidation in addition to the chemical oxidation pathway oh may also enhance the biological oxidation of sulfide as shown by the increased relative abundance of sob in r3 previous studies also reported that oh has a different effect on different bacteria e g increasing the relative abundance of anaerolineaceae but decreasing that of nistrospiraeceae and geobacteraceae in sediments ma et al 2019 more importantly oh could be continuously produced at the oxic anoxic sediment interface because fes can be regenerated due to the continuous reduction and precipitation of fe iii by the sulfide produced in sewer sediments thus oh induced enhancement of sulfide control is sustained 3 7 implications for sewer management advanced oxidation of fes in sediments is an important process affecting biogeochemical cycles and the oh formed leads to different contaminant remediation in various systems han et al 2020 huang et al 2021 wang et al 2017 2022 this study for the first time reports the advanced oxidation of fes in sewer systems which presents a new opportunity to control h2s in sewer networks with iron solution dosed the formed fes nanoparticles are expected to deposit in sewer sediments which when oxidised leads to the production of oh that inhibits sulfidogenic activity and promotes sulfide oxidation indeed the oxygen air injection is a very widely applied approach to control h2s rising mains where a pressure is maintained however an unaddressed critical challenge associated with oxygen air injection is the limited efficiency of oxygen for h2s control previous studies have shown that the sulfide removal was only 6 1 0 4 mg s l when oxygen injection was 15 25 mg o2 l gutierrez et al 2008 suggesting that oxygen utilization efficiency i e the ratio of h2s removed to oxygen was in the range of 0 24 0 41 mg s mg o2 in our long term results oxygen supply 7 mg o2 l combined with a very low dosage of iron salts 4 6 mg fe2 l in theory removing 2 6 mg s l reduced the sulfide by 11 mg s l representing an oxygen utilization efficiency of up to 1 2 mg s mg o2 i e 3 5 times higher than reported this result suggests a dramatic saving in energy to provide oxygen into sewer networks again underpinning the significance and practical relevance of the present study notably despite the absence of sediments in pressure sewers biofilms have been shown to be effective at absorbing ferrous iron which is expected to play a same role in sulfide control moreover regarding the gravity sewer pipes which are partially filled and operate under normal atmospheric conditions the injection of air is more common which could be achieved through ventilation or bubble aeration gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 a potential challenge in gravity sewers is whether fes nanoparticles can be deposited effectively in sewer sediments in some locations with large wastewater velocity to ensure a high fes concentration on sediment surface one solution is adding large fes particles directly to the sediment which is expected to rapidly improve sewer sulfide control via fes advanced oxidation process in sediments while this work mainly focused on the sulfide control in sewers through in situ advanced oxidation of fes the produced oh may also potentially contribute to the remediation of other chemical and biological contaminants in sewage sufficient evidence has shown that oh is effective in degrading various micropollutants and inactivating antibiotic resistant bacteria ahmed et al 2021 frey et al 2010 he et al 2019 for instance the doses of 0 6 mm of h2o2 and 0 18 mm of fe ii led to a 6 log reduction of colistin resistant escherichia coli s115 giannakis et al 2018 however further studies are needed to investigate the impacts of oh generated through fes oxidation moreover recent studies have found that the oxidation of other substances besides fes such as dissolved organic matter dom and sulfide may also induce oh production lombardo et al 2020 page et al 2013 which needs to be further explored in sewer systems finally the optimization strategies to maximize oh production will also require more investigation for example the selection of optimal dosage level of iron salts do level and different types of iron salts such as ferric chloride and ferrous carbonate hu et al 2023 it is important to determine the dosage limit of iron salts to maintain good sulfide control performance while minimizing economic costs and potential environmental impacts 4 conclusions in summary this study proposes and demonstrates a new approach for effective sulfide control in sewers by generating hydroxyl radical oh in situ via advanced oxidation of fes in sewer sediments the main conclusions are as follows in the experimental reactor with air injection combined with ferrous dosing the formation of fes makes oxygen more efficiency for sulfide control with a substantially reduced sulfide level of 3 1 1 8 mg s l much lower than those in control reactors the enhancement of sulfide control in the experimental reactor is induced by simultaneous sulfide oxidation and reduction of microbial sulfate reducing activity in sewer sediments the oh production rate of sewer sediments in the experimental reactor was about 0 28 µm min much higher than those in control reactors 0 15 and 0 16 µm min notes the authors declare no competing financial

14738,sulfide control is a significant problem in urban sewer management although in sewer dosing of chemicals has been widely applied it is prone to high chemical consumption and cost a new approach is proposed in this study for effective sulfide control in sewers it involves advanced oxidation of ferrous sulfide fes in sewer sediment to produce hydroxyl radical oh in situ leading to simultaneous sulfide oxidation and reduction of microbial sulfate reducing activity long term operation of three laboratory sewer sediment reactors was used to test the effectiveness of sulfide control the experimental reactor with the proposed in situ advanced fes oxidation substantially reduced sulfide concentration to 3 1 1 8 mg s l this compares to 9 2 2 7 mg s l in a control reactor with sole oxygen supply and 14 1 4 2 mg s l in the other control reactor without either iron or oxygen mechanistic investigations illustrated the critical role of oh produced from the oxidation of sediment iron in regulating microbial communities and the chemical sulfide oxidation reaction together these results demonstrate that incorporating the advanced fes oxidation process in sewer sediment enable superior performance of sulfide control at a much lower iron dosage thereby largely saving chemical use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer system air injection iron dosing advanced oxidation oh sulfide control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewer network is an important infrastructure asset in modern cities lu et al 2020 pikaar et al 2014 however the serviceability of the sewer system is often compromised by hydrogen sulfide h2s induced concrete corrosion resulting in severe rupture hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 2013 li et al 2020 rauch and kleidorfer 2014 zuo et al 2019 additionally h2s is also responsible for the odor nuisance and poses health threats to sewer workers li et al 2020 consequently researchers have developed a variety of approaches for sulfide control buisman et al 1990 gutierrez et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2022 zuo et al 2023 with the dosing of iron salts being a commonly used technique kulandaivelu et al 2020 firer et al 2008 ganigué et al 2018 this approach is mainly achieved by the precipitation of sulfide by ferrous ion fe2 to form insoluble ferrous sulfide fes in sediments eq 1 haanin et al 2005 an industry survey in australia showed that approximately 66 of the sewage flow with chemical dosing in sewer networks was treated by iron salts ganigue et al 2011 although the dosing of iron salts has been widely applied and shown to be outstandingly effective this technique requires a considerable amount of iron chemical for adequate sulfide control see theoretical stoichiometry in eq 1 wang et al 2021 the consumption can be up to 2 ton fe per day in a 20 km sewer pipe oviedo et al 2012 thus causing a significantly high cost in urban water management 1 f e 2 s 2 fes recently the advanced fes oxidation process has attracted attention in redox fluctuation water environments fes oxygenation can drive a fenton like process leading to the production of hydroxyl radical oh a powerful reactive oxygen species cheng et al 2016 he et al 2020 the oh can oxidize most redox sensitive substances for pollutant remediation and act as an antimicrobial agent against various microorganisms han et al 2020 huang et al 2021 ma et al 2019 wang et al 2017 2022 the advanced fes oxidation process has been shown to play an important role in a range of environments including river groundwater interaction zone lakeshores farmlands wetlands and deep aquifers tong et al 2016 while the wide application of iron salts leads to the accumulation of abundant fes in sewer sediments the role of advanced fes oxidation has not been reported in sewer systems to date more importantly the advanced fes oxidation may impact the sulfidgenic activity in sewers as the oh produced may have a biocidal effect on sulfate reducing bacteria srb this will in theory result in an enhanced h2s control performance beyond the chemical precipitation eq 1 however fes oxidation requires oxygen that can be made available in a sewer surface re aeration can bring in a significant amount of oxygen to sewage in pipes with steep slopes while in other pipes oxygen can be introduced designed air injection indeed air injection is often applied for h2s control in sewer networks because oxygen can inhibit sulfide production and oxidize sulfide that has been already formed chen and leung 2000 garcía et al 2017 however the effectiveness of the air injection alone is rather limited for sulfide control as it is difficult for oxygen to penetrate into deeper layers of sewer sediments zuo et al 2021 moreover sulfide oxidation with oxygen is relatively slow leading to a low h2s removal efficiency rathnayake et al 2019 in contrast oh is a much stronger oxidant compared to oxygen with a much faster reaction rate buxton et al 1988 we therefore hypothesize that air injection to iron containing sewer sediments could significantly improve sulfide oxidation via advanced fes oxidation this study proposes a new strategy combining iron dosing and air injection to achieve superior h2s control in sewers beyond the precipitation of h2s achieved with iron salts and the oxidation of h2s achieved by air injection this combined strategy will introduce a previously neglected process i e the advanced fes oxidation for more effective sulfide control in a sewer the oh formed will potentially impact microbial communities decrease sulfidgenic activity and increase sulfide oxidation these are all favourable for sulfide abatement in sewers and have a strong potential to reduce the iron consumption to assess the proposed approach and to unravel the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced h2s removal three reactors were established with one serving as an experimental reactor with combined iron dosing and air injection and two as controls with or without air injection throughout the long term operation dissolved sulfide in effluent and gaseous h2s in the reactor headspace were continuously monitored when stable operation was reached the sulfide production and oxidation rates and microbial communities in the sediments were evaluated the oh produced during air injection was also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of sewer sediment reactors triplicate laboratory sewer sediment reactors namely r1 r2 and r3 were established fig s1 they were made from plexiglas cylinders each with a total volume of 3 33 l including 0 66 l sediment phase 1 19 l liquid phase and 1 48 l gas phase sediment samples were collected from a gravity sanitary sewer and added to the reactors with an initial depth of approximately 5 cm a mechanical stirrer zt 3ik15rgnc with one paddle was positioned in the liquid phase to provide a stirring speed of 40 rpm all reactors were covered with aluminum foil to mimic the dark environment in sewers an h2s sensor modal odalog type l2 australia was placed in the gas phase to monitor the gaseous h2s concentration a ph do probe wtw ph oxi340i was inserted into the reactor to monitor do ph and temperature sewage collected weekly from a municipal sewer network on the campus of tsinghua university beijing china was used as the feed it contained sulfate at 15 50 mg so4 2 s l sulfide at 5 10 mg s2 s l chemical oxygen demand cod at 100 300 mg cod l and volatile fatty acid vfa at 10 30 mg cod l the collected sewage was stored at 4 c in a refrigerator prior to reactor feeding to prevent changes in the sewage characteristics the average temperature of reactors was maintained at 20 2 c the entire operation of sewer reactors lasted for 155 days consisting of two phases 1 baseline phase day 0 66 the three reactors were fed with fresh wastewater in parallel the feeding regime comprised 20 pump events per day with each pumping event lasting for 10 min feeding 180 ml wastewater into each reactor leading to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h this phase lasted for 66 days as baseline to establish stable sulfide production 2 experimental phase day 67 155 r1 was operated under the same conditions as in the baseline phase r2 started to receive air injection and r3 received air injection combined with fecl2 dosing the dissolved oxygen do in the r2 and r3 influent was 7 mg o2 l while that in r1 was negligible a ferrous ion stock solution with an iron concentration of 87 5 mg fe l was prepared which contained 0 01 m hydrochloric acid hcl to avoid ferrous hydroxide precipitation about 10 ml of the fecl2 solution was transported into r3 during each feed event using a peristaltic pump long model bt100 2 j forming a concentration of 4 6 mg fe l in wastewater thus 2 6 mg s l of sulfide in the sewage should theorectically be removed assuming an s2 fe2 of 1 1 eq 1 throughout the operation the dissolved sulfide concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured 4 6 times per week the gaseous h2s concertation in the gas phase was monitored and recorded by the h2s sensor every 5 10 min the surface sediments 0 5 mm were sampled from the three sewer reactors at the end of the experimental phase to perform microbial community analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing text s1 2 2 sulfidogenic activity batch tests were conducted every 1 2 weeks to evaluate the sulfidogenic activity of sewer sediments in three reactors at the beginning of each batch test the reactors were emptied and filled with fresh wastewater no iron salt or air was added into the reactors when determining the sulfidogenic activity each batch test lasted for 2 h and liquid samples were taken every 0 5 h the dissolved sulfide concentration was immediately analyzed after membrane 0 45 μm filtration the linear regression of these concentrations versus time was used to calculate the sulfidogenic activity to further analyze microscale sulfidogenic activity along the depth of sediments a novel in situ monitoring technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was used previous studies have proven that dgt has significant advantages in providing high resolution and two dimensional analysis in sediments ding et al 2010 xu et al 2013 zuo et al 2020a the dgt was prepared according to ding et al 2012 with the probe provided by the easysensor ltd www easysensor net in this experiment three dgt probes were inserted vertically into the sediments of the three reactors on day 100 the sediment water interface was marked with a ceramic knife after 40 min the dgt probes were taken out and the binding gel was removed and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water before surface drying with filter paper details of the dgt analysis methods can be found in text s2 2 3 sulfide oxidation on day 130 batch tests were performed in r1 r3 to evaluate the in situ sulfide oxidation rate of sewer sediments wastewater in all three reactors was drained and reverse osmosis ro water was used to fill the reactors the initial do was rasied to above 7 mg o2 l while the initial sulfide concentration was adjusted to 16 17 mg s l by adding a na2s stock solution of note wastewater was not used in the experiment as otherwise sulfide would be simultanesouly generated in sediments supported by sulfide and cod presence in the wastewater a sampling frequency of 10 min was maintained during the 1 h test for immediate analysis of sulfide the linear regression of sulfide concentration versus time was used to calculate the sulfide oxidation rate of sewer sediments to examine the chemical sulfide oxidation rates batch tests were performed in a sealed reactor 4 l filled with wastewater but without sediments at the beginning of each batch test the reactor was filled with fresh wastewater without any headspace about 50 ml of the 5 g l sodium sulfide na2s stock solution was added to the reactor resulting in an initial sulfide concentration of 16 17 mg s l tests i and ii were to investigate the removal of sulfide by fes dosing and air injection respectively while test iii was to evaluate the synergistic effect of air injection and fes dosing on sulfide removal specifically the initial do concentration in tests ii and iii was 7 mg o2 l by rapid aeration with an air compressor while fes particles prepared according to butler and hayes 1998 text s3 were added in tests i and iii to bring an iron concentration of about 5 mg fe l a mechanical stirrer with one paddle was positioned in the liquid and operated at a stirring speed of 40 rpm a ph do probe wtw ph oxi340i was inserted into the reactor for monitoring ph do and temperature variations each batch test lasted for 60 min and liquid samples were taken every 10 15 min for the immediate measurement of dissolved sulfide all tests were performed in duplicate the linear regression of sulfide concentration versus time was used to estimate chemical sulfide oxidation rate 2 4 oh production in sewer sediments to verify our hypothesis that sewer sediments had a great potential to produce oh about 25 g surface sediment samples 0 0 5 cm were removed from each of the three sewer reactors in the experimental phase the total iron concentration in sediment samples was measured the sediment samples were transported into three cone shaped flasks containing 50 ml of 100 mm sodium benzoic and 200 ml of ultrapure water with temperature controlled at 21 0 5 c ph buffered at 7 0 0 2 with 3 mm piperazine n n bis ethanesulfonic acid pipes aladdin chemistry co ltd china the reaction between pipes and oh is known to be negligible cheng et al 2016 moreover the flasks were covered with aluminum foil to avoid any potential production of oh due to photolysis the liquid was mixed at a stirring speed of 100 rpm and a do probe wtw ph oxi340i was used to monitor do levels in the flasks all three flasks were aerated with an air compressor at a air flow rate of 3 l min to maintain a saturated do concentration during the test 3 ml of suspensions were collected at 0 15 30 60 120 and 180 min and filtered through a 0 22 μm the filtrate was immediately analyzed for the p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba concentration all the above experiments were carried out in duplicate the linear regression of these concentrations versus time was used to calculate oh production rate by sewer sediments 2 5 chemical analysis sulfide and cod concentrations were measured using standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2016 sulfate concentration was measured using ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa the vfa concentration was measured with gas chromatography gc 6890 n agilent usa the oh concentrations were obtained by measuring according to p hba concentration as reported in literature tong et al 2016 specifically the p hba concentration was analyzed in cl 20a hpcl shimadzu equipped with a uv detector and an inter sustain c18 column 4 6 250 mm the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 1 trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile 65 35 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min with the detection wavelength at 255 nm a conversion factor of 5 87 was used to estimate the cumulative oh concentrations mopper and zhou 1990 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfide control performance the initial 66 days of operation served as the baseline phase without air injection or iron dosing fig s2 the average sulfide concentrations in the r1 r3 effluent were 13 4 3 1 mg s l 14 3 3 1 mg s l and 15 3 2 7 mg s l respectively fig 1 a the similar sulfide concentrations resulted in similar h2s levels in the gas phase which were 130 115 ppm on average fig 1b the average sulfidogenic activity of sewer sediments in r1 r3 were measured to be 6 0 0 8 g s m2 d 5 8 1 1 g s m2 d and 6 6 1 2 g s m2 d respectively fig s3 the rates were similar and close to the sulfidogenic activity previously reported for sewer sediments liu et al 2015 2016 zuo et al 2020b 2021 the differences in effluent sulfide concentration headspace h2s concentration and sulfidogenic activity among r1 r3 were insignificant p 0 05 t test indicating that the sediments in all three sewer reactors had similar capabilities for sulfide production the experimental phase commenced on day 67 air was injected into the influent of r2 and r3 to raise the do concentration to around 7 mg o2 l while r3 also received fecl2 dosing the long term operation showed that the average effluent sulfide concentrations in r2 and r3 decreased to 9 2 2 7 mg s l and 3 1 1 8 mg s l respectively 35 and 78 lower than that of r1 14 1 4 2 mg s l fig 1a the low sulfide concentration in r3 resulted in significantly lower h2s concentration in the gas phase 25 25 ppm demonstrating the high effectiveness of h2s control by combining air injection and iron dosing fig 1b it is worth pointing out that a low dosage of fecl2 was used in r3 at only 4 6 mg fe l which can only remove sulfide of about 2 6 mg s l via fes precipitation eq 1 however in comparison to r2 with air injection the sulfide concentration further decreased by 6 1 mg s l with the addition of fecl2 in r3 which was nearly three times higher than the theoretical value this result suggested that fes precipitation was not the only reason for the enhanced performance of sulfide control in r3 and the whole was clearly greater than the sum of the parts 3 2 inhibition of sulfidogenic activity in the experimental period the sulfidogenic activity of sediments was assessed using batch tests every 1 2 weeks fig 2 a in r2 with air injection the sulfidogenic rate of sediments barely changed compared to the baseline phase the rate of 5 2 0 9 g s m2 d was also close to that of r1 sediment 5 6 0 4 g s m2 d showing that the air injection alone was unable to inhibit sulfidogenic activity likely due to diffusion limitation of oxygen in sediment zuo et al 2021 this also suggested that the reduced sulfide concentration observed in r2 during the long term operation compared to r1 was likely due to the oxidation of sulfide in contrast the sulfidogenic rate of r3 significantly decreased to 3 5 0 5 g s m2 d indicating a 30 40 reduction over r1 and r2 as fes was not found to have any inhibitory effects on the sulfidogenic activity in anaerobic environments text s4 figure s4 these results together suggest that only combining air injection with fecl2 dosing suppressed the sulfidogenic activity on day 100 the dgt technique was applied in the three sewer sediments to measure microscale sulfidogenic activity along the sediment depth similar to previous studies zuo et al 2020b 2021 sediment surface 1 cm was the active zone for sulfide production fig 2b the sulfidogenic activities in the dominant active zones of the three sediments were found to be different as 1 69 0 24 g s m2 d for r1 1 56 0 29 g s m2 d for r2 and 0 90 0 06 s m2 d for r3 the similar sulfidogenic activity between r1 and r2 confirmed that air injection alone had limited impact on the sulfidogenic activity in comparison the sulfidogenic activity of r3 sediment was reduced by around 40 consistent with the batch test results fig 2a 3 3 enhancement of sulfide oxidation rate on day 130 batch tests were performed to determine in situ sulfide oxidation rates in the three sewer sediment reactors the sulfide oxidation rate of sediment in r3 was 0 35 0 07 mg s min nearly three times that in r1 0 12 0 01 mg s min and r2 0 14 0 02 mg s min fig 3 a the results revealed that the combination of air injection and iron dosing significantly increased sulfide oxidation rate moreover a group of sediment free batch tests was designed to investigate the effects of air injection and fes dosing on chemical sulfide oxidation rate in the absence of sediments air injection combined with fes dosing could also enhance the chemical sulfide oxidation rate 0 59 0 15 mg s min which was 2 3 times that achieved in the condition with only air injection 0 28 0 04 mg s min fig 3b the chemical sulfide oxidation rates were higher than in situ sulfide oxidation rates fig 3a because in situ tests in the sediment reactors were usually rate limited by substrate diffusion between the overlying water and sediment zuo et al 2020b however the chemical sulfide oxidation rate and the in situ sulfide oxidation rate measured in r3 were both 2 3 times that in r1 and r2 suggesting that chemical sulfide oxidation was a crucial pathway of in situ sulfide oxidation by sediments as the fes dosing had little impact on chemical sulfide oxidation it is reasonable to speculate that the significant enhancement of sulfide oxidation is attributed to the synergistic effect of air injection and the fes particles 3 4 microbial community analysis sediment samples were collected during stable operation of the experimental phase the microbial communities were analyzed using 16s rrna gene targeted amplicon sequencing the resulting dna gene pruning sequence was separated from three samples into 838 otus good s coverage estimator on the otus calculated from each sample showed that the test captured 99 of the sample species the alpha diversity analysis indicated by sobs and shannon index showed that r3 sample had a higher community richness and diversity than r1 and r2 samples fig s5 illustrating the role of air injection combined with fecl2 dosing the community composition analysis revealed that the 10 most abundant genera did not change significantly in the three sediment samples p 0 05 t test in which trichococcus was the dominant genera constituting approximately 41 59 and 33 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively fig s6 the sulfur related genera consisted of three srbs desulforhabdus desulfomicrobium and desulfovibrio and two sobs thiothrix and sulfurospirillum fig s7 similar to previous reports zuo et al 2021 the relative abundances of these srb were similar among the three reactors p 0 05 t test thus the decreased sulfidogenic activity in r3 was likely because srb were inhibited by the combined air injection and iron dosing the two sobs accounted for 1 4 of the total genera in r3 higher than that in r1 and r2 0 5 and 0 5 suggesting that biological sulfide oxidation might also have contributed to the increased rate in r3 3 5 in situ oh production in sediments the oh production in sewer sediments was estimated using batch tests at the end of reactor operation the highest oh production rate of 0 28 µm min was observed in the r3 sediments compared to 0 15 µm min in r1 and 0 16 µm min in r2 fig 4 the r3 sediment was rich in fes particles due to long term iron dosing 0 9 mmol fe g dry sediment as such the oxidation of fes particles likely produced more oh the r1 and r2 sediments can also produce oh because sewer sediments still contained fe even without intentional iron dosing measured as 0 4 0 5 mmol fe g dry sediment for r1 and r2 as a result of the abundant iron in sewer sediments the oh production rate was higher than other water systems such as rivers lakes and wetland fe ii content 0 0 09 mmol g sediment tong et al 2016 3 6 efficient sulfide control by in situ advanced oxidation of sediment iron this study presents a novel approach for sulfide control in sewers by combined use of air injection and iron dosing thus overcoming the disadvantages of low control efficiency of sole air injection and high consumption of iron dosing abundant oh was produced in sewer sediments confirming the occurrence of in situ advanced oxidation of sediment iron in light of the combined results an underlying mechanism was proposed fig 5 in the presence of oxygen and iron usually in the form of fes in sewer sediment in situ advanced fes oxidation occurs leading to the production of oh through a fenton like process this process primarily occurs in the oxic anoxic surface layer of sediment due to limited diffusion of oxygen the oh produced leads to in situ inhibition of sulfidogenic activity and enhancement of sulfide oxidation specifically the oh produced has a biotoxic effect on sulfidogenic activity inhibiting it through for example the dna disruption oxidation of proteins and amino acids and lipid peroxidation of membrane fatty acids girotti 1998 imlay et al 1988 valko et al 2005 as reported in previous studies oh derived from oxygenation of fe ii has an antimicrobial effect of against many bacteria and fungus dixon and stockwell 2014 secondly the oh produced can enhance the chemical sulfide oxidation rate the oh is a much stronger oxidant than oxygen as evidenced by the 2 3 times higher chemical sulfide oxidation rate achieved in the group with fes and oxygen than the group with only oxygen fig 3 it is previously believed that oxygen is the oxidant for sulfide oxidation but this rate is relatively low and is usually utilized by many containmants in wastewater for example biological organic carbon oxidation could consume oxygen faster than the chemical sulfide oxidation rathnayake et al 2019 thus resulting in a low efficiency for sulfide oxidation in comparison the oh formed could preferentially oxidize sulfide as sulfide is highly reductive and react chemically with oh at a higher rate 1 5 1010 l mol 1 s 1 than many organic contaminants such as glucose 1 5 109 l mol 1 s 1 acetic acid 1 6 107 l mol 1 s 1 propionic acid 6 2 108 l mol 1 s 1 etc buxton et al 1988 based on this mechanism the presence of fes makes oxygen more efficient for chemical sulfide oxidation in addition to the chemical oxidation pathway oh may also enhance the biological oxidation of sulfide as shown by the increased relative abundance of sob in r3 previous studies also reported that oh has a different effect on different bacteria e g increasing the relative abundance of anaerolineaceae but decreasing that of nistrospiraeceae and geobacteraceae in sediments ma et al 2019 more importantly oh could be continuously produced at the oxic anoxic sediment interface because fes can be regenerated due to the continuous reduction and precipitation of fe iii by the sulfide produced in sewer sediments thus oh induced enhancement of sulfide control is sustained 3 7 implications for sewer management advanced oxidation of fes in sediments is an important process affecting biogeochemical cycles and the oh formed leads to different contaminant remediation in various systems han et al 2020 huang et al 2021 wang et al 2017 2022 this study for the first time reports the advanced oxidation of fes in sewer systems which presents a new opportunity to control h2s in sewer networks with iron solution dosed the formed fes nanoparticles are expected to deposit in sewer sediments which when oxidised leads to the production of oh that inhibits sulfidogenic activity and promotes sulfide oxidation indeed the oxygen air injection is a very widely applied approach to control h2s rising mains where a pressure is maintained however an unaddressed critical challenge associated with oxygen air injection is the limited efficiency of oxygen for h2s control previous studies have shown that the sulfide removal was only 6 1 0 4 mg s l when oxygen injection was 15 25 mg o2 l gutierrez et al 2008 suggesting that oxygen utilization efficiency i e the ratio of h2s removed to oxygen was in the range of 0 24 0 41 mg s mg o2 in our long term results oxygen supply 7 mg o2 l combined with a very low dosage of iron salts 4 6 mg fe2 l in theory removing 2 6 mg s l reduced the sulfide by 11 mg s l representing an oxygen utilization efficiency of up to 1 2 mg s mg o2 i e 3 5 times higher than reported this result suggests a dramatic saving in energy to provide oxygen into sewer networks again underpinning the significance and practical relevance of the present study notably despite the absence of sediments in pressure sewers biofilms have been shown to be effective at absorbing ferrous iron which is expected to play a same role in sulfide control moreover regarding the gravity sewer pipes which are partially filled and operate under normal atmospheric conditions the injection of air is more common which could be achieved through ventilation or bubble aeration gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 a potential challenge in gravity sewers is whether fes nanoparticles can be deposited effectively in sewer sediments in some locations with large wastewater velocity to ensure a high fes concentration on sediment surface one solution is adding large fes particles directly to the sediment which is expected to rapidly improve sewer sulfide control via fes advanced oxidation process in sediments while this work mainly focused on the sulfide control in sewers through in situ advanced oxidation of fes the produced oh may also potentially contribute to the remediation of other chemical and biological contaminants in sewage sufficient evidence has shown that oh is effective in degrading various micropollutants and inactivating antibiotic resistant bacteria ahmed et al 2021 frey et al 2010 he et al 2019 for instance the doses of 0 6 mm of h2o2 and 0 18 mm of fe ii led to a 6 log reduction of colistin resistant escherichia coli s115 giannakis et al 2018 however further studies are needed to investigate the impacts of oh generated through fes oxidation moreover recent studies have found that the oxidation of other substances besides fes such as dissolved organic matter dom and sulfide may also induce oh production lombardo et al 2020 page et al 2013 which needs to be further explored in sewer systems finally the optimization strategies to maximize oh production will also require more investigation for example the selection of optimal dosage level of iron salts do level and different types of iron salts such as ferric chloride and ferrous carbonate hu et al 2023 it is important to determine the dosage limit of iron salts to maintain good sulfide control performance while minimizing economic costs and potential environmental impacts 4 conclusions in summary this study proposes and demonstrates a new approach for effective sulfide control in sewers by generating hydroxyl radical oh in situ via advanced oxidation of fes in sewer sediments the main conclusions are as follows in the experimental reactor with air injection combined with ferrous dosing the formation of fes makes oxygen more efficiency for sulfide control with a substantially reduced sulfide level of 3 1 1 8 mg s l much lower than those in control reactors the enhancement of sulfide control in the experimental reactor is induced by simultaneous sulfide oxidation and reduction of microbial sulfate reducing activity in sewer sediments the oh production rate of sewer sediments in the experimental reactor was about 0 28 µm min much higher than those in control reactors 0 15 and 0 16 µm min notes the authors declare no competing financial

14739,there has been a significant increase in antimicrobial agents aas usage globally however the relative consumption is unevenly distributed between nations inappropriate use of antibiotics can harbour inherent antimicrobial resistance amr therefore it is important to understand and monitor community wide prescribing and consumption behaviours throughout different communities around the world wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a novel tool enabling low cost and large scale studies focussed on aa usage patterns the back calculation of community antimicrobial intake was performed

efficacy of the calculation mass per day measurements were normalised to the catchment area via population estimates municipal wastewater treatment plant population estimates were used to normalise the wastewater samples and prescription data mg day 1000 inhabitants population estimates for the informal settlements were less accurate due to a lack of reliable sources that were relevant to the sampling time period both mass loads and normalised loads suggested higher than average usage throughout the settlements relative to municipal wastewater this was seen most prominently in emtricitabine and lamivudine but also sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim sulfadiazine clindamycin ciprofloxacin ofloxacin and doxycycline urban water fingerprinting uwf data triangulation with prescription datasets showed good correlations for several antimicrobial agents aas e g clindamycin clarithromycin ofloxacin and doxycycline it also revealed discrepancies in usage for some compounds e g tetracycline and sulfapyridine this might be linked with a lack of pharma compliance in prescription datasets erroneous association of prescription boundaries with the sewerage catchment and or uncertainties within the sewerage catchment e g population estimations the uwf tool provided a comprehensive overview of multiclass aas usage both prescription and over the counter for example tetracycline was not reported in available prescription statistics but was detected at an average of 18 4 mg day 1000inh and no antiviral prescriptions were obtained but emtricitabine and lamivudine were quantified at 2415 4 and 144 4 mg day 1000inh respectively a lack of clarity regarding prescriptions and a lack of inclusion of several critical often over the counter medications in public

antibiotics antifungals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the usage of antimicrobial agents aas is important to monitor in respect to the rising prevalence of drug tolerance inappropriate use of antibiotics can harbour inherent antimicrobial resistance amr therefore it is important to understand and monitor these prescribing and consumption behaviours regulations throughout different communities around the world there has been a significant increase in antibiotic usage globally however the relative consumption is not evenly distributed between nations for instance between 2000 and 2010 76 of the aa consumption increase was attributed to just five countries brazil russia india china and south africa van boeckel et al 2014 pharmaceutical prescription data is often not publicly available or even collated between pharmacies clinics the added complexity of private versus public prescription datasets as well as non prescription sourcing of aas constitutes a problem especially in low to middle income countries lmics this makes the monitoring and evaluation of aa usage in an area more difficult wastewater based epidemiology wbe is an approach that monitors biomarkers in wastewater treatment plants wwtps either in the absence or in support of prescription records kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 rice et al 2020 yan et al 2019 baz lomba et al 2016 escolà casas et al 2021 oosterhuis et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021 lai et al 2011 boogaerts et al 2019 the daily intake of individual aas has previously been calculated using wbe parameters described in a previous publication kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 in communities with informal dwellings considerations must be made for the proportion of individuals without sufficient safe and convenient access to sanitation facilities western cape government 2021 statistics sa 2016 stellenbosch municipality 2012 holton et al 2022 the who estimated that 1 7 billion people lacked access to basic sanitation globally in 2020 who 2021 while in south africa 10 9 of households lacked access to improved sanitation by 2018 however sanitation facilities in south african informal settlements are typically shared leading residents to forego the use thereof due to safety concerns statistics sa 2018 additionally many informal dwellings still form part of the urban community but with limited access to water and sanitation infrastructure consequently two problems emerge 1 poor living conditions and sanitation may lead to a higher dependence on pharmaceutical use such as broad spectrum antibiotics and 2 that wbe studies that only focus on wwtps may not accurately reflect drug consumption rates of the whole community due to some individuals that do not contribute waste to the facility consequently the definition of wbe in this study has been extended to urban water fingerprinting uwf to include the monitoring of samples collected in the receiving environment such as in downstream locations of informal settlements where effluent waste is not destined for wwtps this should enable a more representative evaluation of community drug consumption in lmic settings having highly polar socio economic circumstances and where epidemiological data may be limited however additional parameters must be calculated and the associated uncertainties evaluated namely concentrations of chemical markers the determination of analyte concentration in urban waters can be achieved using the same lc ms methods as in wastewater however river water is expected to be more dilute have a lower mass loading than wastewater to improve the sensitivity of the method larger volumes can be processed per sample increasing the extent of preconcentration during solid phase extraction wastewater and surface water flow rates receiving water flows may be harder to obtain than for wastewater gauge stations and hydrological models can be utilised where permanent flow meters are not practical populations estimates population estimates can be difficult to calculate for informal settlements they are often more dynamic communities with different demographics to the average formal household and an expectation for greater inter and intra annual variation proportional analyte excretion rates excretion profiles are not expected to be significantly different between communities however relative need access and consumption behaviour may vary river samples have higher environmental exposure leading to increased likelihood of thermal photo analyte degradation infrastructure the variation in infrastructure and access to sanitation is of significant note dissemination of infectious disease can be amplified in regions of high population density insufficient sanitation facilities leading to improper disposal of untreated waste is also likely to result in more frequent outbreaks of disease a case study for a longitudinal uwf campaign was designed in the town of stellenbosch located in the western cape province of south africa the town was selected due to its broad socioeconomic and infrastructural diversity holton et al 2022 the town is host to several informal settlements that are known to contribute urban runoff into surrounding rivers using validated analytical methods and analyte excretion data obtained from a systematic literature review antimicrobial consumption was calculated from both wastewater and receiving water samples these results were evaluated against local prescription records 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

samples were obtained from stellenbosch wastewater treatment plant wwtp on 42 dates between july 2018 may 2019 figure s4 wastewater influent was collected using 24 h time proportional composite samplers with 15 min sub sample collection receiving water samples downstream of the informal settlement were collected via grab sampling the informal settlement sampling site was in a non perennial stream average flow 28 2 ml day holton et al 2022 located downstream from a discharge point coming from a major informal settlement in the study area this sampling location did not have any wwtp discharge further upstream therefore any measurements came from direct discharge rather than wwtp discharge the average stream flow was calculated to be 28 2 41 4 ml day july 2018 june 2019 with a maximum modelled flow of 366 6 ml day july 2018 and a minimum of 1 3 ml day april 2019 compared to the wwtp receiving an average of 14 5 2 8 ml day this site was a much more dynamic system with large

and quality assurance approaches in the catchment study can be found elsewhere holton et al 2022 holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 holton et al 2022 2 3 antimicrobial intake calculation analysis via uplc ms ms provides analyte concentrations mg l 1 in water samples comprehensive analyte concentrations were calculated by spiking with internal standard prior to filtration this methodology should largely account for both liquid and suspended particulate matter fractions as the sorption to solids should be consistent between the analyte and its internal standard however further work might be required for more hydrophobic aas in the context of their sorption to solids the calculation of population normalised daily intake from initial analyte concentration is outlined in eqs 1 5 with all associated terminology described throughout each metabolite of a drug could be used in this back calculation therefore subscript distinctions are made in the equations between the aa parent drug and the specific analyte parent drug or transformed metabolite daily mass loads dl mg day 1 were determined by correcting for average daily flow rate ml day 1 eq 1 flow rates were provided by the municipal operators at stellenbosch wwtp for influent wastewater river flows downstream of the informal settlement were calculated via a hydrological model urmod fidal and kjeldsen 2020 urmod is a deterministic lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model that was used to simulate the river runoff for the eerste river catchment the model was calibrated using gauged sites within the catchment to provide context to the specific catchment community population estimates inhabitants inh are used in the calculation of population normalised datasets eqs 2 and 6 eqs 4 and 5 describe the use of correction factors cf to determine drug consumption daily intake di the cfs use excretion data from a systematic literature review holton et al 2022 and molecular weights to account for metabolism

prescription data used pe ww in the conversion as pndp should represent the whole catchment community the veterinary records were only presented in figures in g day as there was no associated population 2 3 1 population equivalent estimation a comprehensive evaluation of the various population estimates was discussed in a previous publication holton et al 2022 the monitoring campaign was not conducted during a census year sampling from july 2018 to may 2019 where the most recent census had occurred in 2011 however annual socio economic profiles published by the western cape government provided a detailed database for intermediate years the documents include information on demographics education health poverty services safety economy and infrastructure the population estimates quoted in these documents are for the greater stellenbosch municipality 186 187k western cape government 2018 western cape government 2019 whereas the wwtp eerste river catchment sampling involved only stellenbosch town therefore the wwtp population estimate pe ww was favourable for calculation of pndp pndl ww and pndi ww 2018 176 523 and 2019 179 463 holton et al 2022 the northwest of the town hosts the largest population of individuals living in informal housing these constitute both informal settlements as well as dwellings situated in the backyards of formal housing other smaller settlements were not specifically monitored as the contribution into the river systems was not thought to be significant in total it was estimated that approximately thirty thousand people were living in informal dwellings during 2018 19 pe is throughout these settlements limited sanitation facilities were available however for many toilets were located far away 0 5 km for 360 households in 2012 or considered unsafe to visit particularly at night stellenbosch municipality 2012 consequently a lot of urban wastewaters would be discarded and enter downstream rivers waste from an estimated 6 12k people entered the plankenbrug river per day during the sampling period pe riv 12k holton et al 2022 this pe riv upper estimate was used in the calculation of pndl riv and pndi riv pndp values were only calculated using pe ww as it was not possible to distinguish where in the catchment a prescription might have been consumed overall the sum of pndi ww and pndi riv should equal the pndp per antimicrobial however exceptions and uncertainties result in dissonance between these values these variables are discussed in section 2 4 2 3 2 drug excretion correction factors cfs antibiotics are metabolised and excreted from the body via drug specific mechanisms an extensive literature review conducted by holton et al holton et al 2022 collated experimental results for the percentage excretion of drugs and metabolites via urine and faeces this was achieved through a literature searching protocol consisting of 1 systematically obtaining a pharmacokinetic literature pool 2 including excluding papers based on experimental design via title and abstract 3 including excluding based on data in the main text 4 calculating analyte weighted means medians the resultant dataset was used to calculate correction factors cfs in order to determine the original quantity of drug mass consumed si table s5 7 the accuracy of these cfs was validated using a uk wastewater influent dataset against the corresponding daily catchment prescription data dp holton et al 2022 2 3 3 prescription data prescription datasets were obtained for the catchment region via a retrospective records review of four private pharmacies four state clinics and the provincial hospital located in town and the surrounding suburban areas louw and louw 2021 the mass of active ingredient dispensed was used in all calculations it is predicted that the records are representative of the antibiotic use by inhabitants relying on public healthcare including outpatients and inpatients as the sources covered all state healthcare facilities in the area furthermore we expect the inhabitants of the informal settlement and thus the data from the river to be almost completely reliant on the public healthcare system the dataset see tables s8 s10 is only partially representative of the antibiotic use by patients utilising private healthcare as the sources do not include all private pharmacies in the area or the private hospital 4 of 9 are represented the dataset includes the quantities of antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of both household pets and livestock animals the evaluation of the uwf data separates the prescriptions for human recipients state and hospital clinics private pharmacies and for animals veterinary clinics it is not expected that significant proportions of animal waste would reach the wwtp or river systems however small quantities may be washed into sewage pipes via storm drains and into rivers via urban land runoff 2 4 experimental uncertainties for each stage of the methodology the experimental features and limitations were considered these are discussed throughout table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 eerste river stellenbosch catchment the eerste river catchment with both wwtp and informal settlement sampling sites is shown in figure s4 aa specific trends are displayed in fig 1 fig 2 as well as in figures s5 s35 municipal stellenbosch wwtp wastewater was found to contain a wider range of aas at higher concentrations daily loads especially in macrolides quinolones and b lactams for example clr clarithromycin is found at an average of 0 16 g day in informal settlement site and 5 09 g day in wwtp influent this was expected as wwtp wastewater represents 178k inhabitants in contrast settlement wastewater represents aa usage by approximately 6 12k inhabitants interestingly the mass loads of antiretrovirals e g lamivudine 8 4 g day in informal settlement wastewater vs 16 9 g day in wwtp wastewater influent were much closer between sites indicating a significantly higher usage throughout the settlements see holton et al 2022 for further discussion seasonality of antibiotic consumption is often observed due to higher incidence of illness during winter months indeed temporal trends exhibited reduced daily loads during the summer to early autumn in general tb associated drugs and antiretrovirals were some of the most prevalent aas and their presence was season independent sulfonamides and trimethoprim with the next highest prevalence observed much higher seasonality yet considerations must be made regarding seasonal analyte degradation both thermal and photolytic due to climate variations therefore distinctions between behaviour and climate based seasonal patterns can be established if a trend is observed in both wastewater and waterways more likely behavioural or only in waterways more likely climatic the spatiotemporal trends were discussed per drug class in a previous publication holton et al 2022 briefly arvs ftc emtricitabine and 3tc lamivudine were the most prevalent drugs throughout the monitoring campaign wwtp wastewater influent average daily loads 226 2 109 5 and 16 9 8 7 g day respectively followed by tuberculosis drugs wwtp average daily loads 11 6 33 2 g day and sulfonamides wwtp average daily loads 14 7 23 4 g day the average daily loads for tb related drug at informal settlement wastewater and wwtp influent were 5 2 13 5 11 6 33 2 respectively the average daily loads for the arvs at informal settlement and wwtp were 96 5 106 7 121 5 131 7 g day respectively the quinolone average daily loads at informal settlement and wwtp were 0 29 0 67 and 1 1 2 6 g day respectively with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin being the most prevalent the macrolide average daily loads at the informal settlement and wwtp were 0 21 0 35 2 2 4 9 g day respectively with azithromycin being the most prevalent the sulfonamide average daily loads at informal settlement and wwtp were 4 6 11 3 14 7 23 4 g day respectively with sulfamethoxazole being the most prevalent ceftriaxone and cefalexin were the most prevalent amongst the cephalosporins and doxycycline was the most prevalent amongst the cyclines holton et al 2022 3 1 1 evaluation of prescription records in general prescribed aas were detected at the two sampling sites of the wwtp and informal settlement wastewaters prescription data both human and veterinary were obtained for most of the target aas with a few exceptions slz sulfasalazine 3tc lamivudine ftc emitricitabine and tet tetracycline interestingly these four drugs and their metabolites e g spy sulfapyridine and aspy n acetylsulfapyridine that were absent from prescription datasets were also consistently detected throughout the sampling period at both sites this may be explained by the fact that the prescription records used are not complete for the catchment and so may account for the discordance between some datasets where the calculated daily intake di exceeds the daily prescription dp private healthcare facilities operate independently of the public sector and no central publicly accessible repository or platform exists to access aa sales the incomplete nature of the dataset is not ideal and limits the extent of analysis possible but also reflects the reality of lmics currently and in the foreseeable future this reality affects prescription drug monitoring strategies in all low resource settings and highlights wbes potential for impact additionally there may be other sources of these drugs that are not obtained via prescription there were no supplementary prescription data for spy a veterinary antibiotic four of the prescription drugs were also only prescribed in veterinary centres tmp trimethoprim sdz sulfadiazine otc oxytetracycline and dox doxycycline ranging from 0 0025 to 4 22 g day with a median of 0 26 g day si table 9 enrofloxacin a veterinary prodrug of ciprofloxacin cip was also prescribed in the region this drug was recorded at an average of 1 01 g day 2 4 of the average quantity of ciprofloxacin prescribed 42 6 g day considering the low proportion of drug contaminated animal waste reaching the wwtp or specific river site as well as incomplete transformation to cip cester and toutain 1997 mengozzi et al 1996 guo et al 2010 it is unlikely that the prescribed levels of enrofloxacin would have notable impact on the wastewater measurement of cip as mentioned above both human and veterinary prescription data were captured once off retrospectively the distinction between drug content prescribed to humans and animals was displayed via dashed human and dotted animal red lines from fig 1 fig 2 in general contribution from veterinary prescription to the overall catchment prescription was low for example in the case for tmp trimethoprim and sdz sulfadiazine the proportion of drug prescribed in veterinary centres compared to the human prescribed mass was negligible average 0 5 and in the case of dox doxycycline was only 6 average per month in the case of otc oxytetracycline no prescriptions were made throughout the captured pharmacies 4 hospitals 1 and clinics 4 for the period of 2018 19 where all otc datapoints in the environmental sampling were calculated to be below the method s quantification and or detection limit 3 1 2 estimation of community aa intake di versus dp community wide aa intake was estimated in both sewer connected communities via wwtp influent measurements as well as in surface waters that receive untreated wastewater from surrounding informal settlements aa concentrations were normalised to wastewater flows to reduce variabilities from ever changing often weather dependant water flows in the studied catchment south africa has notable rainfall and temperature changes that are driven by seasonality the wet jun nov and dry dec may seasons see holton et al 2022 for further details in order to assess the efficacy of wbe back calculations and established correction factors accounting of human metabolism of aas to allow their intake calculation see our previous work for details holton et al 2022 the datasets were not initially normalised for population size the removal of this variable enabled better confidence in the cf evaluation this is due to higher uncertainties in establishing population equivalents pe in informal settlements vs more robust measurements of pe applied to sewer connected communities in fig 1 fig 2 as well as figures s5 s35 it is clear how the application of the analyte cf increases the estimation of daily mass loads of aas briefly daily loads dls blue display the wbe data corrected for flow rate the correction factor back calculates to drug intake di green by accounting for percentage metabolite excretion per analyte however there is some uncertainty associated with the calculation of di as discussed in section 2 4 and table 1 per analyte the median upper and lower quartile dis were calculated as well as inclusion of standard deviation between uwf replicates only the median di values from ww samples are discussed in this section unless specified discussion for individual aas can be found below 3 1 2 1 sulfamethoxazole smx and asmx in this study the sa dataset the acetyl metabolite suggests consistently lower human intake di asmx 38 4 24 7 g day relative to the available prescription data for the region dp smx 334 7 129 6 g day fig 3 and fig s5 s6 comparatively the unchanged drug form appears to provide higher intake estimates di smx 411 1 279 8 g day this result is in opposition to our published uk study holton et al 2022 where asmx was determined as expected to produce the best estimation of di the underestimation of di asmx and disparity between studies could in part be explained by lower thermal stability of this analyte holton et al 2022 where the concordance of di asmx and dp smx was poorest during the hotter months namely november january and february in the sa study area interestingly an extensive one year longitudinal study in two uk cities confirmed that smx asmx ratio was consistent across both studied catchment areas at 2 40 1 23 and 2 52 1 96 for bath and keynsham but significant temporal variability was observed in the time series sims et al 2023 the lack of concordance between daily intake of smx and available prescription data can most likely be attributed to the limitations of the sa prescription dataset as opposed to the sa dataset that was assembled by our research team the uk national dataset is publicly available via uk national health service it provides comprehensive and high resolution monthly prescription statistics by postcode location that resulted in high concordance of daily prescription of aas with their wbe estimated daily intake therefore in sa and other countries worldwide particularly lmics with limited prescription monitoring infrastructure prescription data cannot be used as an absolute indicator of aa usage the challenges are exacerbated by general issues related to prescription vs consumption vs excretion in the catchment area for this reason wbe can provide a timely and cost effective alternative to the current inability to estimate aa usage in low resource settings or countries and regions without access to prescription usage data 3 1 2 2 trimethoprim tmp and htmp only a very small proportion of htmp is excreted in urine and or faeces 4 it was found to not be suitable for the calculation of di due to underestimation di htmp 2 5 of dp tmp this was largely due to analytical inaccuracies associated with detection levels near the method limit of quantification di via trimethoprim in the unchanged form was more concordant to dp but also appears to be an underestimation di tmp in ww 23 8 8 5 g day and dp tmp 66 9 25 9 g day fig 1 3 s7 s9 recovery and stability of this analyte is high according to method validation holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 therefore this result is currently unexplained likely linked as in the case of smx sulfamethoxazole with our low confidence in the completeness of the sa prescription dataset available further work is required to understand the most probable reasons prescription dispensing out of catchment consumption biomarker excretion however dp tmp average indicates high variability in prescription which might impact the average value for the study period 3 1 2 3 sulfadiazine sdz and asdz in the informal settlement samples two high detection anomalies are observed for sulfadiazine during the september october sampling campaign this pattern was not observed in the metabolite asdz this combination of a lack of metabolite and the higher rainfall measured during this sampling month suggests these spikes could be the result of unused pharmaceutical disposal rather than consumption however asdz has been seen to suffer from high chromatographic interference therefore the lack of detection may be due to reduced sensitivity rather than absence this reduced sensitivity also resulted in asdz being less suitable for the calculation of di and so in this dataset unchanged sdz was selected fig 3 s10 s11 although sdz performed well over 50 samples were below the instrumental limit of detection and 4 7 of the data were below the limit of quantification included in a semi quantitative nature the example of a potential wbe captured sdz direct disposal event provides critical evidence for wider applicability of wbe in comprehensive verification of aa intake vs disposal this cannot be achieved with prescription datasets informing of prescription only and being unable to provide further critical evidence of patient compliance including consumption vs disposal routes of unconsumed aas further information on wbe based verification of pharma disposal can be found elsewhere kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 3 1 2 4 sulfasalazine slz spy aspy no prescription data was obtained for sulfasalazine nor sulfapyridine veterinary use only yet all three associated analytes were detected at both sites throughout the sampling period sources for these drugs may include clinics outside of the catchment or those not captured in the dataset this shows superiority of wbe as an epidemiology tool vs prescription data dues to its ability to capture real usage of aas in the catchment large variation was observed in the estimation of di between the three analytes di slz 17 6 21 3 g day di spy 90 0 56 5 g day and di aspy 23 1 12 4 g day fig 3 s12 slz was calculated to have the lowest recovery and stability and therefore not favoured in the absence of prescription data spy and aspy cannot be quantitively compared for accuracy the spatiotemporal trends are very similar between the two but spy estimated more than twice the daily slz consumption the datapoint validation was stronger for spy and thus was the favoured choice for wbe based estimates of slz intake 3 1 2 5 metronidazole mtz and hmtz the spatiotemporal concordance between the analytes at both sites particularly in sept oct and may si figures s15 s16 suggest the trends were due to consumption the mtz anomalies observed in july and november were not mirrored in hmtz suggesting potential disposal events of unused mtz other than these events both analytes produced lower intake estimates di mtz 16 7 20 4 g day and di hmtz 5 0 2 6 g day relative to daily prescriptions dp mtz 65 9 10 5 g day fig 3 s15 16 3 1 2 6 clindamycin cli and dmcli the unchanged form cli suffered from chromatographic interference resulting in comparatively low signal to noise across most samples the method sensitivity and selectivity were much higher in dmcli and was therefore the favoured analyte for the estimation of di the data did however show good concordance with dp in both analytes di cli 3 8 3 8 g day di dmcli 7 4 13 1 g day dp cli 2 9 0 9 g day fig 3 s17 19 3 1 2 7 clarithromycin clr and dmclr conversely clr is seen to perform better than dmclr di dmclr 47 7 26 7 g day fig 3 s20 21 the uwf duplicate concordance and correlation to prescriptions dp clr 8 4 2 5 g day was much stronger in clr di clr 14 3 8 9 g day 3 1 2 8 ciprofloxacin cip and decip the unchanged form cip was selected as the favoured analyte and performed reasonably well di cip 19 1 11 3 g day dp cip 44 7 16 9 g day fig 2 and 3 s22 23 the proportional excretion of decip is very low 1 4 detection is therefore expected to be low likely around the assay sensitivity threshold methodological error will have higher proportional impact on low prevalence analytes such as this this may lead to overestimation further amplified when the correction factor is applied di decip 281 7 386 0 g day the mass loads of decip dl decip 3 7 5 0 g day before correction perform better this could suggest that the proportional excretion of decip is higher than stated in literature ciprofloxacin is a metabolite of the antibiotic enrofloxacin no metabolism excretion literature was identified for enrofloxacin during the systematic review holton et al 2022 however enrofloxacin is only prescribed for use in animals and so the occurrence of cip in ww influent as a metabolite of enrofloxacin is expected to be negligible furthermore the prescription of enrofloxacin per month was on average only 2 9 of prescribed cip 3 1 2 9 ofloxacin including levofloxacin ofx dmofx and ofxo all three analytes are detected throughout the sampling duration and at both sites ofx is favoured for calculation of di di ofx 3 6 2 4 g day as the other two are excreted proportionally low 3 56 dmofx and 1 00 oofx which may lead to sporadic detection or overestimation di dmofx 4 4 11 6 g day and di ofxo 21 2 39 1 g day relative to prescriptions dp ofx 9 0 1 6 g day fig 3 s24 s26 3 1 2 10 norfloxacin nor and hnor norfloxacin was prescribed at 0 5 g day throughout the sampling period for less commonly prescribed antimicrobials calculating averaged daily prescribed mass may not be representative of the consumption behaviour the sporadic nature of the uwf data suggests norfloxacin may have been prescribed in fewer short courses as with the other quinolones the extremely low proportion of hnor excreted in urine 0 05 might result in amplified estimations of di di hnor 42 5 191 2 g day fig 3 s27 s28 3 1 2 11 antiretrovirals 3tc lamivudine and ftc emtricitabine no prescription data was obtained for either of the antiretrovirals arvs due to the collection methodology yet large quantities were detected at both sites for example ftc was found to be the most prevalent its di reached 665 0 g day whereas 3tc was detected at lower levels with dis spanning from 0 to 90 1 g day this was expected because arvs are used in the treatment of hiv aids an infection of high prevalence in south africa and on the larger african continent from which south africa has the highest arv treatment programme in the world published socio economic profiles for stellenbosch quote the number of registered patients in arv treatment programmes as 6064 and 6960 for 2018 and 2019 respectively western cape government 2020 no information on treatment regimens were included in the report and so could not be added to the prescription dataset there is also the likelihood that high arv usage is prevalent in communities from low socio economic settings i e living in informal settings where domestic waste including sewage will be directly discharged into surrounding surface water settings as observed for the current study uwf therefore provides an important source of information of usage patterns not accessible by other epidemiology tools or where data is limited the spatiotemporal concordance of the two drugs was very strong suggesting either co prescribing or significant temporal disease consumption behaviour fig s29 s30 3 1 2 12 oxytetracycline otc no human prescription records were obtained for oxytetracycline in parallel very few samples were detected above the method limit of quantification during the study period fig s31 suggesting low usage patterns of this drug in the study area 3 1 2 13 tetracycline tet neither veterinary nor human prescription data was obtained for tet however relatively large quantities were detected in wastewater consequently uwf data was the only means to estimate daily usage indicating an importance and utility of the tool dls for ww and receiving waters denoted 0 1 0 9 and 1 6 2 0 g day respectively whereby estimated dis were 0 2 1 3 and 2 5 3 1 g day respectively fig s32 although prescription data for tet was not obtained its broad spectrum use for bacterial infections in both human and veterinary medicine is well known and thus conforms to the large quantity of tet recorded in the wastewater samples for the current study to some extent 3 1 2 14 doxycycline dox the correction factor for dox appears to have performed well despite the large standard deviations within uwf replicates the sum of ww and informal settlement di aligns to the average daily prescribed mass dl denoted 1 4 3 2 g day and di 1 7 3 9 g day whereas dp was 8 0 1 6 g day the mass prescribed for veterinary use 0 4 0 2 g day is added as red dotted lines fig 2 fig s33 the small relative quantity 5 of the human prescriptions would have negligible impact should any of the treated animals waste enter the waterways 3 1 2 15 nitrofurantoin nit and npahd the unchanged nit form was observed to have very low stability in wastewater during method validation 16 22 of analyte recovered after 24 h holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 it is therefore not favoured for the calculation of di the metabolite npahd was significantly more stable at 4 c 78 but degraded rapidly at 20 c 24 holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 consequently a more consistent mass of npahd was measured throughout the wastewater samples with slowed degradation rates within chilled composite samplers relative to river grab samples less mass was measured during hotter summer months particularly jan feb this temporal trend may be due to increased analyte degradation and or decreased nit consumption no literature data was found for the percentage excretion of npahd therefore di could not be calculated and only daily mass loads are quoted fig s34 overall the comparisons of analyte di and aa dp are outlined in fig 3 3 1 3 comparison of municipal and informal settlement aa usage estimates select results from both municipal and informal settlement wastewater polluted surface waters allowed for the comparison of aa usage patterns in formal housing communities as well as informal communities where waste products are directly discharged into surrounding surface waters thus providing a more comprehensive overview of wbe in urban settings where the entire community is not connected to sewage infrastructure these results are gathered in fig 1 fig 2 as well as figures s5 s35 again the datasets are interpreted without the added uncertainty of normalisation from the respective population estimates comparisons are made from g day whereby the expectation may be that the mass originating from informal settlements would be populationally proportional to the antimicrobial mass entering the wwtp the total number of individuals living in informal housing was estimated to be approximately one sixth of the catchment population holton et al 2022 however most of that population is said to have at least partial access to sanitation facilities the upper estimate for the number of individuals contributing waste into the plankenbrug river was 12k pe riv this estimate is about one fifteenth the size of the whole study catchment area despite this many antimicrobials were detected in much higher quantities in informal settlements than a 1 15 ratio in particular smx sulfamethoxazole 1 0 3 0 sdz sulfadiazine 1 0 0 3 mtz metronidazole 1 0 3 0 cli clindamycin 1 0 3 1 3tc lamivudine 1 0 2 0 ftc emtricitabine 1 0 1 2 ofx ofloxacin 1 0 0 7 and dox doxycycline 1 0 2 1 were measured at higher levels than expected the mass of ftc in informal settlement often exceeded that in municipal wwtp wastewater these results support a theory of a large disparity in antimicrobial consumption between the two communities higher per capita antimicrobial usage in informal settlements is likely in higher density populations particularly those with insufficient sanitation infrastructure moreover antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are given as prophylaxis in arv treatment programmes thus partly explaining the high smx detection in the surface water setting where a high level of arv drugs were also detected throughout the study furthermore analyte degradation and metabolite transformation within closed municipal sewers is unlikely to be higher in sewers when compared to runoff from informal settlements these are however analyte specific and subject to environmental factors for example fluoroquinolones are vulnerable to photochemical processes despite the above mentioned uncertainties areas for further research consideration wbe provides a unique opportunity to capture spatial and temporal usage trends in communities that are unlikely to be tested using conventional epidemiology approaches wbe s key role is to provide early warning to signal emerging community wide health related issues the above results indicate that widespread overuse of certain antimicrobials might trigger higher prevalence of resistant microorganisms in communities residing in the informal settlement further work is required to understand the phenomenon and trigger management strategies 3 1 4 evaluation of population estimates wastewater effluent from the sa settlement was studied which in combination with ww influent should have captured a near complete representation of the community see fig 4 8 stellenbosch population estimates 2018 19 for the wastewater treatment plant pe ww 176 179k and for the informal settlements pe is 30k pe riv 6 12k are discussed in detail in our previous publication holton et al 2022 the normalisation of data by contributing population size is a useful tool to enable per capita substance usage and consequently comparisons between catchments however the interpretation of these results is dependant on the accuracy of the population estimates this is in addition to accurate flow measurements allowing for daily loads calculations the pes calculated by wwtps are based on municipal census and household data and are often for very large number of residents pe ww 176 179k these estimates are considered accurate whereas the estimate for the total population in informal settlements was calculated from sporadic sources across a 7 year time period holton et al 2022 the population fluctuation inter and intra annually is often high making estimations increasingly difficult comparing wbe and prescription datasets with and without population normalisation can indicate the accuracy of the various population estimates si figure s36 there is an exact correlation between the g day and population normalised mg day 1000inh for the municipal influent wastewater because all datasets were normalised using pe ww however both pes applied to the informal settlement samples often calculated much higher pndis si fig s37 41 e g smx sulfamethoxazole tmp trimethoprim spy sulfapyridine mtz metronidazole cli clindamycin 3tc lamivudine ftc emtricitabine ofx ofloxacin and dox doxycycline this may be explained by 1 the incompleteness of prescription records obtained 2 a significant proportion of aas were obtained outside of the stellenbosch catchment from other sources incl online purchases 3 informal settlement inhabitants sourcing prescriptions in sewer connected communities 4 sourcing aas via non prescription also illegal routes 5 pe is 30k and pe riv 12k underestimations 6 errors from flow estimations as mentioned above wbe provides true and comprehensive information of community s aa usage patterns because it captures whole communities via wastewater they produce wbe provides superior information when compared with prescription dataset only however to fully appreciate advantages and limitations of both epidemiology tools and to gather the best possible understanding of community wide aa usage patterns it is recommended that both approaches are used as they complement each other figs 4 8 show population normalised daily loads pndl intake pndi and prescription pndp for the whole stellenbosch population including both infrastructure rich communities and those lacking infrastructure sumpndl and sumpndi it can be observed that both pndis and pndps for several aas show clear seasonality with high usage in the wet june november and low usage in the dry december may season this is especially pronounced in the case of sulfonamides and tmp trimethoprim macrolides cli clindamycin and clr clarithromycin fig 4 lower seasonal variability was observed with fluoroquinolones e g ofx ofloxacin or nor norfloxacin fig 5 interestingly mtz metronidazole observed high intake in september as estimated by using both parent drug and its metabolite fig 5 in contrast antiretrovirals being some of the most prevalent aas were found to be largely season independent fig 7 which conform to the usage pattern of these drugs requiring patients to consume the drugs daily in comparison to intermittent antibiotic consumption patterns in many cases pndis were estimated to be higher than pndps especially in high usage wet season months this is particularly pronounced in the case of smx sulfamethoxazole tmp trimethoprim ofx ofloxacin and mtz metronidazole fig 4 6 there are several potential reasons for this as explained above namely 1 higher catchment usage than the official prescription estimates 2 underreported prescription and dispensing in the catchment 3 underreported population size in si as well as 4 uncertainties around flow measurement and the extent of human metabolic vs microbial metabolism contributions despite these uncertainties figs 4 8 clearly show the power of wbe in capturing usage patterns of aas by whole communities that cannot be achieved by other existing epidemiology tools 3 2 comparison of two catchments southwest uk and stellenbosch sa the two regions southwest uk and stellenbosch sa were similar in size and function both affluent high prevalence of tourism and with large student populations the two largest differences were climate and presence of informal housing the wwtp in the uk catchment served approx 120 k people whereas in sa the wwtp estimated 178k holton et al 2022 holton et al 2022 in both catchments sewer overflows can result in the discharge of untreated waste into waterways this occurs during periods of rainfall where the influent volume exceeds the wwtp capacity however most human derived wastewaters in the uk catchment should enter the sewer system to be treated via the wwtp whereas in the sa campaign insufficient access to sanitation in local informal settlements causes significant proportions of grey water and waste black water to enter river systems that are situated close to the informal housing settings holton et al 2022 the acquisition and processing of prescription records was different between the two studies as well the data from the uk was obtained via comprehensive open access reports from nhs digital whereas sa did not have centralised collated records datasets were obtained and processed manually from individual clinics hospitals pharmacies and veterinary centres from within the eerste river catchment the prescription records in this study were thus not complete and so are used as a supportive indicator of daily consumption rather than as an absolute reference as well as variation in the reliability and completeness of prescription data consumption behaviour is also likely to differ between catchments due to the different nature of the health systems some explanations for the deviations between wastewater and prescription estimations are outlined in table 1 when comparing prescribing trends between the two regions it was crucial to account for the relative catchment sizes by calculating population normalised daily prescriptions pndp mg day 1000 inhabitants the observations therefore are dependant on the accuracy of the population estimates due to this uncertainty only the most significant differences should be considered for instance nitrofurantoin oxytetracycline and sulfasalazine were prescribed at significantly lower levels in the sa catchment than the uk region sims et al 2023 conversely the winter pndp sa of sulfamethoxazole 1207 3 mg day 1000inh was 12 times higher than winter pndp uk 94 7 mg day 1000inh table 2 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim often co prescribed are noted for their broad spectrum usage in sa alongside prophylactic administration in antiretroviral therapy programmes macrolides were most prevalent up to 10 times in the uk vs sa both in terms of pndp and pndis interestingly mtz metronidazole has higher pndp but lower pndi in sa vs uk a much higher usage of antiretrovirals ftc emtricitabine and 3tc lamivudine up to 10 times higher was also recorded in the sa study compared to the uk study this is of particular importance as no prescription usage databases exist to provide information of antiretrovirals usage quinolone usage is on average similar across the two catchments with high prevalence of cip ciprofloxacin in the uk and ofx ofloxacin in sa cyclines were found to have higher usage in the uk both in terms of pnpd and pndi with the highest prevalence recorded for otc oxytetracycline comparisons of pndis between the two catchments enabled behavioural distinctions to be made however significant climatic differences must be considered regarding photo and thermal analyte stability especially in the sa study site that include summer periods with high recorded temperatures followed by winter periods with low recorded temperatures consequently assessments between the winter months might be better to be prioritised table 2 this uwf approach is seen here to provide global surveillance of aa usage which is key to tackle amr especially in regions without access to comprehensive prescription datasets 4 conclusion the manuscript aimed to estimate usage of antimicrobial agents in the city of stellenbosch in two contrasting areas the main city with closed sewage collection system and adjacent wwtp and an informal settlement with runoff of untreated sewage to a local receiving stream moreover two epidemiology approaches were compared between the contrasting areas in the sa study and a similar campaign done in the uk namely prescription data and wbe analyses the main conclusions are as follows 1 the uwf tool utilising wbe pipelines provided a comprehensive overview of aa usage accounting for total drug mass in the region independent of prescription access compliance or movement of people 2 wbe data triangulation with prescription dataset showed good correlations for some aas particularly cli clindamycin clr clarithromycin ofx ofloxacin and dox doxycycline it also revealed discrepancies in usage for some compounds e g tet tetracycline and spy sulfapyridine which might be linked with lack of pharma compliance in prescription datasets patient compliance or analyte specific physical chemical properties 3 comparison of sewerage system connected community and informal settlement revealed much higher usage of antimicrobials in the informal settlement which is linked with much higher density of population incidence of disease and uncertainties around contributing population 4 the uwf monitoring identified antimicrobials usage not accounted for in official prescription statistics these include antiretrovirals ftc emtricitabine and 3tc lamivudine 5 lack of clarity regarding prescriptions and lack of inclusion of several critical often over the counter medications such as antiretrovirals in public health databases makes uwf as a useful and comprehensive epidemiology tool for tracking pharma usage 6 comparing uk and sa prescription and wbe datasets indicates higher prevalence of macrolides usage in the uk vs antiretrovirals usage in sa however further work is required to remove uncertainties linked with significant climatic differences impacting photo and thermal analyte stability in sa when compared to the uk climate 7 this uwf approach is seen here to provide global surveillance of aa usage which is key to tackle amr especially in regions without access to comprehensive prescription datasets author statement elisabeth holton

14739,there has been a significant increase in antimicrobial agents aas usage globally however the relative consumption is unevenly distributed between nations inappropriate use of antibiotics can harbour inherent antimicrobial resistance amr therefore it is important to understand and monitor community wide prescribing and consumption behaviours throughout different communities around the world wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a novel tool enabling low cost and large scale studies focussed on aa usage patterns the back calculation of community antimicrobial intake was performed from quantities measured in municipal wastewater and informal settlement discharge in the city of stellenbosch utilising wbe seventeen antimicrobials and their human metabolites were evaluated in concordance with prescription records corresponding to the catchment region the proportional excretion biological chemical stability and method recovery of each analyte were all crucial factors in the efficacy of the calculation mass per day measurements were normalised to the catchment area via population estimates municipal wastewater treatment plant population estimates were used to normalise the wastewater samples and prescription data mg day 1000 inhabitants population estimates for the informal settlements were less accurate due to a lack of reliable sources that were relevant to the sampling time period both mass loads and normalised loads suggested higher than average usage throughout the settlements relative to municipal wastewater this was seen most prominently in emtricitabine and lamivudine but also sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim sulfadiazine clindamycin ciprofloxacin ofloxacin and doxycycline urban water fingerprinting uwf data triangulation with prescription datasets showed good correlations for several antimicrobial agents aas e g clindamycin clarithromycin ofloxacin and doxycycline it also revealed discrepancies in usage for some compounds e g tetracycline and sulfapyridine this might be linked with a lack of pharma compliance in prescription datasets erroneous association of prescription boundaries with the sewerage catchment and or uncertainties within the sewerage catchment e g population estimations the uwf tool provided a comprehensive overview of multiclass aas usage both prescription and over the counter for example tetracycline was not reported in available prescription statistics but was detected at an average of 18 4 mg day 1000inh and no antiviral prescriptions were obtained but emtricitabine and lamivudine were quantified at 2415 4 and 144 4 mg day 1000inh respectively a lack of clarity regarding prescriptions and a lack of inclusion of several critical often over the counter medications in public health databases makes wbe a useful and comprehensive epidemiology tool for tracking pharma usage within a catchment graphical abstract wastewater based epidemiology to monitor antimicrobials usage in

antibiotics antifungals data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the usage of antimicrobial agents aas is important to monitor in respect to the rising prevalence of drug tolerance inappropriate use of antibiotics can harbour inherent antimicrobial resistance amr therefore it is important to understand and monitor these prescribing and consumption behaviours regulations throughout different communities around the world there has been a significant increase in antibiotic usage globally however the relative consumption is not evenly distributed between nations for instance between 2000 and 2010 76 of the aa consumption increase was attributed to just five countries brazil russia india china and south africa van boeckel et al 2014 pharmaceutical prescription data is often not publicly available or even collated between pharmacies clinics the added complexity of private versus public prescription datasets as well as non prescription sourcing of aas constitutes a problem especially in low to middle income countries lmics this makes the monitoring and evaluation of aa usage in an area more difficult wastewater based epidemiology wbe is an approach that monitors biomarkers in wastewater treatment plants wwtps either in the absence or in support of prescription records kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 rice et al 2020 yan et al 2019 baz lomba et al 2016 escolà casas et al 2021 oosterhuis et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021 lai et al 2011 boogaerts et al 2019 the daily intake of individual aas has previously been calculated using wbe parameters described in a previous publication kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 in communities with informal dwellings considerations must be made for the proportion of individuals without sufficient safe and convenient access to sanitation facilities western cape government 2021 statistics sa 2016 stellenbosch municipality 2012 holton et al 2022 the who estimated that 1 7 billion people lacked access to basic sanitation globally in 2020 who 2021 while in south africa 10 9 of households lacked access to improved sanitation by 2018 however sanitation facilities in south african informal settlements are typically shared leading residents to forego the use thereof due to safety concerns statistics sa 2018 additionally many informal dwellings still form part of the urban community but with limited access to water and sanitation infrastructure consequently two problems emerge 1 poor living conditions and sanitation may lead to a higher dependence on pharmaceutical use such as broad spectrum antibiotics and 2 that wbe studies that only focus on wwtps may not accurately reflect drug consumption rates of the whole community due to some individuals that do not contribute waste to the facility consequently the definition of wbe in this study has been extended to urban water fingerprinting uwf to include the monitoring of samples collected in the receiving environment such as in downstream locations of informal settlements where effluent waste is not destined for wwtps this should enable a more representative evaluation of community drug consumption in lmic settings having highly polar socio economic circumstances and where epidemiological data may be limited however additional parameters must be calculated and the associated uncertainties evaluated namely concentrations of chemical markers the determination of analyte concentration in urban waters can be achieved using the same lc ms methods as in wastewater however river water is expected to be more dilute have a lower mass loading than wastewater to improve the sensitivity of the method larger volumes can be processed per sample increasing the extent of preconcentration during solid phase extraction wastewater and surface water flow rates receiving water flows may be harder to obtain than for wastewater gauge stations and hydrological models can be utilised where permanent flow meters are not practical populations estimates population estimates can be difficult to calculate for informal settlements they are often more dynamic communities with different demographics to the average formal household and an expectation for greater inter and intra annual variation proportional analyte excretion rates excretion profiles are not expected to be significantly different between communities however relative need access and consumption behaviour may vary river samples have higher environmental exposure leading to increased likelihood of thermal photo analyte degradation infrastructure the variation in infrastructure and access to sanitation is of significant note dissemination of infectious disease can be amplified in regions of high population density insufficient sanitation facilities leading to improper disposal of untreated waste is also likely to result in more frequent outbreaks of disease a case study for a longitudinal uwf campaign was designed in the town of stellenbosch located in the western cape province of south africa the town was selected due to its broad socioeconomic and infrastructural diversity holton et al 2022 the town is host to several informal settlements that are known to contribute urban runoff into surrounding rivers using validated analytical methods and analyte excretion data obtained from a systematic literature

samplers with 15 min sub sample collection receiving water samples downstream of the informal settlement were collected via grab sampling the informal settlement sampling site was in a non perennial stream average flow 28 2 ml day holton et al 2022 located downstream from a discharge point coming from a major informal settlement in the study area this sampling location did not have any wwtp discharge further upstream therefore any measurements came from direct discharge rather than wwtp discharge the average stream flow was calculated to be 28 2 41 4 ml day july 2018 june 2019 with a

uplc ms ms provides analyte concentrations mg l 1 in water samples comprehensive analyte concentrations were calculated by spiking with internal standard prior to filtration this methodology should largely account for both liquid and suspended particulate matter fractions as the sorption to solids should be consistent between the analyte and its internal standard however further work might be required for more hydrophobic aas in the context of their sorption to solids the calculation of population normalised daily intake from initial analyte concentration is outlined in eqs 1 5 with all associated terminology described throughout each metabolite of a drug could be used in this back calculation therefore subscript distinctions are made in the equations between the aa parent drug and the specific analyte parent drug or transformed metabolite daily mass loads dl mg day 1 were determined by correcting for average daily flow rate ml day 1 eq 1 flow rates were provided by the

population 2 3 1 population equivalent estimation a comprehensive evaluation of the various population estimates was discussed in a previous publication holton et al 2022 the monitoring campaign was not conducted during a census year sampling from july 2018 to may 2019 where the most recent census had occurred in 2011 however annual socio economic profiles published by the western cape government provided a detailed database for intermediate years the documents include information on demographics education health poverty services safety economy and infrastructure the population estimates quoted in these documents are for the greater stellenbosch municipality 186 187k western cape government 2018 western cape government 2019 whereas the wwtp eerste river catchment sampling involved only stellenbosch town therefore the wwtp population estimate pe ww was favourable for calculation of pndp pndl ww and pndi ww 2018 176 523 and 2019 179 463 holton et al 2022 the northwest of the town hosts the largest population of individuals living in informal housing these constitute both informal settlements as well as dwellings situated in the backyards of formal housing other smaller settlements were not specifically monitored as the contribution into the river systems was not thought to be significant in total it was estimated that approximately thirty thousand people were living in informal dwellings during 2018 19 pe is throughout these settlements limited sanitation facilities were available however for many toilets were located far away 0 5 km for 360 households in 2012 or considered unsafe to visit particularly at night stellenbosch municipality 2012 consequently a lot of urban wastewaters would be discarded and enter downstream rivers waste from an estimated 6 12k people entered the plankenbrug river per day during the sampling period pe riv 12k holton et al 2022 this pe riv upper estimate was used in the calculation of pndl riv and pndi riv pndp values were only calculated using pe ww as it was not possible to distinguish where in the catchment a prescription might have been consumed overall the sum of pndi ww and pndi riv should equal the pndp per antimicrobial however exceptions and uncertainties result in dissonance between these values these variables are discussed in section 2 4 2 3 2 drug excretion correction factors cfs antibiotics are metabolised and excreted from the body via drug specific mechanisms an extensive literature review conducted by holton et al holton et al 2022 collated experimental results for the percentage excretion of drugs and metabolites via urine and faeces this was achieved through a literature searching protocol consisting of 1 systematically obtaining a pharmacokinetic literature pool 2 including excluding papers based on experimental design via title and abstract 3 including excluding based on data in the main text 4 calculating analyte weighted means medians the resultant dataset was used to calculate correction factors cfs in order to determine the original quantity of drug mass consumed si table s5 7 the accuracy of these cfs was validated using a uk wastewater influent dataset against the corresponding daily catchment prescription data dp holton et al 2022 2 3 3 prescription data prescription datasets were obtained for the catchment region via a retrospective records review of four private pharmacies four state clinics and the provincial hospital located in town and the surrounding suburban areas louw and louw 2021 the mass of active ingredient dispensed was used in all calculations it is predicted that the records are representative of the antibiotic use by inhabitants relying on public healthcare including outpatients and inpatients as the sources covered all state healthcare facilities in the area furthermore we expect the inhabitants of the informal settlement and thus the data from the river to be almost completely reliant on the public healthcare system the dataset see tables s8 s10 is only partially representative of the antibiotic use by patients utilising private healthcare as the sources do not include all private pharmacies in the area or the private hospital 4 of 9 are represented the dataset includes the quantities of antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of both household pets and livestock animals the evaluation of the uwf data separates the prescriptions for human recipients state and hospital clinics private pharmacies and for animals veterinary clinics it is not expected that significant proportions of animal waste would reach the wwtp or river systems however small quantities may be washed into sewage pipes via storm drains and into rivers via urban land runoff 2 4 experimental uncertainties for each stage of the methodology the experimental features and limitations were considered these are discussed throughout table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 eerste river stellenbosch catchment the eerste river catchment with both wwtp and informal settlement sampling sites is shown in figure s4 aa specific trends are displayed in fig 1 fig 2 as well as in figures s5 s35 municipal stellenbosch wwtp wastewater was found to contain a wider range of aas at higher concentrations daily loads especially in macrolides quinolones and b lactams for example clr clarithromycin is found at an average of 0 16 g day in informal settlement site and 5 09 g day in wwtp influent this was expected as wwtp wastewater represents 178k inhabitants in contrast settlement wastewater represents aa usage by approximately 6 12k inhabitants interestingly the mass loads of antiretrovirals e g lamivudine 8 4 g day in informal settlement wastewater vs 16 9 g day in wwtp wastewater influent were much closer between sites indicating a significantly higher usage throughout the settlements see holton et al 2022 for further discussion seasonality of antibiotic consumption is often observed due to higher incidence of illness during winter months indeed temporal trends exhibited reduced daily loads during the summer to early autumn in general tb associated drugs and antiretrovirals were some of the most prevalent aas and their presence was season independent sulfonamides and trimethoprim with the next highest prevalence observed much higher seasonality yet considerations must be made regarding seasonal analyte degradation both thermal and photolytic due to climate variations therefore distinctions between behaviour and climate based seasonal patterns can be established if a trend is observed in both wastewater and waterways more likely behavioural or only in waterways more likely climatic the spatiotemporal trends were discussed per drug class in a previous publication holton et al 2022 briefly arvs ftc emtricitabine and 3tc lamivudine were the most prevalent drugs throughout the monitoring campaign wwtp wastewater influent average daily loads 226 2 109 5 and 16 9 8 7 g day respectively followed by tuberculosis drugs wwtp average daily loads 11 6 33 2 g day and sulfonamides wwtp average daily loads 14 7 23 4 g day the average daily loads for tb related drug at informal settlement wastewater and wwtp influent were 5 2 13 5 11 6 33 2 respectively the average daily loads for the arvs at informal settlement and wwtp were 96 5 106 7 121 5 131 7 g day respectively the quinolone average daily loads at informal settlement and wwtp were 0 29 0 67 and 1 1 2 6 g day respectively with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin being the most prevalent the macrolide average daily loads at the informal settlement and wwtp were 0 21 0 35 2 2 4 9 g day respectively with azithromycin being the most prevalent the sulfonamide average daily loads at informal settlement and wwtp were 4 6 11 3 14 7 23 4 g day respectively with sulfamethoxazole being the most prevalent ceftriaxone and cefalexin were the most prevalent amongst the cephalosporins and doxycycline was the most prevalent amongst the cyclines holton et al 2022 3 1 1 evaluation of prescription records in general prescribed aas were detected at the two sampling sites of the wwtp and informal settlement wastewaters prescription data both human and veterinary were obtained for most of the target aas with a few exceptions slz sulfasalazine 3tc lamivudine ftc emitricitabine and tet tetracycline interestingly these four drugs and their metabolites e g spy sulfapyridine and aspy n acetylsulfapyridine that were absent from prescription datasets were also consistently detected throughout the sampling period at both sites this may be explained by the fact that the prescription records used are not complete for the catchment and so may account for the discordance between some datasets where the calculated daily intake di exceeds the daily prescription dp private healthcare facilities operate independently of the public sector and no central publicly accessible repository or platform exists to access aa sales the incomplete nature of the dataset is not ideal and limits the extent of analysis possible but also reflects the reality of lmics currently and in the foreseeable future this reality affects prescription drug monitoring strategies in all low resource settings and highlights wbes potential for impact additionally there may be other sources of these drugs that are not obtained via prescription there were no supplementary prescription data for spy a veterinary antibiotic four of the prescription drugs were also only prescribed in veterinary centres tmp trimethoprim sdz sulfadiazine otc oxytetracycline and dox doxycycline ranging from 0 0025 to 4 22 g day with a median of 0 26 g day si table 9 enrofloxacin a veterinary prodrug of ciprofloxacin cip was also prescribed in the region this drug was recorded at an average of 1 01 g day 2 4 of the average quantity of ciprofloxacin prescribed 42 6 g day considering the low proportion of drug contaminated animal waste reaching the wwtp or specific river site as well as incomplete transformation to cip cester and toutain 1997 mengozzi et al 1996 guo et al 2010 it is unlikely that the prescribed levels of enrofloxacin would have notable impact on the wastewater measurement of cip as mentioned above both human and veterinary prescription data were captured once off retrospectively the distinction between drug content prescribed to humans and animals was displayed via dashed human and dotted animal red lines from fig 1 fig 2 in general contribution from veterinary prescription to the overall catchment prescription was low for example in the case for tmp trimethoprim and sdz sulfadiazine the proportion of drug prescribed in veterinary centres compared to the human prescribed mass was negligible average 0 5 and in the case of dox doxycycline was only 6 average per month in the case of otc oxytetracycline no prescriptions were made throughout the captured pharmacies 4 hospitals 1 and clinics 4 for the period of 2018 19 where all otc datapoints in the environmental sampling were calculated to be below the method s quantification and or detection limit 3 1 2 estimation of community aa intake di versus dp community wide aa intake was estimated in both sewer connected communities via wwtp influent measurements as well as in surface waters that receive untreated wastewater from surrounding informal settlements aa concentrations were normalised to wastewater flows to reduce variabilities from ever changing often weather dependant water flows in the studied catchment south africa has notable rainfall and temperature changes that are driven by seasonality the wet jun nov and dry dec may seasons see holton et al 2022 for further details in order to assess the efficacy of wbe back calculations and established correction factors accounting of human metabolism of aas to allow their intake calculation see our previous work for details holton et al 2022 the datasets were not initially normalised for population size the removal of this variable enabled better confidence in the cf evaluation this is due to higher uncertainties in establishing population equivalents pe in informal settlements vs more robust measurements of pe applied to sewer connected communities in fig 1 fig 2 as well as figures s5 s35 it is clear how the application of the analyte cf increases the estimation of daily mass loads of aas briefly daily loads dls blue display the wbe data corrected for flow rate the correction factor back calculates to drug intake di green by accounting for percentage metabolite excretion per analyte however there is some uncertainty associated with the calculation of di as discussed in section 2 4 and table 1 per analyte the median upper and lower quartile dis were calculated as well as inclusion of standard deviation between uwf replicates only the median di values from ww samples are discussed in this section unless specified discussion for individual aas can be found below 3 1 2 1 sulfamethoxazole smx and asmx in this study the sa dataset the acetyl metabolite suggests consistently lower human intake di asmx 38 4 24 7 g day relative to the available prescription data for the region dp smx 334 7 129 6 g day fig 3 and fig s5 s6 comparatively the unchanged drug form appears to provide higher intake estimates di smx 411 1 279 8 g day this result is in opposition to our published uk study holton et al 2022 where asmx was determined as expected to produce the best estimation of di the underestimation of di asmx and disparity between studies could in part be explained by lower thermal stability of this analyte holton et al 2022 where the concordance of di asmx and dp smx was poorest during the hotter months namely november january and february in the sa study area interestingly an extensive one year longitudinal study in two uk cities confirmed that smx asmx ratio was consistent across both studied catchment areas at 2 40 1 23 and 2 52 1 96 for bath and keynsham but significant temporal variability was observed in the time series sims et al 2023 the lack of concordance between daily intake of smx and available prescription data can most likely be attributed to the limitations of the sa prescription dataset as opposed to the sa dataset that was assembled by our research team the uk national dataset is publicly available via uk national health service it provides comprehensive and high resolution monthly prescription statistics by postcode location that resulted in high concordance of daily prescription of aas with their wbe estimated daily intake therefore in sa and other countries worldwide particularly lmics with limited prescription monitoring infrastructure prescription data cannot be used as an absolute indicator of aa usage the challenges are exacerbated by general issues related to prescription vs consumption vs excretion in the catchment area for this reason wbe can provide a timely and cost effective alternative to the current inability to estimate aa usage in low resource settings or countries and regions without access to prescription usage data 3 1 2 2 trimethoprim tmp and htmp only a very small proportion of htmp is excreted in urine and or faeces 4 it was found to not be suitable for the calculation of di due to underestimation di htmp 2 5 of dp tmp this was largely due to analytical inaccuracies associated with detection levels near the method limit of quantification di via trimethoprim in the unchanged form was more concordant to dp but also appears to be an underestimation di tmp in ww 23 8 8 5 g day and dp tmp 66 9 25 9 g day fig 1 3 s7 s9 recovery and stability of this analyte is high according to method validation holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 therefore this result is currently unexplained likely linked as in the case of smx sulfamethoxazole with our low confidence in the completeness of the sa prescription dataset available further work is required to understand the most probable reasons prescription dispensing out of catchment consumption biomarker excretion however dp tmp average indicates high variability in prescription which might impact the average value for the study period 3 1 2 3 sulfadiazine sdz and asdz in the informal settlement samples two high detection anomalies are observed for sulfadiazine during the september october sampling campaign this pattern was not observed in the metabolite asdz this combination of a lack of metabolite and the higher rainfall measured during this sampling month suggests these spikes could be the result of unused pharmaceutical disposal rather than consumption however asdz has been seen to suffer from high chromatographic interference therefore the lack of detection may be due to reduced sensitivity rather than absence this reduced sensitivity also resulted in asdz being less suitable for the calculation of di and so in this dataset unchanged sdz was selected fig 3 s10 s11 although sdz performed well over 50 samples were below the instrumental limit of detection and 4 7 of the data were below the limit of quantification included in a semi quantitative nature the example of a potential wbe captured sdz direct disposal event provides critical evidence for wider applicability of wbe in comprehensive verification of aa intake vs disposal this cannot be achieved with prescription datasets informing of prescription only and being unable to provide further critical evidence of patient compliance including consumption vs disposal routes of unconsumed aas further information on wbe based verification of pharma disposal can be found elsewhere kasprzyk hordern et al 2021 3 1 2 4 sulfasalazine slz spy aspy no prescription data was obtained for sulfasalazine nor sulfapyridine veterinary use only yet all three associated analytes were detected at both sites throughout the sampling period sources for these drugs may include clinics outside of the catchment or those not captured in the dataset this shows superiority of wbe as an epidemiology tool vs prescription data dues to its ability to capture real usage of aas in the catchment large variation was observed in the estimation of di between the three analytes di slz 17 6 21 3 g day di spy 90 0 56 5 g day and di aspy 23 1 12 4 g day fig 3 s12 slz was calculated to have the lowest recovery and stability and therefore not favoured in the absence of prescription data spy and aspy cannot be quantitively compared for accuracy the spatiotemporal trends are very similar between the two but spy estimated more than twice the daily slz consumption the datapoint validation was stronger for spy and thus was the favoured choice for wbe based estimates of slz intake 3 1 2 5 metronidazole mtz and hmtz the spatiotemporal concordance between the analytes at both sites particularly in sept oct and may si figures s15 s16 suggest the trends were due to consumption the mtz anomalies observed in july and november were not mirrored in hmtz suggesting potential disposal events of unused mtz other than these events both analytes produced lower intake estimates di mtz 16 7 20 4 g day and di hmtz 5 0 2 6 g day relative to daily prescriptions dp mtz 65 9 10 5 g day fig 3 s15 16 3 1 2 6 clindamycin cli and dmcli the unchanged form cli suffered from chromatographic interference resulting in comparatively low signal to noise across most samples the method sensitivity and selectivity were much higher in dmcli and was therefore the favoured analyte for the estimation of di the data did however show good concordance with dp in both analytes di cli 3 8 3 8 g day di dmcli 7 4 13 1 g day dp cli 2 9 0 9 g day fig 3 s17 19 3 1 2 7 clarithromycin clr and dmclr conversely clr is seen to perform better than dmclr di dmclr 47 7 26 7 g day fig 3 s20 21 the uwf duplicate concordance and correlation to prescriptions dp clr 8 4 2 5 g day was much stronger in clr di clr 14 3 8 9 g day 3 1 2 8 ciprofloxacin cip and decip the unchanged form cip was selected as the favoured analyte and performed reasonably well di cip 19 1 11 3 g day dp cip 44 7 16 9 g day fig 2 and 3 s22 23 the proportional excretion of decip is very low 1 4 detection is therefore expected to be low likely around the assay sensitivity threshold methodological error will have higher proportional impact on low prevalence analytes such as this this may lead to overestimation further amplified when the correction factor is applied di decip 281 7 386 0 g day the mass loads of decip dl decip 3 7 5 0 g day before correction perform better this could suggest that the proportional excretion of decip is higher than stated in literature ciprofloxacin is a metabolite of the antibiotic enrofloxacin no metabolism excretion literature was identified for enrofloxacin during the systematic review holton et al 2022 however enrofloxacin is only prescribed for use in animals and so the occurrence of cip in ww influent as a metabolite of enrofloxacin is expected to be negligible furthermore the prescription of enrofloxacin per month was on average only 2 9 of prescribed cip 3 1 2 9 ofloxacin including levofloxacin ofx dmofx and ofxo all three analytes are detected throughout the sampling duration and at both sites ofx is favoured for calculation of di di ofx 3 6 2 4 g day as the other two are excreted proportionally low 3 56 dmofx and 1 00 oofx which may lead to sporadic detection or overestimation di dmofx 4 4 11 6 g day and di ofxo 21 2 39 1 g day relative to prescriptions dp ofx 9 0 1 6 g day fig 3 s24 s26 3 1 2 10 norfloxacin nor and hnor norfloxacin was prescribed at 0 5 g day throughout the sampling period for less commonly prescribed antimicrobials calculating averaged daily prescribed mass may not be representative of the consumption behaviour the sporadic nature of the uwf data suggests norfloxacin may have been prescribed in fewer short courses as with the other quinolones the extremely low proportion of hnor excreted in urine 0 05 might result in amplified estimations of di di hnor 42 5 191 2 g day fig 3 s27 s28 3 1 2 11 antiretrovirals 3tc lamivudine and ftc emtricitabine no prescription data was obtained for either of the antiretrovirals arvs due to the collection methodology yet large quantities were detected at both sites for example ftc was found to be the most prevalent its di reached 665 0 g day whereas 3tc was detected at lower levels with dis spanning from 0 to 90 1 g day this was expected because arvs are used in the treatment of hiv aids an infection of high prevalence in south africa and on the larger african continent from which south africa has the highest arv treatment programme in the world published socio economic profiles for stellenbosch quote the number of registered patients in arv treatment programmes as 6064 and 6960 for 2018 and 2019 respectively western cape government 2020 no information on treatment regimens were included in the report and so could not be added to the prescription dataset there is also the likelihood that high arv usage is prevalent in communities from low socio economic settings i e living in informal settings where domestic waste including sewage will be directly discharged into surrounding surface water settings as observed for the current study uwf therefore provides an important source of information of usage patterns not accessible by other epidemiology tools or where data is limited the spatiotemporal concordance of the two drugs was very strong suggesting either co prescribing or significant temporal disease consumption behaviour fig s29 s30 3 1 2 12 oxytetracycline otc no human prescription records were obtained for oxytetracycline in parallel very few samples were detected above the method limit of quantification during the study period fig s31 suggesting low usage patterns of this drug in the study area 3 1 2 13 tetracycline tet neither veterinary nor human prescription data was obtained for tet however relatively large quantities were detected in wastewater consequently uwf data was the only means to estimate daily usage indicating an importance and utility of the tool dls for ww and receiving waters denoted 0 1 0 9 and 1 6 2 0 g day respectively whereby estimated dis were 0 2 1 3 and 2 5 3 1 g day respectively fig s32 although prescription data for tet was not obtained its broad spectrum use for bacterial infections in both human and veterinary medicine is well known and thus conforms to the large quantity of tet recorded in the wastewater samples for the current study to some extent 3 1 2 14 doxycycline dox the correction factor for dox appears to have performed well despite the large standard deviations within uwf replicates the sum of ww and informal settlement di aligns to the average daily prescribed mass dl denoted 1 4 3 2 g day and di 1 7 3 9 g day whereas dp was 8 0 1 6 g day the mass prescribed for veterinary use 0 4 0 2 g day is added as red dotted lines fig 2 fig s33 the small relative quantity 5 of the human prescriptions would have negligible impact should any of the treated animals waste enter the waterways 3 1 2 15 nitrofurantoin nit and npahd the unchanged nit form was observed to have very low stability in wastewater during method validation 16 22 of analyte recovered after 24 h holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 it is therefore not favoured for the calculation of di the metabolite npahd was significantly more stable at 4 c 78 but degraded rapidly at 20 c 24 holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 consequently a more consistent mass of npahd was measured throughout the wastewater samples with slowed degradation rates within chilled composite samplers relative to river grab samples less mass was measured during hotter summer months particularly jan feb this temporal trend may be due to increased analyte degradation and or decreased nit consumption no literature data was found for the percentage excretion of npahd therefore di could not be calculated and only daily mass loads are quoted fig s34 overall the comparisons of analyte di and aa dp are outlined in fig 3 3 1 3 comparison of municipal and informal settlement aa usage estimates select results from both municipal and informal settlement wastewater polluted surface waters allowed for the comparison of aa usage patterns in formal housing communities as well as informal communities where waste products are directly discharged into surrounding surface waters thus providing a more comprehensive overview of wbe in urban settings where the entire community is not connected to sewage infrastructure these results are gathered in fig 1 fig 2 as well as figures s5 s35 again the datasets are interpreted without the added uncertainty of normalisation from the respective population estimates comparisons are made from g day whereby the expectation may be that the mass originating from informal settlements would be populationally proportional to the antimicrobial mass entering the wwtp the total number of individuals living in informal housing was estimated to be approximately one sixth of the catchment population holton et al 2022 however most of that population is said to have at least partial access to sanitation facilities the upper estimate for the number of individuals contributing waste into the plankenbrug river was 12k pe riv this estimate is about one fifteenth the size of the whole study catchment area despite this many antimicrobials were detected in much higher quantities in informal settlements than a 1 15 ratio in particular smx sulfamethoxazole 1 0 3 0 sdz sulfadiazine 1 0 0 3 mtz metronidazole 1 0 3 0 cli clindamycin 1 0 3 1 3tc lamivudine 1 0 2 0 ftc emtricitabine 1 0 1 2 ofx ofloxacin 1 0 0 7 and dox doxycycline 1 0 2 1 were measured at higher levels than expected the mass of ftc in informal settlement often exceeded that in municipal wwtp wastewater these results support a theory of a large disparity in antimicrobial consumption between the two communities higher per capita antimicrobial usage in informal settlements is likely in higher density populations particularly those with insufficient sanitation infrastructure moreover antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are given as prophylaxis in arv treatment programmes thus partly explaining the high smx detection in the surface water setting where a high level of arv drugs were also detected throughout the study furthermore analyte degradation and metabolite transformation within closed municipal sewers is unlikely to be higher in sewers when compared to runoff from informal settlements these are however analyte specific and subject to environmental factors for example fluoroquinolones are vulnerable to photochemical processes despite the above mentioned uncertainties areas for further research consideration wbe provides a unique opportunity to capture spatial and temporal usage trends in communities that are unlikely to be tested using conventional epidemiology approaches wbe s key role is to provide early warning to signal emerging community wide health related issues the above results indicate that widespread overuse of certain antimicrobials might trigger higher prevalence of resistant microorganisms in communities residing in the informal settlement further work is required to understand the phenomenon and trigger management strategies 3 1 4 evaluation of population estimates wastewater effluent from the sa settlement was studied which in combination with ww influent should have captured a near complete representation of the community see fig 4 8 stellenbosch population estimates 2018 19 for the wastewater treatment plant pe ww 176 179k and for the informal settlements pe is 30k pe riv 6 12k are discussed in detail in our previous publication holton et al 2022 the normalisation of data by contributing population size is a useful tool to enable per capita substance usage and consequently comparisons between catchments however the interpretation of these results is dependant on the accuracy of the population estimates this is in addition to accurate flow measurements allowing for daily loads calculations the pes calculated by wwtps are based on municipal census and household data and are often for very large number of residents pe ww 176 179k these estimates are considered accurate whereas the estimate for the total population in informal settlements was calculated from sporadic sources across a 7 year time period holton et al 2022 the population fluctuation inter and intra annually is often high making estimations increasingly difficult comparing wbe and prescription datasets with and without population normalisation can indicate the accuracy of the various population estimates si figure s36 there is an exact correlation between the g day and population normalised mg day 1000inh for the municipal influent wastewater because all datasets were normalised using pe ww however both pes applied to the informal settlement samples often calculated much higher pndis si fig s37 41 e g smx sulfamethoxazole tmp trimethoprim spy sulfapyridine mtz metronidazole cli clindamycin 3tc lamivudine ftc emtricitabine ofx ofloxacin and dox doxycycline this may be explained by 1 the incompleteness of prescription records obtained 2 a significant proportion of aas were obtained outside of the stellenbosch catchment from other sources incl online purchases 3 informal settlement inhabitants sourcing prescriptions in sewer connected communities 4 sourcing aas via non prescription also illegal routes 5 pe is 30k and pe riv 12k underestimations 6 errors from flow estimations as mentioned above wbe provides true and comprehensive information of community s aa usage patterns because it captures whole communities via wastewater they produce wbe provides superior information when compared with prescription dataset only however to fully appreciate advantages and limitations of both epidemiology tools and to gather the best possible understanding of community wide aa usage patterns it is recommended that both approaches are used as they complement each other figs 4 8 show population normalised daily loads pndl intake pndi and prescription pndp for the whole stellenbosch population including both infrastructure rich communities and those lacking infrastructure sumpndl and sumpndi it can be observed that both pndis and pndps for several aas show clear seasonality with high usage in the wet june november and low usage in the dry december may season this is especially pronounced in the case of sulfonamides and tmp trimethoprim macrolides cli clindamycin and clr clarithromycin fig 4 lower seasonal variability was observed with fluoroquinolones e g ofx ofloxacin or nor norfloxacin fig 5 interestingly mtz metronidazole observed high intake in september as estimated by using both parent drug and its metabolite fig 5 in contrast antiretrovirals being some of the most prevalent aas were found to be largely season independent fig 7 which conform to the usage pattern of these drugs requiring patients to consume the drugs daily in comparison to intermittent antibiotic consumption patterns in many cases pndis were estimated to be higher than pndps especially in high usage wet season months this is particularly pronounced in the case of smx sulfamethoxazole tmp trimethoprim ofx ofloxacin and mtz metronidazole fig 4 6 there are several potential reasons for this as explained above namely 1 higher catchment usage than the official prescription estimates 2 underreported prescription and dispensing in the catchment 3 underreported population size in si as well as 4 uncertainties around flow measurement and the extent of human metabolic vs microbial metabolism contributions despite these uncertainties figs 4 8 clearly show the power of wbe in capturing usage patterns of aas by whole communities that cannot be achieved by other existing epidemiology tools 3 2 comparison of two catchments southwest uk and stellenbosch sa the two regions southwest uk and stellenbosch sa were similar in size and function both affluent high prevalence of tourism and with large student populations the two largest differences were climate and presence of informal housing the wwtp in the uk catchment served approx 120 k people whereas in sa the wwtp estimated 178k holton et al 2022 holton et al 2022 in both catchments sewer overflows can result in the discharge of untreated waste into waterways this occurs during periods of rainfall where the influent volume exceeds the wwtp capacity however most human derived wastewaters in the uk catchment should enter the sewer system to be treated via the wwtp whereas in the sa campaign insufficient access to sanitation in local informal settlements causes significant proportions of grey water and waste black water to enter river systems that are situated close to the informal housing settings holton et al 2022 the acquisition and processing of prescription records was different between the two studies as well the data from the uk was obtained via comprehensive open access reports from nhs digital whereas sa did not have centralised collated records datasets were obtained and processed manually from individual clinics hospitals pharmacies and veterinary centres from within the eerste river catchment the prescription records in this study were thus not complete and so are used as a supportive indicator of daily consumption rather than as an absolute reference as well as variation in the reliability and completeness of prescription data consumption behaviour is also likely to differ between catchments due to the different nature of the health systems some explanations for the deviations between wastewater and prescription estimations are outlined in table 1 when comparing prescribing trends between the two regions it was crucial to account for the relative catchment sizes by calculating population normalised daily prescriptions pndp mg day 1000 inhabitants the observations therefore are dependant on the accuracy of the population estimates due to this uncertainty only the most significant differences should be considered for instance nitrofurantoin oxytetracycline and sulfasalazine were prescribed at significantly lower levels in the sa catchment than the uk region sims et al 2023 conversely the winter pndp sa of sulfamethoxazole 1207 3 mg day 1000inh was 12 times higher than winter pndp uk 94 7 mg day 1000inh table 2 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim often co prescribed are noted for their broad spectrum usage in sa alongside prophylactic administration in antiretroviral therapy programmes macrolides were most prevalent up to 10 times in the uk vs sa both in terms of pndp and pndis interestingly mtz metronidazole has higher pndp but lower pndi in sa vs uk a much higher usage of antiretrovirals ftc emtricitabine and 3tc lamivudine up to 10 times higher was also recorded in the sa study compared to the uk study this is of particular importance as no prescription usage databases exist to provide information of antiretrovirals usage quinolone usage is on average similar across the two catchments with high prevalence of cip ciprofloxacin in the uk and ofx ofloxacin in sa cyclines were found to have higher usage in the uk both in terms of pnpd and pndi with the highest prevalence recorded for otc oxytetracycline comparisons of pndis between the two catchments enabled behavioural distinctions to be made however significant climatic differences must be considered regarding photo and thermal analyte stability especially in the sa study site that include summer periods with high recorded temperatures followed by winter periods with low recorded temperatures consequently assessments between the winter months might be better to be prioritised table 2 this uwf approach is seen here to provide global surveillance of aa usage which is key to tackle amr especially in regions without access to comprehensive prescription datasets 4 conclusion the manuscript aimed to estimate usage of antimicrobial agents in the city of stellenbosch in two contrasting areas the main city with closed sewage collection system and adjacent wwtp and an informal settlement with runoff of untreated sewage to a local receiving stream moreover two epidemiology approaches were compared between the contrasting areas in the sa study and a similar campaign done in the uk namely prescription data and wbe analyses the main conclusions are as follows 1 the uwf tool utilising wbe pipelines provided a comprehensive overview of aa usage accounting for total drug mass in the region independent of prescription access compliance or movement of people 2 wbe data triangulation with prescription dataset showed good correlations for some aas particularly cli clindamycin clr clarithromycin ofx ofloxacin and dox doxycycline it also revealed discrepancies in usage for some compounds e g tet tetracycline and spy sulfapyridine which might be linked with lack of pharma compliance in prescription datasets patient compliance or analyte specific physical chemical properties 3 comparison of sewerage system connected community and informal settlement revealed much higher usage of antimicrobials in the informal settlement which is linked with much higher density of population incidence of disease and uncertainties around contributing population 4 the uwf monitoring identified antimicrobials usage not accounted for in official prescription statistics these include antiretrovirals ftc emtricitabine and 3tc lamivudine 5 lack of clarity regarding prescriptions and lack of inclusion of several critical often over the counter medications such as antiretrovirals in public health databases makes uwf as a useful and comprehensive epidemiology tool for tracking pharma usage 6 comparing uk and sa prescription and wbe datasets indicates higher prevalence of macrolides usage in the uk vs antiretrovirals usage in sa however further work is required to remove uncertainties linked with significant climatic differences impacting photo and thermal analyte stability in sa when compared to the uk climate 7 this uwf approach is seen here to provide global surveillance of aa usage which is key to tackle amr especially in regions without access to comprehensive prescription datasets author statement elisabeth holton
