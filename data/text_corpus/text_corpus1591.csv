7955,study region fårö island part of region gotland sweden study focus despite its importance for proactive planning and management understanding of how future climate and socioeconomic trends may interact to influence water supply and demand at sub regional scale remains limited for the nordic region we aim to close this knowledge gap by developing a combined social and hydrological simulation model for fårö island in the baltic sea we use multivariate monte carlo simulations to explore the effects of future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 on local groundwater supplies and subsequent impacts on the housing sector tourism sector and municipal water supply system in the period 2020 2050 new hydrological insights for the region our results suggest that groundwater storage will remain critically low in the coming 30 years with a 60 70 probability of the groundwater head falling to lower levels than experienced in the past 60 years low water availability and widespread saltwater intrusion will constrain housing and tourism development by up to 11 and 30 respectively to sustain growth the tourist sector will become increasingly reliant on water from private wells and supplementary water deliveries from neighboring regions will be required to meet water demand on the municipal grid keywords climate change groundwater water scarcity system dynamics socioeconomic impact 1 introduction water scarcity is a problem with impacts for human health economic development and ecosystems in many regions around the world rijsberman 2006 wimmer et al 2015 it is estimated that up to 50 of the global population will experience seasonal or permanent water insecurity by 2050 caused by a combination of changes in climate urban and rural development and population growth united nations 2018 understanding how trends in climate and socioeconomic development interact to influence water supply and demand across space and time is of great importance to support mitigation and adaptation to water scarcity united nations 2018 building relevant knowledge is challenging however as climate driven impacts on water resources have been shown to differ substantially both between and within geographical regions bessah et al 2020 wu et al 2020 furthermore studies in recent years have demonstrated that understanding the interplay between social and hydrological systems is an important component in long term sustainable management of water resources di baldassarre et al 2019 although much progress has been made in developing macro level theories about the mechanisms of socio hydrological dynamics di baldassarre et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2012 place specific understanding of human water systems remains limited xu et al 2018 most previous studies assessing the local interplay between climate hydrology and the social system have focused on regions with a long history of water scarcity such as the mediterranean region darvini and memmola 2020 fabre et al 2015 the middle east gohari et al 2013 australia van emmerik et al 2014 parts of the us fernald et al 2012 and different parts of africa bessah et al 2020 fraser et al 2011 the nordic region is poorly represented in such research partly because freshwater has historically been a plentiful resource in the region however with the anticipated effects of climate change there is reason to suspect that the nordic region will not be spared from water scarcity for much longer indeed unusually dry summers in recent years have caused periods of local to regional seasonal water scarcity even in typically water abundant areas ahopelto et al 2019 stensen et al 2019 moreover recent reports project that the frequency intensity and duration of seasonal water shortages will continue to increase in the coming decades asp et al 2015 to enable proactive and robust water management strategies to be developed for the nordic region improved local understanding of the combined effects of climate and socioeconomic change on water supply and demand is essential in this paper we contribute to this end by presenting results from a case study exploring how climate and socioeconomic processes interact to influence supply and demand for drinking water on the swedish island of fårö we develop a simulation model of the hydrological and socioeconomic mechanisms governing water supply and demand drawing on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data sources the model calibrated to 20 years of historical data is used in simulation experiments investigating how projected changes in climate are likely to influence water supply and water quality in the coming 30 years we then explore the implications of these changes for the three largest water dependent stakeholders on the island the municipality the tourism sector and the housing sector the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly describe the study area and provide an account of how challenges related to drinking water supply and demand have developed in the past 20 years we present the expected changes in regional climate in the coming 30 year and we define the aim of this study in section 3 we outline the model development process and provide a high level description of the model structure we also present the model calibration process and we describe the experimental set up used to explore the hydrological and socioeconomic implications of future climate scenarios in section 4 calibration results are summarized and we present and discuss the results from the simulation experiments we first describe climate effects on groundwater supply and then the impact of these effects on households tourism and the municipal water supply system we also highlight some limitations of the study and consider areas for future research to support local water resources management and planning in section 5 we summarize our key findings 2 the study area fårö is a small island 114 km2 in the baltic sea 57 9 n 19 1 e belonging to the swedish municipality of gotland fig 1 the island has an average summer and winter temperature of 16 c and 2 c respectively and yearly precipitation of 500 600 mm smhi retrieved 3 february 2021 the main industries are tourism and agriculture and the population consists of about 300 permanent households and 1000 holiday households lantmäteriet 2021 drinking water is obtained exclusively from groundwater sources mostly from private wells drilled into the limestone dominated bedrock the soil layer is shallow 0 2 m across most of the island except for an area in the northeast where layers of coarse grained sandy soil up to 20 m deep make up one of the few large aquifers in the region this aquifer provides water to the municipal grid which serves most tourist facilities and about 50 residential households brunner 2014 rivera and ridderstolpe 2011 sjöstrand et al 2014 in recent decades fårö has become a popular holiday destination with a growing tourism sector fig 2a in the high season june august about 10 000 tourists and part time residents visit the island brunner 2014 water use has thus increased over time 1 1 monthly data on groundwater extraction water supply capacity and water transport volumes are classified information and can therefore not be displayed in the paper mikael tiouls region gotland personal communication 7 december 2021 for inquiries about the data please contact region gotland fig 2b between 2000 and 2020 water use on the municipal grid increased from about 5500 9500 cubic meters per year in fact since 2006 water supply from the municipal aquifer has been insufficient to meet demand in the summer period requiring supplementary transport of water from other regions of gotland to secure supply on the municipal grid1 fig 2c in 2006 in total 1500 cubic meters of supplementary drinking water was transported to fårö and by 2019 the figure had doubled to just above 3000 cubic meters within the private water sector the number of holiday homes has also increased over time and increasing incidence of saltwater intrusion into private wells has been detected magnus pettersson region gotland personal communication 25 january 2021 the growing reliance on transported water and the problem of saltwater intrusion create challenges for the municipality the tourist sector and private households for the municipality reliance on transported water is a risk as it makes the island vulnerable to disturbances such as delivery delays strikes or unexpected peaks in water consumption the municipal water supply has already come close to running out on several occasions because of fluctuations in demand and delivery delays for the tourist sector water supply constraints can limit growth and development in the past ten years establishment of new tourist facilities has been delayed or even canceled because of insufficient water supplies rolf lindvall sudersand resort personal communication 15 october 2020 for the housing sector salt contamination of groundwater sources restricts new housing developments as building permits are not issued in locations with elevated chloride levels gotlands kommun 2008 further if salt intrusion becomes widespread among households outside the public grid the municipality may become legally required to extend its water management area and provide water services to communities currently outside the public grid swedish environment and energy department 2007 this could lead to a significant increase in demand for municipal water and could potentially require substantial investments in water transport or alternative water supply technologies 2 1 aim of study between 2020 and 2050 climate change is expected to increase regional mean temperature by approximately 1 0 1 3 c and increase precipitation by 2 10 compared with the past 20 year period asp et al 2015 in this study we investigate how these changes are likely to influence local water supply and water quality and explore the interplay with existing water supply challenges on fårö island the aim is to improve understanding of the local level impacts of climate change and provide input for proactive water resources planning and management in a hitherto poorly studied region 3 material methods 3 1 model development we develop a combined social and hydrological simulation model of the key mechanisms driving water supply and demand on fårö in stella architect by isee systems lebanon usa following the system dynamics modeling method pruyt 2006 sterman 2000 the model consists of six interconnected submodules climate public water supply private water supply household water use tourism water use and public water supply demand balance fig 3 and simulates from 2000 to 2050 at time units of one month the causal structure of the model is based on a qualitative modeling study conducted by lindqvist et al 2021 exploring the drivers of water scarcity on fårö additional scrutiny of the scientific literature and municipal reports and repeated consultations and validation meetings with the department of water management at region gotland throughout the modeling process are used to cross validate the structural and operational representation of the water management system in the model an overview of the structure data inputs and data outputs for each submodule is presented in sections 3 1 1 3 1 6 for full model documentation see the appendix a 3 1 1 climate the climate module fig 4 imports monthly data on temperature precipitation solar radiation and wind speed and calculates potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith method penman and keen 1948 the effect of temperature on per capita water use is also calculated assuming that water use increases by 2 for every c by which the daily maximum temperature of the month exceeds 15 c dimkić 2020 outputs to other submodules are precipitation pet and effect of temperature on per capita water use for the historical period 2000 2020 we use observation data from local weather stations smhi 2021 as climate inputs for the future period 2020 2050 we used projected values provided by smhi asp et al 2015 these projections were produced by the regional climate model rca4 strandberg et al 2014 by downscaling and averaging across an ensemble of climate scenarios produced by nine global climate models canesm2 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m ec earth ipsl cm5a mr miroc5 mpi ems lr noresmi1 m and hadgem2 es sjökvist et al 2015 for the two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ipcc 2013 see appendix a for details to simulate between year variations in future climate inputs we sample future precipitation temperature and solar radiation values from their respective probability density functions parameterized using the smhi projected mean and historic standard deviation values 3 1 2 public water supply the public water supply module fig 5 simulates the dynamics of the public water supply system including the hydrology of the municipal aquifer and groundwater pumping in municipal wells the aquifer is modeled using budyko based methods for water balance modeling as described by zhang et al 2008 adapted to meet the requirement of unit consistency under system dynamics modeling conventions sterman 2000 in the model the aquifer consists of two connected cylindrical stocks the top representing soil storage and the bottom representing groundwater storage the dynamics of the stocks are governed by the flows of infiltration evapotranspiration recharge deep evapotranspiration base flow horizontal groundwater flow and extraction infiltration is calculated as a nonlinear function of the demand supply relationship between the level of the soil storage stock demand and the incoming precipitation supply zhang et al 2008 as the saturation level of the soil storage stock decreases the proportion of precipitation partitioned to infiltration asymptotically approaches one the shape of the partitioning curve is governed by the rainfall retention capacity of the catchment a model parameter representing the physical capacity of the soil and vegetation of the aquifer to retain water zhang et al 2008 the outflow from soil storage is partitioned between evapotranspiration and recharge according to similar functions as applied for infiltration evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of the relationship between soil storage and pet and recharge as function of the relationship between soil storage and the storage capacity of the aquifer as soil storage increases recharge will also increase and evapotranspiration will approach pet the relative proportion of available water that goes to recharge or evapotranspiration is controlled by the evapotranspiration efficiency of the catchment higher evapotranspiration efficiency means that more available water goes to evapotranspiration and less to recharge zhang et al 2008 the deep evapotranspiration flow ensures that if the groundwater level approaches the shallow soil layer groundwater also becomes available for evapotranspiration yeh and famiglietti 2009 the groundwater base flow is modeled as the product of the groundwater storage and a constant discharge factor and the extraction flow represents groundwater extraction by pumping by municipal wells extraction is set equal to desired extraction calculated in the public water supply demand balance module if the groundwater level in the aquifer remains above the average depth in the municipal wells as the groundwater level approaches the depth in the municipal wells extraction declines linearly lastly the horizontal groundwater flow represents the exchange of water between the municipal aquifer and its surroundings this allows groundwater storage to adjust to the groundwater level in surrounding catchments and is calculated using darcy s flow equation hillel 2004 3 1 3 private water supply the private water supply module fig 6 simulates the groundwater dynamics and the chloride concentration in aquifers outside the public water system the water balance structure is similar to and uses the same climate inputs as that presented in section 3 1 2 but it only accounts for natural water fluxes infiltration evapotranspiration recharge deep evapotranspiration and baseflow extraction is deliberately excluded because of lack of reliable data on historical extraction rates and because water quality measured by chloride concentration rather than water quantity has historically been the determining factor of household water supply magnus pettersson region gotland personal communication 25 october 2021 horizontal groundwater flow is also excluded from the private water supply module assuming homogeneous groundwater levels across the island groundwater chloride concentration represents the average chloride level in groundwater across the island and is calculated as a linear function of the groundwater level using the basictrendline package mei and yu 2020 in rstudio r development core team 2019 the linear model was calibrated using five years of groundwater level data and data on chloride levels in 328 water samples from across the island yielding a statistically significant negative effect of groundwater level on chloride concentration p 0 01 the groundwater chloride concentration is used to estimate the proportion of well sites with chloride levels exceeding the recommended limit values set by the swedish food agency 2017 100 and 300 mg l chloride cl as limit values for technical and drinking use respectively and the maximum permissible chloride concentration when granting building permits 100 mg l cl the proportion of well sites exceeding the limiting value at any given chloride level is obtained by linear 100 mg l cl and nonlinear 300 mg l cl regression mei and yu 2020 with the groundwater chloride concentration as the independent variable and the fraction of samples above 100 mg l cl p 0 05 and 300 mg l cl p 0 01 as dependent variables the effect of chloride concentration on house construction represents the limiting effect of groundwater chloride levels on new construction in the housing and tourism sector if groundwater chloride concentration increases fewer building permits will be issued and construction rates will decline 3 1 4 household water use in the household water use module fig 7 the size of the household sector and total household water use is calculated the total housing stock is divided into two groups k based on the water source public water or private well and each group is further segmented into two types j based on utilization permanent or part time new houses are added to the system by the flow construction starts which adds to the stock of houses under construction the rate of construction starts is influenced positively by higher housing prices and negatively by the effect of chloride concentration on house construction after a 12 month time delay representing the house construction time houses flow from the houses under construction stock to the housing stock via the construction finalization flow construction starts is governed by a simple supply demand structure where a stock of potential buyers is compared to the number of houses finalized each month to give a demand supply ratio that is used to set the housing price the base rate at which new buyers are added to the potential buyers stock is set using exogenous data on housing demand based on data on building permits issued between 2000 and 2020 scb 2021 and the stock is drained at the rate of construction finalization the housing price is used as an indicator of household affluence englund 2011 and it influences the quantity demand for houses by regulating the flow of new buyers added to the potential buyers stock and the number of construction starts we use a price elasticity of demand and supply of 0 5 englund 2011 and 0 1 international monetary fund european dept 2015 respectively the number of houses in use at any given point in time depends on the household type and the duration of the tourist season permanent households are in constant use while the proportion of part time households in use is determined by multiplying the number of part time households by a tourist season utilization factor this factor takes values between zero and one depending on the time of the year here based on estimates by region gotland water use per household is the product of the number of residents per household and normal water use per capita 140 l person day swedish water 2020 and responds dynamically to changes in temperature through the effect of temperature on water use from the climate module dimkić 2020 and the level of household affluence höglund 1999 wiedmann et al 2020 the total household water use is the product of the number of houses in use and the water use per household and provides input to the public water supply demand balance module 3 1 5 tourism water use the tourism water use module fig 8 simulates the development of the tourist sector and its total water use the size of the tourist sector is measured by its bed capacity and it is modeled by a three compartment aging chain sterman 2000 consisting of the stocks beds planned beds on order and installed beds linked by the flows adding beds to plan ordering new beds and installing new beds the number of tourists is modeled as an additional stock that increases or decreases with the flow of net arrivals net arrivals fluctuate with the tourist season using the same tourist season utilization factor as in section 3 1 4 and respond to changes in destination attractiveness assumed constant in the base case scenario the number of beds added to the system each month is controlled by a goal gap function where the level of capacity utilization the ratio of tourists to installed beds is compared to a desired capacity utilization if capacity utilization exceeds desired capacity utilization this leads to an increase in desired expansion and an inflow to beds planned beds move in batches from beds planned through beds on order to installed beds with a total planning and construction delay of 24 months bed capacity investments are bounded by the water self sufficiency of the public grid and the possibility of tourist facilities to drill their own wells if public water self sufficiency is low water use restrictions calculated in the public water supply demand balance module section 3 1 6 will limit planning and investment in new bed capacity this will force tourist facilities to search for private water supply sources by drilling new wells making the groundwater chloride concentration the limiting factor for tourism growth total tourism water use is calculated as the product of normal water use per tourist the number of tourists and the effect of temperature on water use imported from the climate module and it provides input to the public water supply demand module 3 1 6 public water supply demand balance the public water supply demand balance module fig 9 sums up the total water use from the tourist sector with the total public water use in the household sector to calculate the total public water use the total public water use dictates the desired pumping from the public aquifer in the public water supply module section 3 1 2 and when multiplied by the consumer water price the municipal revenues from water tariffs desired extraction is compared to the actual groundwater extraction from the public water supply module to calculate a water supply deficit the deficit triggers water use restrictions that limit further expansion of the tourist sector section 3 1 5 and increases the volume and costs of water transports the difference between revenues and costs of the water supply system is used as an estimate of the net profits of the municipal drinking water system 3 2 model calibration calibration is conducted by varying module parameter inputs to optimize the fit of the simulation outputs to historical data on groundwater levels water use tourism and housing development provided by swedish metrological and hydrological institute smhi 2021 geological survey of sweden sgu 2021a 2021b statistics sweden scb 2021 and region gotland region gotland 2021a 2021b each submodule is first calibrated individually adhering to strategies for partial model calibration described by homer 2012 followed by a final round of full model calibration and evaluation to ensure consistency with historical data is maintained with the complete set of between module feedbacks active parameter estimates are selected based on literature studies expert opinions local empirical data or if beforementioned information sources are not available best estimates by the modelers parameters with high uncertainty regarding their true values and with high impact on simulation results were numerically estimated using powell optimization powell 2009 the squared error between simulated and observed timeseries is used as payoff function in the parameter estimation process and results are evaluated quantitatively using theil inequality coefficients sterman 1984 and qualitatively by comparing the derived parameter estimates with ranges suggested in the literature and by local experts for a complete list of calibration inputs and outputs see appendix b due to lack of data on historical groundwater levels in the municipal aquifer a two step procedure is used for groundwater calibration first the aquifer structure presented in section 3 1 2 is calibrated to 25 years of data 1971 1996 on historical groundwater levels from an aquifer in southern sweden sgu 2020 that has similar geological and landcover characteristics as those found on fårö this step ensures that the structure can replicate the general groundwater dynamics of the aquifer in a second round of calibration the pre calibrated structure is finetuned to represent the municipal aquifer on fårö by optimizing its fit to available data on municipal groundwater extraction between 2000 and 2020 calibration results are presented in section 4 1 3 3 experimental set up for future climate two climate scenarios are considered representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 ipcc 2013 in the rcp4 5 scenario we assume depending on season a 2 11 increase in monthly mean precipitation and a 0 96 1 24 c increase in monthly mean temperature between 2020 and 2050 in the rcp8 5 scenario the corresponding values are a 5 11 increase in precipitation and a 1 6 1 32 c increase in temperature asp et al 2015 for future solar radiation we use monthly averages from the past 12 years smhi 2021 and for future mean monthly wind speed we use historic averages alexandersson 2006 we assume new house constructions will continue to occur primarily outside the public water grid and in the tourist sector we expect the growth in demand for hotels and other tourist facilities to continue at the same rate as seen in the past 20 years lastly we assume that water transports will continue to be the main municipal strategy to cover seasonal peaks in water demand to handle the uncertainty embedded in long term policy and strategy planning it is necessary to explore a wide ensemble of plausible futures and let the full outcome space inform the decision making process bankes 1993 to this end we carry out multivariate monte carlo mc simulations varying model parameters governing future climate precipitation and temperature housing supply and demand future demand for houses price elasticity of demand price elasticity of supply and price sensitivity of the ratio between demand and supply groundwater chloride levels effect of groundwater level on chloride concentration the effect of chloride levels on tourism and house expansion effect of chloride concentration on house construction and per capita water use affluence effect on water use the parameters included in the mc analysis and their associated ranges are selected based on extensive partial model sensitivity testing and the availability of reliable empirical or literature based estimates in other words parameters that show a significant effect on simulation outputs and a high uncertainty with regards to their true values were included in the mc analysis see appendix c for a full list of parameters distributions and ranges chosen we simulate the model 1000 times with randomly selected parameter values taken from predefined probability distributions within specified ranges results are reported as outcome ranges bounded by the 95 confidence intervals and the mean of the 1000 simulations is used to study long term trends in groundwater levels using the seasonally adjusted mann kendall trend test mcleod 2011 to assess the effect of future climate on groundwater levels we compare the results from our mc simulations to the simulated groundwater regimes in two reference periods p1 p2 p1 is the period 1961 1990 a commonly used reference in climate impact assessments asp et al 2015 sjökvist et al 2015 p2 is the more recent period 2000 2020 comparison against pl gives a long term perspective of the groundwater regime in the future and makes our results comparable to those of other studies but it is less relevant for planning and policy purposes p2 is the period during which water scarcity has developed into a problem on fårö and is therefore a more relevant reference for policy makers when assessing the impacts of future groundwater levels additionally for planning and management purposes an indication of variations and the risk of extreme events is equally if not more important than the average trajectory suggested by the mc ensemble mccollum et al 2020 we therefore calculate the probability of future extreme groundwater drawdowns defined as the fraction of simulated scenarios where the groundwater head reaches a level more extreme than the 2 5th percentile of its range in p1 and p2 or more extreme than the lowest groundwater level experienced in either p1 or p2 to assess the implications of changes in future groundwater quality and availability on the housing and tourism sectors we compare the results from the mc analysis with a simulated scenario where housing and tourism development is not constrained by water availability in other words we simulate a scenario where the growth of the two sectors is allowed to reach its full potential and we use this as our baseline for assessing the impact of water scarcity on socioeconomic development in the region 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration results our calibration results show an overall acceptable fit to available hydrological and socioeconomic data fig 10 most importantly the model captures the general trends of increasing summer water use and growing reliance on water transports furthermore the mean absolute error mae of the groundwater simulations is low 12 and 48 cm for the municipal and private aquifers respectively with most of the error caused by unequal covariance between the observed and simulated timeseries 98 and 56 for the municipal and private aquifers respectively this indicates a low level of systematic error and provides confidence that the model is capable of replicating the dominating behavior trends in the hydrological system sterman 1984 summary statistics for the calibration results are presented in table 1 4 2 effects of future climate on groundwater storage and groundwater quality the mean of our mc ensemble shows that groundwater levels in both public and private aquifers on fårö are likely to remain within the range seen in the previous 20 year period p2 fig 11 a slight but statistically significant p 0 05 increasing trend in groundwater storage in both aquifer types can be seen from 2030 these trends aside compared to the reference period p1 the projected groundwater levels remain critically low suggesting continuation of the decades long regime of low groundwater storage these results are in line with findings in monitoring studies conducted by sgu that most aquifers on gotland have been at historically low levels for most of the time since the turn of the millennium sgu 2021a therefore the slight increase in groundwater storage suggested by our simulations is from a historically low level and should not be interpreted as a return to some long term historical normal both aquifer types show substantial variation in groundwater levels between the upper and lower bound of the simulated outcome space fig 11 the difference between the higher and lower confidence interval is up to 90 cm in the public aquifer and about 180 cm in private aquifers it is important to acknowledge that the confidence bounds do not represent individual scenarios from the mc analysis rather they mark extreme values taken by any of the 1000 independent simulations and should therefore be interpreted as plausible ranges within which groundwater levels are likely to fluctuate in the coming 30 years analyzing the extremes of the outcome space makes this clear table 2 between 2020 and 2050 a groundwater level more extreme than the lowest level ever experienced since 1961 occurs at least once in between 60 and 70 of the simulated scenarios on average such an extreme month occurs 14 times for the public aquifer and four times for private aquifers in the 30 year period months with groundwater levels lower than the 95 range of p1 and p2 occur at least once in more than 80 of the scenarios or on average 211 and 36 times for the public aquifer and 31 and 10 times for private aquifers like the groundwater level the ensemble mean suggests no significant change in chloride concentrations compared with the p2 period however because of the high probability of recurring periods with low groundwater levels it is likely that the number of households experiencing occasional water quality issues will increase in the coming decades likewise between year variation in groundwater chloride sd 45 9 mg l cl can result in some locations in years with high groundwater levels shifting from being just above to just below the building permit threshold 100 mg l cl and thereby increase the potential for new housing projects the low spatial resolution of available data does not allow us to identify in what locations on fårö large fluctuations in chloride levels are most likely however previous studies by dahlqvist et al 2015 have shown that there are substantial geographical variations in chloride base levels across the island accounting for both the spatial and temporal variability in groundwater chloride concentration when issuing new building permits is important to avoid an accumulation of houses in risk zones during periods when chloride levels are low to mitigate this risk further studies exploring spatial variation in chloride responsiveness to groundwater fluctuations are needed so that locations with acceptable and stable groundwater quality can be identified for future building projects 4 3 socioeconomic impacts 4 3 1 impacts on the housing sector our mc ensemble mean suggests that by 2050 the total number of households on fårö will be between 2300 and 3100 compared to about 1300 in 2020 table 3 most of the variation arises from uncertainty about future housing demand and about the strength of influence that groundwater chloride levels have on housing construction rates on average between 40 and 50 of well sites will have chloride levels exceeding 100 mg l in the coming decades but at the extreme of the simulated outcome space that is during periods of severely low groundwater levels as described in section 4 1 the proportion can be as high as 75 for parts of the island detailed assessment of the impacts this would have on the housing sector requires further investigation of what areas that are attractive for housing development and how these areas correlate with risk zones for high chloride levels in lack of this type of detailed spatial information we make the simplifying assumption that housing development projects are homogenously distributed across the island if this holds true elevated chloride levels will pose a constraint for future housing development increase housing prices and reduce the number of households in 2050 by 4 11 compared with the unconstrained scenario where chloride levels have no effect on housing development for a region like fårö a 4 11 reduction in housing development is significant for many years rg has been striving towards increasing the number of permanent residents on the island through initiatives to enhance the availability of affordable housing despite these initiatives reports by rg suggest that the high demand for summer houses primarily by financially strong consumers from other regions of sweden have contributed to driving up house prices beyond what is affordable for the majority of the local community brunner 2014 this effect has been confirmed by previous studies showing how tourism intensification can lead to increase in local house prices paramati and roca 2019 and limit the availability of affordable housing for the local community mikulić et al 2021 our results suggest that future constraints in water availability could enhance these effects as the decline in housing availability that this would cause could contribute to further escalation of house prices 4 3 2 impacts on the tourist sector the tourist sector is expected to grow from about 800 beds in 2020 to between 1000 and 1300 beds by 2050 table 3 the rate of growth is constrained by sustained low water self sufficiency on the public grid causing current restrictions on new connections to be maintained see section 4 2 3 this restraint leads to the establishment of a growing number of tourist accommodation sites relying on water from private wells instead of the municipal grid the growth rate of these off grid facilities experiences the same water quality constraints as the housing sector described in section 4 2 1 controlling for other factors water supply limitations cause a 10 30 reduction in tourism growth compared with the unconstrained scenario as a whole the proportion of tourist facilities relying on the municipal water system declines but counterintuitively in absolute terms the tourist sector demand for water from the municipal grid continues to increase this is due to a significant share of tourism water consumption resulting from activities not associated with accommodation for example tourism water use arising in restaurant kitchens spas and laundry facilities accumulates to on average 10 30 liters per guest night according to studies by gossling et al 2012 on fårö these facilities typically are connected to the public water grid and therefore continues to tax the public water system despite the accommodation facilities having their own wells these spillover effects will cause an increase in the absolute municipal water use by the tourist sector despite a growing number of tourist facilities having their own water supply we argue that this is a challenge that is not unique to our case study introducing alternative water supply solutions e g private wells on top of an already existing centralized water supply system e g the public grid is likely to increase water use in the centralized system in the long run if it leads to an increase in the total number of consumers and the water use of the new consumers is not confined to their private taps 4 3 3 impacts on the municipal water system persistence of the low groundwater regime experienced in the past 20 years will continue to limit groundwater extraction from the municipal aquifer and result in continued dependence on summertime supplementary water transports as described in section 4 2 2 growing water use in the tourist sector combined with higher summer water use due to warmer temperatures causes water transports to increase steadily throughout the simulation fig 12 by 2050 yearly water transports on average reach close to 4000 cubic meters per year compared with the hitherto highest observed value of 3000 cubic meters with a confidence bound ranging from 2200 to 5400 cubic meters table 3 a remarkable aspect of these results is that the local municipal water supply is insufficient to meet demand for the entire outcome space this suggests that even in the most optimistic climate scenario from a water supply perspective maintaining the current trajectory of socioeconomic development will cause sustained reliance on supplementary water transports additionally the high proportion of households with permanent or periodically elevated chloride levels is likely to result in increased pressure on the municipality to expand the borders of the municipal water management area and provide water services to more communities on the island this would require substantial investments in infrastructure and further increase the reliance on supplementary water transports for fårö to become water self sufficient a fundamental change in water supply solutions growth strategy and water use efficiency is needed for instance the current water supply system is completely reliant on groundwater making it vulnerable to declines in both groundwater levels and groundwater quality schramm and felmeden 2012 diversifying the portfolio of local water sources can reduce this vulnerability by making the system more resilient to unexpected climate events and the large fluctuations in groundwater availability that our simulations project daigger and crawford 2007 leigh and lee 2019 rainwater stormwater and graywater are all potential sources of usable water that are not leveraged in most municipalities across the nordic region utilizing these as alternatives for non potable purposes can reduce water demand from conventional sources by an estimated 30 60 biggs et al 2009 zadeh et al 2013 these solutions can improve overall resource efficiency and increase redundancy by not wasting drinking quality water on uses with lower quality requirements e g irrigation and toilet flushing reducing groundwater extraction also serves to maintain environmental flows that are critical for the health of freshwater dependent ecosystems leigh and lee 2019 and it can significantly reduce energy demand for water treatment and transfer xue et al 2016 several studies have concluded that because of their low energy costs short construction times and low capital intensity decentralized solutions making use of alternative water sources are compatible and often economically superior to conventional centralized alternatives brown et al 2011 leigh and lee 2019 on the other hand a cost benefit analysis conducted by sjöstrand et al 2019 comparing different water scarcity abatement measures in the gotland region concluded increased centralized groundwater extraction to be the most cost effective solution for the region however the analysis by sjöstrand et al 2019 like most conventional approaches for both economic and sustainability policy assessment are based on a static view of the system lindqvist et al 2019 that is the system is assumed not to evolve or change over time and factors such as resilience to climate variability effects of synergies and interactions between interventions and socioeconomic feedbacks are not accounted for in the assessment our simulation results clearly show that such a static assumption is misleading and based on previous studies can compromise the sustainability and resilience of future water systems leigh and lee 2019 lindqvist et al 2021 we call for further studies on fårö and elsewhere to reassess alternative water supply solutions some of which we have briefly mentioned utilizing the type of feedback rich dynamic socio hydrological system models we have developed in this study to identify sustainable and resilient pathways to mitigate future water scarcity 5 conclusions we present a combined social and hydrological model using multivariate mc simulations to explore the effects of future climate and socioeconomic mechanisms on local supply and demand for drinking water on the swedish island of fårö our results suggest given the available projections of future climate for the region that the period with historically low groundwater levels experienced in the last decades will be sustained and the probability of recurring periods with the groundwater table reaching lower levels than hitherto ever experienced is high the low groundwater levels will limit water availability and increase the risk of saltwater contamination of drinking water wells this will constrain growth in the housing sector by 4 11 and the tourist sector by 10 30 and maintain municipal reliance on supplementary water transports in summer months the tourist sector will become increasingly reliant on private wells to support growth but spillover effects will continue to increase consumption of municipal water and yearly municipal water transports to our knowledge this is the first study to explore local impacts of future climate using an integrated social and hydrological model in the scandinavian region as in many other studies rusli et al 2021 tegegne et al 2017 poor availability of local hydrological and water use data poses a challenge to model development for the region for instance limited data on historical groundwater levels and lack of spatially referenced water quality samples make spatially disaggregated modeling of future groundwater levels impossible this necessitates a more exploratory modeling approach investigating broad parameter ranges and presenting results in terms of outcome spaces rather than narrow predictions bankes 1993 these limitations aside our results provide important insights about the range of plausible futures that should be accounted for in local to regional water resource management and planning ensuring water self sufficiency across the full outcome space will require investments targeting resilience in the water supply system this can be achieved by leveraging alternative water sources improving water use efficiency and by accounting for socio hydrological dynamics in the planning and management of future water system we believe that the work presented here can support this necessary transition on fårö and serve as a steppingstone for further climate impact and adaptation research in the nordic region funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding

7955,study region fårö island part of region gotland sweden study focus despite its importance for proactive planning and management understanding of how future climate and socioeconomic trends may interact to influence water supply and demand at sub regional scale remains limited for the nordic region we aim to close this knowledge gap by developing a combined social and hydrological simulation model for fårö island in the baltic sea we use multivariate monte carlo simulations to explore the effects of future climate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 on local groundwater supplies and subsequent impacts on the housing sector tourism sector and municipal water supply system in the period 2020 2050 new hydrological insights for the region our results suggest that groundwater storage will remain critically low in the coming 30 years with a 60 70 probability of the groundwater head falling to lower levels than experienced in the past 60 years low water availability and widespread saltwater intrusion will constrain housing and tourism development by up to 11 and 30 respectively to sustain growth the tourist sector will become increasingly reliant on water from private wells and supplementary water deliveries from neighboring regions will be required to meet water demand on the municipal grid keywords climate change groundwater water scarcity system dynamics socioeconomic impact 1 introduction water scarcity is a problem with impacts for human health economic development and ecosystems in many regions around the world rijsberman 2006 wimmer et al 2015 it is estimated that up to 50 of the global population will experience seasonal or permanent water insecurity by 2050 caused by a combination of changes in climate urban and rural development and population growth united nations 2018 understanding how trends in climate and socioeconomic development interact to influence water supply and demand across space and time is of great importance to support mitigation and adaptation to water scarcity united nations 2018 building relevant knowledge is challenging however as climate driven impacts on water resources have been shown to differ substantially both between and within geographical regions bessah et al 2020 wu et al 2020 furthermore studies in recent years have demonstrated that understanding the interplay between social and hydrological systems is an important component in long term sustainable management of water resources di baldassarre et al 2019 although much progress has been made in developing macro level theories about the mechanisms of socio hydrological dynamics di baldassarre et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2012 place specific understanding of human water systems remains limited xu et al 2018 most previous studies assessing the local interplay between climate hydrology and the social system have focused on regions with a long history of water scarcity such as the mediterranean region darvini and memmola 2020 fabre et al 2015 the middle east gohari et al 2013 australia van emmerik et al 2014 parts of the us fernald et al 2012 and different parts of africa bessah et al 2020 fraser et al 2011 the nordic region is poorly represented in such research partly because freshwater has historically been a plentiful resource in the region however with the anticipated effects of climate change there is reason to suspect that the nordic region will not be spared from water scarcity for much longer indeed unusually dry summers in recent years have caused periods of local to regional seasonal water scarcity even in typically water abundant areas ahopelto et al 2019 stensen et al 2019 moreover recent reports project that the frequency intensity and duration of seasonal water shortages will continue to increase in the coming decades asp et al 2015 to enable proactive and robust water management strategies to be developed for the nordic region improved local understanding of the combined effects of climate and socioeconomic change on water supply and demand is essential in this paper we contribute to this end by presenting results from a case study exploring how climate and socioeconomic processes interact to influence supply and demand for drinking water on the swedish island of fårö we develop a simulation model of the hydrological and socioeconomic mechanisms governing water supply and demand drawing on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data sources the model calibrated to 20 years of historical data is used in simulation experiments investigating how projected changes in climate are likely to influence water supply and water quality in the coming 30 years we then explore the implications of these changes for the three largest water dependent stakeholders on the island the municipality the tourism sector and the housing sector the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly describe the study area and provide an account of how challenges related to drinking water supply and demand have developed in the past 20 years we present the expected changes in regional climate in the coming 30 year and we define the aim of this study in section 3 we outline the model development process and provide a high level description of the model structure we also present the model calibration process and we describe the experimental set up used to explore the hydrological and socioeconomic implications of future climate scenarios in section 4 calibration results are summarized and we present and discuss the results from the simulation experiments we first describe climate effects on groundwater supply and then the impact of these effects on households tourism and the municipal water supply system we also highlight some limitations of the study and consider areas for future research to support local water resources management and planning in section 5 we summarize our key findings 2 the study area fårö is a small island 114 km2 in the baltic sea 57 9 n 19 1 e belonging to the swedish municipality of gotland fig 1 the island has an average summer and winter temperature of 16 c and 2 c respectively and yearly precipitation of 500 600 mm smhi retrieved 3 february 2021 the main industries are tourism and agriculture and the population consists of about 300 permanent households and 1000 holiday households lantmäteriet 2021 drinking water is obtained exclusively from groundwater sources mostly from private wells drilled into the limestone dominated bedrock the soil layer is shallow 0 2 m across most of the island except for an area in the northeast where layers of coarse grained sandy soil up to 20 m deep make up one of the few large aquifers in the region this aquifer provides water to the municipal grid which serves most tourist facilities and about 50 residential households brunner 2014 rivera and ridderstolpe 2011 sjöstrand et al 2014 in recent decades fårö has become a popular holiday destination with a growing tourism sector fig 2a in the high season june august about 10 000 tourists and part time residents visit the island brunner 2014 water use has thus increased over time 1 1 monthly data on groundwater extraction water supply capacity and water transport volumes are classified information and can therefore not be displayed in the paper mikael tiouls region gotland personal communication 7 december 2021 for inquiries about the data please contact region gotland fig 2b between 2000 and 2020 water use on the municipal grid increased from about 5500 9500 cubic meters per year in fact since 2006 water supply from the municipal aquifer has been insufficient to meet demand in the summer period requiring supplementary transport of water from other regions of gotland to secure supply on the municipal grid1 fig 2c in 2006 in total 1500 cubic meters of supplementary drinking water was transported to fårö and by 2019 the figure had doubled to just above 3000 cubic meters within the private water sector the number of holiday homes has also increased over time and increasing incidence of saltwater intrusion into private wells has been detected magnus pettersson region gotland personal communication 25 january 2021 the growing reliance on transported water and the problem of saltwater intrusion create challenges for the municipality the tourist sector and private households for the municipality reliance on transported water is a risk as it makes the island vulnerable to disturbances such as delivery delays strikes or unexpected peaks in water consumption the municipal water supply has already come close to running out on several occasions because of fluctuations in demand and delivery delays for the tourist sector water supply constraints can limit growth and development in the past ten years establishment of new tourist facilities has been delayed or even canceled because of insufficient water supplies rolf lindvall sudersand resort personal communication 15 october 2020 for the housing sector salt contamination of groundwater sources restricts new housing developments as building permits are not issued in locations with elevated chloride levels gotlands kommun 2008 further if salt intrusion becomes widespread among households outside the public grid the municipality may become legally required to extend its water management area and provide water services to communities currently outside the public grid swedish environment and energy department 2007 this could lead to a significant increase in demand for municipal water and could potentially require substantial investments in water transport or alternative water supply technologies 2 1 aim of study between 2020 and 2050 climate change is expected to increase regional mean temperature by approximately 1 0 1 3 c and increase precipitation by 2 10 compared with the past 20 year period asp et al 2015 in this study we investigate how these changes are likely to influence local water supply and water quality and explore the interplay with existing water supply challenges on fårö island the aim is to improve understanding of the local level impacts of climate change and provide input for proactive water resources planning and management in a hitherto poorly studied region 3 material methods 3 1 model development we develop a combined social and hydrological simulation model of the key mechanisms driving water supply and demand on fårö in stella architect by isee systems lebanon usa following the system dynamics modeling method pruyt 2006 sterman 2000 the model consists of six interconnected submodules climate public water supply private water supply household water use tourism water use and public water supply demand balance fig 3 and simulates from 2000 to 2050 at time units of one month the causal structure of the model is based on a qualitative modeling study conducted by lindqvist et al 2021 exploring the drivers of water scarcity on fårö additional scrutiny of the scientific literature and municipal reports and repeated consultations and validation meetings with the department of water management at region gotland throughout the modeling process are used to cross validate the structural and operational representation of the water management system in the model an overview of the structure data inputs and data outputs for each submodule is presented in sections 3 1 1 3 1 6 for full model documentation see the appendix a 3 1 1 climate the climate module fig 4 imports monthly data on temperature precipitation solar radiation and wind speed and calculates potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith method penman and keen 1948 the effect of temperature on per capita water use is also calculated assuming that water use increases by 2 for every c by which the daily maximum temperature of the month exceeds 15 c dimkić 2020 outputs to other submodules are precipitation pet and effect of temperature on per capita water use for the historical period 2000 2020 we use observation data from local weather stations smhi 2021 as climate inputs for the future period 2020 2050 we used projected values provided by smhi asp et al 2015 these projections were produced by the regional climate model rca4 strandberg et al 2014 by downscaling and averaging across an ensemble of climate scenarios produced by nine global climate models canesm2 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m ec earth ipsl cm5a mr miroc5 mpi ems lr noresmi1 m and hadgem2 es sjökvist et al 2015 for the two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ipcc 2013 see appendix a for details to simulate between year variations in future climate inputs we sample future precipitation temperature and solar radiation values from their respective probability density functions parameterized using the smhi projected mean and historic standard deviation values 3 1 2 public water supply the public water supply module fig 5 simulates the dynamics of the public water supply system including the hydrology of the municipal aquifer and groundwater pumping in municipal wells the aquifer is modeled using budyko based methods for water balance modeling as described by zhang et al 2008 adapted to meet the requirement of unit consistency under system dynamics modeling conventions sterman 2000 in the model the aquifer consists of two connected cylindrical stocks the top representing soil storage and the bottom representing groundwater storage the dynamics of the stocks are governed by the flows of infiltration evapotranspiration recharge deep evapotranspiration base flow horizontal groundwater flow and extraction infiltration is calculated as a nonlinear function of the demand supply relationship between the level of the soil storage stock demand and the incoming precipitation supply zhang et al 2008 as the saturation level of the soil storage stock decreases the proportion of precipitation partitioned to infiltration asymptotically approaches one the shape of the partitioning curve is governed by the rainfall retention capacity of the catchment a model parameter representing the physical capacity of the soil and vegetation of the aquifer to retain water zhang et al 2008 the outflow from soil storage is partitioned between evapotranspiration and recharge according to similar functions as applied for infiltration evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of the relationship between soil storage and pet and recharge as function of the relationship between soil storage and the storage capacity of the aquifer as soil storage increases recharge will also increase and evapotranspiration will approach pet the relative proportion of available water that goes to recharge or evapotranspiration is controlled by the evapotranspiration efficiency of the catchment higher evapotranspiration efficiency means that more available water goes to evapotranspiration and less to recharge zhang et al 2008 the deep evapotranspiration flow ensures that if the groundwater level approaches the shallow soil layer groundwater also becomes available for evapotranspiration yeh and famiglietti 2009 the groundwater base flow is modeled as the product of the groundwater storage and a constant discharge factor and the extraction flow represents groundwater extraction by pumping by municipal wells extraction is set equal to desired extraction calculated in the public water supply demand balance module if the groundwater level in the aquifer remains above the average depth in the municipal wells as the groundwater level approaches the depth in the municipal wells extraction declines linearly lastly the horizontal groundwater flow represents the exchange of water between the municipal aquifer and its surroundings this allows groundwater storage to adjust to the groundwater level in surrounding catchments and is calculated using darcy s flow equation hillel 2004 3 1 3 private water supply the private water supply module fig 6 simulates the groundwater dynamics and the chloride concentration in aquifers outside the public water system the water balance structure is similar to and uses the same climate inputs as that presented in section 3 1 2 but it only accounts for natural water fluxes infiltration evapotranspiration recharge deep evapotranspiration and baseflow extraction is deliberately excluded because of lack of reliable data on historical extraction rates and because water quality measured by chloride concentration rather than water quantity has historically been the determining factor of household water supply magnus pettersson region gotland personal communication 25 october 2021 horizontal groundwater flow is also excluded from the private water supply module assuming homogeneous groundwater levels across the island groundwater chloride concentration represents the average chloride level in groundwater across the island and is calculated as a linear function of the groundwater level using the basictrendline package mei and yu 2020 in rstudio r development core team 2019 the linear model was calibrated using five years of groundwater level data and data on chloride levels in 328 water samples from across the island yielding a statistically significant negative effect of groundwater level on chloride concentration p 0 01 the groundwater chloride concentration is used to estimate the proportion of well sites with chloride levels exceeding the recommended limit values set by the swedish food agency 2017 100 and 300 mg l chloride cl as limit values for technical and drinking use respectively and the maximum permissible chloride concentration when granting building permits 100 mg l cl the proportion of well sites exceeding the limiting value at any given chloride level is obtained by linear 100 mg l cl and nonlinear 300 mg l cl regression mei and yu 2020 with the groundwater chloride concentration as the independent variable and the fraction of samples above 100 mg l cl p 0 05 and 300 mg l cl p 0 01 as dependent variables the effect of chloride concentration on house construction represents the limiting effect of groundwater chloride levels on new construction in the housing and tourism sector if groundwater chloride concentration increases fewer building permits will be issued and construction rates will decline 3 1 4 household water use in the household water use module fig 7 the size of the household sector and total household water use is calculated the total housing stock is divided into two groups k based on the water source public water or private well and each group is further segmented into two types j based on utilization permanent or part time new houses are added to the system by the flow construction starts which adds to the stock of houses under construction the rate of construction starts is influenced positively by higher housing prices and negatively by the effect of chloride concentration on house construction after a 12 month time delay representing the house construction time houses flow from the houses under construction stock to the housing stock via the construction finalization flow construction starts is governed by a simple supply demand structure where a stock of potential buyers is compared to the number of houses finalized each month to give a demand supply ratio that is used to set the housing price the base rate at which new buyers are added to the potential buyers stock is set using exogenous data on housing demand based on data on building permits issued between 2000 and 2020 scb 2021 and the stock is drained at the rate of construction finalization the housing price is used as an indicator of household affluence englund 2011 and it influences the quantity demand for houses by regulating the flow of new buyers added to the potential buyers stock and the number of construction starts we use a price elasticity of demand and supply of 0 5 englund 2011 and 0 1 international monetary fund european dept 2015 respectively the number of houses in use at any given point in time depends on the household type and the duration of the tourist season permanent households are in constant use while the proportion of part time households in use is determined by multiplying the number of part time households by a tourist season utilization factor this factor takes values between zero and one depending on the time of the year here based on estimates by region gotland water use per household is the product of the number of residents per household and normal water use per capita 140 l person day swedish water 2020 and responds dynamically to changes in temperature through the effect of temperature on water use from the climate module dimkić 2020 and the level of household affluence höglund 1999 wiedmann et al 2020 the total household water use is the product of the number of houses in use and the water use per household and provides input to the public water supply demand balance module 3 1 5 tourism water use the tourism water use module fig 8 simulates the development of the tourist sector and its total water use the size of the tourist sector is measured by its bed capacity and it is modeled by a three compartment aging chain sterman 2000 consisting of the stocks beds planned beds on order and installed beds linked by the flows adding beds to plan ordering new beds and installing new beds the number of tourists is modeled as an additional stock that increases or decreases with the flow of net arrivals net arrivals fluctuate with the tourist season using the same tourist season utilization factor as in section 3 1 4 and respond to changes in destination attractiveness assumed constant in the base case scenario the number of beds added to the system each month is controlled by a goal gap function where the level of capacity utilization the ratio of tourists to installed beds is compared to a desired capacity utilization if capacity utilization exceeds desired capacity utilization this leads to an increase in desired expansion and an inflow to beds planned beds move in batches from beds planned through beds on order to installed beds with a total planning and construction delay of 24 months bed capacity investments are bounded by the water self sufficiency of the public grid and the possibility of tourist facilities to drill their own wells if public water self sufficiency is low water use restrictions calculated in the public water supply demand balance module section 3 1 6 will limit planning and investment in new bed capacity this will force tourist facilities to search for private water supply sources by drilling new wells making the groundwater chloride concentration the limiting factor for tourism growth total tourism water use is calculated as the product of normal water use per tourist the number of tourists and the effect of temperature on water use imported from the climate module and it provides input to the public water supply demand module 3 1 6 public water supply demand balance the public water supply demand balance module fig 9 sums up the total water use from the tourist sector with the total public water use in the household sector to calculate the total public water use the total public water use dictates the desired pumping from the public aquifer in the public water supply module section 3 1 2 and when multiplied by the consumer water price the municipal revenues from water tariffs desired extraction is compared to the actual groundwater extraction from the public water supply module to calculate a water supply deficit the deficit triggers water use restrictions that limit further expansion of the tourist sector section 3 1 5 and increases the volume and costs of water transports the difference between revenues and costs of the water supply system is used as an estimate of the net profits of the municipal drinking water system 3 2 model calibration calibration is conducted by varying module parameter inputs to optimize the fit of the simulation outputs to historical data on groundwater levels water use tourism and housing development provided by swedish metrological and hydrological institute smhi 2021 geological survey of sweden sgu 2021a 2021b statistics sweden scb 2021 and region gotland region gotland 2021a 2021b each submodule is first calibrated individually adhering to strategies for partial model calibration described by homer 2012 followed by a final round of full model calibration and evaluation to ensure consistency with historical data is maintained with the complete set of between module feedbacks active parameter estimates are selected based on literature studies expert opinions local empirical data or if beforementioned information sources are not available best estimates by the modelers parameters with high uncertainty regarding their true values and with high impact on simulation results were numerically estimated using powell optimization powell 2009 the squared error between simulated and observed timeseries is used as payoff function in the parameter estimation process and results are evaluated quantitatively using theil inequality coefficients sterman 1984 and qualitatively by comparing the derived parameter estimates with ranges suggested in the literature and by local experts for a complete list of calibration inputs and outputs see appendix b due to lack of data on historical groundwater levels in the municipal aquifer a two step procedure is used for groundwater calibration first the aquifer structure presented in section 3 1 2 is calibrated to 25 years of data 1971 1996 on historical groundwater levels from an aquifer in southern sweden sgu 2020 that has similar geological and landcover characteristics as those found on fårö this step ensures that the structure can replicate the general groundwater dynamics of the aquifer in a second round of calibration the pre calibrated structure is finetuned to represent the municipal aquifer on fårö by optimizing its fit to available data on municipal groundwater extraction between 2000 and 2020 calibration results are presented in section 4 1 3 3 experimental set up for future climate two climate scenarios are considered representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 ipcc 2013 in the rcp4 5 scenario we assume depending on season a 2 11 increase in monthly mean precipitation and a 0 96 1 24 c increase in monthly mean temperature between 2020 and 2050 in the rcp8 5 scenario the corresponding values are a 5 11 increase in precipitation and a 1 6 1 32 c increase in temperature asp et al 2015 for future solar radiation we use monthly averages from the past 12 years smhi 2021 and for future mean monthly wind speed we use historic averages alexandersson 2006 we assume new house constructions will continue to occur primarily outside the public water grid and in the tourist sector we expect the growth in demand for hotels and other tourist facilities to continue at the same rate as seen in the past 20 years lastly we assume that water transports will continue to be the main municipal strategy to cover seasonal peaks in water demand to handle the uncertainty embedded in long term policy and strategy planning it is necessary to explore a wide ensemble of plausible futures and let the full outcome space inform the decision making process bankes 1993 to this end we carry out multivariate monte carlo mc simulations varying model parameters governing future climate precipitation and temperature housing supply and demand future demand for houses price elasticity of demand price elasticity of supply and price sensitivity of the ratio between demand and supply groundwater chloride levels effect of groundwater level on chloride concentration the effect of chloride levels on tourism and house expansion effect of chloride concentration on house construction and per capita water use affluence effect on water use the parameters included in the mc analysis and their associated ranges are selected based on extensive partial model sensitivity testing and the availability of reliable empirical or literature based estimates in other words parameters that show a significant effect on simulation outputs and a high uncertainty with regards to their true values were included in the mc analysis see appendix c for a full list of parameters distributions and ranges chosen we simulate the model 1000 times with randomly selected parameter values taken from predefined probability distributions within specified ranges results are reported as outcome ranges bounded by the 95 confidence intervals and the mean of the 1000 simulations is used to study long term trends in groundwater levels using the seasonally adjusted mann kendall trend test mcleod 2011 to assess the effect of future climate on groundwater levels we compare the results from our mc simulations to the simulated groundwater regimes in two reference periods p1 p2 p1 is the period 1961 1990 a commonly used reference in climate impact assessments asp et al 2015 sjökvist et al 2015 p2 is the more recent period 2000 2020 comparison against pl gives a long term perspective of the groundwater regime in the future and makes our results comparable to those of other studies but it is less relevant for planning and policy purposes p2 is the period during which water scarcity has developed into a problem on fårö and is therefore a more relevant reference for policy makers when assessing the impacts of future groundwater levels additionally for planning and management purposes an indication of variations and the risk of extreme events is equally if not more important than the average trajectory suggested by the mc ensemble mccollum et al 2020 we therefore calculate the probability of future extreme groundwater drawdowns defined as the fraction of simulated scenarios where the groundwater head reaches a level more extreme than the 2 5th percentile of its range in p1 and p2 or more extreme than the lowest groundwater level experienced in either p1 or p2 to assess the implications of changes in future groundwater quality and availability on the housing and tourism sectors we compare the results from the mc analysis with a simulated scenario where housing and tourism development is not constrained by water availability in other words we simulate a scenario where the growth of the two sectors is allowed to reach its full potential and we use this as our baseline for assessing the impact of water scarcity on socioeconomic development in the region 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration results our calibration results show an overall acceptable fit to available hydrological and socioeconomic data fig 10 most importantly the model captures the general trends of increasing summer water use and growing reliance on water transports furthermore the mean absolute error mae of the groundwater simulations is low 12 and 48 cm for the municipal and private aquifers respectively with most of the error caused by unequal covariance between the observed and simulated timeseries 98 and 56 for the municipal and private aquifers respectively this indicates a low level of systematic error and provides confidence that the model is capable of replicating the dominating behavior trends in the hydrological system sterman 1984 summary statistics for the calibration results are presented in table 1 4 2 effects of future climate on groundwater storage and groundwater quality the mean of our mc ensemble shows that groundwater levels in both public and private aquifers on fårö are likely to remain within the range seen in the previous 20 year period p2 fig 11 a slight but statistically significant p 0 05 increasing trend in groundwater storage in both aquifer types can be seen from 2030 these trends aside compared to the reference period p1 the projected groundwater levels remain critically low suggesting continuation of the decades long regime of low groundwater storage these results are in line with findings in monitoring studies conducted by sgu that most aquifers on gotland have been at historically low levels for most of the time since the turn of the millennium sgu 2021a therefore the slight increase in groundwater storage suggested by our simulations is from a historically low level and should not be interpreted as a return to some long term historical normal both aquifer types show substantial variation in groundwater levels between the upper and lower bound of the simulated outcome space fig 11 the difference between the higher and lower confidence interval is up to 90 cm in the public aquifer and about 180 cm in private aquifers it is important to acknowledge that the confidence bounds do not represent individual scenarios from the mc analysis rather they mark extreme values taken by any of the 1000 independent simulations and should therefore be interpreted as plausible ranges within which groundwater levels are likely to fluctuate in the coming 30 years analyzing the extremes of the outcome space makes this clear table 2 between 2020 and 2050 a groundwater level more extreme than the lowest level ever experienced since 1961 occurs at least once in between 60 and 70 of the simulated scenarios on average such an extreme month occurs 14 times for the public aquifer and four times for private aquifers in the 30 year period months with groundwater levels lower than the 95 range of p1 and p2 occur at least once in more than 80 of the scenarios or on average 211 and 36 times for the public aquifer and 31 and 10 times for private aquifers like the groundwater level the ensemble mean suggests no significant change in chloride concentrations compared with the p2 period however because of the high probability of recurring periods with low groundwater levels it is likely that the number of households experiencing occasional water quality issues will increase in the coming decades likewise between year variation in groundwater chloride sd 45 9 mg l cl can result in some locations in years with high groundwater levels shifting from being just above to just below the building permit threshold 100 mg l cl and thereby increase the potential for new housing projects the low spatial resolution of available data does not allow us to identify in what locations on fårö large fluctuations in chloride levels are most likely however previous studies by dahlqvist et al 2015 have shown that there are substantial geographical variations in chloride base levels across the island accounting for both the spatial and temporal variability in groundwater chloride concentration when issuing new building permits is important to avoid an accumulation of houses in risk zones during periods when chloride levels are low to mitigate this risk further studies exploring spatial variation in chloride responsiveness to groundwater fluctuations are needed so that locations with acceptable and stable groundwater quality can be identified for future building projects 4 3 socioeconomic impacts 4 3 1 impacts on the housing sector our mc ensemble mean suggests that by 2050 the total number of households on fårö will be between 2300 and 3100 compared to about 1300 in 2020 table 3 most of the variation arises from uncertainty about future housing demand and about the strength of influence that groundwater chloride levels have on housing construction rates on average between 40 and 50 of well sites will have chloride levels exceeding 100 mg l in the coming decades but at the extreme of the simulated outcome space that is during periods of severely low groundwater levels as described in section 4 1 the proportion can be as high as 75 for parts of the island detailed assessment of the impacts this would have on the housing sector requires further investigation of what areas that are attractive for housing development and how these areas correlate with risk zones for high chloride levels in lack of this type of detailed spatial information we make the simplifying assumption that housing development projects are homogenously distributed across the island if this holds true elevated chloride levels will pose a constraint for future housing development increase housing prices and reduce the number of households in 2050 by 4 11 compared with the unconstrained scenario where chloride levels have no effect on housing development for a region like fårö a 4 11 reduction in housing development is significant for many years rg has been striving towards increasing the number of permanent residents on the island through initiatives to enhance the availability of affordable housing despite these initiatives reports by rg suggest that the high demand for summer houses primarily by financially strong consumers from other regions of sweden have contributed to driving up house prices beyond what is affordable for the majority of the local community brunner 2014 this effect has been confirmed by previous studies showing how tourism intensification can lead to increase in local house prices paramati and roca 2019 and limit the availability of affordable housing for the local community mikulić et al 2021 our results suggest that future constraints in water availability could enhance these effects as the decline in housing availability that this would cause could contribute to further escalation of house prices 4 3 2 impacts on the tourist sector the tourist sector is expected to grow from about 800 beds in 2020 to between 1000 and 1300 beds by 2050 table 3 the rate of growth is constrained by sustained low water self sufficiency on the public grid causing current restrictions on new connections to be maintained see section 4 2 3 this restraint leads to the establishment of a growing number of tourist accommodation sites relying on water from private wells instead of the municipal grid the growth rate of these off grid facilities experiences the same water quality constraints as the housing sector described in section 4 2 1 controlling for other factors water supply limitations cause a 10 30 reduction in tourism growth compared with the unconstrained scenario as a whole the proportion of tourist facilities relying on the municipal water system declines but counterintuitively in absolute terms the tourist sector demand for water from the municipal grid continues to increase this is due to a significant share of tourism water consumption resulting from activities not associated with accommodation for example tourism water use arising in restaurant kitchens spas and laundry facilities accumulates to on average 10 30 liters per guest night according to studies by gossling et al 2012 on fårö these facilities typically are connected to the public water grid and therefore continues to tax the public water system despite the accommodation facilities having their own wells these spillover effects will cause an increase in the absolute municipal water use by the tourist sector despite a growing number of tourist facilities having their own water supply we argue that this is a challenge that is not unique to our case study introducing alternative water supply solutions e g private wells on top of an already existing centralized water supply system e g the public grid is likely to increase water use in the centralized system in the long run if it leads to an increase in the total number of consumers and the water use of the new consumers is not confined to their private taps 4 3 3 impacts on the municipal water system persistence of the low groundwater regime experienced in the past 20 years will continue to limit groundwater extraction from the municipal aquifer and result in continued dependence on summertime supplementary water transports as described in section 4 2 2 growing water use in the tourist sector combined with higher summer water use due to warmer temperatures causes water transports to increase steadily throughout the simulation fig 12 by 2050 yearly water transports on average reach close to 4000 cubic meters per year compared with the hitherto highest observed value of 3000 cubic meters with a confidence bound ranging from 2200 to 5400 cubic meters table 3 a remarkable aspect of these results is that the local municipal water supply is insufficient to meet demand for the entire outcome space this suggests that even in the most optimistic climate scenario from a water supply perspective maintaining the current trajectory of socioeconomic development will cause sustained reliance on supplementary water transports additionally the high proportion of households with permanent or periodically elevated chloride levels is likely to result in increased pressure on the municipality to expand the borders of the municipal water management area and provide water services to more communities on the island this would require substantial investments in infrastructure and further increase the reliance on supplementary water transports for fårö to become water self sufficient a fundamental change in water supply solutions growth strategy and water use efficiency is needed for instance the current water supply system is completely reliant on groundwater making it vulnerable to declines in both groundwater levels and groundwater quality schramm and felmeden 2012 diversifying the portfolio of local water sources can reduce this vulnerability by making the system more resilient to unexpected climate events and the large fluctuations in groundwater availability that our simulations project daigger and crawford 2007 leigh and lee 2019 rainwater stormwater and graywater are all potential sources of usable water that are not leveraged in most municipalities across the nordic region utilizing these as alternatives for non potable purposes can reduce water demand from conventional sources by an estimated 30 60 biggs et al 2009 zadeh et al 2013 these solutions can improve overall resource efficiency and increase redundancy by not wasting drinking quality water on uses with lower quality requirements e g irrigation and toilet flushing reducing groundwater extraction also serves to maintain environmental flows that are critical for the health of freshwater dependent ecosystems leigh and lee 2019 and it can significantly reduce energy demand for water treatment and transfer xue et al 2016 several studies have concluded that because of their low energy costs short construction times and low capital intensity decentralized solutions making use of alternative water sources are compatible and often economically superior to conventional centralized alternatives brown et al 2011 leigh and lee 2019 on the other hand a cost benefit analysis conducted by sjöstrand et al 2019 comparing different water scarcity abatement measures in the gotland region concluded increased centralized groundwater extraction to be the most cost effective solution for the region however the analysis by sjöstrand et al 2019 like most conventional approaches for both economic and sustainability policy assessment are based on a static view of the system lindqvist et al 2019 that is the system is assumed not to evolve or change over time and factors such as resilience to climate variability effects of synergies and interactions between interventions and socioeconomic feedbacks are not accounted for in the assessment our simulation results clearly show that such a static assumption is misleading and based on previous studies can compromise the sustainability and resilience of future water systems leigh and lee 2019 lindqvist et al 2021 we call for further studies on fårö and elsewhere to reassess alternative water supply solutions some of which we have briefly mentioned utilizing the type of feedback rich dynamic socio hydrological system models we have developed in this study to identify sustainable and resilient pathways to mitigate future water scarcity 5 conclusions we present a combined social and hydrological model using multivariate mc simulations to explore the effects of future climate and socioeconomic mechanisms on local supply and demand for drinking water on the swedish island of fårö our results suggest given the available projections of future climate for the region that the period with historically low groundwater levels experienced in the last decades will be sustained and the probability of recurring periods with the groundwater table reaching lower levels than hitherto ever experienced is high the low groundwater levels will limit water availability and increase the risk of saltwater contamination of drinking water wells this will constrain growth in the housing sector by 4 11 and the tourist sector by 10 30 and maintain municipal reliance on supplementary water transports in summer months the tourist sector will become increasingly reliant on private wells to support growth but spillover effects will continue to increase consumption of municipal water and yearly municipal water transports to our knowledge this is the first study to explore local impacts of future climate using an integrated social and hydrological model in the scandinavian region as in many other studies rusli et al 2021 tegegne et al 2017 poor availability of local hydrological and water use data poses a challenge to model development for the region for instance limited data on historical groundwater levels and lack of spatially referenced water quality samples make spatially disaggregated modeling of future groundwater levels impossible this necessitates a more exploratory modeling approach investigating broad parameter ranges and presenting results in terms of outcome spaces rather than narrow predictions bankes 1993 these limitations aside our results provide important insights about the range of plausible futures that should be accounted for in local to regional water resource management and planning ensuring water self sufficiency across the full outcome space will require investments targeting resilience in the water supply system this can be achieved by leveraging alternative water sources improving water use efficiency and by accounting for socio hydrological dynamics in the planning and management of future water system we believe that the work presented here can support this necessary transition on fårö and serve as a steppingstone for further climate impact and adaptation research in the nordic region funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding

7956,study region the lower reaches of the yangtze river china study focus a novel framework for analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river was proposed in this study which was carried out using the google earth engine gee cloud computing platform the sentinel 1a images of dry and wet seasons in the study area during 2016 and 2020 were initially synthesized based on the median value of the backscatter coefficient then water extraction results were obtained from the combination of the random forest rf algorithm digital elevation model dem and mathematical morphology model according to preferred textural features new hydrological insights for the region verification regions were selected to evaluate the performance of proposed framework the overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient kappa of the proposed method was 94 13 and 0 89 respectively meanwhile the proposed water extraction framework can provide a better performance when compared with state of the art methods otsu threshold method k nearest neighbors knn and support vector machine svm algorithms regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations the mountain shadows could be eliminated and water continuity improved when the dem and mathematical morphology model were introduced in the proposed framework the results indicate that frequent floods and droughts occur in the study area additionally this area is experiencing because of the increases in the water levels and a decline in the regulation and storage capacity of lakes keywords google earth engine surface water yangtze river sentinel 1 satellite textural features 1 introduction surface water water bodies on the earth s surface includes oceans rivers lakes and reservoirs it plays an important role in the climate and the hydrological cycle and broader ecosystem which can provide the basic resource for terrestrial and marine life christer and hasson 2002 yang et al 2015 cui et al 2019 the multi lake multi depression topography subtropical monsoon climate and el niño phenomenon have caused erratic rainfall and extreme weather conditions in the lower reaches of the yangtze river besides it has caused a major loss of life and local economies chen et al 2001 2020 xia et al 2021 hence the analysis and evaluation of surface water changes is highly significant in the follow up investigation of water resources flood and drought monitoring and comprehensive watershed management with advancements in remote sensing technology the surface water information can be rapidly extracted from remote sensing datasets traditional large scale water extraction methods based on optical images jiang et al 2018 jia et al 2018 bie et al 2020 are vulnerable to the clouds fog and bad weather which hinders the accurate and rapid acquisition of datasets baselice and ferraioli 2013 rahman and thakur 2017 to this regard the sentinel 1 satellite equipped with c band synthetic aperture radar sar is not only independent of meteorological conditions and illumination but also has the advantages of higher resolution and shorter revisit period as a result sentinel 1 images have already been widely used in surface water extraction and crop growth monitoring mohammad and gholamreza 2017 goumehei et al 2019 mandal et al 2020 currently some surface water extraction methods based on sar images have been developed hu et al 2020 mahoney et al 2020 among them threshold methods have been the most extensively used in water extraction which include the otsu threshold zhou et al 2020 local threshold liang and liu 2020 and dual threshold methods bao et al 2021 based on the heterogeneous characteristics of surface water liang and liu 2020 proposed a novel local threshold method for water delineation using sentinel 1 images which was effective to resolve the poor extraction accuracy of the traditional threshold method and improved the recognition ability between different objects however it was impossible to distinguish objects with similar scattering characteristics such as airports and shadows furthermore it is difficult to obtain an accurate threshold using threshold methods owing to the influence of speckle noise and the complex information within large scale sar images therefore water extraction methods based on threshold algorithms are only suitable when the sar images are characterized by low noise and small scale vickers et al 2019 the google earth engine gee platform has become an effective tool for large scale surface water extraction the gee platform is an advanced cloud computing platform which can process effectively satellite imagery and it is supported by google cloud infrastructure since the release of the gee platform it has provided massive datasets including the landsat sentinel series and digital elevation model dem as the gee cloud platform enables integration of data acquisition image processing calculation analysis and spatial visualization the efficiency of large scale and time series surface water dynamics has significantly improved based on the gee platform and sentinel 1 images zhang et al 2020 proposed a level set segmentation method to extract surface water for the yarlung zangbo river basin which removed shadows and noise and improved extraction accuracy in mountainous areas however it was difficult to determine the initial and automatic thresholds although the threshold segmentation methods are advantageous in terms of speed and minimal calculation the optimal threshold is extremely challenging which depends on many factors such as the wavelength incidence angle and dielectric properties of target argenti et al 2013 as sentinel 1 images have the higher spatial resolution and the richer textural features surface water extraction methods based on texture information have been extensively investigated when compared to traditional threshold segmentation algorithms sghaier et al 2017 2018 among them the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm is the most widely used method to describe textural features zhang et al 2019 combined the backscatter coefficient of sentinel 1 imagery and five glcm features to extract surface water information which demonstrated the high potential of sentinel 1 sar imagery in long term water extraction applications alejandra et al 2020 incorporated the texture parameter of glcm mean and support vector machine svm model to extract surface water the approach enabled distinguishing surface water with higher accuracy and aided in detecting highly dynamic water when compared with traditional threshold methods they also demonstrated that the effect of speckle noise in sar imagery may be suppressed and the classification results were improved by combining glcm textural features however the most conducive textural features to water extraction are difficult to determine while eliminating the interference of shadows is also problematic furthermore the water continuity is a critical issue that needs to be resolved for surface water extraction from large scale images a novel framework for the analysis and evaluation of surface water changes was proposed to address the issues associated with traditional large scale water extraction in this study within this framework the gee platform was applied to acquire sentinel 1a images of dry and wet seasons in the study area further glcm textural features were used to extract surface water and the dem and the mathematical morphology model were combined for water post processing finally the changes and characteristics of surface water were analyzed across different time periods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area spans the lower reaches of the yangtze river located between 113 34 121 54 e 24 29 32 44 n covering a 28 6071 86 km2 area the region includes shanghai city jiangxi anhui jiangsu and zhejiang provinces some large lakes are contained in the study area such as poyang chaohu and taihu lakes as shown in fig 1 the study area is an important grain plant oil and cotton production zone in china and a strategic water source for water resources allocated to the south to north water diversion most of the lower reaches of the yangtze river belongs to the northern subtropical zone and a small part belongs to the northern margin of the central subtropical zone the average annual temperature is 14 18 c the coldest monthly average temperature is 0 5 5 c the absolute minimum temperature is 10 c to 20 c and the hottest monthly average temperature is 27 28 c this area is also the most complex watershed system in the world because of its abundant precipitation and unique climatic conditions it is highly affected by seasonal rainfall and is prone to flooding as it is characterized by relatively flat terrain annual rainfall in the region increases significantly around april and may and is characterized by a rainy period with heavy rainfall from june to july which corresponds to the concentrated flooding period in recent years the study area has experienced heavier socio economic losses due to frequent flooding events therefore analysis and evaluation of changes to surface water is of huge importance to water resources management flood and drought disaster assessment 2 2 datasets three types of datasets were selected to extract water evaluate accuracy and remove shadows table 1 presents the details of these datasets 2 2 1 sentinel 1 datasets the gee cloud computing platform https earthengine google org was utilized and sentinel 1a images of the study area were obtained to ensure reliability and good representation sentinel 1 images of the wet from july 10 to july 31 2016 and from july 20 to august 10 2020 and dry seasons january 2016 and january 2020 of study area were obtained 2 2 2 gaofen 1 datasets to verify the accuracy of small scale water extraction panchromatic and multi spectral images of gaofen 1 gf 1 pms from july to august 2020 were obtained the gf 1 images were selected as they have high spatial resolution 2 m in the panchromatic and a revisit cycle of 4 d which is relatively similar to the revisit period of the sentinel 1a satellite the consistent acquisition dates for sentinel 1a and gf 1 images may reduce the influence of water fluctuations on bi temporal images the ground truth map of verification regions were manually digitized based on gf 1 pms images together with the google earth pro software 2 2 3 digital elevation model dem datasets the new dem data was released by national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 2017 and it is a re processed data of the shuttle radar topography mission data with 30 m spatial resolution it has a higher precision due to the incorporation of auxiliary data from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global dem ice cloud and land elevation geoscience laser altimeter system the dem datasets were obtained to eliminate mountain shadows and reduce water extraction errors 2 3 data pre processing the pre processing of sentinel 1a imagery and the dem are consisted in this study firstly a series of sentinel 1a images were pre processed which included radiation correction geometric correction registration clipping and synthesis to increase the image quality the sentinel 1a images from january in 2016 and 2020 were used to extract surface water in the dry season and the images from july 10 to july 31 2016 and from july 20 to august 10 2020 were used to extract surface water in the wet season further four sentinel 1a images were synthesized based on the median value of the backscatter coefficient to effectively address data quality abnormal values the dem data pre processing consisted of image clipping and determining surface slope values 3 methodology to address the low efficiency of data acquisition and the traditional large scale water extraction the gee cloud computing platform was used to acquire sentinel 1a images and perform the relevant processing the framework of the water extraction method based on gee cloud computing platform was shown in fig 2 which included data pre processing water extraction post processing of water extraction and accuracy evaluation five preferred glcm texture features based on the preprocessed sentinel 1 images were extracted including angular second moment asm contrast con correlation cor entropy en and inverse difference moment idm furthermore the random forest rf algorithm was used to extract surface water and the dem was introduced to remove mountain shadows in conjunction with the mathematical morphology model the extracted water results were processed by disconnecting denoising and refining to obtain continuous water in last four different regions were selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the characteristics of changes to surface water in the study area were evaluated 3 1 gray level co occurrence matrix generally the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm is a l l symmetrical matrix composed of l level gray levels and the complexity of the glcm is affected by the orientation θ and the relative distance d between two pixel pairs the glcm was created from a grayscale image by selecting a horizontal 0 diagonal 45 vertical 90 and anti diagonal 135 which orientations can be adopted to obtain four glcms haralick et al 1973 to intuitively describe textural conditions of the sentinel 1a images the parameters of asm con cor and en were utilized idm was introduced to describe the homogeneity of surface water based on the continuity of water these textural features were convenient for calculation and offered higher water extraction accuracy the selected five textural features can be described as follows 1 a s m i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 p 2 i j c o n i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 i j 2 p i j c o r 1 σ 1 σ 2 i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 i j p i j μ 1 μ 2 e n i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 p i j log p i j i d m i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 p i j 1 1 i j 2 where l represents the gray level of the sentinel 1a image and p i j is the gray level value of the glcm elements at the i j the μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 are the means and standard deviations of p x and p y respectively notably the p x j 0 l 1 p i j represents the marginal probability matrix obtained by summing the rows of p i j the μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 parameters in eq 2 may be defined as follows 2 μ 1 i 0 l 1 i j 0 l 1 p i j μ 2 j 0 l 1 i i 0 l 1 p i j σ 1 i 0 l 1 μ 1 i 2 j 0 l 1 p i j σ 2 j 0 l 1 μ 1 j 2 i 0 l 1 p i j the asm can reflect the uniformity of sentinel 1a image distribution and texture roughness and water may have a larger energy value when compared to the terrestrial regions the con reflects the clarity of the sentinel 1a image and depth of texture grooves notably water regions have lower con value than other objects in sentinel 1a images the cor evaluates the correlation of gray level values and its maximal value is obtained when all elements of glcm are equal generally the correlation coefficients of pixels in water areas are usually high the en is a measure of random quantity which indicates the complexity of sar images a larger entropy value implies stronger randomness for water the entropy values are usually low moreover the idm is also known as homogeneity which indicates the roughness of objects in sar images and measures the local change of texture a higher idm indicates that there is no change between different regions of image texture and a uniform locality as the water region is relatively more homogeneous in sentinel 1a images it has a greater idm value 3 2 random forest algorithm in order to verify the accuracy of water extraction the otsu threshold method the knn and svm algorithms were selected for comparison the otsu threshold method was proposed by n otsu in 1979 the basic idea of the otsu threshold method is to obtain the water segmentation threshold by solving the extreme points of the image histogram otsu 1979 the knn algorithm was proposed by cover and hart in 1967 thomas and peter 1967 in order to determine the category of the unknown samples the distance between the unlabeled samples and all the labeled samples is calculated with the samples of all known categories as the reference according to the majority voting rule the unlabeled samples and the k nearest samples are classified into one category with a large proportion of categories the svm algorithm was proposed to find an optimal segmented hyper plane that meets the classification requirements and make it as a decision surface to realize the points in the linear partition space vapnik 1995 it has the characteristics of simple structure strong adaptability and global optimization the above three methods only use image gray information to extract water by contrast the rf algorithm has great advantages in multi feature classification therefore rf algorithm combined with a variety of texture features was selected to extract water in this study the rf algorithm is an integrated learning algorithm based on the classification and regression tree cart and it is introduced to extract multiple samples from original data the classification process of the rf algorithm was presents in fig 3 firstly the cart for each sample was constructed further the prediction results were combined and analyzed to obtain the final classification results the classification process of the rf algorithm can be expressed as eq 3 3 h x arg max y i 1 k i h i x where h x represents the final classification result h i x is the classification result of single decision tree y denotes the output variable target variable and i is the indicative function during sample training the decision trees are independent and certain judgment algorithms are adopted to determine when the good results are obtained in other words high quality samples are used during sample training to eliminate poor results and retain good results in this way the rf algorithm reduces noise interference and demonstrates its strong generalization ability breiman 2001 naghibi et al 2017 therefore the rf algorithm has been applied to water extraction tesfamariam and liu 2010 hernandez and shi 2018 rastgou et al 2020 the rf algorithm was executed directly on the gee cloud platform in this study training samples were obtained by combining visual interpretation and the google earth pro software 3 3 post processing of water extraction it is difficult to remove directly mountain shadows from results of water extraction and the dem datasets were used to generate a slope model which is helpful to remove mountain shadows after obtaining the results from the initial water extraction the average slope was calculated and the mountain shadows were removed when the slope values are larger than 15 li and sheng 2012 zhao et al 2018 furthermore the open and closed operations of the mathematical morphology model were combined to improve the accuracy of small water bodies 3 4 accuracy evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the four water extraction methods the confusion matrix is constructed by using water body result obtained by ground truth map and the overall accuracy oa user accuracy ua producer accuracy pa false rate fr missed rate mr and kappa coefficient kappa were calculated as follows 4 o a t p t n n u a t p t p f p p a t p

water changes were introduced in this section firstly the extraction results of surface water and the four typical regions were selected to qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method finally the analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the study area are discussed note that the step and window sizes of texture calculation were set to 1 and 11 respectively the textural features with four directions 0 45 90 and 135 were normalized and the number of decision trees was set to 200 all data processing and algorithms were processed on the gee cloud computing platform 4 1 qualitative evaluation of surface water extraction results to evaluate qualitatively the surface water changes in the study area water extraction results were obtained using the proposed method as shown figs 4 and 5 as fig 4 a and b shown the results of surface water extraction in the dry and wet seasons were varied considerably the coverage of surface water in the dry season was significantly reduced when compared with the wet season in the study area the main stream and multiple tributaries of the yangtze river sustained low water levels in the dry season in contrast the main watercourse of the yangtze river and its surrounding tributaries significantly expanded outward in the wet season the water levels of the main watercourse several tributaries and major lakes rose significantly during the wet season the rising water levels led to the evident widening of surrounding river channels fig 4 a2 and 4 b2 the coverage of lakes fig 4 a3 and 4 b3 also increased significantly with the rise in water levels and several previously dry areas were inundated in addition there were numerous minor water zones seasonal water that occurred due to prolonged precipitation fig 4 a1 and 4 b1 it may be deduced that the surface water conditions in the study area were similar in 2016 fig 4 a and b and 2020 fig 5 a and b surface water considerably varied across the different seasons and significantly expanded during the wet season the main tributaries and most of the lakes were flood prone areas fig 5 a and b and there was also evident widening of surrounding river channels fig 5 a1 and b1 with many previously dry areas becoming inundated fig 5 a2 and b2 when compared with the water extraction results of the dry and wet seasons in 2020 additionally many minor water zones seasonal water occurred because of the rising water levels during the wet season fig 5 a3 and b3 the spatiotemporal distribution of annual precipitation was erratic during these surface water changes 4 2 quantitative evaluation of water extraction to evaluate quantitatively the results of water extraction different regions were selected to extract surface water based on sentinel 1a images of wet season in 2020 as shown in fig 6 verification region 1 is a relatively complex region which characterized by large water small lakes and urban areas fig 6 a to an extent it was possible to evaluate the applicability and overall accuracy of the water extraction methods verification region 2 fig 6 b was selected to distinguish the shadows of water extraction which is a mountainous area with mountain shadows to evaluate the applicability of water extraction methods in an urban region the verification region 3 fig 6 c was used verification region 4 fig 6 d was selected to verify the ability to identify small surface water areas gf 1 pms images captured at roughly the same time as the sentinel 1a images were obtained to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of water extraction methods the ground truth map is shown as fig 7 among them the red regions represented water areas while the yellow regions represented non water areas to verify the advantages of the proposed method the otsu threshold knn and svm algorithms were selected to extract water information from the four verification regions the initial water extraction results are shown in figs 8 9 10 and 11 notably the rf glcm method indicated that water was extracted with rf based on the extracted glcm textural features the initial water extraction results of verification region 1 are shown in fig 8 the confusion matrix the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 2 the best result from each quantitative index is characterized in bold text table 2 shows that the proposed method has some advantages in surface water extraction when compared with the otsu threshold knn and svm algorithms for example the oa of the otsu threshold method was 93 52 this was higher than the knn and svm algorithms the water extraction effect of this method was inadequate for complex sar images with the oa only being 51 35 and the fr being as high as 57 43 as fig 8 d shown the otsu threshold method was difficult to accurately extract the shape of the river based on this method compared with the otsu threshold method the oa from the knn algorithm had improved however this method demonstrated weak anti interference ability has an inability to extract the complete water body the misclassification errors with the knn algorithm are clearly as shown in fig 8 e and the accuracy of knn algorithm was poor the accuracy of the svm algorithm was relatively better and the ua reached 92 83 however a disconnection problem and minor small area water noise with the svm algorithm are obvious as shown in fig 8 f the oa of the proposed method was better than the traditional threshold method otsu and classification algorithms knn and svm generally the proposed method portrays the water distribution more accurately and the boundary between water and non water areas was smooth and the river shape was complete as shown in fig 8 b the initial water extraction results of verification region 2 are shown in fig 9 the confusion matrix the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that the proposed method has some advantages in the mountainous region most shadows were eliminated and the oa and ua of the proposed method was 96 12 and 87 23 respectively the pa of knn algorithm was highest 98 25 however the false phenomenon was obvious and the fr reached 35 86 fig 9 e shows that although the knn algorithm removed some shadows the continuity of the extracted river was poor relatively speaking the kappa of the proposed method was the highest and the water extraction effect was the best compared with the water extraction results in fig 9 b the proposed method was able to eliminate most mountain shadows and improve water continuity the initial water extraction results of verification region 3 are shown in fig 10 the confusion matrix the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that the proposed method has some advantages in the urban region the oa and ua of the proposed method was 97 22 and 75 18 respectively the pa of otsu threshold method was highest 93 03 however the false phenomenon was obvious the fr reached 67 11 the water extraction result fig 10 d of otsu threshold method contained more road and shadows information when compared with the water extraction results fig 10 b of the proposed method the initial water extraction results of verification region 4 are shown in fig 11 the confusion matrix and the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 5 verification region 4 provided greater information on the river particularly in terms of the small tributaries within the study area table 5 shows that the proposed method has higher accuracy in the small surface water areas the oa and ua of the proposed method was 94 87 and 85 86 respectively the pa of otsu threshold method was highest reached 97 04 these indicated the otsu threshold method offered certain advantages in small water extraction although the misclassification was apparent when compared with the water extraction results in fig 11 the knn algorithm extracted the integrated water information with the lowest mr 1 17 but the fr of result was relatively higher 24 72 which was still considerable interference fig 11 e as shown in table 5 and fig 11 b the kappa of the proposed method was highest 0 87 and the fr was lowest 14 14 which most shadows were eliminated by the proposed method and the proposed method has the best oa 94 87 of water extraction 4 3 discussion based on above analysis it may be inferred that the otsu threshold method has certain advantages in the surface water extraction of low noise sentinel 1a images although the rough water range may be extracted by the otsu threshold method there are many misclassification phenomena and water continuity which requires improvement compared with the otsu threshold method the knn and svm algorithms eliminated some interference from similar objects the svm algorithm demonstrated better classification results although it contained some disconnection problems and noise the proposed method demonstrated a strong anti interference ability and most objects with similar scattering characteristics to water e g such as roads shadows were identified using this method the accuracy of water extraction showed considerable improvement using the post processing method most mountain shadows were removed by the introduction of the dem while water continuity was greatly enhanced through the introduction of mathematical morphology these results indicate that the proposed method utilizes textural features of the sar images and is advantageous for the surface water extraction a comparison of the water extraction results in figs 4 and 5 showed that major lakes such as poyang caizi baidang and shijiu lakes had significantly expanded during the wet season the hydrological condition of the study area was majorly impacted by climate fluctuations and changes because of its vast area complex terrain and typical monsoon climate table 6 shows the surface water area in 2016 and 2020 table 6 shows that total surface water area during the wet season increased significantly when compared with the dry season the water coverage in the dry and wet seasons in 2016 was 15988 14 and 27 502 65 km2 respectively in 2020 the water coverage in the dry and wet seasons was 15 872 13 and 26 071 49 km2 respectively generally surface water coverage in the study area in 2016 and 2020 varied significantly across the different seasons in 2016 the difference in surface water area between the dry and wet seasons was approximately 11 514 km2 similarly the difference in surface water area between the dry and wet seasons was approximately 10 199 km2 in 2020 a large amount of surrounding land was eroded and the varying degrees of flooding was introduced when compared fig 10 with fig 11 therefore the poyang lake and shijiu lake basins were selected to further analyze the change of surface water the results of water extraction are shown in figs 12 and 13 compared with the results of water extraction in fig 12 the water change during the dry and wet seasons of poyang lake basin expanded significantly in 2016 and 2020 moreover the coverage of surface water in the dry and wet seasons exhibited huge differences in poyang lake basin there were clear droughts during the dry season black box in fig 12 a and b and serious floods during the wet season black box in fig 12 c and d rivers in the upper reaches of poyang lake basin were significantly widened during wet season yellow box in fig 12 c and d and caused cities and towns to suffer from varying degrees of waterlogging the rise of water level also caused disasters in many areas notably the flood disaster in 2020 was more serious as there was a significant expansion of the surface water when compared with the cover of surface water in 2016 combined with google earth imagery poyang county in the east of poyang lake and duchang county in the northeast were extensively affected due to the increase in water level wucheng town in the northwest was also severely affected and lakes such as lake dahuchi and sand lake were completely submerged the constant rise in water level is one of the main causes of frequent flooding in the study area due to the influence of multiple heavy rainfall events the higher water level concurrent with the flooding of the yangtze river resulted in the slow drawdown of the water level with the rapid development of economy and society the drainage capacity along the yangtze river particularly in cities has gradually improved and rainwater that causes flooding was rapidly discharged into the yangtze river this causes the high water level of the main river further aggravating flooding compared with the results of water extraction in fig 13 the area of shijiu lake basin increased significantly black box in fig 13 and the nearby towns experienced serious flooding yellow box in fig 13 the three large lakes i e shijiu gucheng and nanyi lakes expanded significantly based on the google earth imagery we identified that gaochun district and southeast of dangtu county were almost completely submerged yellow box in fig 13 c and d nanyi lake also expanded triggering varying degrees of flooding the surface water change in shijiu lake basin was similar during 2016 and 2020 the difference between these time period was the expansion of the lake area and the more serious flooding these phenomena reflect the insufficient flood discharge capacity of the river and the inadequate lake regulation and storage capacity as such in the instances of concentrated rainfall continuous flooding will become the new normal as the contradiction between human land and surface waters in the study area has intensified this creates new problems such as increased water levels and a decline in the regulation and storage capacity of lakes 5 conclusion a novel framework for analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river using the gee cloud platform was proposed in this study quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the results showed that the proposed method outperformed the otsu threshold method the knn and svm algorithms which can be used to large scale surface water extraction it was prone to occurred floods and droughts in the study area which caused by the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall as a result the dry season was prone to drought and the severe flood disasters were prone to occurred in the wet season nevertheless there are several improvements that could be made in future for example it only discussed the impact of precipitation climate and human activities on the change of surface water in this study however it did not consider the conversion of groundwater to surface water in addition taking full advantage of the short revisit period of sentinel 1a images the analysis of surface water monthly change is the focus in future studies credit authorship contribution statement zongqiao yu and wensong liu conceptualization methodology zongqiao yu wensong liu and

7956,study region the lower reaches of the yangtze river china study focus a novel framework for analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river was proposed in this study which was carried out using the google earth engine gee cloud computing platform the sentinel 1a images of dry and wet seasons in the study area during 2016 and 2020 were initially synthesized based on the median value of the backscatter coefficient then water extraction results were obtained from the combination of the random forest rf algorithm digital elevation model dem and mathematical morphology model according to preferred textural features new hydrological insights for the region verification regions were selected to evaluate the performance of proposed framework the overall accuracy oa and kappa coefficient kappa of the proposed method was 94 13 and 0 89 respectively meanwhile the proposed water extraction framework can provide a better performance when compared with state of the art methods otsu threshold method k nearest neighbors knn and support vector machine svm algorithms regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations the mountain shadows could be eliminated and water continuity improved when the dem and mathematical morphology model were introduced in the proposed framework the results indicate that frequent floods and droughts occur in the study area additionally this area is experiencing because of the increases in the water levels and a decline in the regulation and storage capacity of lakes keywords google earth engine surface water yangtze river sentinel 1 satellite textural features 1 introduction surface water water bodies on the earth s surface includes oceans rivers lakes and reservoirs it plays an important role in the climate and the hydrological cycle and broader ecosystem which can provide the basic resource for terrestrial and marine life christer and hasson 2002 yang et al 2015 cui et al 2019 the multi lake multi depression topography subtropical monsoon climate and el niño phenomenon have caused erratic rainfall and extreme weather conditions in the lower reaches of the yangtze river besides it has caused a major loss of life and local economies chen et al 2001 2020 xia et al 2021 hence the analysis and evaluation of surface water changes is highly significant in the follow up investigation of water resources flood and drought monitoring and comprehensive watershed management with advancements in remote sensing technology the surface water information can be rapidly extracted from remote sensing datasets traditional large scale water extraction methods based on optical images jiang et al 2018 jia et al 2018 bie et al 2020 are vulnerable to the clouds fog and bad weather which hinders the accurate and rapid acquisition of datasets baselice and ferraioli 2013 rahman and thakur 2017 to this regard the sentinel 1 satellite equipped with c band synthetic aperture radar sar is not only independent of meteorological conditions and illumination but also has the advantages of higher resolution and shorter revisit period as a result sentinel 1 images have already been widely used in surface water extraction and crop growth monitoring mohammad and gholamreza 2017 goumehei et al 2019 mandal et al 2020 currently some surface water extraction methods based on sar images have been developed hu et al 2020 mahoney et al 2020 among them threshold methods have been the most extensively used in water extraction which include the otsu threshold zhou et al 2020 local threshold liang and liu 2020 and dual threshold methods bao et al 2021 based on the heterogeneous characteristics of surface water liang and liu 2020 proposed a novel local threshold method for water delineation using sentinel 1 images which was effective to resolve the poor extraction accuracy of the traditional threshold method and improved the recognition ability between different objects however it was impossible to distinguish objects with similar scattering characteristics such as airports and shadows furthermore it is difficult to obtain an accurate threshold using threshold methods owing to the influence of speckle noise and the complex information within large scale sar images therefore water extraction methods based on threshold algorithms are only suitable when the sar images are characterized by low noise and small scale vickers et al 2019 the google earth engine gee platform has become an effective tool for large scale surface water extraction the gee platform is an advanced cloud computing platform which can process effectively satellite imagery and it is supported by google cloud infrastructure since the release of the gee platform it has provided massive datasets including the landsat sentinel series and digital elevation model dem as the gee cloud platform enables integration of data acquisition image processing calculation analysis and spatial visualization the efficiency of large scale and time series surface water dynamics has significantly improved based on the gee platform and sentinel 1 images zhang et al 2020 proposed a level set segmentation method to extract surface water for the yarlung zangbo river basin which removed shadows and noise and improved extraction accuracy in mountainous areas however it was difficult to determine the initial and automatic thresholds although the threshold segmentation methods are advantageous in terms of speed and minimal calculation the optimal threshold is extremely challenging which depends on many factors such as the wavelength incidence angle and dielectric properties of target argenti et al 2013 as sentinel 1 images have the higher spatial resolution and the richer textural features surface water extraction methods based on texture information have been extensively investigated when compared to traditional threshold segmentation algorithms sghaier et al 2017 2018 among them the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm is the most widely used method to describe textural features zhang et al 2019 combined the backscatter coefficient of sentinel 1 imagery and five glcm features to extract surface water information which demonstrated the high potential of sentinel 1 sar imagery in long term water extraction applications alejandra et al 2020 incorporated the texture parameter of glcm mean and support vector machine svm model to extract surface water the approach enabled distinguishing surface water with higher accuracy and aided in detecting highly dynamic water when compared with traditional threshold methods they also demonstrated that the effect of speckle noise in sar imagery may be suppressed and the classification results were improved by combining glcm textural features however the most conducive textural features to water extraction are difficult to determine while eliminating the interference of shadows is also problematic furthermore the water continuity is a critical issue that needs to be resolved for surface water extraction from large scale images a novel framework for the analysis and evaluation of surface water changes was proposed to address the issues associated with traditional large scale water extraction in this study within this framework the gee platform was applied to acquire sentinel 1a images of dry and wet seasons in the study area further glcm textural features were used to extract surface water and the dem and the mathematical morphology model were combined for water post processing finally the changes and characteristics of surface water were analyzed across different time periods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area spans the lower reaches of the yangtze river located between 113 34 121 54 e 24 29 32 44 n covering a 28 6071 86 km2 area the region includes shanghai city jiangxi anhui jiangsu and zhejiang provinces some large lakes are contained in the study area such as poyang chaohu and taihu lakes as shown in fig 1 the study area is an important grain plant oil and cotton production zone in china and a strategic water source for water resources allocated to the south to north water diversion most of the lower reaches of the yangtze river belongs to the northern subtropical zone and a small part belongs to the northern margin of the central subtropical zone the average annual temperature is 14 18 c the coldest monthly average temperature is 0 5 5 c the absolute minimum temperature is 10 c to 20 c and the hottest monthly average temperature is 27 28 c this area is also the most complex watershed system in the world because of its abundant precipitation and unique climatic conditions it is highly affected by seasonal rainfall and is prone to flooding as it is characterized by relatively flat terrain annual rainfall in the region increases significantly around april and may and is characterized by a rainy period with heavy rainfall from june to july which corresponds to the concentrated flooding period in recent years the study area has experienced heavier socio economic losses due to frequent flooding events therefore analysis and evaluation of changes to surface water is of huge importance to water resources management flood and drought disaster assessment 2 2 datasets three types of datasets were selected to extract water evaluate accuracy and remove shadows table 1 presents the details of these datasets 2 2 1 sentinel 1 datasets the gee cloud computing platform https earthengine google org was utilized and sentinel 1a images of the study area were obtained to ensure reliability and good representation sentinel 1 images of the wet from july 10 to july 31 2016 and from july 20 to august 10 2020 and dry seasons january 2016 and january 2020 of study area were obtained 2 2 2 gaofen 1 datasets to verify the accuracy of small scale water extraction panchromatic and multi spectral images of gaofen 1 gf 1 pms from july to august 2020 were obtained the gf 1 images were selected as they have high spatial resolution 2 m in the panchromatic and a revisit cycle of 4 d which is relatively similar to the revisit period of the sentinel 1a satellite the consistent acquisition dates for sentinel 1a and gf 1 images may reduce the influence of water fluctuations on bi temporal images the ground truth map of verification regions were manually digitized based on gf 1 pms images together with the google earth pro software 2 2 3 digital elevation model dem datasets the new dem data was released by national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 2017 and it is a re processed data of the shuttle radar topography mission data with 30 m spatial resolution it has a higher precision due to the incorporation of auxiliary data from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global dem ice cloud and land elevation geoscience laser altimeter system the dem datasets were obtained to eliminate mountain shadows and reduce water extraction errors 2 3 data pre processing the pre processing of sentinel 1a imagery and the dem are consisted in this study firstly a series of sentinel 1a images were pre processed which included radiation correction geometric correction registration clipping and synthesis to increase the image quality the sentinel 1a images from january in 2016 and 2020 were used to extract surface water in the dry season and the images from july 10 to july 31 2016 and from july 20 to august 10 2020 were used to extract surface water in the wet season further four sentinel 1a images were synthesized based on the median value of the backscatter coefficient to effectively address data quality abnormal values the dem data pre processing consisted of image clipping and determining surface slope values 3 methodology to address the low efficiency of data acquisition and the traditional large scale water extraction the gee cloud computing platform was used to acquire sentinel 1a images and perform the relevant processing the framework of the water extraction method based on gee cloud computing platform was shown in fig 2 which included data pre processing water extraction post processing of water extraction and accuracy evaluation five preferred glcm texture features based on the preprocessed sentinel 1 images were extracted including angular second moment asm contrast con correlation cor entropy en and inverse difference moment idm furthermore the random forest rf algorithm was used to extract surface water and the dem was introduced to remove mountain shadows in conjunction with the mathematical morphology model the extracted water results were processed by disconnecting denoising and refining to obtain continuous water in last four different regions were selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the characteristics of changes to surface water in the study area were evaluated 3 1 gray level co occurrence matrix generally the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm is a l l symmetrical matrix composed of l level gray levels and the complexity of the glcm is affected by the orientation θ and the relative distance d between two pixel pairs the glcm was created from a grayscale image by selecting a horizontal 0 diagonal 45 vertical 90 and anti diagonal 135 which orientations can be adopted to obtain four glcms haralick et al 1973 to intuitively describe textural conditions of the sentinel 1a images the parameters of asm con cor and en were utilized idm was introduced to describe the homogeneity of surface water based on the continuity of water these textural features were convenient for calculation and offered higher water extraction accuracy the selected five textural features can be described as follows 1 a s m i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 p 2 i j c o n i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 i j 2 p i j c o r 1 σ 1 σ 2 i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 i j p i j μ 1 μ 2 e n i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 p i j log p i j i d m i 0 l 1 j 0 l 1 p i j 1 1 i j 2 where l represents the gray level of the sentinel 1a image and p i j is the gray level value of the glcm elements at the i j the μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 are the means and standard deviations of p x and p y respectively notably the p x j 0 l 1 p i j represents the marginal probability matrix obtained by summing the rows of p i j the μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 and σ 2 parameters in eq 2 may be defined as follows 2 μ 1 i 0 l 1 i j 0 l 1 p i j μ 2 j 0 l 1 i i 0 l 1 p i j σ 1 i 0 l 1 μ 1 i 2 j 0 l 1 p i j σ 2 j 0 l 1 μ 1 j 2 i 0 l 1 p i j the asm can reflect the uniformity of sentinel 1a image distribution and texture roughness and water may have a larger energy value when compared to the terrestrial regions the con reflects the clarity of the sentinel 1a image and depth of texture grooves notably water regions have lower con value than other objects in sentinel 1a images the cor evaluates the correlation of gray level values and its maximal value is obtained when all elements of glcm are equal generally the correlation coefficients of pixels in water areas are usually high the en is a measure of random quantity which indicates the complexity of sar images a larger entropy value implies stronger randomness for water the entropy values are usually low moreover the idm is also known as homogeneity which indicates the roughness of objects in sar images and measures the local change of texture a higher idm indicates that there is no change between different regions of image texture and a uniform locality as the water region is relatively more homogeneous in sentinel 1a images it has a greater idm value 3 2 random forest algorithm in order to verify the accuracy of water extraction the otsu threshold method the knn and svm algorithms were selected for comparison the otsu threshold method was proposed by n otsu in 1979 the basic idea of the otsu threshold method is to obtain the water segmentation threshold by solving the extreme points of the image histogram otsu 1979 the knn algorithm was proposed by cover and hart in 1967 thomas and peter 1967 in order to determine the category of the unknown samples the distance between the unlabeled samples and all the labeled samples is calculated with the samples of all known categories as the reference according to the majority voting rule the unlabeled samples and the k nearest samples are classified into one category with a large proportion of categories the svm algorithm was proposed to find an optimal segmented hyper plane that meets the classification requirements and make it as a decision surface to realize the points in the linear partition space vapnik 1995 it has the characteristics of simple structure strong adaptability and global optimization the above three methods only use image gray information to extract water by contrast the rf algorithm has great advantages in multi feature classification therefore rf algorithm combined with a variety of texture features was selected to extract water in this study the rf algorithm is an integrated learning algorithm based on the classification and regression tree cart and it is introduced to extract multiple samples from original data the classification process of the rf algorithm was presents in fig 3 firstly the cart for each sample was constructed further the prediction results were combined and analyzed to obtain the final classification results the classification process of the rf algorithm can be expressed as eq 3 3 h x arg max y i 1 k i h i x where h x represents the final classification result h i x is the classification result of single decision tree y denotes the output variable target variable and i is the indicative function during sample training the decision trees are independent and certain judgment algorithms are adopted to determine when the good results are obtained in other words high quality samples are used during sample training to eliminate poor results and retain good results in this way the rf algorithm reduces noise interference and demonstrates its strong generalization ability breiman 2001 naghibi et al 2017 therefore the rf algorithm has been applied to water extraction tesfamariam and liu 2010 hernandez and shi 2018 rastgou et al 2020 the rf algorithm was executed directly on the gee cloud platform in this study training samples were obtained by combining visual interpretation and the google earth pro software 3 3 post processing of water extraction it is difficult to remove directly mountain shadows from results of water extraction and the dem datasets were used to generate a slope model which is helpful to remove mountain shadows after obtaining the results from the initial water extraction the average slope was calculated and the mountain shadows were removed when the slope values are larger than 15 li and sheng 2012 zhao et al 2018 furthermore the open and closed operations of the mathematical morphology model were combined to improve the accuracy of small water bodies 3 4 accuracy evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the four water extraction methods the confusion matrix is constructed by using water body result obtained by ground truth map and the overall accuracy oa user accuracy ua producer accuracy pa false rate fr missed rate mr and kappa coefficient kappa were calculated as follows 4 o a t p t n n u a t p t p f p p a t p

the true value reference image and ρ is the correlation coefficient which can be expressed as 5 ρ tp fn tp fp fp tn fn tn n 2 4 results and discussion the accuracy evaluation and analysis of surface water changes were introduced in this section firstly the extraction results of surface water and the four typical regions were selected to qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method finally the analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the study area are discussed note that the step and window sizes of texture calculation were set to 1 and 11 respectively the textural features with four directions 0 45 90 and 135 were normalized and the number of decision trees was set to 200 all data processing and algorithms were processed on the gee cloud computing platform 4 1 qualitative evaluation of surface water extraction results to evaluate qualitatively the surface water changes in the study area water extraction results were obtained using the proposed method as shown figs 4 and 5 as fig 4 a and b shown the results of surface water extraction in the dry and wet seasons were varied considerably the coverage of surface water in the dry season was significantly reduced when compared with the wet season in the study area the main stream and multiple tributaries of the yangtze river sustained low water levels in the dry season in contrast the main watercourse of the yangtze river and its surrounding tributaries significantly expanded outward in the wet season the water levels of the main watercourse several tributaries and major lakes rose significantly during the wet season the rising water levels led to the evident widening of surrounding river channels fig 4 a2 and 4 b2 the coverage of lakes fig 4 a3 and 4 b3 also increased significantly with the rise in water levels and several previously dry areas were inundated in addition there were numerous minor water zones seasonal water that occurred due to prolonged precipitation fig 4 a1 and 4 b1 it may be deduced that the surface water conditions in the study area were similar in 2016 fig 4 a and b and 2020 fig 5 a and b surface water considerably varied across the different seasons and significantly expanded during the wet season the main tributaries and most of the lakes were flood prone areas fig 5 a and b and there was also evident widening of surrounding river channels fig 5 a1 and b1 with many previously dry areas becoming inundated fig 5 a2 and b2 when compared with the water extraction results of the dry and wet seasons in 2020 additionally many minor water zones seasonal water occurred because of the rising water levels during the wet season fig 5 a3 and b3 the spatiotemporal distribution of annual precipitation was erratic during these surface water changes 4 2 quantitative evaluation of water extraction to evaluate quantitatively the results of water extraction different regions were selected to extract surface water based on sentinel 1a images of wet season in 2020 as shown in fig 6 verification region 1 is a relatively complex region which characterized by large water small lakes and urban areas fig 6 a to an extent it was possible to evaluate the applicability and overall accuracy of the water extraction methods verification region 2 fig 6 b was selected to distinguish the shadows of water extraction which is a mountainous area with mountain shadows to evaluate the applicability of water extraction methods in an urban region the verification region 3 fig 6 c was used verification region 4 fig 6 d was selected to verify the ability to identify small surface water areas gf 1 pms images captured at roughly the same time as the sentinel 1a images were obtained to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of water extraction methods the ground truth map is shown as fig 7 among them the red regions represented water areas while the yellow regions represented non water areas to verify the advantages of the proposed method the otsu threshold knn and svm algorithms were selected to extract water information from the four verification regions the initial water extraction results are shown in figs 8 9 10 and 11 notably the rf glcm method indicated that water was extracted with rf based on the extracted glcm textural features the initial water extraction results of verification region 1 are shown in fig 8 the confusion matrix the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 2 the best result from each quantitative index is characterized in bold text table 2 shows that the proposed method has some advantages in surface water extraction when compared with the otsu threshold knn and svm algorithms for example the oa of the otsu threshold method was 93 52 this was higher than the knn and svm algorithms the water extraction effect of this method was inadequate for complex sar images with the oa only being 51 35 and the fr being as high as 57 43 as fig 8 d shown the otsu threshold method was difficult to accurately extract the shape of the river based on this method compared with the otsu threshold method the oa from the knn algorithm had improved however this method demonstrated weak anti interference ability has an inability to extract the complete water body the misclassification errors with the knn algorithm are clearly as shown in fig 8 e and the accuracy of knn algorithm was poor the accuracy of the svm algorithm was relatively better and the ua reached 92 83 however a disconnection problem and minor small area water noise with the svm algorithm are obvious as shown in fig 8 f the oa of the proposed method was better than the traditional threshold method otsu and classification algorithms knn and svm generally the proposed method portrays the water distribution more accurately and the boundary between water and non water areas was smooth and the river shape was complete as shown in fig 8 b the initial water extraction results of verification region 2 are shown in fig 9 the confusion matrix the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that the proposed method has some advantages in the mountainous region most shadows were eliminated and the oa and ua of the proposed method was 96 12 and 87 23 respectively the pa of knn algorithm was highest 98 25 however the false phenomenon was obvious and the fr reached 35 86 fig 9 e shows that although the knn algorithm removed some shadows the continuity of the extracted river was poor relatively speaking the kappa of the proposed method was the highest and the water extraction effect was the best compared with the water extraction results in fig 9 b the proposed method was able to eliminate most mountain shadows and improve water continuity the initial water extraction results of verification region 3 are shown in fig 10 the confusion matrix the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that the proposed method has some advantages in the urban region the oa and ua of the proposed method was 97 22 and 75 18 respectively the pa of otsu threshold method was highest 93 03 however the false phenomenon was obvious the fr reached 67 11 the water extraction result fig 10 d of otsu threshold method contained more road and shadows information when compared with the water extraction results fig 10 b of the proposed method the initial water extraction results of verification region 4 are shown in fig 11 the confusion matrix and the oa ua pa fr mr and kappa are shown in table 5 verification region 4 provided greater information on the river particularly in terms of the small tributaries within the study area table 5 shows that the proposed method has higher accuracy in the small surface water areas the oa and ua of the proposed method was 94 87 and 85 86 respectively the pa of otsu threshold method was highest reached 97 04 these indicated the otsu threshold method offered certain advantages in small water extraction although the misclassification was apparent when compared with the water extraction results in fig 11 the knn algorithm extracted the integrated water information with the lowest mr 1 17 but the fr of result was relatively higher 24 72 which was still considerable interference fig 11 e as shown in table 5 and fig 11 b the kappa of the proposed method was highest 0 87 and the fr was lowest 14 14 which most shadows were eliminated by the proposed method and the proposed method has the best oa 94 87 of water extraction 4 3 discussion based on above analysis it may be inferred that the otsu threshold method has certain advantages in the surface water extraction of low noise sentinel 1a images although the rough water range may be extracted by the otsu threshold method there are many misclassification phenomena and water continuity which requires improvement compared with the otsu threshold method the knn and svm algorithms eliminated some interference from similar objects the svm algorithm demonstrated better classification results although it contained some disconnection problems and noise the proposed method demonstrated a strong anti interference ability and most objects with similar scattering characteristics to water e g such as roads shadows were identified using this method the accuracy of water extraction showed considerable improvement using the post processing method most mountain shadows were removed by the introduction of the dem while water continuity was greatly enhanced through the introduction of mathematical morphology these results indicate that the proposed method utilizes textural features of the sar images and is advantageous for the surface water extraction a comparison of the water extraction results in figs 4 and 5 showed that major lakes such as poyang caizi baidang and shijiu lakes had significantly expanded during the wet season the hydrological condition of the study area was majorly impacted by climate fluctuations and changes because of its vast area complex terrain and typical monsoon climate table 6 shows the surface water area in 2016 and 2020 table 6 shows that total surface water area during the wet season increased significantly when compared with the dry season the water coverage in the dry and wet seasons in 2016 was 15988 14 and 27 502 65 km2 respectively in 2020 the water coverage in the dry and wet seasons was 15 872 13 and 26 071 49 km2 respectively generally surface water coverage in the study area in 2016 and 2020 varied significantly across the different seasons in 2016 the difference in surface water area between the dry and wet seasons was approximately 11 514 km2 similarly the difference in surface water area between the dry and wet seasons was approximately 10 199 km2 in 2020 a large amount of surrounding land was eroded and the varying degrees of flooding was introduced when compared fig 10 with fig 11 therefore the poyang lake and shijiu lake basins were selected to further analyze the change of surface water the results of water extraction are shown in figs 12 and 13 compared with the results of water extraction in fig 12 the water change during the dry and wet seasons of poyang lake basin expanded significantly in 2016 and 2020 moreover the coverage of surface water in the dry and wet seasons exhibited huge differences in poyang lake basin there were clear droughts during the dry season black box in fig 12 a and b and serious floods during the wet season black box in fig 12 c and d rivers in the upper reaches of poyang lake basin were significantly widened during wet season yellow box in fig 12 c and d and caused cities and towns to suffer from varying degrees of waterlogging the rise of water level also caused disasters in many areas notably the flood disaster in 2020 was more serious as there was a significant expansion of the surface water when compared with the cover of surface water in 2016 combined with google earth imagery poyang county in the east of poyang lake and duchang county in the northeast were extensively affected due to the increase in water level wucheng town in the northwest was also severely affected and lakes such as lake dahuchi and sand lake were completely submerged the constant rise in water level is one of the main causes of frequent flooding in the study area due to the influence of multiple heavy rainfall events the higher water level concurrent with the flooding of the yangtze river resulted in the slow drawdown of the water level with the rapid development of economy and society the drainage capacity along the yangtze river particularly in cities has gradually improved and rainwater that causes flooding was rapidly discharged into the yangtze river this causes the high water level of the main river further aggravating flooding compared with the results of water extraction in fig 13 the area of shijiu lake basin increased significantly black box in fig 13 and the nearby towns experienced serious flooding yellow box in fig 13 the three large lakes i e shijiu gucheng and nanyi lakes expanded significantly based on the google earth imagery we identified that gaochun district and southeast of dangtu county were almost completely submerged yellow box in fig 13 c and d nanyi lake also expanded triggering varying degrees of flooding the surface water change in shijiu lake basin was similar during 2016 and 2020 the difference between these time period was the expansion of the lake area and the more serious flooding these phenomena reflect the insufficient flood discharge capacity of the river and the inadequate lake regulation and storage capacity as such in the instances of concentrated rainfall continuous flooding will become the new normal as the contradiction between human land and surface waters in the study area has intensified this creates new problems such as increased water levels and a decline in the regulation and storage capacity of lakes 5 conclusion a novel framework for analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river using the gee cloud platform was proposed in this study quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the results showed that the proposed method outperformed the otsu threshold method the knn and svm algorithms which can be used to large scale surface water extraction it was prone to occurred floods and droughts in the study area which caused by the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall as a result the dry season was prone to drought and the severe flood disasters were prone to occurred in the wet season nevertheless there are several improvements that could be made in future for example it only discussed the impact of precipitation climate and human activities on the change of surface water in this study however it did not consider the conversion of groundwater to surface water in addition taking full advantage of the short revisit period of sentinel 1a images the analysis of surface water monthly change is the focus in future studies credit authorship contribution statement zongqiao yu and wensong liu conceptualization methodology zongqiao yu wensong liu and

7957,study region middle east study focus droughts are a major natural disaster in almost every region of the world causing negative impacts on natural resources and water basin management however it is challenging to study drought mechanisms in transboundary rivers where hydrometeorological observations are often not available or limited due to administrative issues this study aims to assess drought conditions at three iraqi transboundary river basins a mosul river basin between iraq and turkey b qadisiyah river basin between iraq syria and turkey and c dukan river basin between iraq and iran the famine early warning systems network land data assimilation system fldas and satellite datasets have been used to calculate various drought indices and reservoir areas for the study period between 1987 and 2019 new hydrological insights for the regions we exhibited the usefulness of fldas and satellite datasets in analyzing the variations and trends in hydro meteorological variables and reservoirs surface areas over three transboundary river basins results exposed a significant drought exacerbation over the study regions during the periods of 1989 1991 2000 2003 2007 2012 and 2015 2018 based on our analysis on drought duration and severity for inside and outside iraq we suggest the long term meteorological drought indices 12 24 month timescales in monitoring drought conditions our results could be beneficial for water and natural resources managers in understanding spatial variability and impact of droughts keywords iraq middle east transboundary river drought fldas avhrr landsat 1 introduction many transboundary rivers are facing pressure due to risk induced by water in near future with little known about changes in hydrometeorological conditions in upstream parts of a basin munia et al 2020 water resources management in such shared natural resources have faced numerous uncertainties due to insufficient spatial and timely monitoring networks therefore improved assessment of climate change and natural hazards over these transboundary rivers are recently receiving increased attention as they can result in political conflict if left unaddressed among natural hazards droughts are one of the most devastating causing major societal disruptions depletion of water resources and dramatic reductions in crop production wmo 2006 published literatures have shown the impacts of droughts on global basins especially in the transboundary river basins al faraj et al 2015 rajsekhar and gorelick 2017 rimkus et al 2013 these studies often evaluate drought condition at basin level however a prolonged drought event in a transboundary river may not be a simple process but a consequence of human activities in different riparian countries for example in a study over mekong river basin a transboundary river crossing six countries basist and williams 2020 presented that drought risk in lower part of this basin could be mitigated if upstream country would release more water to downstream rather than hold it in reservoirs in the tagus river shared between spain and portugal the operation of alcantara dam contributed on changes in the drought magnitude in spain and portugal lópez moreno et al 2009 therefore in transboundary rivers examination of drought conditions can provide an opportunity to understand drought mechanism however there have been limited studies that have examined these situations lakshmi 2003 drought conditions can be measured in different ways with about 50 available drought indices satoh et al 2021 wmo and gwp 2016 drought conditions can be characterized based on meteorological variables such as precipitation standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the degree of vegetation greenness also can be a signal of drought such as analyzing the probability of normalized different vegetation index ndvi deviation from normal kogan 1995 peters et al 2002 for agricultural drought standardized soil moisture index ssi can keep track soil moisture condition which is a critical variable to assess vulnerability of crop against drought events inocêncio et al 2020 with the advent of geographic information system gis and increasing data availability and computing one can apply various drought indices in monitoring droughts and guiding early warning assessment wmo and gwp 2016 in this study we selected the country of iraq as a case study a region of the world where drought risk is expected to increase in the future and yet where arguably the largest gaps in understanding drought risk remain iraq s water resources are dealing with a serious water shortage problem due to the dearth of water supply from the two major rivers tigris and euphrates albarakat et al 2018 awchi and kalyana 2017 in addition the climate of iraq an arid and semi arid region and is characterized by water scarcity and low and unevenly distributed annual precipitation awchi and kalyana 2017 this precipitation is insufficient for successful agriculture production and that has led to an extended drought and the emergence of dust storms albarakat and lakshmi 2019b zakaria et al 2012 this implies that special consideration must be paid to the areas that depend on precipitation for cereal production especially wheat and barley which have cultural and economic importance in iraq awchi and kalyana 2017 a significant portion of water resources in iraq originate outside its region such as from rivers entering the country from turkey syria and iran there are various transboundary river basins for example turkey i e euphrates tigris khabour and the greater zab syria i e euphrates and iran i e the lesser zab diyala teeb dwairej kerkhe and karun waterway bowls iraq is the lower riparian nation of these rivers which makes its water resources management subject to upstream water usage water stockpiling and political interests al faraj and al dabbagh 2015 al faraj and tigkas 2016 turkey and syria control the headwaters of the euphrates and turkey controls the headwaters of the tigris khabour and the greater zab whereas iran controls the headwaters of all river basins common with iraq there are a few studies on understanding the drought episodes and hydrology in iraqi transboundary watersheds for example al faraj et al 2015 and al faraj and tigkas 2016 evaluated spatio temporal meteorological drought conditions over the diyala watershed shared between iraq and iran al faraj and al dabbagh 2015 investigated the changes in meteorological drought and flow regimes in the international lesser zab river basin avarideh et al 2017 evaluated effects of the water sharing on the transboundary sirwan diyala river basin using water resources planning model weap however most studies have conducted their work on a single river basin or analyzed just a few drought indices which may not provide a strong general conclusion moreover the drought characteristics in different parts of the transboundary river basins e g inside or outside of iraq have not been discussed time series analysis e g trend analysis anomalies analysis is common method in the previous studies but spatial evaluation for drought characteristics e g drought duration drought severity were absent this study has following objectives 1 to compare various drought indices in monitoring drought conditions over three iraq transboundary river basins 2 to assess whether there are differences in the variability of drought conditions for various regions e g inside iraq and outside iraq territory or upstream riparian countries with the first objective we calculated multiple drought indices from meteorological drought including standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to agricultural drought such as standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized vegetation index svi the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas and satellite data have been applied for estimating these above drought indices for the second objective we analyze the relationship between drought conditions and annual variation in reservoir surface areas because in a semi arid country such as iraq reservoirs play an important role in supplying drinking water irrigating agricultural crops and generation of hydropower in this study we used landsat images to monitor and estimate annual reservoir area there are a few studies using satellite images to understand the variations of open water bodies surface reservoir wet land in iraq with encourage accuracy al quraishi and kaplan 2021 albarakat et al 2018 alwan and aziz 2021 gao et al 2012 naji and abduljabbar 2019 the novelty of this work lies in i an understanding of drought conditions based on administration national boundary which have been absent in previous studies for the region ii evaluation of various drought indices meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought indices to better characterize drought conditions iii study framework in three basins across different climatic conditions and riparian countries so that the conclusions of this work would be better applicable 2 study area in this study we studied conditions in three reservoirs i e qadisiyah mosul and dukan with their basin boundaries extending to territory outside of iraq i e iran syria and turkey fig 1 these transboundary river basins are thus considered as geopolitically ungauged where data observation networks may exist but data are unavailable for use due to geopolitical constraints du et al 2020 kibler et al 2014 we delineated basins areas associated with the dam locations using srtm dem and corrected basin boundaries with the global runoff data center grdc basin boundary database we hereafter designate these basins corresponding to reservoir outlets dam locations as qadisiyah river basin mosul river basin and dukan river basin the characteristics of these basins are described as follow 2 1 qadisiyah river basin qadisiyah is located on the north side of the haditha dam this reservoir was formed by construction of haditha dam between 1977 and 1986 on the euphrates river as an important artificial water storage site this reservoir provides irrigation water for the nearby fields the main source of this reservoir is euphrates river the euphrates originates in the eastern highlands of turkey it enters the syrian territory at karkamis downstream from the turkish town of birecik it flows southeast across the syrian plateau before entering the iraqi territory near qusaybah the euphrates river is 3000 km long divided between turkey 1230 km the syrian arab republic 710 km and iraq 1060 km fao 2009 the qadisiyah river basin is situated between 32 and 40 n and 36 7 43 8 e the watershed drains an area of 260 000 km2 in total of which about 15 lies in iraq and 85 outside iraq 2 2 mosul river basin mosul dam is located on the tigris river about 60 km north of mosul city this dam was constructed in 1985 and is considered to be one of the largest water reservoirs in iraq khattab and merkel 2014 the main source of this reservoir is the tigris river the tigris originates in eastern turkey and flows through the country until the border city of cizre the tigris river is 1850 km long with 400 km in turkey 32 km on the border between turkey and the syrian arab republic and 1418 km in iraq fao 2009 the tigris river discharges between 60 and 5000 m3 s of water into the mosul dam reservoir khattab and merkel 2014 the outflow has ranged between 100 and 1000 m3 s since the construction of the dam in 1985 al obaydy 1996 mosul dam reservoir is one of the main shared river basins between iraq and turkey the basin is situated between 36 6 and 39 4 n and 39 1 and 44 3 e the watershed drains an area of 52 000 km2 in total of which about 8 lies in iraq and 92 outside iraq 2 3 dukan river basin it is located close to the city of ranya and is a reservoir on the little zab created by the construction of the dukan dam the dukan dam was built between 1954 and 1959 as a multi purpose dam to provide water storage irrigation and hydroelectricity kliot 2005 the lesser zab river is the main water source for the dukan reservoir the lesser zab which originates in the islamic republic of iran is equipped with the dukan dam it begins from the intersection of two small streams to shape the chami kalvem in the azar bayjani gharbi area in iran that flows in a south southeasterly bearing and enters iraqi kurdistan region at that point close to mawat town inside kurdistan region close penjwin town it merges with the siwayl river and streams then a northwesterly way towards rania town until it enters the dukan reservoir hassan et al 2016 the basin is located between 35 4 and 36 9 n and 44 4 and 46 3 e the area of this river basin is 9800 km2 in total of which about 55 lies in iraq and 45 outside iraq as depicted in fig 1 the climate over three river basins exhibits great diversity between in and outside of iraq for qadisiyah river basin the climate inside iraq spreads out in three climate zones with bwh arid desert hot as the dominant climate zone the outside iraq of qadisiyah river basin has across five climate zones from arid climate bwh to cold dry summer hot summer dsa with respect to mosul and dukan river basins the inside iraq parts are located in csa climate zone temperate dry summer hot summer while the outside iraq parts spreads out over csa and dsa mosul river basin and dsa dukan river basin 3 data and methodology 3 1 the famine early warning systems network fews net

2019a 3 4 drought index calculation 3 4 1 standardized precipitation index spi this study calculated spi at four different timescales 3 month 6 month 12 month and 24 month mckee et al 1993 the three steps to calculate spi are described as follows step 1 fitting distribution function for precipitation time series 1 x i m k t 13 k m 12 p i 1 t t 1 m p i t where k is time scale i is year m is month of year p is precipitation the two parameter gamma distribution is used to fit the time series as follows 2 g x 0 x x α 1 e x β dx where α is shape parameter β is scale parameter step 2 estimation of the cumulative probability 3 h x p 1 p g x where p is probability of no precipitation step 3 transformation of the cumulative probability to the standard normal variable 4 z w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 2

3 0 001308 value z is representative for spi 3 4 2 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei index also can be estimated in multiple timescales vicente serrano et al 2010 similar to spi spei was calculated in four timescales spei3 spei6 spei12 and spei24 two distinct features of spei compared with spi are i the calculation framework is similar to spi but it uses a deficit between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as the time series of spei ii three parameter log logistic regression was employed to fit the time series of spei eq 5 5 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β and γ are shape scale and original parameter respectively 3 4 3 standardized soil moisture index ssi the ssi is calculated using following equation xu et al 2018 6 ssi vsm i y vsm i σ vsm i where i y represent month and year respectively vsm i and σ vsm i represent average value and standard deviation of vsm at i th month respectively 3 4 4 standardized vegetation index svi the svi is calculated using following expression peters et al 2002 7 svi ndvi i y ndvi i σ ndvi i where i y represent month and year respectively ndvi i and σ ndvi i represent average value and standard deviation of ndvi at i th month respectively 3 4 5 drought characteristics in each pixel temporal drought characteristics were estimated using drought duration dd and drought severity ds le et al 2020 2019 it is noted that the dd and ds were only calculated for meteorological drought indices spi and spei the dd units in month is described in the following eq 8 8 dd i 1 m du i m where du i is i th drought duration which is the number of consecutive months in which the spi spei is below 1 m is the number of drought duration the ds no dimension is described in the following eq 9 9 ds 1 m i 1 du di i di i 1 where di i is spi spei at month i to examine whether drought characteristics drought duration and drought severity inside and outside of iraq are similar equal mean we used t test and wilcoxon rank sum test ott and longnecker 2015 we only consider there is a significant difference in drought duration or in drought severity between two regions when both testes rejected the hypothesis that two mean difference is equal to zero at significant level of 05 3 5 calculation of the surface reservoir area all the landsat images used in this study acquired from usgs earth explorer were geometrically corrected using the envi software the area of interest was clipped where the largest reservoir area in the time series for the time period 1987 2019 of each reservoir was considered as the main shapefile each image is classified with the support vector machine svm supervised classification algorithm svm is a well established technique and has been considerably used in remote sensing applications because of its higher ability to handle smaller training samples and greater classification accuracy huang et al 2002 mantero et al 2005 mountrakis et al 2011 3 6 modified mann kendall trend test trend analysis the mann kendall mk test was performed to analyze the trends of reservoir areas and drought indices the mk test is a non parametric test that statistically assesses the monotonic trends in data over time hirsch and slack 1984 kendall 1948 mann 1945 to provide a robust assessment in the presence of autocorrelated time series which may cause a false interpretation results to the trend yue et al 2002 we removed the serial correlation effect based on the pre whitening method after that we applied for the mk test gocic and trajkovic 2013 to perform modified mann kendall trend test mmk to examine the magnitude of trends we used the sen s slope sen 1968 4 results this section characterizes meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature land surface parameters ndvi and soil moisture and hydrological parameter surface reservoir area for three basins studied in this work 4 1 annual time series analysis from 1987 to 2019 we calculated the annual average precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi to study the patterns from 1987 to 2019 for qadisiyah mosul and dukan river basins that are total basin extent inside iraq and outside iraq that are represented in red green and blue plots respectively fig 2 1 shows the time series of the variability of precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi for each basin fig 2 1a illustrates the precipitation for qadisiyah that are usually much lower than the precipitation of the total basin extent and outside iraq regions due to the differences in the climate characteristics whereas the climate of the inside iraq region is desert fig 1 fig 2 1a exhibits that the maximum value of precipitation for inside iraq is 285 mm while for the outside iraq and total basin extent is 580 mm fig 2 1b shows obvious difference between mean air temperature over inside iraq and outside iraq and the total basin extent it is obvious that the differences between air temperature inside iraq and outside iraq and the total basin extent is around 7 8 c corresponding to the time series due to the high temperatures in the summer reaching to 48 c albarakat and lakshmi 2019a fao 2003 fig 2 1c exhibits the soil moisture values for each river basin the soil moisture plot for inside iraq is usually lower than soil moisture values of outside iraq and the entire qadisiyah basin fig 2 1d shows the ndvi time series 1987 2019 for qadisiyah river basin the three regions inside iraq outside iraq and total basin extent have almost the same values before 1999 whereas from 1999 to 2019 the soil moisture values for inside iraq region have declined due to multiple drought events that have led the upstream countries of euphrates river i e turkey and syria to decrease runoff of the euphrates river into iraq albarakat et al 2018 richardson 2009 richardson and hussain 2006 by storing water in reservoirs fig 2 2 represents the precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi over mosul river basin in the fig 2 2a c and d the precipitation soil moisture and ndvi for inside iraq outside iraq and total basin extent are obviously correlated average r² for the precipitation soil moisture and ndvi were 0 91 0 90 and 0 75 respectively while fig 2 2b shows the difference between mean air temperature over inside iraq and outside iraq and total basin extent the difference between air temperature inside iraq and outside iraq and the total basin extent is 6 7 c corresponding to the time series because of the high temperature during the summer in the part of inside iraq the precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi for dukan river basin are shown in fig 2 3 all variables show high correlation to each other average r² for inter correlation were all above 0 90 for the three main regions inside iraq outside iraq and total basin extent except air temperature in fig 2 3b which shows slight disparity between the three regions a difference of 1 2 in general the time series of precipitation and soil moisture show declines in 1989 1991 1999 2001 2008 2015 and 2018 due to drought events al hedny and muhaimeed 2020 albarakat et al 2018 hameed et al 2018 we also observed that the entire basin and outside iraq similar for most variables but the inside iraq is quite different especially in the qadisiyah mosul river basins it is likely due to the impact of the basin area distribution within and outside iraq fig 3 displays the average and standard deviation of annual precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi whereas x axis for each graph represents the various locations for the three transboundary river basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan the legend is shown in the right side of the fig 3 fig 3a shows that the mean precipitation on total basin extent and outside iraq for qadisiyah and mosul are higher than the inside iraq while the mean precipitation over dukan river basin is quite similar for total basin extent inside iraq outside iraq fig 3b illustrates the average of air temperature for each basin the average air temperature over inside iraq for qadisiyah and mosul river basins is much higher than over entire and outside iraq soil moisture in the fig 3 c shows that the mean value of soil moisture in inside iraq for qadisiyah has a lower value than the entire and outside iraq while the mean values of soil moisture in entire inside iraq and outside iraq for mosul and dukan basins are almost close to each other fig 3d shows the average values of ndvi whereas inside iraq for qadisiyah has a lower mean value of ndvi than entire and outside iraq the values of the mean ndvi for mosul and dukan basins are close to each other fig 3d we observed large differences in precipitation among different basins as well as between inside and outside iraq but not in soil moisture it is quite possible that the evapotranspiration equalizes the soil moisture et demand is so high that the soil moisture decreases in spite of differences in precipitation the spatial distribution of average monthly of precipitation air temperature soil moisture ndvi for the three iraqi transboundary basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan are shown in fig 4 and the average correlation entire basin between these variables is given in table 2 fig 4a shows the average monthly precipitation gradually increased from inside iraq region to outside iraq region where the average monthly precipitation values reached 60 70 mm in turkey and iran territories the monthly average air temperatures show high air temperature in inside iraq region for all basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan and some parts of syria for qadisiyah basin the average monthly air temperature is low in the outside iraq region specially in turkey and iran the average monthly soil moisture and ndvi show lower values in inside iraq than outside iraq and total basin extent among the relationships between hydro meteorological variables p sm at all three basins exhibited statistically positive correlations while ndvi t had statistical negative correlations in mosul and dukan river basins 4 2 annual evolution of the reservoir surface area from 1987 to 2019 we calculated the reservoir surface area at the dam locations for the three basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan from the landsat images we utilized landsat images that have the same acquisition months september as it corresponds to relatively cloud free conditions the time series of each reservoir surface area is 33 years from 1987 to 2019 fig 5 in general fig 5 shows extreme decreases in the reservoir surface area of the three reservoirs in the time periods 1999 2001 2008 2015 and 2017 2018 it is noticed that variation in annual surface reservoir time series exhibited poor correlation with annual precipitation over the river basin r² for qadisiyah mosul and dukan are 0 01 0 01 and 0 14 respectively this implies that changes in the surface reservoir are attributed to multiple factors rather than solely precipitation these decreases in the reservoir surface areas were attributed to drought events al hedny and muhaimeed 2020 hameed et al 2018 the temporal variation of reservoir surface area for qadisiyah mosul and dukan is shown in fig 6 the blue line illustrates the best fit regression line between the reservoir surface areas and time the slope values were calculated using sen s method fig 6 shows a statistically significant negative trend of the two river basins qadisiyah and mosul but not dukan for the given study period 1987 2019 the slope values are 4 11 1 54 and 0 79 for qadisiyah mosul dukan respectively in summary the satellite images adequately quantify the spatial and temporal variability of reservoir areas for example the large variations around 2010 in the qadisiyah reservoir fig 6c can be validated by observation in 2009 iraq registered a record low discharge on the tigris and the euphrates albarakat et al 2018 it is likely due to drought events in 2008 2009 and 2010 in the upstream countries of turkey and syria these events coupled with reduced runoff from iran led to shrinkage in iraqi reservoirs richardson 2009 qadisiyah reservoir was hit relatively harder by the droughts reservoir storage was completely depleted by 2009 and 2010 gao et al 2012 for a comparison the raw image of the year of 2009 extreme drought and the year of 2006 normal year is provided in supplementary material a our analysis confirms that the current annual flow of the euphrates and tigris entering iraq has dropped dramatically this decline can be attributed to many factors such as dam construction in all riparian countries and an increased withdrawal of water for irrigation lück 2014 while the withdrawal of water for irrigation has not well document yet there are several evidences on the links between negative trend of reservoir areas to the construction of large dams in turkey as part of the southeastern anatolia project and the construction of a series of dams in syria and downstream iraq albarakat et al 2018 asia 2013 holmes 2010 according to giovanis and ozdamar 2021 due to dams series built in turkey iran and syria and irrigation projects respondents in iraq have witnessed a lack of water supply and a decline in water surface area overall they found a significant impact of drought and water bodies on the quantity of agricultural products produced such as cereals fruits vegetables and dates ranging between 5 and 22 per cent furthermore they showed a significant impact of climate change related shocks on various outcomes including the decrease in income assets food production and stock in iraq for the euphrates a single dam in the upper part of the catchment the atatürk dam is able to regulate a considerable portion of the river s flow the atatürk dam is commonly regarded as not only turkey s largest dam but also one of the world s largest giovanis and ozdamar 2021 building dam series in the world led to climate change that leads to an increase in global average annual air temperature and regional rainfall variation which is projected to continue and worsen in the future misra 2014 solomon et al 2007 in short iraq has been suffering for years from low water levels flowing on the tigris and euphrates rivers from the neighboring turkey and iran the iraqi government has warned prolonged shortage of drinking water surface water storage and agriculture lands al ansari 2013 2016 osman et al 2017 4 3 assessment of spatio temporal drought indices trends in different parts of river basins fig 7 displays the spatial distribution of mmk trend tests for spi and spei since we calculated the indices at four different timescales for spi and spei we only present in fig 7 the mmk results for spi12 and spei12 only for other timescales the results can be found in the supplementary material b the spi and spei trends exhibited a contrasting pattern the spi generally increased over the period of 1987 2019 except for the middle region of qadisiyah basin fig 7 1 the significant positive trends of the spi index were observed in the northern part of qadisiyah basin and center of iraq on the contrary the spei index in most of the area in iraq and lower area of qadisiyah basin exhibited significant negative trends fig 7 2 the trends of spi and spei index in mosul and dukan are not clear similar observations have been found for other spi and spei timescales please see content in supplementary material b with respect to soil moisture the ssi exhibited significant increasing trends in the center of iraq fig 8 3 this is likely attributed to significant increase in precipitation in form of the spi index as previously described in this area on the other hand a large portion in southwestern part of qadisiyah basin observed significant negative trends in soil moisture for the mosul and dukan basins the ssi index trends generally increased over the study period but only a small portion was observed to have a statistically significant positive trend examination of the vegetation trend the svi indicated that large areas in the southwestern part of qadisiyah and eastern part of mosul exhibited significant negative trends fig 8 4 fig 9 presents distributions of area under mmk test for the ten drought indices in three basins in three regions total basin extent inside of iraq and outside of iraq in this study we focus on the significant negative sn trend areas because they indicate worsened drought conditions over the years in the qadisiyah basin drought trends for areas inside of iraq were more intense than areas outside of iraq demonstrating by high portion sn areas under mmk tests for example for the spei24 index the percentage of areas with sn trends inside and outside iraq were about 100 and 60 in mosul and dukan basin the proportion of sn areas for both inside and outside iraq were comparable it is noticed that spi index reported zero or a small portion of area with sn trends 5 discussion 5 1 inter comparison of multiple drought indices fig 10 presents variation in monthly drought indices for the total basin extent of three basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan for the 33 years 1987 2019 we detected four major drought periods which were in 1989 1991 2000 2003 2007 2012 and 2015 2018 the periods corresponding to these significant drought conditions correspond with previous studies al faraj and scholz 2014 almamalachy et al 2020 and with statistics from the ministry of water resources and the ministry of agriculture in iraq the ratio of land with poor crop harvests due to drought events were significantly higher than in the other years among drought indices the major 1989 1991 drought was clearly observed from spi and spei up to 6 month time scale meanwhile longer time scales of spei such as spei12 and spei24 could monitor the major droughts after 2000 the major drought 2007 2012 was also observed from ssi while the major droughts during 1989 1991 and 2015 2018 were observed by svi it suggested that soil moisture is significantly reduced during 2007 2012 while the green areas were greatly impacted on 1989 1991 and 2015 2018 droughts therefore by using multiple drought indices we can see impacts of drought on different aspects of the hydrological and ecological cycle 5 2 elaboration on drought assessment in different parts of a transboundary river basin reservoir surface area is an important observation to understand water storage change in a basin and can be useful for policy maker in water resources planning kansara and lakshmi 2021 we used the reservoir surface area as a reference dataset to discuss the usefulness of different drought indices e g inside outside iraq our studied basins specifically we aim to forecast the severity of the annual hydrological drought parameter reservoir surface area based on the calculation of various meteorological and agricultural drought indices estimated from fldas from shorter reference periods 9 months meteorological spi spei and agricultural ssi svi drought indices time series were aggregated in a reference period of 9 months then the pearson correlation coefficient of these referenced drought indices time series with annual reservoir surface areas time series were computed this concept is somehow similar to the work of tigkas et al 2012 table 3 presents relationships between various drought indices and change in reservoir surface areas over the study period the relationship in terms of correlation coefficient cc between drought indices and surface reservoir areas are case specifics for the qadisiyah river basin most spi indices short to medium timescales and svi exhibited low correlation with cc values in between 0 and 0 343 the long term spi spi24 in spi24 out spei except for spei3 in and ssi out are significantly correlated with the surface reservoir areas with cc values in between 0 360 and 0 676 for the mosul river basin the change in reservoir areas was only significantly related to the spei3 in spei out and spei6 out cc values in range 0 375 0 436 and ssi out cc 0 399 while that relationship was low with other drought indices cc values in 0 0 33 on the other hand except for svi inside outside iraq all other drought indices exhibited a significant correlation with the reservoir surface areas over the dukan river basin as cc values range from 0 353 to 0 611 the mixed relationship between the reservoir surface areas to the drought indices across basins is likely due to the impact of dams constructed on the outside iraq areas of the studied basins based on global reservoir and dam database grand v1 3 lehner et al 2011 the total large dams 0 1 km³ located in the outside iraq of qadisiyah and mosul river basin are 23 2203 km² of total surface water areas 11 255 km² of total water surface areas respectively while there is no large dam observed at dukan river basin see supplementary material c as the final downstream user of the tigris and euphrates rivers iraq only receives the streamflow that remains after appropriations and diversions by turkey and syria according to the minister of water resources iraq the amount of water flowing in iraq s rivers has fallen by at least 40 in recent decades largely due to the construction of dams voss et al 2013 although the drought indices exhibited a good relationship with reservoir surface areas in dukan river basin where has no existence of large dam they have mostly exhibited low correlations with the change in reservoir surface in mosul and qadisiyah river basins among different timescales long term timescales seem to have a better correlation with the changes in the surface reservoirs areas at the qadisiyah river basin while at the dukan river basin all timescales seem to relate with the reservoir surface areas it suggests the basin size could play a role here as at a large basin like the qadisiyah river the long memory drought indices seem to be useful we also observed that among significant drought indices over the qadisiyah river basin the cc values for the drought indices estimated from the outside of iraq were often higher compared to the drought indices estimated from the inside of iraq the proportional area of inside outside iraq may also explain that difference as a large portion of the area of the qadisiyah river basin is located outside of iraq causing more influence on the impact on the changes in hydrological variable in summary we determined that the selection of drought indices in terms of timescales and spatial inside outside iraq depends on the basin size and proportional area between in and out of iraq we also found the challenge of the current drought indices in accurately monitoring the drought conditions due to the existence of large dams within the basin we also examined how the drought duration dd and drought severity ds were different between inside and outside iraq fig 11 presents dd and ds across three basins and various regions inside outside iraq based on the period 1987 2019 for the qadisiyah river basin dd inside of iraq seems to be longer than that dd outside of iraq demonstrated by the dd s mean values of inside iraq statistically higher than that mean values of outside of iraq for spi6 spi12 spi24 spei3 spei6 spei12 and spei24 the difference between ds are mixed ds was more intense ds in ds out with spi12 spi24 spei24 and spei24 however with short timescales drought index spi3 and spei3 the outside of iraq exhibited statistically higher mean of ds as compared to the inside of iraq for the mosul river basin the dd were higher statistically significant with only two indices spi24 and spei3 with respect to ds inside of iraq its mean ds values from short to long timescales of spi spi 3 6 12 24 and long term spei24 were statistically higher than that mean ds values of the outside of the iraq however the short to medium timescales of spei spei3 spei6 experienced a statistical higher mean ds values for the outside of iraq as compared to the inside of iraq over the dukan river basin no significant difference in both dd and ds between inside outside iraq has been ascertained in summary we observed importance features of long term drought indices at both qadisiyah and mosul river basin the drought duration and drought severity obtained from inside outside iraq were significantly different with such a drought monitoring system with long term drought indices spi12 spi24 spei12 spei24 could be essential to effectively monitor the drought dynamics at various parts of the basin 6 conclusions since many river basins in iraq are spread out over different nations there are challenges to acquiring field observations for total basin extent due to administrative issues therefore global and satellite datasets are of great interest to characterize hydrometeorological features in such transboundary river basins in this study we explored drought conditions at three iraqi transboundary river basins that are qadisiyah mosul and dukan based on differences in administrative boundary inside iraq and outside iraq we used fldas avhrr and landsat datasets to investigate differences of drought conditions inside outside iraq during 33 years 1987 2019 and discuss on the usefulness of multiple timescales drought indices on the specific studied regions below are our major findings a we observed contradictory patterns for meteorological variables in the qadisiyah and mosul river basins precipitation much lower air temperature much higher for the inside of iraq as compared to the corresponding values for the outside of iraq b variations of reservoirs surface areas exhibited significantly negative trends in qadisiyah and mosul river basins the landsat satellite has proved its capability in capturing extreme drought events for example the year of 2009 over the qadisiyah reservoir c temporal variation of different drought indices from 1987 to 2019 over qadisiyah mosul and dukan river basins exhibited significant exacerbation of drought over iraq during the periods of 1989 1991 2000 2003 2007 2012 and 2015 2018 these drought events matched data from the ministry of water resources and the ministry of agriculture in iraq the ratio of land with poor crop harvests due to drought events were significantly higher than other years d we found out the importance of long term meteorological drought indices 12 24 month timescales of spi spei in monitoring drought conditions over the studied regions as i they exhibited a good relationship with reservoir surface areas ii drought characteristics duration severity of these indices are statistically significant difference between inside outside iraq the soil moisture drought index ssi are also considered for qadisiyah and dukan river basins while vegetation index svi is useful for mosul river basin on the other hand we found the challenges in using the current drought indices towards accurately monitoring the drought conditions with the presence of large dams within the basin transboundary watersheds pose policy and diplomacy concerns for the countries involved several such issues have resulted in the recent years over sharing of water the use of satellite data is helpful in this regard for example precipitation from satellite sensors compares well with rain gage networks hashemi et al 2017 le et al 2018 mondal et al 2018 specifically when in situ observations of streamflow are not shared between countries and groundwater storage is seldom observed and even if they are far and few monitoring wells the use of high resolution soil moisture data fang et al 2021a 2018 2013 2020 2021b and models lakshmi et al 2018 are helpful in this regard proper identification of the onset of the drought as well as its progression using the publicly available satellite data can help policy makers negotiate amicably

7957,study region middle east study focus droughts are a major natural disaster in almost every region of the world causing negative impacts on natural resources and water basin management however it is challenging to study drought mechanisms in transboundary rivers where hydrometeorological observations are often not available or limited due to administrative issues this study aims to assess drought conditions at three iraqi transboundary river basins a mosul river basin between iraq and turkey b qadisiyah river basin between iraq syria and turkey and c dukan river basin between iraq and iran the famine early warning systems network land data assimilation system fldas and satellite datasets have been used to calculate various drought indices and reservoir areas for the study period between 1987 and 2019 new hydrological insights for the regions we exhibited the usefulness of fldas and satellite datasets in analyzing the variations and trends in hydro meteorological variables and reservoirs surface areas over three transboundary river basins results exposed a significant drought exacerbation over the study regions during the periods of 1989 1991 2000 2003 2007 2012 and 2015 2018 based on our analysis on drought duration and severity for inside and outside iraq we suggest the long term meteorological drought indices 12 24 month timescales in monitoring drought conditions our results could be beneficial for water and natural resources managers in understanding spatial variability and impact of droughts keywords iraq middle east transboundary river drought fldas avhrr landsat 1 introduction many transboundary rivers are facing pressure due to risk induced by water in near future with little known about changes in hydrometeorological conditions in upstream parts of a basin munia et al 2020 water resources management in such shared natural resources have faced numerous uncertainties due to insufficient spatial and timely monitoring networks therefore improved assessment of climate change and natural hazards over these transboundary rivers are recently receiving increased attention as they can result in political conflict if left unaddressed among natural hazards droughts are one of the most devastating causing major societal disruptions depletion of water resources and dramatic reductions in crop production wmo 2006 published literatures have shown the impacts of droughts on global basins especially in the transboundary river basins al faraj et al 2015 rajsekhar and gorelick 2017 rimkus et al 2013 these studies often evaluate drought condition at basin level however a prolonged drought event in a transboundary river may not be a simple process but a consequence of human activities in different riparian countries for example in a study over mekong river basin a transboundary river crossing six countries basist and williams 2020 presented that drought risk in lower part of this basin could be mitigated if upstream country would release more water to downstream rather than hold it in reservoirs in the tagus river shared between spain and portugal the operation of alcantara dam contributed on changes in the drought magnitude in spain and portugal lópez moreno et al 2009 therefore in transboundary rivers examination of drought conditions can provide an opportunity to understand drought mechanism however there have been limited studies that have examined these situations lakshmi 2003 drought conditions can be measured in different ways with about 50 available drought indices satoh et al 2021 wmo and gwp 2016 drought conditions can be characterized based on meteorological variables such as precipitation standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 precipitation and potential evapotranspiration standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the degree of vegetation greenness also can be a signal of drought such as analyzing the probability of normalized different vegetation index ndvi deviation from normal kogan 1995 peters et al 2002 for agricultural drought standardized soil moisture index ssi can keep track soil moisture condition which is a critical variable to assess vulnerability of crop against drought events inocêncio et al 2020 with the advent of geographic information system gis and increasing data availability and computing one can apply various drought indices in monitoring droughts and guiding early warning assessment wmo and gwp 2016 in this study we selected the country of iraq as a case study a region of the world where drought risk is expected to increase in the future and yet where arguably the largest gaps in understanding drought risk remain iraq s water resources are dealing with a serious water shortage problem due to the dearth of water supply from the two major rivers tigris and euphrates albarakat et al 2018 awchi and kalyana 2017 in addition the climate of iraq an arid and semi arid region and is characterized by water scarcity and low and unevenly distributed annual precipitation awchi and kalyana 2017 this precipitation is insufficient for successful agriculture production and that has led to an extended drought and the emergence of dust storms albarakat and lakshmi 2019b zakaria et al 2012 this implies that special consideration must be paid to the areas that depend on precipitation for cereal production especially wheat and barley which have cultural and economic importance in iraq awchi and kalyana 2017 a significant portion of water resources in iraq originate outside its region such as from rivers entering the country from turkey syria and iran there are various transboundary river basins for example turkey i e euphrates tigris khabour and the greater zab syria i e euphrates and iran i e the lesser zab diyala teeb dwairej kerkhe and karun waterway bowls iraq is the lower riparian nation of these rivers which makes its water resources management subject to upstream water usage water stockpiling and political interests al faraj and al dabbagh 2015 al faraj and tigkas 2016 turkey and syria control the headwaters of the euphrates and turkey controls the headwaters of the tigris khabour and the greater zab whereas iran controls the headwaters of all river basins common with iraq there are a few studies on understanding the drought episodes and hydrology in iraqi transboundary watersheds for example al faraj et al 2015 and al faraj and tigkas 2016 evaluated spatio temporal meteorological drought conditions over the diyala watershed shared between iraq and iran al faraj and al dabbagh 2015 investigated the changes in meteorological drought and flow regimes in the international lesser zab river basin avarideh et al 2017 evaluated effects of the water sharing on the transboundary sirwan diyala river basin using water resources planning model weap however most studies have conducted their work on a single river basin or analyzed just a few drought indices which may not provide a strong general conclusion moreover the drought characteristics in different parts of the transboundary river basins e g inside or outside of iraq have not been discussed time series analysis e g trend analysis anomalies analysis is common method in the previous studies but spatial evaluation for drought characteristics e g drought duration drought severity were absent this study has following objectives 1 to compare various drought indices in monitoring drought conditions over three iraq transboundary river basins 2 to assess whether there are differences in the variability of drought conditions for various regions e g inside iraq and outside iraq territory or upstream riparian countries with the first objective we calculated multiple drought indices from meteorological drought including standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to agricultural drought such as standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized vegetation index svi the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas and satellite data have been applied for estimating these above drought indices for the second objective we analyze the relationship between drought conditions and annual variation in reservoir surface areas because in a semi arid country such as iraq reservoirs play an important role in supplying drinking water irrigating agricultural crops and generation of hydropower in this study we used landsat images to monitor and estimate annual reservoir area there are a few studies using satellite images to understand the variations of open water bodies surface reservoir wet land in iraq with encourage accuracy al quraishi and kaplan 2021 albarakat et al 2018 alwan and aziz 2021 gao et al 2012 naji and abduljabbar 2019 the novelty of this work lies in i an understanding of drought conditions based on administration national boundary which have been absent in previous studies for the region ii evaluation of various drought indices meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought indices to better characterize drought conditions iii study framework in three basins across different climatic conditions and riparian countries so that the conclusions of this work would be better applicable 2 study area in this study we studied conditions in three reservoirs i e qadisiyah mosul and dukan with their basin boundaries extending to territory outside of iraq i e iran syria and turkey fig 1 these transboundary river basins are thus considered as geopolitically ungauged where data observation networks may exist but data are unavailable for use due to geopolitical constraints du et al 2020 kibler et al 2014 we delineated basins areas associated with the dam locations using srtm dem and corrected basin boundaries with the global runoff data center grdc basin boundary database we hereafter designate these basins corresponding to reservoir outlets dam locations as qadisiyah river basin mosul river basin and dukan river basin the characteristics of these basins are described as follow 2 1 qadisiyah river basin qadisiyah is located on the north side of the haditha dam this reservoir was formed by construction of haditha dam between 1977 and 1986 on the euphrates river as an important artificial water storage site this reservoir provides irrigation water for the nearby fields the main source of this reservoir is euphrates river the euphrates originates in the eastern highlands of turkey it enters the syrian territory at karkamis downstream from the turkish town of birecik it flows southeast across the syrian plateau before entering the iraqi territory near qusaybah the euphrates river is 3000 km long divided between turkey 1230 km the syrian arab republic 710 km and iraq 1060 km fao 2009 the qadisiyah river basin is situated between 32 and 40 n and 36 7 43 8 e the watershed drains an area of 260 000 km2 in total of which about 15 lies in iraq and 85 outside iraq 2 2 mosul river basin mosul dam is located on the tigris river about 60 km north of mosul city this dam was constructed in 1985 and is considered to be one of the largest water reservoirs in iraq khattab and merkel 2014 the main source of this reservoir is the tigris river the tigris originates in eastern turkey and flows through the country until the border city of cizre the tigris river is 1850 km long with 400 km in turkey 32 km on the border between turkey and the syrian arab republic and 1418 km in iraq fao 2009 the tigris river discharges between 60 and 5000 m3 s of water into the mosul dam reservoir khattab and merkel 2014 the outflow has ranged between 100 and 1000 m3 s since the construction of the dam in 1985 al obaydy 1996 mosul dam reservoir is one of the main shared river basins between iraq and turkey the basin is situated between 36 6 and 39 4 n and 39 1 and 44 3 e the watershed drains an area of 52 000 km2 in total of which about 8 lies in iraq and 92 outside iraq 2 3 dukan river basin it is located close to the city of ranya and is a reservoir on the little zab created by the construction of the dukan dam the dukan dam was built between 1954 and 1959 as a multi purpose dam to provide water storage irrigation and hydroelectricity kliot 2005 the lesser zab river is the main water source for the dukan reservoir the lesser zab which originates in the islamic republic of iran is equipped with the dukan dam it begins from the intersection of two small streams to shape the chami kalvem in the azar bayjani gharbi area in iran that flows in a south southeasterly bearing and enters iraqi kurdistan region at that point close to mawat town inside kurdistan region close penjwin town it merges with the siwayl river and streams then a northwesterly way towards rania town until it enters the dukan reservoir hassan et al 2016 the basin is located between 35 4 and 36 9 n and 44 4 and 46 3 e the area of this river basin is 9800 km2 in total of which about 55 lies in iraq and 45 outside iraq as depicted in fig 1 the climate over three river basins exhibits great diversity between in and outside of iraq for qadisiyah river basin the climate inside iraq spreads out in three climate zones with bwh arid desert hot as the dominant climate zone the outside iraq of qadisiyah river basin has across five climate zones from arid climate bwh to cold dry summer hot summer dsa with respect to mosul and dukan river basins the inside iraq parts are located in csa climate zone temperate dry summer hot summer while the outside iraq parts spreads out over csa and dsa mosul river basin and dsa dukan river basin 3 data and methodology 3 1 the famine early warning systems network fews net

where α β and γ are shape scale and original parameter respectively 3 4 3 standardized soil moisture index ssi the ssi is calculated using following equation xu et al 2018 6 ssi vsm i y vsm i σ vsm i where i y represent month and year respectively vsm i and σ vsm i represent average value and standard deviation of vsm at i th month respectively 3 4 4 standardized vegetation index svi the svi is calculated using following expression peters et al 2002 7 svi ndvi i y ndvi i σ ndvi i where i y represent month and year respectively ndvi i and σ ndvi i represent average value and standard deviation of ndvi at i th month respectively 3 4 5 drought characteristics in each pixel temporal drought characteristics were estimated using drought duration dd and drought severity ds le et al 2020 2019 it is noted that the dd and ds were only calculated for meteorological drought indices spi and spei the dd units in month is described in the following eq 8 8 dd i 1 m du i m where du i is i th drought duration which is the number of consecutive months in which the spi spei is below 1 m is the number of drought duration the ds no dimension is described in the following eq 9 9 ds 1 m i 1 du di i di i 1 where di i is spi spei at month i to examine whether drought characteristics drought duration and drought severity inside and outside of iraq are similar equal mean we used t test and wilcoxon rank sum test ott and longnecker 2015 we only consider there is a significant difference in drought duration or in drought severity between two regions when both testes rejected the hypothesis that two mean difference is equal to zero at significant level of 05 3 5 calculation of the surface reservoir area all the landsat images used in this study acquired from usgs earth explorer were geometrically corrected using the envi software the area of interest was clipped where the largest reservoir area in the time series for the time period 1987 2019 of each reservoir was considered as the main shapefile each image is classified with the support vector machine svm supervised classification algorithm svm is a well established technique and has been considerably used in remote sensing applications because of its higher ability to handle smaller training samples and greater classification accuracy huang et al 2002 mantero et al 2005 mountrakis et al 2011 3 6 modified mann kendall trend test trend analysis the mann kendall mk test was performed to analyze the trends of reservoir areas and drought indices the mk test is a non parametric test that statistically assesses the monotonic trends in data over time hirsch and slack 1984 kendall 1948 mann 1945 to provide a robust assessment in the presence of autocorrelated time series which may cause a false interpretation results to the trend yue et al 2002 we removed the serial correlation effect based on the pre whitening method after that we applied for the mk test gocic and trajkovic 2013 to perform modified mann kendall trend test mmk to examine the magnitude of trends we used the sen s slope sen 1968 4 results this section characterizes meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature land surface parameters ndvi and soil moisture and hydrological parameter surface reservoir area for three basins studied in this work 4 1 annual time series analysis from 1987 to 2019 we calculated the annual average precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi to study the patterns from 1987 to 2019 for qadisiyah mosul and dukan river basins that are total basin extent inside iraq and outside iraq that are represented in red green and blue plots respectively fig 2 1 shows the time series of the variability of precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi for each basin fig 2 1a illustrates the precipitation for qadisiyah that are usually much lower than the precipitation of the total basin extent and outside iraq regions due to the differences in the climate characteristics whereas the climate of the inside iraq region is desert fig 1 fig 2 1a exhibits that the maximum value of precipitation for inside iraq is 285 mm while for the outside iraq and total basin extent is 580 mm fig 2 1b shows obvious difference between mean air temperature over inside iraq and outside iraq and the total basin extent it is obvious that the differences between air temperature inside iraq and outside iraq and the total basin extent is around 7 8 c corresponding to the time series due to the high temperatures in the summer reaching to 48 c albarakat and lakshmi 2019a fao 2003 fig 2 1c exhibits the soil moisture values for each river basin the soil moisture plot for inside iraq is usually lower than soil moisture values of outside iraq and the entire qadisiyah basin fig 2 1d shows the ndvi time series 1987 2019 for qadisiyah river basin the three regions inside iraq outside iraq and total basin extent have almost the same values before 1999 whereas from 1999 to 2019 the soil moisture values for inside iraq region have declined due to multiple drought events that have led the upstream countries of euphrates river i e turkey and syria to decrease runoff of the euphrates river into iraq albarakat et al 2018 richardson 2009 richardson and hussain 2006 by storing water in reservoirs fig 2 2 represents the precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi over mosul river basin in the fig 2 2a c and d the precipitation soil moisture and ndvi for inside iraq outside iraq and total basin extent are obviously correlated average r² for the precipitation soil moisture and ndvi were 0 91 0 90 and 0 75 respectively while fig 2 2b shows the difference between mean air temperature over inside iraq and outside iraq and total basin extent the difference between air temperature inside iraq and outside iraq and the total basin extent is 6 7 c corresponding to the time series because of the high temperature during the summer in the part of inside iraq the precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi for dukan river basin are shown in fig 2 3 all variables show high correlation to each other average r² for inter correlation were all above 0 90 for the three main regions inside iraq outside iraq and total basin extent except air temperature in fig 2 3b which shows slight disparity between the three regions a difference of 1 2 in general the time series of precipitation and soil moisture show declines in 1989 1991 1999 2001 2008 2015 and 2018 due to drought events al hedny and muhaimeed 2020 albarakat et al 2018 hameed et al 2018 we also observed that the entire basin and outside iraq similar for most variables but the inside iraq is quite different especially in the qadisiyah mosul river basins it is likely due to the impact of the basin area distribution within and outside iraq fig 3 displays the average and standard deviation of annual precipitation air temperature soil moisture and ndvi whereas x axis for each graph represents the various locations for the three transboundary river basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan the legend is shown in the right side of the fig 3 fig 3a shows that the mean precipitation on total basin extent and outside iraq for qadisiyah and mosul are higher than the inside iraq while the mean precipitation over dukan river basin is quite similar for total basin extent inside iraq outside iraq fig 3b illustrates the average of air temperature for each basin the average air temperature over inside iraq for qadisiyah and mosul river basins is much higher than over entire and outside iraq soil moisture in the fig 3 c shows that the mean value of soil moisture in inside iraq for qadisiyah has a lower value than the entire and outside iraq while the mean values of soil moisture in entire inside iraq and outside iraq for mosul and dukan basins are almost close to each other fig 3d shows the average values of ndvi whereas inside iraq for qadisiyah has a lower mean value of ndvi than entire and outside iraq the values of the mean ndvi for mosul and dukan basins are close to each other fig 3d we observed large differences in precipitation among different basins as well as between inside and outside iraq but not in soil moisture it is quite possible that the evapotranspiration equalizes the soil moisture et demand is so high that the soil moisture decreases in spite of differences in precipitation the spatial distribution of average monthly of precipitation air temperature soil moisture ndvi for the three iraqi transboundary basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan are shown in fig 4 and the average correlation entire basin between these variables is given in table 2 fig 4a shows the average monthly precipitation gradually increased from inside iraq region to outside iraq region where the average monthly precipitation values reached 60 70 mm in turkey and iran territories the monthly average air temperatures show high air temperature in inside iraq region for all basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan and some parts of syria for qadisiyah basin the average monthly air temperature is low in the outside iraq region specially in turkey and iran the average monthly soil moisture and ndvi show lower values in inside iraq than outside iraq and total basin extent among the relationships between hydro meteorological variables p sm at all three basins exhibited statistically positive correlations while ndvi t had statistical negative correlations in mosul and dukan river basins 4 2 annual evolution of the reservoir surface area from 1987 to 2019 we calculated the reservoir surface area at the dam locations for the three basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan from the landsat images we utilized landsat images that have the same acquisition months september as it corresponds to relatively cloud free conditions the time series of each reservoir surface area is 33 years from 1987 to 2019 fig 5 in general fig 5 shows extreme decreases in the reservoir surface area of the three reservoirs in the time periods 1999 2001 2008 2015 and 2017 2018 it is noticed that variation in annual surface reservoir time series exhibited poor correlation with annual precipitation over the river basin r² for qadisiyah mosul and dukan are 0 01 0 01 and 0 14 respectively this implies that changes in the surface reservoir are attributed to multiple factors rather than solely precipitation these decreases in the reservoir surface areas were attributed to drought events al hedny and muhaimeed 2020 hameed et al 2018 the temporal variation of reservoir surface area for qadisiyah mosul and dukan is shown in fig 6 the blue line illustrates the best fit regression line between the reservoir surface areas and time the slope values were calculated using sen s method fig 6 shows a statistically significant negative trend of the two river basins qadisiyah and mosul but not dukan for the given study period 1987 2019 the slope values are 4 11 1 54 and 0 79 for qadisiyah mosul dukan respectively in summary the satellite images adequately quantify the spatial and temporal variability of reservoir areas for example the large variations around 2010 in the qadisiyah reservoir fig 6c can be validated by observation in 2009 iraq registered a record low discharge on the tigris and the euphrates albarakat et al 2018 it is likely due to drought events in 2008 2009 and 2010 in the upstream countries of turkey and syria these events coupled with reduced runoff from iran led to shrinkage in iraqi reservoirs richardson 2009 qadisiyah reservoir was hit relatively harder by the droughts reservoir storage was completely depleted by 2009 and 2010 gao et al 2012 for a comparison the raw image of the year of 2009 extreme drought and the year of 2006 normal year is provided in supplementary material a our analysis confirms that the current annual flow of the euphrates and tigris entering iraq has dropped dramatically this decline can be attributed to many factors such as dam construction in all riparian countries and an increased withdrawal of water for irrigation lück 2014 while the withdrawal of water for irrigation has not well document yet there are several evidences on the links between negative trend of reservoir areas to the construction of large dams in turkey as part of the southeastern anatolia project and the construction of a series of dams in syria and downstream iraq albarakat et al 2018 asia 2013 holmes 2010 according to giovanis and ozdamar 2021 due to dams series built in turkey iran and syria and irrigation projects respondents in iraq have witnessed a lack of water supply and a decline in water surface area overall they found a significant impact of drought and water bodies on the quantity of agricultural products produced such as cereals fruits vegetables and dates ranging between 5 and 22 per cent furthermore they showed a significant impact of climate change related shocks on various outcomes including the decrease in income assets food production and stock in iraq for the euphrates a single dam in the upper part of the catchment the atatürk dam is able to regulate a considerable portion of the river s flow the atatürk dam is commonly regarded as not only turkey s largest dam but also one of the world s largest giovanis and ozdamar 2021 building dam series in the world led to climate change that leads to an increase in global average annual air temperature and regional rainfall variation which is projected to continue and worsen in the future misra 2014 solomon et al 2007 in short iraq has been suffering for years from low water levels flowing on the tigris and euphrates rivers from the neighboring turkey and iran the iraqi government has warned prolonged shortage of drinking water surface water storage and agriculture lands al ansari 2013 2016 osman et al 2017 4 3 assessment of spatio temporal drought indices trends in different parts of river basins fig 7 displays the spatial distribution of mmk trend tests for spi and spei since we calculated the indices at four different timescales for spi and spei we only present in fig 7 the mmk results for spi12 and spei12 only for other timescales the results can be found in the supplementary material b the spi and spei trends exhibited a contrasting pattern the spi generally increased over the period of 1987 2019 except for the middle region of qadisiyah basin fig 7 1 the significant positive trends of the spi index were observed in the northern part of qadisiyah basin and center of iraq on the contrary the spei index in most of the area in iraq and lower area of qadisiyah basin exhibited significant negative trends fig 7 2 the trends of spi and spei index in mosul and dukan are not clear similar observations have been found for other spi and spei timescales please see content in supplementary material b with respect to soil moisture the ssi exhibited significant increasing trends in the center of iraq fig 8 3 this is likely attributed to significant increase in precipitation in form of the spi index as previously described in this area on the other hand a large portion in southwestern part of qadisiyah basin observed significant negative trends in soil moisture for the mosul and dukan basins the ssi index trends generally increased over the study period but only a small portion was observed to have a statistically significant positive trend examination of the vegetation trend the svi indicated that large areas in the southwestern part of qadisiyah and eastern part of mosul exhibited significant negative trends fig 8 4 fig 9 presents distributions of area under mmk test for the ten drought indices in three basins in three regions total basin extent inside of iraq and outside of iraq in this study we focus on the significant negative sn trend areas because they indicate worsened drought conditions over the years in the qadisiyah basin drought trends for areas inside of iraq were more intense than areas outside of iraq demonstrating by high portion sn areas under mmk tests for example for the spei24 index the percentage of areas with sn trends inside and outside iraq were about 100 and 60 in mosul and dukan basin the proportion of sn areas for both inside and outside iraq were comparable it is noticed that spi index reported zero or a small portion of area with sn trends 5 discussion 5 1 inter comparison of multiple drought indices fig 10 presents variation in monthly drought indices for the total basin extent of three basins qadisiyah mosul and dukan for the 33 years 1987 2019 we detected four major drought periods which were in 1989 1991 2000 2003 2007 2012 and 2015 2018 the periods corresponding to these significant drought conditions correspond with previous studies al faraj and scholz 2014 almamalachy et al 2020 and with statistics from the ministry of water resources and the ministry of agriculture in iraq the ratio of land with poor crop harvests due to drought events were significantly higher than in the other years among drought indices the major 1989 1991 drought was clearly observed from spi and spei up to 6 month time scale meanwhile longer time scales of spei such as spei12 and spei24 could monitor the major droughts after 2000 the major drought 2007 2012 was also observed from ssi while the major droughts during 1989 1991 and 2015 2018 were observed by svi it suggested that soil moisture is significantly reduced during 2007 2012 while the green areas were greatly impacted on 1989 1991 and 2015 2018 droughts therefore by using multiple drought indices we can see impacts of drought on different aspects of the hydrological and ecological cycle 5 2 elaboration on drought assessment in different parts of a transboundary river basin reservoir surface area is an important observation to understand water storage change in a basin and can be useful for policy maker in water resources planning kansara and lakshmi 2021 we used the reservoir surface area as a reference dataset to discuss the usefulness of different drought indices e g inside outside iraq our studied basins specifically we aim to forecast the severity of the annual hydrological drought parameter reservoir surface area based on the calculation of various meteorological and agricultural drought indices estimated from fldas from shorter reference periods 9 months meteorological spi spei and agricultural ssi svi drought indices time series were aggregated in a reference period of 9 months then the pearson correlation coefficient of these referenced drought indices time series with annual reservoir surface areas time series were computed this concept is somehow similar to the work of tigkas et al 2012 table 3 presents relationships between various drought indices and change in reservoir surface areas over the study period the relationship in terms of correlation coefficient cc between drought indices and surface reservoir areas are case specifics for the qadisiyah river basin most spi indices short to medium timescales and svi exhibited low correlation with cc values in between 0 and 0 343 the long term spi spi24 in spi24 out spei except for spei3 in and ssi out are significantly correlated with the surface reservoir areas with cc values in between 0 360 and 0 676 for the mosul river basin the change in reservoir areas was only significantly related to the spei3 in spei out and spei6 out cc values in range 0 375 0 436 and ssi out cc 0 399 while that relationship was low with other drought indices cc values in 0 0 33 on the other hand except for svi inside outside iraq all other drought indices exhibited a significant correlation with the reservoir surface areas over the dukan river basin as cc values range from 0 353 to 0 611 the mixed relationship between the reservoir surface areas to the drought indices across basins is likely due to the impact of dams constructed on the outside iraq areas of the studied basins based on global reservoir and dam database grand v1 3 lehner et al 2011 the total large dams 0 1 km³ located in the outside iraq of qadisiyah and mosul river basin are 23 2203 km² of total surface water areas 11 255 km² of total water surface areas respectively while there is no large dam observed at dukan river basin see supplementary material c as the final downstream user of the tigris and euphrates rivers iraq only receives the streamflow that remains after appropriations and diversions by turkey and syria according to the minister of water resources iraq the amount of water flowing in iraq s rivers has fallen by at least 40 in recent decades largely due to the construction of dams voss et al 2013 although the drought indices exhibited a good relationship with reservoir surface areas in dukan river basin where has no existence of large dam they have mostly exhibited low correlations with the change in reservoir surface in mosul and qadisiyah river basins among different timescales long term timescales seem to have a better correlation with the changes in the surface reservoirs areas at the qadisiyah river basin while at the dukan river basin all timescales seem to relate with the reservoir surface areas it suggests the basin size could play a role here as at a large basin like the qadisiyah river the long memory drought indices seem to be useful we also observed that among significant drought indices over the qadisiyah river basin the cc values for the drought indices estimated from the outside of iraq were often higher compared to the drought indices estimated from the inside of iraq the proportional area of inside outside iraq may also explain that difference as a large portion of the area of the qadisiyah river basin is located outside of iraq causing more influence on the impact on the changes in hydrological variable in summary we determined that the selection of drought indices in terms of timescales and spatial inside outside iraq depends on the basin size and proportional area between in and out of iraq we also found the challenge of the current drought indices in accurately monitoring the drought conditions due to the existence of large dams within the basin we also examined how the drought duration dd and drought severity ds were different between inside and outside iraq fig 11 presents dd and ds across three basins and various regions inside outside iraq based on the period 1987 2019 for the qadisiyah river basin dd inside of iraq seems to be longer than that dd outside of iraq demonstrated by the dd s mean values of inside iraq statistically higher than that mean values of outside of iraq for spi6 spi12 spi24 spei3 spei6 spei12 and spei24 the difference between ds are mixed ds was more intense ds in ds out with spi12 spi24 spei24 and spei24 however with short timescales drought index spi3 and spei3 the outside of iraq exhibited statistically higher mean of ds as compared to the inside of iraq for the mosul river basin the dd were higher statistically significant with only two indices spi24 and spei3 with respect to ds inside of iraq its mean ds values from short to long timescales of spi spi 3 6 12 24 and long term spei24 were statistically higher than that mean ds values of the outside of the iraq however the short to medium timescales of spei spei3 spei6 experienced a statistical higher mean ds values for the outside of iraq as compared to the inside of iraq over the dukan river basin no significant difference in both dd and ds between inside outside iraq has been ascertained in summary we observed importance features of long term drought indices at both qadisiyah and mosul river basin the drought duration and drought severity obtained from inside outside iraq were significantly different with such a drought monitoring system with long term drought indices spi12 spi24 spei12 spei24 could be essential to effectively monitor the drought dynamics at various parts of the basin 6 conclusions since many river basins in iraq are spread out over different nations there are challenges to acquiring field observations for total basin extent due to administrative issues therefore global and satellite datasets are of great interest to characterize hydrometeorological features in such transboundary river basins in this study we explored drought conditions at three iraqi transboundary river basins that are qadisiyah mosul and dukan based on differences in administrative boundary inside iraq and outside iraq we used fldas avhrr and landsat datasets to investigate differences of drought conditions inside outside iraq during 33 years 1987 2019 and discuss on the usefulness of multiple timescales drought indices on the specific studied regions below are our major findings a we observed contradictory patterns for meteorological variables in the qadisiyah and mosul river basins precipitation much lower air temperature much higher for the inside of iraq as compared to the corresponding values for the outside of iraq b variations of reservoirs surface areas exhibited significantly negative trends in qadisiyah and mosul river basins the landsat satellite has proved its capability in capturing extreme drought events for example the year of 2009 over the qadisiyah reservoir c temporal variation of different drought indices from 1987 to 2019 over qadisiyah mosul and dukan river basins exhibited significant exacerbation of drought over iraq during the periods of 1989 1991 2000 2003 2007 2012 and 2015 2018 these drought events matched data from the ministry of water resources and the ministry of agriculture in iraq the ratio of land with poor crop harvests due to drought events were significantly higher than other years d we found out the importance of long term meteorological drought indices 12 24 month timescales of spi spei in monitoring drought conditions over the studied regions as i they exhibited a good relationship with reservoir surface areas ii drought characteristics duration severity of these indices are statistically significant difference between inside outside iraq the soil moisture drought index ssi are also considered for qadisiyah and dukan river basins while vegetation index svi is useful for mosul river basin on the other hand we found the challenges in using the current drought indices towards accurately monitoring the drought conditions with the presence of large dams within the basin transboundary watersheds pose policy and diplomacy concerns for the countries involved several such issues have resulted in the recent years over sharing of water the use of satellite data is helpful in this regard for example precipitation from satellite sensors compares well with rain gage networks hashemi et al 2017 le et al 2018 mondal et al 2018 specifically when in situ observations of streamflow are not shared between countries and groundwater storage is seldom observed and even if they are far and few monitoring wells the use of high resolution soil moisture data fang et al 2021a 2018 2013 2020 2021b and models lakshmi et al 2018 are helpful in this regard proper identification of the onset of the drought as well as its progression using the publicly available satellite data can help policy makers negotiate amicably

7958,study region regional precipitation gradient across kansas usa study focus as precipitation increases baseflow and surface runoff generally increase but it is unclear whether they increase proportionally and how proportions respond to climate and land use changes this study examined variation in streamflow components of perennial streams across the study region and its relationships with watershed properties we evaluated streamflow components with hydrograph separation and used spearman s rank correlation tests and principal component analysis pca to assess spatial trends 28 sites and mann kendall and sen s slope tests to assess temporal relationships 9 sites 1960 2018 new hydrological insights for region runoff and baseflow both increase eastward with precipitation but the increase is greater for runoff as such baseflow index bfi baseflow streamflow decreases with increasing precipitation potentially reflecting the limits of infiltration on recharge runoff partitioning spatial patterns in variables that influence infiltration land use and soil texture also vary with precipitation consistent with long term influences of climate on landscapes since 1960 the watersheds included in our temporal analysis experienced small mainly insignificant increases in precipitation and temperature and large significant increases in irrigation during this time bfi increased significantly only in semi arid agriculture dominated catchments overlaying higher permeability deposits these findings underscore the importance of watershed characteristics as controls on current spatial patterns in streamflow and bfi and also the sensitivity of streamflow and bfi to climate and land use changes over time graphical abstract this study examines variation in runoff ro baseflow bf and the baseflow index bfi in perennial streams across the kansas usa precipitation gradient we identify current spatial trends for each and also whether they have changed over time we also consider how spatiotemporal variation relates to watershed characteristics land use and climate variables ga1 keywords streamflow components precipitation gradient groundwater climate change land use 1 introduction the two major components of streamflow are runoff and baseflow runoff is water that runs over the land surface during precipitation and snowmelt events whereas baseflow is water added to streams from the subsurface baseflow sustains flow between precipitation events and helps regulate surface water quality and quantity price 2011 the contribution of baseflow to streamflow is known to be sensitive to catchment and regional characteristics such as precipitation temperature topography geology and land use defined here to include land use cover and management following zipper et al 2018 price 2011 carlier et al 2018 however how baseflow varies on large spatial and temporal scales is not well known for many regions miller et al 2016 ficklin et al 2016 cuthbert et al 2019 changes to baseflow can significantly impact water supplies and thus are important to understand for effective management and protection of water resources in this study we consider variation in the contribution of baseflow to streams across the kansas regional precipitation gradient fig 1 the precipitation gradient across the state is one of the steepest in the us and may be changing in response to climate change mean annual precipitation is as low as 635 mm yr 25 in yr at the western margin of the state to as high as 1145 mm yr 45 in yr in the east previous research indicates that a warming climate increases atmospheric moisture and moisture demand over land held and soden 2006 ipcc 2021 these changes can directly alter the occurrence and patterns in subsurface storage and streamflow which can stress water resources and increase flooding and drought risks milly et al 2005 brikowski 2008 layzell and evans 2013 seager et al 2018 cuthbert et al 2019 precipitation data collected since the 1890 s indicates that total annual rainfall has generally increased across the state particularly during the second half of the 20th century rahmani et al 2015 however over that same time span average statewide warming of 0 06 c per decade appears to be increasing dryness in western kansas but not central and eastern kansas based on changes in the palmer drought severity index lin et al 2017 alongside variation in precipitation the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow may also vary across the study area in response to land use most of the study region is used for agriculture but urban land use is also present in agricultural landscapes irrigation pumping can decrease baseflow by lowering the water table earman and dettinger 2011 barlow and leake 2012 brikowski 2008 however it can also increase baseflow by adding irrigation return flow to streams blodgett et al 1992 either way impacts of irrigation on baseflow may typically be greater in more arid regions where rates of irrigation pumping are generally greater famiglietti et al 2011 voss et al 2013 in urban areas an increased abundance of impermeable surfaces increases runoff and thus decreases recharge and groundwater inputs to streams ku et al 1992 however leaky infrastructure in urban settings can increase groundwater recharge and subsequent discharge to streams lerner 2002 bhaskar et al 2015 moreover in both agricultural and urban settings changes in plant growth can impact the contribution of baseflow to streamflow by altering soil permeability and evapotranspiration et patterns zhang and schilling 2006 price 2011 teutschbein et al 2018 these examples illustrate that impacts of land use are variable in general however land use changes that increase infiltration and recharge tend to increase baseflow to streams whereas those that increase evapotranspiration tend to decrease baseflow price 2011 the interaction of changes in land use and climate can have complex feedbacks for water resources changes in climate can cause changes in land use which can in turn impact water resources and greenhouse gas budgets enough to drive further changes in climate at local and even regional scales foley et al 2005 brown and pervez 2014 zabel et al 2014 bajželj and richards 2014 although the coupled impacts of climate and land use have clear implications for water resources our ability to analyze those impacts is made difficult by such feedback loops as well as the scales at which each occurs climate groundwater response times can occur over thousands of years cuthbert et al 2019 whereas impacts of land use change can manifest within years or decades zhang et al 2016 further the coupled impacts of climate and land use can occur on different spatial scales with local land use effects superimposed on regional climate controls wang and hejazi 2011 martin et al 2017 wang and stephenson 2018 zipper et al 2018 regional scale studies may be critical to studying these relationships and their impact on baseflow ayers et al 2018 tan et al 2020 recently a study examining relationships across the entire us found that runoff and baseflow generally increase with precipitation yet the relationship between precipitation and the proportion of baseflow in streamflow was variable suggesting that regional factors were influential ficklin et al 2016 numerous physical catchment properties can impact streamflow components making it difficult to determine spatiotemporal patterns and relationships santhi et al 2008 price 2011 gnann et al 2019 previous studies have investigated various watershed characteristics including topography geology soil land use and climate on baseflow and its proportion in streamflow within the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 2020 miller et al 2016 however these studies are specific to the study area which differs considerably from kansas studies that have included kansas and the midwestern us brikowski 2008 ayers et al 2018 were focused on impacts of climate and land use and did not consider other factors known to drive baseflow generation and occurrence including soil and bedrock composition which can be among the most important controls richardson et al 2020 to help fill this knowledge gap this study uses the kansas regional precipitation gradient as a natural laboratory to examine how variation in precipitation rate land use and various watershed characteristics impact proportions of baseflow in streams results of our analysis are particularly relevant to the central great plains of the us along which the precipitation gradient occurs however the results may also shed light on potential future impacts of changes in the amount of precipitation in other regions for our analysis we used streamflow records and watershed data to understand spatiotemporal patterns in the partitioning of streamflow components and their variation in response to changes in precipitation land use and other watershed properties we first performed hydrograph separation calculations on stream discharge data from 28 watersheds across the precipitation gradient to analyze current spatial variation in streamflow components the calculations evaluated runoff ro baseflow bf and baseflow index bfi which is the proportion of baseflow in total streamflow we then used spearman s rank correlation tests to examine the relationship of these streamflow components to watershed characteristics across the precipitation gradient due to high covariance between some variables we conducted a principal component analysis pca to better understand relative significances of watershed and climate variables secondly in nine watersheds with longer data records we examined temporal trends 1960 2018 in hydrograph results climate and land use data using mann kendall and sen s slope analyses 2 materials methods 2 1 site selection and study area for our analysis we selected usgs gage sites across kansas that met requirements of hydrograph separation specifically the analysis requires watersheds with drainage areas less than 1300 km2 500 mi2 and streamflow contributions primarily from groundwater discharge and surface runoff barlow et al 2014 none of the sites are downstream from dams or discharges from wastewater treatment facilities hydrograph separation analysis is most accurate when averaged over longer time periods on the range of years barlow et al 2014 so we required streams to have a minimum of 14 years of continuous discharge data to maximize accuracy and number of sites included more details about this choice are provided in the next section below the resulting 28 sites span a steep precipitation gradient from eastern to west central kansas fig 1 annual precipitation varies from 635 mm yr 25 in yr at the most western site up to 1145 mm 45 in yr at the furthest east site giving a gradient of approximately 1 3 mm km 0 1 in mi in average annual precipitation reflecting this precipitation gradient soil moisture and vegetation change across the state with temperate deciduous forests and temperate tallgrass prairie in eastern kansas to semi arid grasslands in the west seager et al 2018 elevation also decreases eastward from 1231 to 207 m with a gradient of 2 6 m km 4038 679 ft 13 7 ft mi the sites include a range of sediments and sedimentary rocks deposited from the paleozoic to the cenozoic eras kgs 2008 from the western border extending into central kansas the predominant surficial rock and sediment type is unconsolidated silt and sand from loess and river valley deposits cretaceous shale sandstone and chalk deposits kgs 2008 in the eastern portion of the state the lithology is predominantly flat lying alternating limestone and mudstone of the permian and carboniferous systems stoeser et al 2005 similarly kansas aquifers shift from unconsolidated sand gravel and sandstone aquifers of the larger great plains and high plains aquifers out west to limestone aquifers of the flint hills and osage aquifers in the east with glacial drift aquifers in the northeast corner macfarlane et al 2000 alluvial aquifers are scattered across the state and tend to dominate in eastern areas that experience high streamflow macfarlane et al 2000 dominant surficial rock type and aquifer maps can be found in figs s1 and s2 of the supporting information 2 2 hydrograph separation we carried out the hydrograph separations using discharge data from each site with the usgs groundwater gw toolbox software barlow et al 2017 the software requires daily discharge data which we acquired from the united states geological survey usgs national water information system usgs 2016 for all 28 sites we collected daily streamflow data from 2004 to 2018 to calculate a 14 year average for runoff baseflow and bfi which we use as representative of current conditions as stated in section 2 1 graphical hydrograph separation analysis is more accurate when the hydrograph data span annual or longer time scales barlow et al 2014 considering that surface water and groundwater processes often occur over months to decades price 2011 jasechko 2019 we sought to extend our time scale beyond a decade to analyze current conditions our choice of 14 years allowed us to achieve that goal and also maximize the number of sites included in our analysis of current relationships across the precipitation gradient for nine sites with long data records we also carried out an analysis of changes in streamflow components over time for those sites we collected daily streamflow data from 1960 through 2018 to calculate annual and seasonal averages for runoff baseflow and bfi we averaged results from the cold and dry jan feb oct dec months and the warm and wet april sept months for the seasonal analysis we will refer to the two seasons as dry and wet seasons from this point forward gw toolbox contains six different hydrograph separation methods to partition the discharge records into baseflow and runoff components part bfi standard and modified and hysep fixed sliding interval and local minimum a detailed description for each method is available in the gw toolbox user manual barlow et al 2014 briefly the various separation analyses partition runoff from baseflow by determining the portions of the hydrograph that are not affected by runoff via various methods turning point factor recession index algorithms to connect low points and continuous recession none of these methods appear to be more appropriate than the others for application to our study region as such we carried out both the spatial and temporal analyses using the average of all six methods we ran our analyses using the original settings in usgs gw toolbox partition length n days 5 turning point test factor f 0 9 daily recession index k 0 97915 the watershed drainage area mi2 for each site is used to normalize the initial results of the hydrograph separation given in cubic feet per second cfs to flow rate per unit area cfs mi2 the software then converts values of streamflow components runoff and baseflow to units of inches the bfi results are presented as unitless values between 0 no baseflow component and 1 no runoff component we then converted units for runoff and baseflow cm for our analyses 2 3 watershed water usage and climate data we gathered various watershed data from open source online databases kansas land cover patterns percent forest urban agriculture and grassland were gathered from raster data from the 2005 kansas land cover patterns mapping initiative peterson et al 2009 percent grassland includes grassland and pasture and percent agriculture is defined as row crop agriculture geologic data was gathered from kgs and usgs stoeser et al 2005 falcone 2011 additional watershed data elevation potential evapotranspiration pet soil clay and sand content was gathered from usgs gages ii falcone 2011 annual climate mean precipitation and temperature data were gathered from prism climate data at 4 km resolution for all 28 sites from the past 30 years and monthly data from 1960 to 2018 were collected for the nine sites included in the temporal analysis prism 2020 we also gathered annual county wide land square km acres irrigated and groundwater usage cubic meter acre feet diverted data from kgs water information management and analysis system wimas for the web for nine sites used in the temporal analysis wilson et al 2005 land use average annual climate and additional watershed data used for the spatial analysis can be found in tables s1 and s2 of the si annual and monthly climate data and annual land use data used for the temporal analysis can be found in tables s10 s11 and s12 of the si 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were carried out using rstudio version 1 2 5033 rstudio team 2019 for all analyses we considered probability values p less than 0 05 to be significant we carried out nonparametric kruskal wallis tests to determine if the results from the six hydrograph separation methods were significantly different to identify specifically which method s were significantly different we conducted a pairwise wilcox test additionally we assessed if bfi values were significantly different based on the dominant aquifer underlying each site with a one way anova this approach is appropriate given that bfi values are normally distributed for all 28 sites we tested the strength of relationships between the hydrograph results and climate and watershed parameters using spearman s rho rank order correlation test we used a threshold for significance of correlation rho greater than the absolute value of 0 40 due to the high covariance between variables within the dataset we conducted a principal component analysis pca using the factominer package lê et al 2008 prior to or during the analysis data with high absolute values were transformed and standardized mean of zero and standard deviation of one the results were extracted and visualized using the factoextra package kassambara and mundt 2020 we used eigenvalue 1 as a cutoff for which principal components pc are considered in the results and discussion as that threshold indicates variance within the component is greater than that of a single variable kaiser 1961 we tested the strength and significance of temporal relationships using mann kendall and sen s slope analyses the mann kendall test determines the presence of trends in the time series data where positive and negative values indicate increasing and decreasing trends respectively sen s slope determines the magnitude or the slope of that trend the larger the number the greater the slope and thus the greater the change over time these analyses are common in studies that analyze climate and streamflow time series because they do not require the data to follow any specific distribution marques da silva et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 the tests were used for annual trends in streamflow components ro bf bfi climate temperature and precipitation and groundwater usage and irrigated acreage and for seasonal trends in streamflow components and climate data 3 results 3 1 variability between hydrograph separation methods differences in runoff estimates were insignificant for all hydrograph separation methods fig 2 a average runoff across the gradient is 13 23 cm 4 80 in the difference in baseflow for local minimum modified and standard methods are insignificant from each other with an average value of 3 50 cm 1 29 in p 0 05 but are significantly different from hysep fixed and part which have an average of 4 97 cm 1 82 in p 0 05 one method hysep slide is insignificantly different from both groups and has an average of 5 03 cm 1 85 in similarly the difference in bfi for local minimum modified and standard methods are insignificantly different from each other with an average of 0 25 but again are significantly different from hysep fixed and part which has an average of 0 33 however for bfi hysep slide is significantly different from both groups and has an average of 0 34 standard deviations on the means calculated for each method are depicted by the error bars in fig 2b although there is some variability between methods the trend with longitude is consistent for each method moving forward we incorporate the differences in these estimates by using average values for runoff baseflow and bfi to compare the hydrograph separation results to climate and watershed data in both the spatial and temporal analyses detailed results of the hydrograph separation and the statistical test kruskal wallis and pairwise wilcox test results are located in tables s3 s6 of the si 3 2 spatial variation under current conditions average runoff and baseflow in streams increases eastward across the study area p 0 005 fig 2b the increase in runoff 0 81 26 6 cm is greater than that for baseflow 0 86 9 90 cm as a result the proportion of baseflow in total streamflow bfi generally decreased eastward from 0 6 to 0 26 p 0 01 these streamflow components vary significantly with some of the climate land use and soil parameters in our dataset fig 3 among climate variables streamflow components are more strongly related to precipitation than temperature or pet precipitation positively correlates with runoff and baseflow and negatively correlates with bfi while temperature and pet only have weak but significant relationships with runoff and bfi respectively precipitation co varies with elevation and longitude across the precipitation gradient thus it is not surprising that streamflow components are also significantly correlated with elevation and longitude among land use variables streamflow components do not have significant relationships with the proportion of grassland in the watershed which is the dominant land cover in most watersheds however runoff positively correlates with forest land cover and baseflow negatively correlates with agricultural land cover bfi is significantly correlated to urban land cover lastly the clay content of watershed soils is positively related to runoff and baseflow and sand is negatively related to runoff full results of the spearman s rank correlations can be found in figs s3 s8 and table s7 of the si the pca results show that approximately 86 of the total variance is explained by principal components pc 1 4 fig s9 table s17 which we focus on here and in the discussion below the pca weightings and contribution of variance for watershed climate and hydrograph variables are presented in table 1 for interpreting pca weightings similar values in magnitude demonstrate highly correlated variables with positive and negative values indicating positive and negative correlations respectively precipitation runoff longitude baseflow and clay are highly correlated with each other as seen by similar in magnitude and sign weightings on pc1 elevation is negatively correlated to the aforementioned variables shown by the equal but opposite negative weightings on pc1 temperature and sand are positively correlated for pc2 while negatively correlated with latitude for pc3 bfi and grassland are positively correlated to each other and both are negatively correlated to agriculture and pet grassland and urban land use are negatively correlated on pc4 the contribution of variables to the variance shows which variables best explain the variability within each pc fig 4 in general precipitation runoff longitude elevation baseflow and percent clay contribute similarly to the total variance of pc1 accounting for between 10 and 13 each as observed by clustering of variables along axis 1 fig 4 a latitude and temperature contribute roughly 30 to the total variance of pc2 followed by percent sand and forest cover 17 and 10 respectively pet accounts for 30 of variance captured in pc3 followed by bfi percent agriculture and grassland 19 17 10 respectively percent grassland and urban land cover each account for 38 of variance in pc4 the full results of the pca all biplots eigenvalues and variable contributions can be found in fig s9 and s10 and tables s13 and s17 of the si 3 3 variation over time the results of the temporal analysis show that bfi has increased significantly at four sites bow white rock salt and mill at washington from 1960 through 2018 fig 5 the change in bfi was small slope 0 01 for all sites even at sites with significant trends bfi increased at most sites except at the three easternmost sites mill at paxico soldier at topeka and stranger similarly baseflow increased at all sites except the three eastern sites however all trends were insignificant and small slope 0 04 cm year fig 5 runoff decreased at most sites with salt mill at paxico and soldier at topeka as exceptions similar to baseflow the trends in runoff were insignificant and small slope 0 02 cm year annual average precipitation increased at all sites with the trendline slopes ranging from 0 22 to 2 18 but the increase was significant only at the westernmost site bow temperature also increased slightly across all sites with the trendline slopes ranging from 0 002 to 0 02 mm year with significant increases occurring at two sites chapman and soldier at topeka groundwater use and irrigated acreage increased significantly at all sites fig 6 the slopes for land use parameters were large ranging from 32 003 bow to 292 918 soldier for groundwater use m3 year and 85 410 black vermillion to 1 281 821 soldier for irrigated area km2 year the results of the seasonal temporal analysis show that bfi significantly increased at five sites bow white rock salt and both mill at washington and paxico for the dry season and at two sites bow and white rock for the wet season fig 7 the slope of the trendlines were positive for both seasons at all sites except for the wet season at mill at paxico soldier at topeka and stranger changes in baseflow were insignificant at all sites for both seasons except bow in the dry season the slope of the trendlines were positive at all sites but mill both seasons and stranger dry season runoff significantly decreased at one site white rock in the dry season changes in runoff for the wet season were insignificant at all sites trendline slopes were negative at all sites for the dry season sites and three sites for the wet season bow white rock and chapman overall the trendline slopes were small less than 0 005 for bfi baseflow and runoff seasonal changes in precipitation were insignificant at all sites for both the wet and dry seasons temperature did not vary significantly during the wet season for all sites but increased significantly at two sites chapman and soldier for the dry season climate trends were generally positive except for variation in precipitation at two sites mill at paxico in wet season black vermillion in dry season and temperature at one site white rock in wet season full results of the annual and seasonal hydrograph results climate and land use data can be found in tables s8 s12 and results of the mann kendall and sen s slope analyses can be found in tables s14 15 of the si 4 discussion 4 1 influence of watershed characteristics on spatial patterns of streamflow and bfi the spatial analysis of hydrograph separation results reveals significant and surprising relationships with precipitation baseflow and runoff are significantly correlated with increasing precipitation fig 3 rho 0 76 and 0 95 respectively fig 4 a consistent with other studies that have found strong relationships between streamflow components and climate ficklin et al 2016 ayers et al 2018 rumsey et al 2020 we expected the average bfi in streamflow to also increase with precipitation however we observe that the calculated bfi values decrease significantly with increasing precipitation fig 3 rho 0 42 and negatively correlated with precipitation runoff and baseflow on pc1 fig 4 a we interpret the relationship between precipitation and bfi to reflect the influence of infiltration on the contribution of groundwater to streams during precipitation events some portion of the water infiltrates the surface percolates downward and ultimately recharges the underlying saturated zone thus the amount of precipitation influences the absolute amount of groundwater discharge to streams by affecting recharge rates price 2011 however when the rate of precipitation exceeds the infiltration capacity of a soil runoff is generated loague et al 2010 where infiltration capacity is exceeded further increases in precipitation will increase the proportion of precipitation that flows over the land surface as runoff we reason that the frequency with which this capacity is exceeded is likely higher in areas that receive more precipitation where that is the case the relative contribution of groundwater to streamflow would decrease with increasing precipitation consistent with our observations partitioning between runoff and recharge across the precipitation gradient also varies in response to differences in natural watershed permeability increasing soil clay content is associated with decreased permeability and limited infiltration and groundwater recharge which can ultimately impact groundwater discharge to streams hillel 1982 wolock et al 2004 rumsey et al 2015 this relationship likely contributes to the high and positive correlation of soil clay content with precipitation longitude runoff baseflow and the weak negative association between soil clay content and bfi fig 4 a similarly surficial sediment and underlying bedrock type may also influence spatial trends in streamflow components specifically bf and bfi the western streams in our study area tend to be located on coarse sand and gravel deposits sandstones and chalks that have relatively high hydraulic conductivity 102 103 3 1 and 30 m day respectively de marsily 1986 and are associated with high rates of infiltration recharge and discharge wolock 2004 santhi et al 2008 a shift in the relationships of precipitation with baseflow and bfi coincides with a change in bedrock composition fig 8 the flint hills region consists of alternating limestone and mudstone bedrock in an early stage of karstification macpherson et al 2008 which could support high infiltration rates that contribute to higher proportions of groundwater discharge indeed the anova results show that sites within the flint hills have significantly different bfi values compared to sites with streams flowing over strictly alluvial aquifers and overlying the dakota aquifer fig 8 table s16 alongside variation in soil and bedrock composition land use can also alter surface permeability and contribute to variation in streamflow components across the study area the correlation between bfi and urban land use fig 3 table 1 fig 4b potentially reflects the influence of impermeable surfaces in urban environments which can limit infiltration into the subsurface ku et al 1992 price 2011 as mentioned in the introduction also as mentioned previously changes to agricultural crop forest and grassland coverage have the potential to impact streamflow and surface properties by altering plant compositions in ways that affect water fluxes into the subsurface sullivan et al 2019 compared to areas used for crops grasslands can have lower evapotranspiration and higher infiltration rates which work to increase baseflow and groundwater discharge nie et al 2011 although agricultural crop land use impacts to streamflow can vary increased evapotranspiration as well as irrigation rates associated with crop areas have the potential to decrease groundwater discharge to streams wen and chen 2006 price 2011 such interactions between vegetation and water resources may explain the relationships we observed between land use bfi and pet on pc3 table 1 fig 4b the positive correlation between grassland and bfi coupled with negative correlation of bfi with agriculture and pet could indicate that such tradeoffs are occurring however finer scale data and analysis to unequivocally identify mechanisms these results illustrate the coupled nature of potential controls on streamflow components across broad regions our study area spans a steep precipitation gradient and as precipitation changes it affects land use land cover and other natural watershed properties for example the amount of urban and forested area in a watershed are positively correlated with precipitation while the amount of agriculture is negatively correlated with precipitation across the study area significant spearman rho p 0 005 fig 4 a these superimposed relationships suggest that the spatial patterns in streamflow components are driven by the precipitation gradient both directly and indirectly by influencing to patterns in land use and physical watershed properties across the study area together these findings add to the growing knowledge that the effects of local land use on hydrologic processes are often superimposed on larger climate trends wang and hejazi 2011 martin et al 2017 wang and stephenson 2018 zipper et al 2018 and is important to take into consideration for future management of water resources 4 2 impact of long term trends in climate and land use on bfi increases in average annual precipitation and temperature that we observe from 1960 are consistent with results rahmani et al 2015 and lin et al 2017 as mentioned in the introduction the general trends observed by those studies included an increase in annual precipitation and temperature across the state alongside these changes irrigated acreage and groundwater use also increased for all watersheds although these changes in climate and land use all trend in the same direction their influences on streamflow appear to be different for the three easternmost sites where bfi decreased compared to the five westernmost sites where bfi increased fig 5 we hypothesize that the differences between eastern and western sites reflect natural antecedent properties of each watershed as discussed in the paragraphs below watershed characteristics are not only important for determining hydrological processes under current climate but also their response to changing conditions teutschbein et al 2018 first differences in soil and bedrock composition and land use likely impact the streamflow response to increasing precipitation over time as they do across the precipitation gradient currently section 4 1 specifically soil and bedrock in the eastern watersheds generally has lower permeability than the western watersheds reflecting differences in soil clay content urbanization and bedrock units as precipitation and irrigation increases soils and bedrock that are more permeable would be better able to accommodate an increase in infiltration than those with lower permeability yu et al 2000 wang et al 2009 vaezi et al 2010 thus with increasing precipitation and irrigation a greater proportion of the water may have infiltrated the subsurface in the western watersheds but not the eastern watersheds causing their bfi values to increase and decrease over time respectively consistent with this interpretation more permeable lithologies such as sandstones have been found to provide a buffering effect that can sustain low flows during dry periods carlier et al 2018 their permeability is high enough to allow them to store large amounts of water during precipitation events but low enough to prevent a sharp decrease in storage after the event further combined effects of higher clay content and urban land cover can also result in increased rates of sedimentation and siltation within stream channels which intensifies the decoupling of surface groundwater resources and negatively impacts water quality jones et al 2015 michalek et al 2021 secondly the different response between the eastern and western watersheds may reflect the greater aridity of the western sites previous studies have also found that relatively arid catchments are more sensitive to impacts from climate and land use changes than humid catchments where water is more abundant farmer et al 2003 wang and hejazi 2011 third changes in seasonal patterns could also play a role in driving the trends over time we observe that most watersheds have experienced increases in bfi over time however increases in bfi were significant in five watersheds for the dry season jan mar and oct dec compared to only two watersheds in the wet season april sept fig 7 precipitation and temperature also generally increased although not significantly in the dry season while the wet season does not appear to demonstrate consistent trends such changes in precipitation seasonality could be affecting the proportions of recharge and runoff and thus values of bfi over time jones and banner 2003 zhang et al 2020 temperatures during the dry season are generally lower than those during the wet season if a greater proportion of the annual precipitation falls while temperatures are cooler lower evapotranspiration rates during that time may allow greater infiltration and recharge earman and dettinger 2011 significant changes in bfi seasonality primarily occurred in western watersheds which again support the notion that western watersheds appear to be more sensitive to changing conditions both annually and seasonally due to different watershed characteristics 4 3 limitations there are important limitations to our analyses that should be considered when interpreting the results of our study first hydrograph separation techniques are relatively simple widely used and useful metric for understanding relationships between groundwater discharge and watershed characteristics eckhardt 2008 tesoriero et al 2009 price 2011 ficklin et al 2016 but the results are estimates of streamflow components and bfi with true values often unknown eckhardt 2008 barlow et al 2014 the accuracy of the hydrograph separation method is dependent on local factors such as watershed topography channel geomorphology and geology price 2011 alternative approaches have been used to validate results of hydrograph separation e g chemical and isotopic tracers however such validations and data required for them are geographically limited eckhardt 2008 and these alternative methods have their own limitations by comparing the results of multiple hydrograph separation techniques we can help ensure accuracy barlow et al 2014 for our study we observed good agreement between methods fig 2b coupled with methodological uncertainty there are also uncertainties that arise from our data sources the groundwater usage and total irrigation acreage data are county wide rather than watershed specific and are self reported until 1980 wilson et al 2005 additionally the climate data are not field measured data but rather the data are extrapolated modeled from the prism climate group model although such climate data is frequently used in these types of analysis e g ficklin et al 2016 the data could miss intensity and frequency of climate data that is crucial in understanding patterns in groundwater discharge over time similarly we use average values for many watershed and streamflow properties which can result in lost information or over underestimation of trends gnann et al 2019 in reality interactions between numerous landscape variables are likely influencing streamflow generation and overall watershed hydrology to some extent at both spatial and temporal scales rumsey et al 2015 teutschbein et al 2018 this work is exploratory in nature the relationships we identified and our interpretation of them are based largely on statistical analysis future work is warranted that aims to assess finer scales of streamflow components in space and time determine causal and functional relationships between watershed variables streamflow components and bfi and to and make water quantity quality predictions regardless our results add to the growing knowledge on the importance of understanding the complex relationships between watershed variables climate and land use on regional water quantity and quality price 2011 zipper at al 2018 teutschbein et al 2018 5 concluding remarks this study examined spatial and temporal variation in streamflow components across the kansas precipitation gradient to better understand how climate and land use variation impacts the contribution of baseflow to streamflow the spatial analysis demonstrates that under current conditions both runoff and baseflow increase significantly in the direction of increasing precipitation however bfi decreases significantly with increasing precipitation because the increase in runoff with precipitation is greater than the increase in baseflow we interpret this result to reflect the limits of infiltration on the proportion of precipitation that recharges the subsurface and can ultimately discharge into a stream as precipitation increases a greater proportion of water may be diverted over the land surface rather than through the subsurface in addition variation in the permeability of watershed soil and bedrock in response to natural lithologic variation and land use also appears to contribute variation in bfi across the study area spatial patterns in many watershed properties e g land use soil clay content are driven by precipitation therefore our results highlight the long term importance of climate on landscape composition and water resources our temporal analysis indicates that bfi significantly increased during 1960 2018 at sites in the western half of our study area precipitation temperature irrigated acreage and groundwater pumping all increased over the same time interval and thus may have contributed to the observed increase in bfi however we hypothesize that the western watersheds were more sensitive to these changes than the eastern watersheds because the western watersheds have more permeable soils and bedrock and lower rates of annual precipitation these characteristics not only influence streamflow under current climate but also its response to changing conditions teutschbein et al 2018 these findings have important implications for water quantity and quality across the kansas precipitation gradient and beyond first the same properties that make the western watersheds more sensitive to variation in climate and land use likely make them more susceptible to groundwater contamination watersheds with high permeability soil and bedrock are considered high risk for groundwater contamination usgs 1999 second an increase in bfi coupled with widespread agricultural development may be causing an increase in the export of nutrients from groundwater to surface water over time if so this change would alter surface water composition and may promote algal growth johnson and stets 2020 brookfield et al 2021 third our work provides a strong foundation for understanding streamflow drivers and how they vary spatially and temporally past 60 years in our study region but also in other moderate to low relief regions where changes in precipitation rates will occur therefore the results of this study are important to consider for future water management across

7958,study region regional precipitation gradient across kansas usa study focus as precipitation increases baseflow and surface runoff generally increase but it is unclear whether they increase proportionally and how proportions respond to climate and land use changes this study examined variation in streamflow components of perennial streams across the study region and its relationships with watershed properties we evaluated streamflow components with hydrograph separation and used spearman s rank correlation tests and principal component analysis pca to assess spatial trends 28 sites and mann kendall and sen s slope tests to assess temporal relationships 9 sites 1960 2018 new hydrological insights for region runoff and baseflow both increase eastward with precipitation but the increase is greater for runoff as such baseflow index bfi baseflow streamflow decreases with increasing precipitation potentially reflecting the limits of infiltration on recharge runoff partitioning spatial patterns in variables that influence infiltration land use and soil texture also vary with precipitation consistent with long term influences of climate on landscapes since 1960 the watersheds included in our temporal analysis experienced small mainly insignificant increases in precipitation and temperature and large significant increases in irrigation during this time bfi increased significantly only in semi arid agriculture dominated catchments overlaying higher permeability deposits these findings underscore the importance of watershed characteristics as controls on current spatial patterns in streamflow and bfi and also the sensitivity of streamflow and bfi to climate and land use changes over time graphical abstract this study examines variation in runoff ro baseflow bf and the baseflow index bfi in perennial streams across the kansas usa precipitation gradient we identify current spatial trends for each and also whether they have changed over time we also consider how spatiotemporal variation relates to watershed characteristics land use and climate variables ga1 keywords streamflow components precipitation gradient groundwater climate change land use 1 introduction the two major components of streamflow are runoff and baseflow runoff is water that runs over the land surface during precipitation and snowmelt events whereas baseflow is water added to streams from the subsurface baseflow sustains flow between precipitation events and helps regulate surface water quality and quantity price 2011 the contribution of baseflow to streamflow is known to be sensitive to catchment and regional characteristics such as precipitation temperature topography geology and land use defined here to include land use cover and management following zipper et al 2018 price 2011 carlier et al 2018 however how baseflow varies on large spatial and temporal scales is not well known for many regions miller et al 2016 ficklin et al 2016 cuthbert et al 2019 changes to baseflow can significantly impact water supplies and thus are important to understand for effective management and protection of water resources in this study we consider variation in the contribution of baseflow to streams across the kansas regional precipitation gradient fig 1 the precipitation gradient across the state is one of the steepest in the us and may be changing in response to climate change mean annual precipitation is as low as 635 mm yr 25 in yr at the western margin of the state to as high as 1145 mm yr 45 in yr in the east previous research indicates that a warming climate increases atmospheric moisture and moisture demand over land held and soden 2006 ipcc 2021 these changes can directly alter the occurrence and patterns in subsurface storage and streamflow which can stress water resources and increase flooding and drought risks milly et al 2005 brikowski 2008 layzell and evans 2013 seager et al 2018 cuthbert et al 2019 precipitation data collected since the 1890 s indicates that total annual rainfall has generally increased across the state particularly during the second half of the 20th century rahmani et al 2015 however over that same time span average statewide warming of 0 06 c per decade appears to be increasing dryness in western kansas but not central and eastern kansas based on changes in the palmer drought severity index lin et al 2017 alongside variation in precipitation the contribution of baseflow to total streamflow may also vary across the study area in response to land use most of the study region is used for agriculture but urban land use is also present in agricultural landscapes irrigation pumping can decrease baseflow by lowering the water table earman and dettinger 2011 barlow and leake 2012 brikowski 2008 however it can also increase baseflow by adding irrigation return flow to streams blodgett et al 1992 either way impacts of irrigation on baseflow may typically be greater in more arid regions where rates of irrigation pumping are generally greater famiglietti et al 2011 voss et al 2013 in urban areas an increased abundance of impermeable surfaces increases runoff and thus decreases recharge and groundwater inputs to streams ku et al 1992 however leaky infrastructure in urban settings can increase groundwater recharge and subsequent discharge to streams lerner 2002 bhaskar et al 2015 moreover in both agricultural and urban settings changes in plant growth can impact the contribution of baseflow to streamflow by altering soil permeability and evapotranspiration et patterns zhang and schilling 2006 price 2011 teutschbein et al 2018 these examples illustrate that impacts of land use are variable in general however land use changes that increase infiltration and recharge tend to increase baseflow to streams whereas those that increase evapotranspiration tend to decrease baseflow price 2011 the interaction of changes in land use and climate can have complex feedbacks for water resources changes in climate can cause changes in land use which can in turn impact water resources and greenhouse gas budgets enough to drive further changes in climate at local and even regional scales foley et al 2005 brown and pervez 2014 zabel et al 2014 bajželj and richards 2014 although the coupled impacts of climate and land use have clear implications for water resources our ability to analyze those impacts is made difficult by such feedback loops as well as the scales at which each occurs climate groundwater response times can occur over thousands of years cuthbert et al 2019 whereas impacts of land use change can manifest within years or decades zhang et al 2016 further the coupled impacts of climate and land use can occur on different spatial scales with local land use effects superimposed on regional climate controls wang and hejazi 2011 martin et al 2017 wang and stephenson 2018 zipper et al 2018 regional scale studies may be critical to studying these relationships and their impact on baseflow ayers et al 2018 tan et al 2020 recently a study examining relationships across the entire us found that runoff and baseflow generally increase with precipitation yet the relationship between precipitation and the proportion of baseflow in streamflow was variable suggesting that regional factors were influential ficklin et al 2016 numerous physical catchment properties can impact streamflow components making it difficult to determine spatiotemporal patterns and relationships santhi et al 2008 price 2011 gnann et al 2019 previous studies have investigated various watershed characteristics including topography geology soil land use and climate on baseflow and its proportion in streamflow within the upper colorado river basin rumsey et al 2015 2020 miller et al 2016 however these studies are specific to the study area which differs considerably from kansas studies that have included kansas and the midwestern us brikowski 2008 ayers et al 2018 were focused on impacts of climate and land use and did not consider other factors known to drive baseflow generation and occurrence including soil and bedrock composition which can be among the most important controls richardson et al 2020 to help fill this knowledge gap this study uses the kansas regional precipitation gradient as a natural laboratory to examine how variation in precipitation rate land use and various watershed characteristics impact proportions of baseflow in streams results of our analysis are particularly relevant to the central great plains of the us along which the precipitation gradient occurs however the results may also shed light on potential future impacts of changes in the amount of precipitation in other regions for our analysis we used streamflow records and watershed data to understand spatiotemporal patterns in the partitioning of streamflow components and their variation in response to changes in precipitation land use and other watershed properties we first performed hydrograph separation calculations on stream discharge data from 28 watersheds across the precipitation gradient to analyze current spatial variation in streamflow components the calculations evaluated runoff ro baseflow bf and baseflow index bfi which is the proportion of baseflow in total streamflow we then used spearman s rank correlation tests to examine the relationship of these streamflow components to watershed characteristics across the precipitation gradient due to high covariance between some variables we conducted a principal component analysis pca to better understand relative significances of watershed and climate variables secondly in nine watersheds with longer data records we examined temporal trends 1960 2018 in hydrograph results climate and land use data using mann kendall and sen s slope analyses 2 materials methods 2 1 site selection and study area for our analysis we selected usgs gage sites across kansas that met requirements of hydrograph separation specifically the analysis requires watersheds with drainage areas less than 1300 km2 500 mi2 and streamflow contributions primarily from groundwater discharge and surface runoff barlow et al 2014 none of the sites are downstream from dams or discharges from wastewater treatment facilities hydrograph separation analysis is most accurate when averaged over longer time periods on the range of years barlow et al 2014 so we required streams to have a minimum of 14 years of continuous discharge data to maximize accuracy and number of sites included more details about this choice are provided in the next section below the resulting 28 sites span a steep precipitation gradient from eastern to west central kansas fig 1 annual precipitation varies from 635 mm yr 25 in yr at the most western site up to 1145 mm 45 in yr at the furthest east site giving a gradient of approximately 1 3 mm km 0 1 in mi in average annual precipitation reflecting this precipitation gradient soil moisture and vegetation change across the state with temperate deciduous forests and temperate tallgrass prairie in eastern kansas to semi arid grasslands in the west seager et al 2018 elevation also decreases eastward from 1231 to 207 m with a gradient of 2 6 m km 4038 679 ft 13 7 ft mi the sites include a range of sediments and sedimentary rocks deposited from the paleozoic to the cenozoic eras kgs 2008 from the western border extending into central kansas the predominant surficial rock and sediment type is unconsolidated silt and sand from loess and river valley deposits cretaceous shale sandstone and chalk deposits kgs 2008 in the eastern portion of the state the lithology is predominantly flat lying alternating limestone and mudstone of the permian and carboniferous systems stoeser et al 2005 similarly kansas aquifers shift from unconsolidated sand gravel and sandstone aquifers of the larger great plains and high plains aquifers out west to limestone aquifers of the flint hills and osage aquifers in the east with glacial drift aquifers in the northeast corner macfarlane et al 2000 alluvial aquifers are scattered across the state and tend to dominate in eastern areas that experience high streamflow macfarlane et al 2000 dominant surficial rock type and aquifer maps can be found in figs s1 and s2 of the supporting information 2 2 hydrograph separation we carried out the hydrograph separations using discharge data from each site with the usgs groundwater gw toolbox software barlow et al 2017 the software requires daily discharge data which we acquired from the united states geological survey usgs national water information system usgs 2016 for all 28 sites we collected daily streamflow data from 2004 to 2018 to calculate a 14 year average for runoff baseflow and bfi which we use as representative of current conditions as stated in section 2 1 graphical hydrograph separation analysis is more accurate when the hydrograph data span annual or longer time scales barlow et al 2014 considering that surface water and groundwater processes often occur over months to decades price 2011 jasechko 2019 we sought to extend our time scale beyond a decade to analyze current conditions our choice of 14 years allowed us to achieve that goal and also maximize the number of sites included in our analysis of current relationships across the precipitation gradient for nine sites with long data records we also carried out an analysis of changes in streamflow components over time for those sites we collected daily streamflow data from 1960 through 2018 to calculate annual and seasonal averages for runoff baseflow and bfi we averaged results from the cold and dry jan feb oct dec months and the warm and wet april sept months for the seasonal analysis we will refer to the two seasons as dry and wet seasons from this point forward gw toolbox contains six different hydrograph separation methods to partition the discharge records into baseflow and runoff components part bfi standard and modified and hysep fixed sliding interval and local minimum a detailed description for each method is available in the gw toolbox user manual barlow et al 2014 briefly the various separation analyses partition runoff from baseflow by determining the portions of the hydrograph that are not affected by runoff via various methods turning point factor recession index algorithms to connect low points and continuous recession none of these methods appear to be more appropriate than the others for application to our study region as such we carried out both the spatial and temporal analyses using the average of all six methods we ran our analyses using the original settings in usgs gw toolbox partition length n days 5 turning point test factor f 0 9 daily recession index k 0 97915 the watershed drainage area mi2 for each site is used to normalize the initial results of the hydrograph separation given in cubic feet per second cfs to flow rate per unit area cfs mi2 the software then converts values of streamflow components runoff and baseflow to units of inches the bfi results are presented as unitless values between 0 no baseflow component and 1 no runoff component we then converted units for runoff and baseflow cm for our analyses 2 3 watershed water usage and climate data we gathered various watershed data from open source online databases kansas land cover patterns percent forest urban agriculture and grassland were gathered from raster data from the 2005 kansas land cover patterns mapping initiative peterson et al 2009 percent grassland includes grassland and pasture and percent agriculture is defined as row crop agriculture geologic data was gathered from kgs and usgs stoeser et al 2005 falcone 2011 additional watershed data elevation potential evapotranspiration pet soil clay and sand content was gathered from usgs gages ii falcone 2011 annual climate mean precipitation and temperature data were gathered from prism climate data at 4 km resolution for all 28 sites from the past 30 years and monthly data from 1960 to 2018 were collected for the nine sites included in the temporal analysis prism 2020 we also gathered annual county wide land square km acres irrigated and groundwater usage cubic meter acre feet diverted data from kgs water information management and analysis system wimas for the web for nine sites used in the temporal analysis wilson et al 2005 land use average annual climate and additional watershed data used for the spatial analysis can be found in tables s1 and s2 of the si annual and monthly climate data and annual land use data used for the temporal analysis can be found in tables s10 s11 and s12 of the si 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were carried out using rstudio version 1 2 5033 rstudio team 2019 for all analyses we considered probability values p less than 0 05 to be significant we carried out nonparametric kruskal wallis tests to determine if the results from the six hydrograph separation methods were significantly different to identify specifically which method s were significantly different we conducted a pairwise wilcox test additionally we assessed if bfi values were significantly different based on the dominant aquifer underlying each site with a one way anova this approach is appropriate given that bfi values are normally distributed for all 28 sites we tested the strength of relationships between the hydrograph results and climate and watershed parameters using spearman s rho rank order correlation test we used a threshold for significance of correlation rho greater than the absolute value of 0 40 due to the high covariance between variables within the dataset we conducted a principal component analysis pca using the factominer package lê et al 2008 prior to or during the analysis data with high absolute values were transformed and standardized mean of zero and standard deviation of one the results were extracted and visualized using the factoextra package kassambara and mundt 2020 we used eigenvalue 1 as a cutoff for which principal components pc are considered in the results and discussion as that threshold indicates variance within the component is greater than that of a single variable kaiser 1961 we tested the strength and significance of temporal relationships using mann kendall and sen s slope analyses the mann kendall test determines the presence of trends in the time series data where positive and negative values indicate increasing and decreasing trends respectively sen s slope determines the magnitude or the slope of that trend the larger the number the greater the slope and thus the greater the change over time these analyses are common in studies that analyze climate and streamflow time series because they do not require the data to follow any specific distribution marques da silva et al 2015 ficklin et al 2016 the tests were used for annual trends in streamflow components ro bf bfi climate temperature and precipitation and groundwater usage and irrigated acreage and for seasonal trends in streamflow components and climate data 3 results 3 1 variability between hydrograph separation methods differences in runoff estimates were insignificant for all hydrograph separation methods fig 2 a average runoff across the gradient is 13 23 cm 4 80 in the difference in baseflow for local minimum modified and standard methods are insignificant from each other with an average value of 3 50 cm 1 29 in p 0 05 but are significantly different from hysep fixed and part which have an average of 4 97 cm 1 82 in p 0 05 one method hysep slide is insignificantly different from both groups and has an average of 5 03 cm 1 85 in similarly the difference in bfi for local minimum modified and standard methods are insignificantly different from each other with an average of 0 25 but again are significantly different from hysep fixed and part which has an average of 0 33 however for bfi hysep slide is significantly different from both groups and has an average of 0 34 standard deviations on the means calculated for each method are depicted by the error bars in fig 2b although there is some variability between methods the trend with longitude is consistent for each method moving forward we incorporate the differences in these estimates by using average values for runoff baseflow and bfi to compare the hydrograph separation results to climate and watershed data in both the spatial and temporal analyses detailed results of the hydrograph separation and the statistical test kruskal wallis and pairwise wilcox test results are located in tables s3 s6 of the si 3 2 spatial variation under current conditions average runoff and baseflow in streams increases eastward across the study area p 0 005 fig 2b the increase in runoff 0 81 26 6 cm is greater than that for baseflow 0 86 9 90 cm as a result the proportion of baseflow in total streamflow bfi generally decreased eastward from 0 6 to 0 26 p 0 01 these streamflow components vary significantly with some of the climate land use and soil parameters in our dataset fig 3 among climate variables streamflow components are more strongly related to precipitation than temperature or pet precipitation positively correlates with runoff and baseflow and negatively correlates with bfi while temperature and pet only have weak but significant relationships with runoff and bfi respectively precipitation co varies with elevation and longitude across the precipitation gradient thus it is not surprising that streamflow components are also significantly correlated with elevation and longitude among land use variables streamflow components do not have significant relationships with the proportion of grassland in the watershed which is the dominant land cover in most watersheds however runoff positively correlates with forest land cover and baseflow negatively correlates with agricultural land cover bfi is significantly correlated to urban land cover lastly the clay content of watershed soils is positively related to runoff and baseflow and sand is negatively related to runoff full results of the spearman s rank correlations can be found in figs s3 s8 and table s7 of the si the pca results show that approximately 86 of the total variance is explained by principal components pc 1 4 fig s9 table s17 which we focus on here and in the discussion below the pca weightings and contribution of variance for watershed climate and hydrograph variables are presented in table 1 for interpreting pca weightings similar values in magnitude demonstrate highly correlated variables with positive and negative values indicating positive and negative correlations respectively precipitation runoff longitude baseflow and clay are highly correlated with each other as seen by similar in magnitude and sign weightings on pc1 elevation is negatively correlated to the aforementioned variables shown by the equal but opposite negative weightings on pc1 temperature and sand are positively correlated for pc2 while negatively correlated with latitude for pc3 bfi and grassland are positively correlated to each other and both are negatively correlated to agriculture and pet grassland and urban land use are negatively correlated on pc4 the contribution of variables to the variance shows which variables best explain the variability within each pc fig 4 in general precipitation runoff longitude elevation baseflow and percent clay contribute similarly to the total variance of pc1 accounting for between 10 and 13 each as observed by clustering of variables along axis 1 fig 4 a latitude and temperature contribute roughly 30 to the total variance of pc2 followed by percent sand and forest cover 17 and 10 respectively pet accounts for 30 of variance captured in pc3 followed by bfi percent agriculture and grassland 19 17 10 respectively percent grassland and urban land cover each account for 38 of variance in pc4 the full results of the pca all biplots eigenvalues and variable contributions can be found in fig s9 and s10 and tables s13 and s17 of the si 3 3 variation over time the results of the temporal analysis show that bfi has increased significantly at four sites bow white rock salt and mill at washington from 1960 through 2018 fig 5 the change in bfi was small slope 0 01 for all sites even at sites with significant trends bfi increased at most sites except at the three easternmost sites mill at paxico soldier at topeka and stranger similarly baseflow increased at all sites except the three eastern sites however all trends were insignificant and small slope 0 04 cm year fig 5 runoff decreased at most sites with salt mill at paxico and soldier at topeka as exceptions similar to baseflow the trends in runoff were insignificant and small slope 0 02 cm year annual average precipitation increased at all sites with the trendline slopes ranging from 0 22 to 2 18 but the increase was significant only at the westernmost site bow temperature also increased slightly across all sites with the trendline slopes ranging from 0 002 to 0 02 mm year with significant increases occurring at two sites chapman and soldier at topeka groundwater use and irrigated acreage increased significantly at all sites fig 6 the slopes for land use parameters were large ranging from 32 003 bow to 292 918 soldier for groundwater use m3 year and 85 410 black vermillion to 1 281 821 soldier for irrigated area km2 year the results of the seasonal temporal analysis show that bfi significantly increased at five sites bow white rock salt and both mill at washington and paxico for the dry season and at two sites bow and white rock for the wet season fig 7 the slope of the trendlines were positive for both seasons at all sites except for the wet season at mill at paxico soldier at topeka and stranger changes in baseflow were insignificant at all sites for both seasons except bow in the dry season the slope of the trendlines were positive at all sites but mill both seasons and stranger dry season runoff significantly decreased at one site white rock in the dry season changes in runoff for the wet season were insignificant at all sites trendline slopes were negative at all sites for the dry season sites and three sites for the wet season bow white rock and chapman overall the trendline slopes were small less than 0 005 for bfi baseflow and runoff seasonal changes in precipitation were insignificant at all sites for both the wet and dry seasons temperature did not vary significantly during the wet season for all sites but increased significantly at two sites chapman and soldier for the dry season climate trends were generally positive except for variation in precipitation at two sites mill at paxico in wet season black vermillion in dry season and temperature at one site white rock in wet season full results of the annual and seasonal hydrograph results climate and land use data can be found in tables s8 s12 and results of the mann kendall and sen s slope analyses can be found in tables s14 15 of the si 4 discussion 4 1 influence of watershed characteristics on spatial patterns of streamflow and bfi the spatial analysis of hydrograph separation results reveals significant and surprising relationships with precipitation baseflow and runoff are significantly correlated with increasing precipitation fig 3 rho 0 76 and 0 95 respectively fig 4 a consistent with other studies that have found strong relationships between streamflow components and climate ficklin et al 2016 ayers et al 2018 rumsey et al 2020 we expected the average bfi in streamflow to also increase with precipitation however we observe that the calculated bfi values decrease significantly with increasing precipitation fig 3 rho 0 42 and negatively correlated with precipitation runoff and baseflow on pc1 fig 4 a we interpret the relationship between precipitation and bfi to reflect the influence of infiltration on the contribution of groundwater to streams during precipitation events some portion of the water infiltrates the surface percolates downward and ultimately recharges the underlying saturated zone thus the amount of precipitation influences the absolute amount of groundwater discharge to streams by affecting recharge rates price 2011 however when the rate of precipitation exceeds the infiltration capacity of a soil runoff is generated loague et al 2010 where infiltration capacity is exceeded further increases in precipitation will increase the proportion of precipitation that flows over the land surface as runoff we reason that the frequency with which this capacity is exceeded is likely higher in areas that receive more precipitation where that is the case the relative contribution of groundwater to streamflow would decrease with increasing precipitation consistent with our observations partitioning between runoff and recharge across the precipitation gradient also varies in response to differences in natural watershed permeability increasing soil clay content is associated with decreased permeability and limited infiltration and groundwater recharge which can ultimately impact groundwater discharge to streams hillel 1982 wolock et al 2004 rumsey et al 2015 this relationship likely contributes to the high and positive correlation of soil clay content with precipitation longitude runoff baseflow and the weak negative association between soil clay content and bfi fig 4 a similarly surficial sediment and underlying bedrock type may also influence spatial trends in streamflow components specifically bf and bfi the western streams in our study area tend to be located on coarse sand and gravel deposits sandstones and chalks that have relatively high hydraulic conductivity 102 103 3 1 and 30 m day respectively de marsily 1986 and are associated with high rates of infiltration recharge and discharge wolock 2004 santhi et al 2008 a shift in the relationships of precipitation with baseflow and bfi coincides with a change in bedrock composition fig 8 the flint hills region consists of alternating limestone and mudstone bedrock in an early stage of karstification macpherson et al 2008 which could support high infiltration rates that contribute to higher proportions of groundwater discharge indeed the anova results show that sites within the flint hills have significantly different bfi values compared to sites with streams flowing over strictly alluvial aquifers and overlying the dakota aquifer fig 8 table s16 alongside variation in soil and bedrock composition land use can also alter surface permeability and contribute to variation in streamflow components across the study area the correlation between bfi and urban land use fig 3 table 1 fig 4b potentially reflects the influence of impermeable surfaces in urban environments which can limit infiltration into the subsurface ku et al 1992 price 2011 as mentioned in the introduction also as mentioned previously changes to agricultural crop forest and grassland coverage have the potential to impact streamflow and surface properties by altering plant compositions in ways that affect water fluxes into the subsurface sullivan et al 2019 compared to areas used for crops grasslands can have lower evapotranspiration and higher infiltration rates which work to increase baseflow and groundwater discharge nie et al 2011 although agricultural crop land use impacts to streamflow can vary increased evapotranspiration as well as irrigation rates associated with crop areas have the potential to decrease groundwater discharge to streams wen and chen 2006 price 2011 such interactions between vegetation and water resources may explain the relationships we observed between land use bfi and pet on pc3 table 1 fig 4b the positive correlation between grassland and bfi coupled with negative correlation of bfi with agriculture and pet could indicate that such tradeoffs are occurring however finer scale data and analysis to unequivocally identify mechanisms these results illustrate the coupled nature of potential controls on streamflow components across broad regions our study area spans a steep precipitation gradient and as precipitation changes it affects land use land cover and other natural watershed properties for example the amount of urban and forested area in a watershed are positively correlated with precipitation while the amount of agriculture is negatively correlated with precipitation across the study area significant spearman rho p 0 005 fig 4 a these superimposed relationships suggest that the spatial patterns in streamflow components are driven by the precipitation gradient both directly and indirectly by influencing to patterns in land use and physical watershed properties across the study area together these findings add to the growing knowledge that the effects of local land use on hydrologic processes are often superimposed on larger climate trends wang and hejazi 2011 martin et al 2017 wang and stephenson 2018 zipper et al 2018 and is important to take into consideration for future management of water resources 4 2 impact of long term trends in climate and land use on bfi increases in average annual precipitation and temperature that we observe from 1960 are consistent with results rahmani et al 2015 and lin et al 2017 as mentioned in the introduction the general trends observed by those studies included an increase in annual precipitation and temperature across the state alongside these changes irrigated acreage and groundwater use also increased for all watersheds although these changes in climate and land use all trend in the same direction their influences on streamflow appear to be different for the three easternmost sites where bfi decreased compared to the five westernmost sites where bfi increased fig 5 we hypothesize that the differences between eastern and western sites reflect natural antecedent properties of each watershed as discussed in the paragraphs below watershed characteristics are not only important for determining hydrological processes under current climate but also their response to changing conditions teutschbein et al 2018 first differences in soil and bedrock composition and land use likely impact the streamflow response to increasing precipitation over time as they do across the precipitation gradient currently section 4 1 specifically soil and bedrock in the eastern watersheds generally has lower permeability than the western watersheds reflecting differences in soil clay content urbanization and bedrock units as precipitation and irrigation increases soils and bedrock that are more permeable would be better able to accommodate an increase in infiltration than those with lower permeability yu et al 2000 wang et al 2009 vaezi et al 2010 thus with increasing precipitation and irrigation a greater proportion of the water may have infiltrated the subsurface in the western watersheds but not the eastern watersheds causing their bfi values to increase and decrease over time respectively consistent with this interpretation more permeable lithologies such as sandstones have been found to provide a buffering effect that can sustain low flows during dry periods carlier et al 2018 their permeability is high enough to allow them to store large amounts of water during precipitation events but low enough to prevent a sharp decrease in storage after the event further combined effects of higher clay content and urban land cover can also result in increased rates of sedimentation and siltation within stream channels which intensifies the decoupling of surface groundwater resources and negatively impacts water quality jones et al 2015 michalek et al 2021 secondly the different response between the eastern and western watersheds may reflect the greater aridity of the western sites previous studies have also found that relatively arid catchments are more sensitive to impacts from climate and land use changes than humid catchments where water is more abundant farmer et al 2003 wang and hejazi 2011 third changes in seasonal patterns could also play a role in driving the trends over time we observe that most watersheds have experienced increases in bfi over time however increases in bfi were significant in five watersheds for the dry season jan mar and oct dec compared to only two watersheds in the wet season april sept fig 7 precipitation and temperature also generally increased although not significantly in the dry season while the wet season does not appear to demonstrate consistent trends such changes in precipitation seasonality could be affecting the proportions of recharge and runoff and thus values of bfi over time jones and banner 2003 zhang et al 2020 temperatures during the dry season are generally lower than those during the wet season if a greater proportion of the annual precipitation falls while temperatures are cooler lower evapotranspiration rates during that time may allow greater infiltration and recharge earman and dettinger 2011 significant changes in bfi seasonality primarily occurred in western watersheds which again support the notion that western watersheds appear to be more sensitive to changing conditions both annually and seasonally due to different watershed characteristics 4 3 limitations there are important limitations to our analyses that should be considered when interpreting the results of our study first hydrograph separation techniques are relatively simple widely used and useful metric for understanding relationships between groundwater discharge and watershed characteristics eckhardt 2008 tesoriero et al 2009 price 2011 ficklin et al 2016 but the results are estimates of streamflow components and bfi with true values often unknown eckhardt 2008 barlow et al 2014 the accuracy of the hydrograph separation method is dependent on local factors such as watershed topography channel geomorphology and geology price 2011 alternative approaches have been used to validate results of hydrograph separation e g chemical and isotopic tracers however such validations and data required for them are geographically limited eckhardt 2008 and these alternative methods have their own limitations by comparing the results of multiple hydrograph separation techniques we can help ensure accuracy barlow et al 2014 for our study we observed good agreement between methods fig 2b coupled with methodological uncertainty there are also uncertainties that arise from our data sources the groundwater usage and total irrigation acreage data are county wide rather than watershed specific and are self reported until 1980 wilson et al 2005 additionally the climate data are not field measured data but rather the data are extrapolated modeled from the prism climate group model although such climate data is frequently used in these types of analysis e g ficklin et al 2016 the data could miss intensity and frequency of climate data that is crucial in understanding patterns in groundwater discharge over time similarly we use average values for many watershed and streamflow properties which can result in lost information or over underestimation of trends gnann et al 2019 in reality interactions between numerous landscape variables are likely influencing streamflow generation and overall watershed hydrology to some extent at both spatial and temporal scales rumsey et al 2015 teutschbein et al 2018 this work is exploratory in nature the relationships we identified and our interpretation of them are based largely on statistical analysis future work is warranted that aims to assess finer scales of streamflow components in space and time determine causal and functional relationships between watershed variables streamflow components and bfi and to and make water quantity quality predictions regardless our results add to the growing knowledge on the importance of understanding the complex relationships between watershed variables climate and land use on regional water quantity and quality price 2011 zipper at al 2018 teutschbein et al 2018 5 concluding remarks this study examined spatial and temporal variation in streamflow components across the kansas precipitation gradient to better understand how climate and land use variation impacts the contribution of baseflow to streamflow the spatial analysis demonstrates that under current conditions both runoff and baseflow increase significantly in the direction of increasing precipitation however bfi decreases significantly with increasing precipitation because the increase in runoff with precipitation is greater than the increase in baseflow we interpret this result to reflect the limits of infiltration on the proportion of precipitation that recharges the subsurface and can ultimately discharge into a stream as precipitation increases a greater proportion of water may be diverted over the land surface rather than through the subsurface in addition variation in the permeability of watershed soil and bedrock in response to natural lithologic variation and land use also appears to contribute variation in bfi across the study area spatial patterns in many watershed properties e g land use soil clay content are driven by precipitation therefore our results highlight the long term importance of climate on landscape composition and water resources our temporal analysis indicates that bfi significantly increased during 1960 2018 at sites in the western half of our study area precipitation temperature irrigated acreage and groundwater pumping all increased over the same time interval and thus may have contributed to the observed increase in bfi however we hypothesize that the western watersheds were more sensitive to these changes than the eastern watersheds because the western watersheds have more permeable soils and bedrock and lower rates of annual precipitation these characteristics not only influence streamflow under current climate but also its response to changing conditions teutschbein et al 2018 these findings have important implications for water quantity and quality across the kansas precipitation gradient and beyond first the same properties that make the western watersheds more sensitive to variation in climate and land use likely make them more susceptible to groundwater contamination watersheds with high permeability soil and bedrock are considered high risk for groundwater contamination usgs 1999 second an increase in bfi coupled with widespread agricultural development may be causing an increase in the export of nutrients from groundwater to surface water over time if so this change would alter surface water composition and may promote algal growth johnson and stets 2020 brookfield et al 2021 third our work provides a strong foundation for understanding streamflow drivers and how they vary spatially and temporally past 60 years in our study region but also in other moderate to low relief regions where changes in precipitation rates will occur therefore the results of this study are important to consider for future water management across

7959,study region johor river basin jrb malaysia study focus the study generates long time series land use and land cover lulc change at 5 years interval using google earth engine and investigate the lulc changes and river morphology changes of jrb intensity analysis on the lulc changes was conducted to highlight the transition between lulc targeted transition from natural to disturbed lands were detected which impact the river morphology of the basin river morphology changes were identified along johor river based on the centerline migration derived from channel migration toolbox new hydrological insights for the region jrb has undergone high intensity lulc change over the past decades due to significant economic and population growth which impacted the river morphology channel migration analysis reported high river centerline migration 498609 m2 to 1853886 m2 of johor river higher migration rate was identified at the estuary of the johor river and several locations along the river specific locations with high channel migration were highlighted where human induced changes are the factors to affect the morphology of the river the proposed method is first applied in the region and the results enhance local and regional policies and decision making on food and water security prevent extreme events such as floods and further degradation of natural land keywords land use land cover lulc change google earth engine gee johor river basin river morphology channel migration 1 introduction over the past decades one third of the global land use has been changed either once or on multiple occasions winkler et al 2021 the dynamicity of land use and land cover lulc change has triggered issues related to environmental ecosystem water food security climate change etc song et al 2018 winkler et al 2021 the lulc science includes characterization of land cover and land use and quantification of their changes and their consequences drivers of these changes are either natural such as climate variability and change or anthropogenic such as socio economic or political roy and roy 2010 any human induced landscape modification driven by economy or politics has impacts on major components in the earth system such as carbon cycle surface hydrology and atmospheric processes zhao et al 2006 these changes also affect social systems and impact food security energy production and water resources wolde et al 2021 water is the foundation to sustain life guppy and anderson 2017 half of the world s population reside at the vicinity of river 3 km to obtain their main source of water freshwater supply kummu et al 2011 and daily essentials such as economic activities transportation and natural resources exploration fang et al 2018 however water scarcity and security issues have emerged at national and global scales due to rapid population growth by 2050 more than 40 of the world s population will get their daily water supply from water stressed river basins oecd 2001 this increase of supply and demand of water and resources relative to the global population growth has led to significant lulc change especially at the vicinity of rivers which can severely impact the river physical characteristics and ecology chin 2006 zhao et al 2006 how lulc changes impact a river basin from various perspectives have been studied chin 2006 including runoff and water availability wang et al 2017 discharge petchprayoon et al 2010 water yield geng et al 2015 headwater fluvial harden 2006 morphology and structure kudnar 2020 yousefi et al 2019 and dam construction wwf 2004 river morphology refers to the shape of river channels and identifying their changes in terms of the area zone and direction channel migration over time can help communities residing near the river bank to guide development away from channel migration zones and reduce flood hazards recent studies by kong et al 2020 and ibitoye 2021 proved that the natural and anthropogenic activities are the main cause of river morphology changes the johor river basin jrb located in the southern state of peninsular malaysia has an important role to supply water for local usage and to support part of the water demand of singapore chuah et al 2018 it is in a humid tropical region with monsoon seasons and is occasionally influenced by el nino events and severely impacted by floods for the past decades kia et al 2012 saudi et al 2015 droughts floods dams and barrage construction and land reclamation within or surrounding the basin can severely affect the naturality of the basin thus it has become a popular area for research particularly relating to hydro climatology studies including floods ismail et al 2015 streamflow tan et al 2015 runoff dorofki et al 2012 drought tan et al 2019a 2019b and soil erosion obaid and shahid 2017 which are impacted by the lulc changes over the years under the rapid development of the area wang et al 2019 identified several land sprawl construction and land reclamation areas over the southern part of the jrb particularly at tekong island singapore to accommodate the economic development and inhabitants surrounding the river basin this indicates that the jrb and its surrounding area are rapidly changing which could have a direct impact on the hydrology and ecology of the river basin in addition anthropogenic activities including construction of dams and barrage along the jrb have affected the natural stability of the river basin although these activities were to ensure water security and prevent floods in the area lin 2011 studies investigating the impact of lulc changes on river morphology are limited and only a few researchers have been conducted to date in portugal fernandes et al 2020 india himayoun and roshni 2020 iran yousefi et al 2019 2016 nigeria ibitoye 2021 despite being a popular study site due to its importance to the region a long term analysis on lulc changes within the jrb and the impacts on the river morphology is yet to be conducted awang ali et al 2017 lulc classification and change detection over the tropical region is always a painstaking task due to the lack of multi temporal cloudless satellite data and insufficient ground sampling to date most of the lulc classification or change detection studies conducted in tropical region are based on satellite images contains with some clouds and cloud shadows deilmai et al 2014 kanniah et al 2021 2016 2015 tan et al 2010 intensity analysis of lulc has been successfully applied globally to improve the understanding of the transition between various land use classes ekumah et al 2020 estoque and murayama 2015 gandharum et al 2022 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 this advanced analytical technique is also useful on detecting errors on historical classification maps which ground truth samples are usually unavailable enaruvbe and pontius 2015 sun et al 2021 tankpa et al 2020 and added advantage to explain the lulc results in a more detailed manner moreover although lulc classification is a popular research in malaysia no previous studies applied intensity analysis to describe lulc changes in malaysia this study utilized the google earth engine gee a cloud based platform featuring big data processing using a collection of publicly available remote sensing imagery and products gorelick et al 2017 for lulc classification although the gee has gained much publicity a review by amani et al 2020 summarized machine learning and land cover as being a popular research area based on gee only a few studies have been conducted in malaysia over the years shaharum et al 2020 compared svm rf and classification and regression tree cart classifiers to classify oil palm in malaysia on 2016 2017 using landsat 8 data wahap and shafri 2020 also compared these three classifiers over klang valley area for year 1998 2003 and 2018 ju et al 2021 combines landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images with a number of indices to perform land classification of jrb but only focused on year 2019 to our knowledge there are limited studies conducted on jrb to identify the impacts of lulc changes to the dynamics of river morphology over a long period the impacts of lulc changes within the river basin can support future planning management and sustainable development of the jrb and its surrounding areas it will also assist further studies involving ecosystem conservation and services sustainable land use planning natural disaster floods prevention and water security this study aims to analyze the impacts of lulc changes within the jrb to the johor river morphology over the past 30 years based on remote sensing and geographic information science gis techniques more specifically two machine learning algorithms were compared to delineate different land use and land cover classes the intensity of the lulc changes was then analysed at 5 years intervals between 1990 and 2020 river features classified from the satellite images were processed to generate river centerlines and migration polygons a detailed analysis on river morphology was performed on locations that underwent significant changes over time the results from this study will support the local understanding on the lulc changes and the impact to the river morphology of the jrb it will provide useful data to inform local and national policies and development plans that will contribute to the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs for sustainable development and climate change i e sdg 11 and sdg 13 2 study area over the past three decades malaysia s population grew from 18 4 million to 32 7 million mean annual growth of 2 0 the state of johor is strategically located between the straits of melaka at its west south china sea at its east and singapore at its south and has become one of the focused regions for urbanization and economic development in malaysia as the development offers opportunities johor recorded a higher population growth rate of 2 6 2 1 million to 3 7 million than the national rate over the same period department of statistics malaysia https www dosm gov my accessed on 7th july 2021 the johor river basin 1 426 2 080 n and 103 330 e to 104 075 e is located in the state of johor at the southern part of peninsular malaysia the ecosystem services of the jrb particularly on water supply makes it one of the most highlighted basins in the area the jrb supplies water to the southern johor zone where the capital city of johor bahru is located and to singapore the jrb is distributed over 4 districts in johor namely kluang johor bahru kota tinggi and mersing where the johor river is the main river with a total length of 122 km originating from mount belumut 1010 m at the northern part of the basin its major tributaries include the linggui sayong tiram and seluyut rivers fig 1 b the whole of the jrb considered in this study covers an area of about 238600 ha part of it is within the iskandar malaysia zone which has been the focus development area of malaysia since 2006 land transformation due to urbanization dam constructions and agricultural activities have been some of the major lulc changes in the jrb over the decades to cope with the increased population water demand and to support economical income from industrial and agricultural sectors fig 1 a and b show the location of the jrb in the johor state of peninsular malaysia 3 data and methodology the methodology of this study is divided into two parts the first part involves digital image classification of cloudless landsat image composites that were generated using gee based on two machine learning classifiers the accuracy assessment and change detection analysis and the lulc change intensity analysis the second part involves the analysis on the river morphology changes using the channel migration toolbox cmt over the study period in jhb fig 2 shows the general workflow of the study and the following subsections describes the procedures in detail 3 1 google earth engine the google earth engine gee is a user friendly open source web based cloud computing platform featuring big geodata access processing interpretation and analysis amani et al 2020 since the introduction of the gee in 2010 multiple satellites data collection is made available including from the landsat mission which is the most widely used dataset kumar and mutanga 2018 with a collection covering around 40 years since the 1970 s tamiminia et al 2020 recent studies utilized gee to generate landsat time series lulc changes analysis and comparing different classification techniques over variety of study sites benefiting from the vast data availability and fast computing capability of gee brovelli et al 2020 nyland et al 2018 richards and belcher 2020 shaharum et al 2020 xie et al 2019 these studies suggest that gee could accelerate and improve the long time series lulc classification over selected area or regions the gee was applied in this study to produce landsat image composites at 5 years gap and to perform machine learning classification and confusion matrix analysis operating on a cloud based platform the computing power of the gee facilitates data collection classification and analysis processes at a very fast speed the following sections describe the detailed methodology used in the gee to achieve accurate lulc classification maps for the jrb 3 1 1 cloudless landsat image composite landsat is one of the satellite datasets in the gee image collections although the first landsat satellite was launched in 1972 a complete coverage of the landsat image composite over the study area is only available from 1990 therefore landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 operation land imager oli were used to generate the image composites at 5 years interval for classification purposes the landsat collection of tier 1 surface reflectance t1 sr which underwent atmospheric correction including cloud shadow water and snow mask processes was selected in this study both landsat 6 failed to enter the orbit and landsat 7 scan line corrector failure were left out from the selection table 1 summarizes the characteristics of landsat 5 and landsat 8 sensors cloud cover is always an issue for optical remote sensing images acquired over the equatorial region to overcome this issue a cloud masking function was applied during the image composition process the bitmask for pixel qa pixel quality attributes bands were considered to mask the clouds and cloud shadow on each landsat image within each period of interest table 2 lists the detail of the periods and number of scenes used to generate each image composite the default period to generate the image composite is one year while for several cases there are still some masked pixels found on the image composite thus a longer timeframe was set to overcome this issue for example a timeframe of 2 years 01 01 2004 31 12 2005 was set to generate the image composite for year 2005 based on local knowledge we assume that there are no massive land use and land cover change occurred during the 2 years interval within the 5 years window considered in this study this assumption is supported by 1 the transition from forest to agriculture or urban requires land clearance which normally takes years to complete 2 the built up of residential and commercial buildings from bare soil requires at least 3 years to complete 3 the clearance and replanting of crops in the study area can be completed within 2 3 years period therefore we believe that 5 years interval set in this study could be appropriate and representable to the actual land use land cover changes once the landsat images were listed from each timeframe the median of each pixel in the jrb was computed to create the cloudless landsat scenes within each timeframe median reduction method is used in this study because it is a promising technique in gee to process image composite which can provide equal or improved classification accuracy when compared to other reduction method mean minimum maximum percentile etc single image and timeseries images feizizadeh et al 2021 nyland et al 2018 phan et al 2020 richards and belcher 2020 xie et al 2019 li et al 2019 and luo et al 2022 proved that the median image composite method based on multi year images could minimize the impact of extreme outliers caused by the seasonal and weather effects resulting a robust image composite for mapping therefore the cloudless landsat image composites generated based on the above procedures are assumed to have stable spectral characteristics and minimal seasonal effects where the changes of water level and river wetted cross sections will not significantly impact the classification extraction of river polygons and its centerlines as well as the river morphology analysis fig s1 shows the true color cloudless landsat image composite of each time interval 3 1 2 machine learning classification machine learning classification is one of the most applied functions in gee which includes both supervised and unsupervised algorithms amani et al 2020 this study utilized support vector machine svm and random forest rf classifiers available on gee platform gorelick et al 2017 based on two recent reviews by tamiminia et al 2020 and sheykhmousa et al 2020 both svm and rf can provide comparable high accuracy while both support vector machine svm and random forest rf are the most selected machine learning classifier over the recent years sheykhmousa et al 2020 conclusion on which classifier performs better in lulc classification is not clear thus this study compared the two classifiers and analysed their capability in terms of classification accuracy and visual appearance 3 1 2 1 support vector machine classifier a svm classifier based on the supervised non parametric statistical learning technique separates the data into classes by optimization of separation hyperplanes svm was first introduced in the late 1970 s and the strength of svm is its ability to solve the local extremum dilemma present in the machine learning techniques by obtaining a global optimal solution by solving the convex quadratic optimization problem the optimization is generally defined by applying soft margin or kernel functions polynomial radial basis gaussian radial basis sigmoid to solve inseparability issues caused by mixing effects which is common in remote sensing image classification in addition svm requires only small training sets to produce higher accuracy than a traditional classifier however it has shortcomings when dealing with noisy data mountrakis et al 2011 tamiminia et al 2020 3 1 2 2 random forest classifier random forest rf is the most popularly applied machine learning classifier belgiu and drăguţ 2016 and the most frequently used classifier on the gee platform tamiminia et al 2020 rf which is based on the decision tree method with an ensemble learning approach utilizes boosting and bagging procedures to solve the classification of satellite image pixels the boosting technique integrates multiple models to solve the same problem hence increasing the classification accuracy the accuracy of rf classification relies on two parameters namely the number of trees ntree and number of features mtry the classification accuracy of rf is more sensitive to mtry than ntree where a smaller mtry would shorten the processing time but provides lower accuracy it is common to set ntree as large as possible as this will not affect the efficiency and cause over fitting during the classification process belgiu and drăguţ 2016 3 2 lulc class descriptions this study classifies a total of six lulc classes lulc classes based on the local landuse map provided by the national land use information division department of town and country planning malaysia was referred and simplified water class in this study includes rivers ponds and dams in the study area forest class refers to the inland forest while mangrove class refers to wetland forest located by the river or shorelines agricultural class includes oil palm plantation rubber plantation and other agricultural lands the commercial industrial residential infrastructure and utilities and transportation road networks are classified as urban bare soil includes empty lands and cleared lands where the soil surface can be detected from the images 3 3 sampling points lack of field based data collection is always an issue when conducting a long term lulc analysis in this study on screen selection of sample points from high resolution google earth images were conducted to provide the training and validation points this method is theoretically proven and practiced in kanniah 2017 lin et al 2018 during the selection of the sample points the time slider function of google earth was used to ensure the data used to select the sample points were within the specific period of interest according to table 2 for all the periods 300 points were randomly identified and the portion of the points for each land use class were roughly distributed based on the area of each class for example 1 agriculture is the major land use in the jrb thus the majority sample points selected are for agriculture almost half of the total sample points and 2 the sample points for water on year 1990 is 50 while we increased the number of points to 60 after year 1995 since there were more water bodies found in the study area in order to reduce the impact of the location of the sample points to the classification results we tried to maintain most of the sample points at the same location throughout the 30 years study period unless land use change was identified visually during the sample point selection the selected sample points were imported to gee script to run the classification during the classification process the sample points were randomly divided into 2 categories namely training sample 70 and validation samples 30 3 4 post classification and accuracy assessment a minimum mapping unit mmu was applied at post classification to improve the quality of the classified maps a window size of 3 3 was used on each classified map to generalize spurious pixels according to the neighboring pixels this process can remove noise and salt pepper effects from the output maps the gee platform also supports classification analysis including the confusion matrix which is also used to compute the overall accuracy oa producer accuracy pa consumer accuracy ca and kappa coefficient kc oa is the ratio between the sum of the major diagonal to the total number of sample points pa and ca are two accuracy parameters to show the agreement between the sample points to a specific class from the perspective of the producer or the consumer respectively pa is computed by dividing the major diagonal value of the class samples that are correctly classified to the sum of the samples for that class ca is computed by dividing the major diagonal value by the total number of sample classified mapped as that class finally the kc was computed for each classification map to test whether the result is significantly better than a random classification a kc above 0 also refers to significant agreement between the classification map with the reference sample points congalton and green 2019 thus the oa pa ca and kc were reported in this study for both the svm and rf classification map of every selected period 3 5 lulc changes analysis located within the rapidly developing state of malaysia jrb has been subject to intense analysis on the lulc changes to show how and what are the major land uses that have changed over the study period besides comparison on the total area and percentage of each lulc class change detection analysis is normally conducted to detect the area changes from one class to another a matrix with computed pixel counts or area of the changes was produced from the change detection of two periods and maps were generated to visually identify the area of significant changes in order to understand the lulc changes in more detail an advance analysis method such as intensity analysis was introduced by aldwaik and pontius 2012 and tested on several sites including plum island in boston zhenlai county in china yang et al 2017 and two developing cities in southeast asia bangkok and manila estoque and murayama 2015 intensity analysis of lulc changes can be performed based on the data derived from the change detection matrix intensity analysis can be divided into three levels which are interval intensity category intensity and transition intensity the interval intensity compares the uniform intensity calculated as the rate of change of the whole study period to the rate of change of each time interval the annual rate of changes also can be computed by dividing the interval rates to the number of years of each period by comparing the annual intensity rate to the uniform intensity rate the lulc change of a specific area can be identified as slow or fast paced over a specific period the category intensity computes the annual change intensity of each category based on the gross gains and gross losses then the intensity is compared to the uniform intensity this comparison examines which category actively changes or stays dormant over the period the transition intensity explaining the gains or losses of a particular category are targeted from or avoided from which category it can highlight how intensely a category changed from or to another category the equations involved in computing the interval category and transition intensities can be referred to in aldwaik and pontius 2012 hypothetical errors of each time interval were calculated to explain the deviation of each classification map from the uniform transitions as shown in enaruvbe and pontius 2015 with consideration of classification errors may influence the accuracy of the intensity analysis 3 6 river morphology changes to investigate the morphological changes channel migration of the johor river the raster classification maps of the jrb were vectorized and the polygons of water bodies rivers dams ponds etc were extracted at a 30 meter spatial resolution of landsat composite images some parts of the river and tributes with width less than the landsat spatial resolution are not clearly identified due to the mixing pixel effects commonly occurring in remote sensing data therefore we limited the river morphology analysis to the main river johor river in the jrb fig 1 b fig 3 describes the steps applied to derive river centerlines and use the centerlines to compute river migration area and distance firstly the area of the johor river was computed based on the polygons and compared among the different years to understand the areal changes of the river over time secondly the centerlines of the river were generated from the river polygons fig 3 a b using the create thiessen polygon function in arcgis version 10 5 lewandowicz and flisek 2020 centerlines are commonly used to investigate the morphological changes of a river ibitoye 2021 kong et al 2020 during this process the centerlines were generated based on the boundary of the polygons so the centerlines can represent the changes of the shape and direction morphology of the river the length of the centerlines was then compared among the years to define the changes of the total length of johor river over the period the channel migration toolbox cmt legg et al 2014 developed by the department of ecology state of washington usa integrated in arcgis 10 5 was used to analyse the morphological changes the main purpose of cmt is to measure river migration rates along the entire river and within the river reaches sections of the river transects were drawn within the reaches to directly measure river migration at specific locations fig 3 c d legg et al 2014 three tools were used in the cmt to derive the migration area zone and distance of the river namely 1 reach average channel migration tool 2 transect generation tool and 3 transect channel migration tool by importing the river centerlines into the cmt the first tool overlays the centerlines to create polygons that represent the migration area zone during each specific period in order to analyse the river changes in a more detailed manner 13 reaches at different lengths were set along the river r 1 to r 13 table 3 the function of these reaches is to separate the entire river into sections so the migration rate of each reach can be clearly defined and analysed the second tool generates the transects within each reach at a user specified gap the distance between transects is relative to the width of the river where greater transect gap is recommended for wider river legg et al 2014 thus different number of transacts were generated for each reach considering the relative width of the river table 3 summarizes the gap set for the transects and the number of transects within each reach the third tool applied in this study overlays the transects on to the migration area polygons defined from tool 1 the lateral movements of centerlines across multiple periods can be measured using this tool and the distance of the migration at each transects are exported based on the transects migration distance table analysis such as the migration distance of specific transects mean migration distance within each reach and total migration distance of the entire river can be computed analysis of the impact of lulc changes on river morphology changes was performed by comparing the lulc change intensity with the total migration area and total migration distance computed from cmt furthermore specific locations with significant river migration were highlighted and the reasons for the river morphology change were discussed 4 results and analysis 4 1 classification maps and accuracy assessment classification procedures based on gee minimize the time and steps required to complete the classification of the jrb over three decades with 5 years interval classification maps for years 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 were produced based on the cloudless landsat image composites described in section 3 1 1 table 4 lists the pa ca oa and kc for each year and their respective classes statistically the rf classifier has higher oa and kc when compared to the svm classifier both svm and rf classifiers showed very high accuracy above 0 90 and rf recorded perfect classification accuracy on several occasions oa 1 00 according to breiman 2001 it is possible for rf classifier to produce oa of 1 0 due to several reasons when 1 the rf has built a full grown tree and 2 rf is based on the bootstrapped training sets that the out of bag method decreases the error rate in addition of the high accuracy of svm and rf the spatial distribution of the classification maps generated from svm fig 4 and rf fig s2 are also similar however from detail visual interpretation on the output maps we found that the svm classifier performed better on identifying narrow river when compared to the results from the rf classification the rivers identified using the svm classifier were found to be mis classified as their surrounding land use classes in the rf classifier fig 5 shows a zoomed location comparing this issue from fig 5 we can notice that the sayong river located at the western side of the johor river basin was correctly classified using the svm classifier but some parts of the sayong river were classified as agricultural area when the rf classifier was applied based on this finding we conclude that despite the rf classifier produced a higher classification accuracy it can only produce more generalized classification maps the svm classifier on the other hand is found to capture more details especially over narrower features such as rivers in the jrb region this finding is corresponded to zagajewski et al 2021 who found that svm has superiority on classifying heterogeneous area capture more features and detecting edge pixels heydari and mountrakis 2018 while rf tends to be more generalized on agricultural area dabija et al 2021 the potential of the rf classifier to delineate narrow features needs to be explored further therefore in the following section the results produced from the svm classification are described and discussed fig 4 shows the majority of the lulc of the jrb is for agricultural usage with agricultural land covering more than 60 150000 ha of the basin in all the years analyzed in this study this is followed by forest land that covers about 20 of the basin most of the forests are found at the northeastern part of the basin and other forest patches are located at the middle and the eastern part of the basin urban development is found to be expanding at the southern part of the basin while mangroves are located along the johor river and its estuary this type of lulc distribution is common in the sea region where the majority of forest lands were cleared for agricultural crops and urbanization surrounding the river kummu et al 2011 being the main water source for daily supply and industrial usage the construction of dams became a common practice in sea as well as at global scale primarily at the area of rapid population growth sabater et al 2018 such as in the jrb 4 2 lulc change analysis based on the classification maps as shown in fig 4 the area of each class was computed as in table 5 and plotted in fig 6 over the period of the 30 years examined a significant loss of land cover especially forest was identified and the most rapid reduction of forest was found between 1990 and 1995 with a total reduction of 20992 6 ha in the same period agricultural land expanded 15573 2 ha and most of these expansions were at the expense of forest destruction this transition of forest to agricultural land especially oil palm has a long history to support national income from commodity manufacturing and trading aznam yusof and bhattasali 2008 losses of mangrove areas were also detected during the study period although mangrove covers only less than 2 0 of the whole jrb region nearly 30 of mangrove losses were identified from 1990 to 2020 since most mangrove lands were located at the downstream of the jrb the major loss of mangrove areas was found to be associated with the development of the pasir gudang port and conversion to agricultural activities note that the lowest mangrove area recorded was in 2010 with 2822 2 ha then a regrowth of mangrove was noticed in years 2015 and 2020 increasing the total mangrove land to 3081 6 ha by 2020 the regrowth of mangrove within the past 10 years can be accredited to an increasing public awareness due to the policy of the iskandar malaysia regional development authority on mangrove conservation and restoration kanniah et al 2021 water is an essential resource that supports the daily life of the people living in the johor state and singapore chuah et al 2018 heng et al 2017 from 1990 to 1995 the construction of the linggui dam a reservoir with maximum capacity of 760 million cubic meters served as the main water supply source for the area at the northern side of the jrb the dam construction increased the coverage of water area in jrb from 8662 5 ha to 13619 9 ha with a net increase of 4957 4 ha 57 3 the linggui dam project also contributed partly to the loss of forest area within this period another increase in water bodies is found in 2020 where the construction of another dam seluyut dam increased areas covered by water to 15690 40 ha 6 6 which is the highest of the 30 years period besides dams sand mining and man made ponding along the river for economic and agricultural usage was also found to be the reason for the widening of johor river which consequently increased the water area and changed the river morphology the expansion of urban areas i e the penggerang industrial area at the southern east of the johor coast not in the jrb meant that more water was demanded for industrial usage and to support the daily water needs of the population that had moved into the area the urban expansion of the jrb rose from 4603 5 ha in 1990 to 10541 7 ha in 2020 which was more than a two fold gain over three decades the most rapid gain of urban area was between 2005 and 2010 which corresponds to the highest loss of bare soil area from 2005 to 2010 a change detection analysis was conducted to show generally how each lulc class changed during the 30 years period based on fig 6 and table 6 water urban and agricultural gained 6484 48 ha 6337 53 ha and 10699 29 ha respectively while forest mangrove and bare soil lost 21919 32 ha 1374 03 ha and 229 95 ha respectively a total of 24 28 of increment of water surface was recorded while the highest gain was from the urban class 68 55 from 4203 81 ha rising to 10541 34 ha agricultural land gained 10692 99 ha 11 01 over the same period the loss of natural ecosystems forest and mangrove was 45 82 and 42 79 respectively over the 30 years period the most significant lulc change was the transition from forest to agricultural land where 22191 57 ha 9 3 of the total land in jrb of forest land was cleared and used for agricultural activity bare soil is among the smallest lulc class but shows the highest percentage of change 94 17 due to the rapid land clearing and urban built up activities over the study period a more detailed analysis of change detection at 5 years intervals can be found in the change detection matrix in the supplementary document table s1 s6 4 3 lulc change intensity analysis the change detection matrix at 5 years intervals table s1 s6 can be used to provide information about the lulc intensity analysis note that we used the number of pixels but not the converted area ha as the main unit for intensity analysis to prevent any degradation of accuracy in the analysis during the process of pixel to area conversion fig 7 shows the interval intensity analysis for the jrb the left side of the plot describes the total percentage of changed area within each interval the highest interval change is noticed in the period between 2011 and 2015 while the period between 2016 and 2020 recorded the lowest change intensity among other periods the right side of the plot describes how fast the area changed annually similarly the fastest and slowest annual change was for periods between 2011 and 2015 and 2016 2020 respectively uniform intensity ui presenting the change intensity of the whole period 30 years was calculated and compared to the annual change area rate the uniform intensity in this study is 3 48 where only the two intervals 1990 1995 4 23 and 2011 2015 4 37 recorded a relatively faster rate more intense lulc changes then normal of change among the six periods three intervals 1996 2000 2001 2005 and 2016 2020 were found to have a slower annual change intensity than the ui during the interval between 2006 and 2010 the annual change rate was found to be almost similar to the ui all the bars on the right side of the plot indicate the rate of change of the jrb was not stationary throughout the study period we further analysed the category intensity change for each lulc class over the 6 intervals during the 30 years period fig 8 the bars on the left side of the plots indicate the annual change area number of pixels of each class including their gross gain and gross loss during each interval the bars on the right side of the plot indicate the annual change intensity of each class if the bar is longer than the uniform intensity line the changes of the respective class is active during the period if the bar is shorter than the uniform intensity line then the changes of the respective class is dormant during the period it can be noticed that forest and agricultural area recorded the most gain and or loss in each interval mainly because they have the largest coverage over the jrb and are rapidly changing however agricultural area and forest do not show the highest annual change intensity when compared to urban and bare soil the bars on the right hand side of the plots indicate the annual change intensity of each class which can explain that the lulc changes are simply due to the large size of the categoies or can be related to the intensity of changes of the category if the bar of the gain or loss is longer than the uniform intensity red dotted line the change of the lulc category is relatively active it is obvious that urban forest and bare soil have higher annual intensity and active changes gain and loss within each interval where depletion of forest land clearing and urban development are all significant factors of a rapidly developing region the bar of gain of urban and bare soil extends over the uniform line for all the intervals indicating the urban and bare soil gains are more intensive active than the other lulc similarly the bar of forest loss is always longer than the uniform line indicating active forest loss in the jrb throughout the 30 years period in all the plots the annual change intensity of the agricultural land during each time interval is found to be dormant annual changes less than the uniform intensity despite the agricultural area annual change being the highest in most of the intervals this indicates that although agricultural land has the highest annual gain and or loss the change of agricultural land was relatively consistent and dormant during the six intervals an active gain of water was found within the 1990 1995 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 periods over the study period two dams were built which is the main reason for the active gain of water bodies between 1990 and 1995 linggui dam and 2016 and 2020 seluyut dam on the other hand an active loss of water was identified between 2011 and 2015 particularly due to drought conditions resulting from an el nino event in 2015 low and loganathan 2019 at the transition level we focus our analysis on the natural lulc forest and the irreversible lulc urban to show areas where there were forest losses and where urban areas were gained from and whether these transitions were systematically targeted avoided from the specific class fig 9 demonstrates the annual transition rate and intensity from forest to other lulc for each period higher transition intensity from forest to water was identified during the 1990 1995 and 2016 2020 intervals particularly due to the occupancy of forest lands for dam construction this can be explained by forest being targeted for transition to water at the other intervals the intensity of forest transition to agricultural bare soil and mangrove was higher targeted transition clearance of forest to bare soil was noticed as four out of six intervals have higher annual transition intensity of bare soil than the uniform intensity as the urban expansion in jrb area is found doubled during the study period we hypothesized that the clearance of forest could be targeted to urban development however the forest clearance does not fully contribute to the urban transition as the annual transition intensity of urban is always below avoided transition the uniform intensity this may be because part of the clearance of forest became agricultural land instead of urban land this argument can be supported by the plots shown in fig 10 as 1 the annual gain intensity of urban from forest is always below the uniform intensity of all intervals showing systematic avoidance of transition over the period proving that forest is not the main lulc that is targeted for urban transformation and 2 bare soil has the highest annual transition intensity which is always higher than the uniform intensity value of all intervals showing that urban gains targeted bare soil more intensively compared to forest and other categories this condition also can be explained as bare soil is systematically targeted for transition to urban thus we can conclude that direct transition from forest to urban in jrb was avoided throughout the 30 years period over all the intervals the computed hypothetical annual transition errors are less than 4 in terms of accounting the apparent deviation from the uniform transitions of respective intervals note that the computation of hypothetical errors of uniform annual transition assumes the changes of a targeted category of the initial time allocated different area of the final time as shown in fig 8 high transition intensities from forest to bare soil and higher transition intensities from forest to agricultural than from forest to urban avoided transition indicates that most of the urban conversions are from agricultural and bare soil rather than from forest itself here a detailed investigation was performed to explore the main category ies that contributed to the increase of urban land analysis of the agricultural land losses could answer this query fig 11 analyzed the intensity of agricultural losses to bare soil and urban for the six intervals targeted clearance of agricultural land to bare soil was identified throughout the study period where all the annual transition intensity bars are longer than the uniform line of the respective intervals there is also targeted loss of agricultural land to urban except 2001 2005 this analysis proves that the lulc changes from systematically targeting transition of agricultural to bare soil and from bare soil to urban indicates that the lulc changes from forest to urban was avoided direct destruction of forest land for urban uses was inactive during the study period 4 4 river morphology analysis urbanization can impact the morphology of the river due to increase of streamflow runoff sediment transport etc the changes that occurred on the physical properties i e area length and migration area and distance of the johor river at every 5 years interval are presented in this section fig 13 shows the overlaid river polygons to show the changes of the river boundary over the years the centerlines and their length and areal extent derived from the johor river are presented in table 7 in general the area of water increased from 5442 46 ha in 1990 to 5684 94 ha in 2020 on the other hand the length of the centerlines increased from 1990 to 2005 then decreased from 2010 to 2020 the mean length of the centerlines is recorded as 90249 77 m for the analysis of channel migration the centerline of johor river is divided into 13 reaches fig 14 based on the centerline of year 1990 as the original state analysis on two outputs from the cmt are focused here including the river migration area and the river migration distance the river migration area refers to the area of polygons generated by overlaying the centerlines of subsequent years the river migration distance refers to the distance detected by overlaying the transects at specific locations along the centerlines table 8 explains the trends of johor river migration over the study period table 8 a shows the migration zones within each reach their total migration and the total polygons generated along the river over each interval and table 8 b reported the migrated distance detected by all the transects within each reach mean migration distance and their total over each period less migrated changed portion of the river is found within r 5 to r 9 italicized table 8 a b in general highest area migration 1853886 m2 of johor river occurred between 2010 and 2015 and least area migration 498609 m2 occurred from 1995 to 2000 we compared the annual change intensity fig 7 with the total migration area and total migration distance as shown in fig 12 the proportional relationship between lulc changes intensity with the total migration area and total mean migration distance shows that higher lulc change intensity can lead to higher river migration which could increase the river morphology changes over the respective period therefore the result implies that lulc changes can impact the river morphology of the jrb among the reaches higher migration shaded in table 8 a occurred in r 12 1188252 m2 and r 13 1986384 m2 this situation could be due to the r 12 and r 13 are located near the estuary which has the widest width along the johor river where a slight changes on the centerline will cause higher migration of area over these reaches fig 15 a showed the maps of the locations of r 12 and r 13 from fig 13 significant changes at both sides of r 12 and r 13 can be seen where on the left side of the river some areas were covered by water in 2010 but no water remained after 2015 we suspect this could be due to heavy development of the area where the senai desaru expressway indicated in fig 15 a was built which caused serious mangrove degradation and led to flooding in 2010 moreover on the right side of r 13 development of aquacultural activities were noticed which could be the main reason that contributed to the high changes recorded land reclamation wang et al 2019 near the estuary of johor river could also contributes to the high channel migration table 8 b captures more details of channel migration at specific locations several high mean migration distance values were detected and analyzed values with asterisk r 1 recorded relatively higher migration distance throughout the study period the main reason for the high migration distance is because this area is located at the outlet of linggui dam built on year 1992 where most of the impacts following the construction of dams could be detected highest migration distance of r 1 was detected over year 2015 2020 where a mean of 41 30 m of migration was recorded from the 10 transects generated within this reach fig 15 b highlighted the changes of r 1 several sand mining activities were noticed along the main river and these activities created ponding of water besides the river which have been classified as part of the river based on our classification algorithm the ponds created by sand mining activities can be clearly identified from the lulc classification map of year 2020 where forest and agricultural land were cleared for the purpose of sand mining the presence of these sand mining ponds changes occurred in lulc increased the migration area and distance of the river river morphology of r1 as shown in table 8 sand mining near the river if not properly managed can bring a negative impact to the river itself and the surrounding environment and ecosystem including shallowing the river and increasing sediment flow downstream fig 15 c displayed a meander closure along the r 2 between year 2010 and 2015 resulting a mean migration distance of 45 25 m the inlet of the river meander was found to be filled with soil possible reasons for this are due to the shortening of river or to avoid flooding over the plantation zone another high mean migration distance was detected due to plantation activities within r 4 between year 2005 2020 fig 15 d total mean migration distance of this reach from 2005 to 2020 is recorded as 80 08 m over this area ponds built along the river have been classified as the river since about 65 of the jrb is agricultural land these ponds were built to store water for irrigation purposes water from the river can flow into these ponds and support the surrounding plantation activities these ponds are located closely to the main river and have been classified as water in the lulc maps which we think could bring great impact to the river morphology changes therefore we include the area of ponds classified as the river in the analysis to show the impacts of these man made ponds to the morphology changes in addition a barrage was built at the kota tinggi town r 7 in 2017 to prevent the saline water flow to the upper stream lee binti zaharuddin 2015 and to prevent floods fig 15 e channel migration distance of 40 92 m was reported due to the change of water course and the barrage separated the river into two parts and increased the water area surrounding it the existence of the barrage could influence the biodiversity of the area impacting the fishery production due to a reduced flow of saline water sinha et al 1996 through the analysis of migration area and migration distance computed based on the river centerlines using the cmt the shape and width changes of johor river is analysed changes of the shape and width of johor river will affect the creation of the centerlines while the migration of centerlines can represent the changes of the river morphology during a specified area and period this section proved that significant morphology changes on johor river was identified where the largest changes found near the estuary of the river several locations with high migration distances were identified and proved that some human induced activities are the main causes of river morphology changes 5 discussion 5 1 lulc monitoring using gee remote sensing and geospatial technologies offer unique opportunities in mapping monitoring and quantitative analysis of land surface processes such as land degradation and deforestation and their impact on the biosphere dubovyk 2017 remote sensing has been used to classify lulc since the launch of landsat satellites in 1970 s souza filho et al 2016 although landsat data are available at every 16 day intervals frequent cloud cover especially in the tropical maritime regions like malaysia make only very few images available for producing change detection maps nevertheless compositing procedures mosaicking clear pixels from available partially cloudy images have been developed roy et al 2010 the google earth engine gee has become a popular platform for remote sensing image processing to eliminate clouds and lulc monitoring despite the gee provides comprehensive image composite method some issues are still noticeable on the composite images one of the issues is the presence of cloud shadow which could not be detected and removed based on the c function of mask cfmask algorithm used by landsat on gee to overcome this issue an improved cloud shadow filter must be developed in the near future barboza castillo et al 2020 specifically over the tropical region lulc classification in this study using gee with svm and rf classifiers showed high classification accuracy oa 0 90 and svm classifier was found advantageous on classifying narrow features as suggested by heydari and mountrakis 2018 zagajewski et al 2021 the capability of svm to classify narrow river could be due to the non linear hyperplanes theory which can successfully delineate water pixels surrounding by other lulc classes while rf which is based on the ensemble tree theory could mis group the water pixels into the other lulc classes during the voting process generally the use of gee increases the classification speed from the perspective of satellite data collection processing classification and accuracy assessment the methodology of this study can be utilized to a larger region i e state and national scale to enhance the lulc classification in terms of time and cost consumptions future study can utilize high spatial resolution remote sensing data which can improve the accuracy of lulc classification and change detection and includes the digital elevation model dem as input of slope during river centerline generation in order to enhance the quality of river morphology changes identification 5 2 lulc changes and impacts increased food production due to population growth has caused large scale forest clearance in the sea as a whole over the last 50 years maja and ayano 2021 similarly rapid growth in industrialization urbanization and aquaculture have also contributed to loss of arable lands and coastal ecosystems sejati et al 2020 extensive urbanization increases water scarcity issues which leads to the construction of dams and exploration of groundwater chen and trias 2020 impacts of lulc changes of river basins has been extensively studied and linked to climate change temperature precipitation etc and alteration of hydrological processes runoff discharge floods streamflow evapotranspiration lateral flow etc chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 getachew et al 2021 petchprayoon et al 2010 sinha et al 2020 zope et al 2017 deforestation and urbanization are two key factors that contribute to lulc changes of a river basin while the building of a reservoir or dam within a river basin has become very common in recent years behera et al 2018 li et al 2020 woldemichael et al 2012 to overcome water related issues the johor river basin is an area where tropical flora and fauna presents but population growth and urbanization have altered the lulc of the area dramatically as shown in this study the findings of this study are similar to our previous lulc study of the iskandar malaysia development region kanniah et al 2015 where loss of natural land cover forest and mangrove and gain of agricultural urban and bare soil were identified a total of 8 5 of forest loss and 0 5 of mangrove loss were identified during the study period in jrb which were converted into dams agricultural lands urban area and cleared bare soil to ensure water security for the local population and support regional singapore necessity dams were built in the jrb construction of a dam can have a strong impact on the river ecosystem where river flow regulations river channelization water abstraction are among the most influencing factors that cause river stress sabater et al 2018 the building of dams increased the areas covered by water in the study area where an increase of 4957 4 ha and 2000 ha were identified between 1990 and 1995 and 2015 2020 corresponding to the period when the linggui and the seluyut dams were built respectively besides damming building of a barrage and human exploration sand mining were also identified along the river changes of the rivers in a basin can have socio economic biodiversity hydrology and environmental impacts consequently the changes of these lulc could have caused changes in the river morphology from this study we identified the increase of water area when analyzing the main river johor river in the jrb which was mainly due to damming building of a barrage and human exploration sand mining inconsistencies in lulc change based on the intensity analysis in this study fig 7 to fig 11 clearly show the intensity of the lulc changes particularly the depletion of forests and agricultural lands for water dams and urban development within each interval at least 12 of land area was changed within jrb approximately 25 of area changes was identified on two intervals 1990 1995 and 2010 2015 the high area changes occurred between 1990 and 1995 could be due to the introduction of new development policy of the malaysia government while the development of iskandar malaysia region could be the reason for high changes occurred between year 2010 2015 the detailed analysis highlights hotspots in lulc change of bare soil 94 17 urban 68 55 forest 45 82 and mangrove 42 79 and it is useful to local stakeholders and policy makers for regulating and realizing sustainable development goals sdgs to prevent over exploration of land and resources in the area the expansion of oil palm and rubber plantation lands in the jrb over the past decades is found to correspond to the regional pattern gains and losses of bare soil were found always active over the study period indicating active forest clearance to bare soil and active transition of bare soil to urban development which is particular pattern of a rapidly developing region as it has been suggested previously this intensify lulc changes could bring severe impacts to the area including the changes of river morphology 5 3 river morphology changes based on the channel migration toolbox the area and distance changes of the johor river was detected based on the polygons and centerlines generated from the classification results higher river migration area and mean distance was identified during the period when there is higher lulc change intensity and vice versa fig 12 this finding supports our hypothesis that lulc changes can impact the river morphology in jrb changes of river morphology usually can only be detected over decades but human interference can directly induced channel adjustments surian and rinaldi 2003 recent studies concentrated on examining river morphology changes following the construction of dams li et al 2020 piqué et al 2016 and flood events magliulo and valente 2020 yousefi et al 2019 and found that these activities contribute to river morphology changes at different magnitudes due to the characteristics of the study area dingle et al 2019 concludes that tropical river characterized with higher channel migration rate then temperate however research on river morphological changes is found limited in the southeast asia from the analysis most of the migration captured in this study are human induced including mangrove degradation due to expressway construction r 12 and r 13 dam construction and sand mining activities r 1 agricultural activities r 2 and r 4 and the construction of barrage r 7 these anthropogenic activities although mainly targeted to improve humans livelihood particularly over the high populated area should be planned with a boarder perspective and according to international and local policies to prevent habitat fragmentation ecological impacts and assure water security and environmental sustainability hohensinner et al 2018 spada et al 2018 further research is required to explain the changes of the area of river over the time since these changes are mainly due to the combined effects of natural rainfall runoff drought tides etc and manmade activities sand mining aquaculture conversion etc the method introduced in this study can be developed as a toolkit to consistently investigate the migration and morphological changes of the rivers in the region 6 conclusion this study investigated the lulc changes of the johor river basin and the changes of river morphology over the period 1990 2020 based on remote sensing and gis techniques the google earth engine was applied with landsat imageries and two classifiers svm and rf were compared high classification accuracy was achieved with an overall accuracy above 90 while svm produced more detailed classification maps compared to rf with better capability to detect narrow river features increase of water and urban area based on the classification results indicate that jrb is a hotspot of urbanization with increasing water demand with the construction of two dams the main river johor river in the jrb was selected for river morphology change analysis intensity analysis on the classification results shows an average of 3 48 of jrb area underwent lulc changes annually forest urban and bare soil are the classes changing actively throughout the 30 years period activities including sand mining artificial meander closure and barrage construction were identified along the johor river and the impacts of these activities to the river migration is highlighted in this study however the impacts of these anthropogenic modifications to the ecosystem and environment are unknown a better understanding on how the lulc and river morphology changes in this river basin impacts the environment hydrological processes ecosystem services social and communities will become a critical subject to enhance and sustain future planning and management to ensure water security and

7959,study region johor river basin jrb malaysia study focus the study generates long time series land use and land cover lulc change at 5 years interval using google earth engine and investigate the lulc changes and river morphology changes of jrb intensity analysis on the lulc changes was conducted to highlight the transition between lulc targeted transition from natural to disturbed lands were detected which impact the river morphology of the basin river morphology changes were identified along johor river based on the centerline migration derived from channel migration toolbox new hydrological insights for the region jrb has undergone high intensity lulc change over the past decades due to significant economic and population growth which impacted the river morphology channel migration analysis reported high river centerline migration 498609 m2 to 1853886 m2 of johor river higher migration rate was identified at the estuary of the johor river and several locations along the river specific locations with high channel migration were highlighted where human induced changes are the factors to affect the morphology of the river the proposed method is first applied in the

once or on multiple occasions winkler et al 2021 the dynamicity of land use and land cover lulc change has triggered issues related to environmental ecosystem water food security climate change etc song et al 2018 winkler et al 2021 the lulc science includes characterization of land cover and land use and quantification of their changes and their consequences drivers of these changes are either natural such as climate variability and change or anthropogenic such as socio economic or political roy and roy 2010 any human induced landscape modification driven by economy or politics has impacts on major components in the earth system such as carbon cycle surface hydrology and atmospheric processes zhao et al 2006 these changes also affect social systems and impact food security energy production and water resources wolde et al 2021 water is the foundation to sustain life guppy and anderson 2017 half of the world s population reside at the vicinity of river 3 km to obtain their main source of water freshwater supply kummu et al 2011 and daily essentials such as economic activities transportation and natural resources exploration fang et al 2018 however water scarcity and security issues have emerged at national and global scales due to rapid population growth by 2050 more than 40 of the world s population will get their daily water supply from water stressed river basins oecd 2001 this increase of supply and demand of water and resources relative to the global population growth has led to significant lulc change especially at the vicinity of rivers which can severely impact the river physical characteristics and ecology chin 2006 zhao et al 2006 how lulc changes impact a river basin from various perspectives have been studied chin 2006 including runoff and water availability wang et al 2017 discharge petchprayoon et al 2010 water yield geng et al 2015 headwater fluvial harden 2006 morphology and structure kudnar 2020 yousefi et al 2019 and dam construction wwf 2004 river morphology refers to the shape of river channels and identifying their changes in terms of the area zone and direction channel migration over time can help communities residing near the river bank to guide development away from channel migration zones and reduce flood hazards recent studies by kong et al 2020 and ibitoye 2021 proved that the natural and anthropogenic activities are the main cause of river morphology changes the johor river basin jrb located in the southern state of peninsular malaysia has an important role to supply water for local usage and to support part of the water demand of singapore chuah et al 2018 it is in a humid tropical region with monsoon seasons and is occasionally influenced by el nino events and severely impacted by floods for the past decades kia et al 2012 saudi et al 2015 droughts floods dams and barrage construction and land reclamation within or surrounding the basin can severely affect the naturality of the basin thus it has become a popular area for research particularly relating to hydro climatology studies including floods ismail et al 2015 streamflow tan et al 2015 runoff dorofki et al 2012 drought tan et al 2019a 2019b and soil erosion obaid and shahid 2017 which are impacted by the lulc changes over the years under the rapid development of the area wang et al 2019 identified several land sprawl construction and land reclamation areas over the southern part of the jrb particularly at tekong island singapore to accommodate the economic development and inhabitants surrounding the river basin this indicates that the jrb and its surrounding area are rapidly changing which could have a direct impact on the hydrology and ecology of the river basin in addition anthropogenic activities including construction of dams and barrage along the jrb have affected the natural stability of the river basin although these activities were to ensure water security and prevent floods in the area lin 2011 studies investigating the impact of lulc changes on river morphology are limited and only a few researchers have been conducted to date in portugal fernandes et al 2020 india himayoun and roshni 2020 iran yousefi et al 2019 2016 nigeria ibitoye 2021 despite being a popular study site due to its importance to the region a long term analysis on lulc changes within the jrb and the impacts on the river morphology is yet to be conducted awang ali et al 2017 lulc classification and change detection over the tropical region is always a painstaking task due to the lack of multi temporal cloudless satellite data and insufficient ground sampling to date most of the lulc classification or change detection studies conducted in tropical region are based on satellite images contains with some clouds and cloud shadows deilmai et al 2014 kanniah et al 2021 2016 2015 tan et al 2010 intensity analysis of lulc has been successfully applied globally to improve the understanding of the transition between various land use classes ekumah et al 2020 estoque and murayama 2015 gandharum et al 2022 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 this advanced analytical technique is also useful on detecting errors on historical classification maps which ground truth samples are usually unavailable enaruvbe and pontius 2015 sun et al 2021 tankpa et al 2020 and added advantage to explain the lulc results in a more detailed manner moreover although lulc classification is a popular research in malaysia no previous studies applied intensity analysis to describe lulc changes in malaysia this study utilized the google earth engine gee a cloud based platform featuring big data processing using a collection of publicly available remote sensing imagery and products gorelick et al 2017 for lulc classification although the gee has gained much publicity a review by amani et al 2020 summarized machine learning and land cover as being a popular research area based on gee only a few studies have been conducted in malaysia over the years shaharum et al 2020 compared svm rf and classification and regression tree cart classifiers to classify oil palm in malaysia on 2016 2017 using landsat 8 data wahap and

classification of jrb but only focused on year 2019 to our knowledge there are limited studies conducted on jrb to identify the impacts of lulc changes to the dynamics of river morphology over a long period the impacts of lulc changes within the river basin can support future planning management and sustainable development of the jrb and its surrounding areas it will also assist further studies involving ecosystem conservation and services sustainable land use planning natural disaster floods prevention and water security this study aims to analyze the impacts of lulc changes within the jrb to the johor river morphology over the past 30 years based on remote sensing and geographic information science gis techniques more specifically two machine learning algorithms were compared to delineate different land use and land cover classes the intensity of the lulc changes was then analysed at 5 years intervals between 1990 and 2020 river features classified from the satellite images were processed to generate river centerlines and migration polygons a detailed analysis on river morphology was performed on locations that underwent significant changes over time the results from this study will support the local understanding on the lulc changes and the impact to the river morphology of the jrb it will provide useful data to inform local and national policies and development

major tributaries include the linggui sayong tiram and seluyut rivers fig 1 b the whole of the jrb considered in this study covers an area of about 238600 ha part of it is within the iskandar malaysia zone which has been the focus development area of malaysia since 2006 land transformation due to urbanization dam constructions and agricultural activities have been some of the major lulc changes in the jrb over the decades to cope with the increased population water demand and to support economical income from industrial and agricultural sectors fig 1 a and b show the location of the jrb in the johor state of peninsular malaysia 3 data and methodology the methodology of this study is divided into two parts the first part involves digital image classification of cloudless landsat image composites that were generated using gee based on two machine learning classifiers the accuracy assessment and change detection analysis and the lulc change intensity analysis the second part involves the analysis on the river morphology changes using the channel migration toolbox cmt over the study period in jhb fig 2 shows the general workflow of the study and the following subsections describes the procedures in detail 3 1 google earth engine the google earth engine gee is a user friendly open source web based cloud computing platform featuring big geodata access processing interpretation and analysis amani et al 2020 since the introduction of the gee in 2010 multiple satellites data collection is made available including from the landsat mission which is the most widely used dataset kumar and mutanga 2018 with a collection covering around 40 years since the 1970 s tamiminia et al 2020 recent studies utilized gee to generate landsat time series lulc changes analysis and comparing different classification techniques over variety of study sites benefiting from the vast data availability and fast computing capability of gee brovelli et al 2020 nyland et al 2018 richards and belcher 2020 shaharum et al 2020 xie et al 2019 these studies suggest that gee could accelerate and improve the long time series lulc classification over selected area or regions the gee was applied in this study to produce landsat image composites at 5 years gap and to perform machine learning classification and confusion matrix analysis operating on a cloud based platform the computing power of the gee facilitates data collection classification and analysis processes at a very fast speed the following sections describe the detailed methodology used in the gee to achieve accurate lulc classification maps for the jrb 3 1 1 cloudless landsat image composite landsat is one of the satellite datasets in the gee image collections although the first landsat satellite was launched in 1972 a complete coverage of the landsat image composite over the study area is only available from 1990 therefore landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 operation land imager oli were used to generate the image composites at 5 years interval for classification purposes the landsat collection of tier 1 surface reflectance t1 sr which underwent atmospheric correction including cloud shadow water and snow mask processes was selected in this study both landsat 6 failed to enter the orbit and landsat 7 scan line corrector failure were left out from the selection table 1 summarizes the characteristics of landsat 5 and landsat 8 sensors cloud cover is always an issue for optical remote sensing images acquired over the equatorial region to overcome this issue a cloud masking function was applied during the image composition process the bitmask for pixel qa pixel quality attributes bands were considered to mask the clouds and cloud shadow on each landsat image within each period of interest table 2 lists the detail of the periods and number of scenes used to generate each image composite the default period to generate the image composite is one year while for several cases there are still some masked pixels found on the image composite thus a longer timeframe was set to overcome this issue for example a timeframe of 2 years 01 01 2004 31 12 2005 was set to generate the image composite for year 2005 based on local knowledge we assume that there are no massive land use and land cover change occurred during the 2 years interval within the 5 years window considered in this study this assumption is supported by 1 the transition from forest to agriculture or urban requires land clearance which normally takes years to complete 2 the built up of residential and commercial buildings from bare soil requires at least 3 years to complete 3 the clearance and replanting of crops in the study area can be completed within 2 3 years period therefore we believe that 5 years interval set in this study could be appropriate and representable to the actual land use land cover changes once the landsat images were listed from each timeframe the median of each pixel in the jrb was computed to create the cloudless landsat scenes within each timeframe median reduction method is used in this study because it is a promising technique in gee to process image composite which can provide equal or improved classification accuracy when compared to other reduction method mean minimum maximum percentile etc single image and timeseries images feizizadeh et al 2021 nyland et al 2018 phan et al 2020 richards and belcher 2020 xie et al 2019 li et al 2019 and luo et al 2022 proved that the median image composite method based on multi year images could minimize the impact of extreme outliers caused by the seasonal and weather effects resulting a robust image composite for mapping therefore the cloudless landsat image composites generated based on the above procedures are assumed to have stable spectral characteristics and minimal seasonal effects where the changes of water level and river wetted cross sections will not significantly impact the classification extraction of river polygons and its centerlines as well as the river morphology analysis fig s1 shows the true color cloudless landsat image composite of each time interval 3 1 2 machine learning classification machine learning classification is one of the most applied functions in gee which includes both supervised and unsupervised algorithms amani et al 2020 this study utilized support vector machine svm and random forest rf classifiers available on gee platform gorelick et al 2017 based on two recent reviews by tamiminia et al 2020 and sheykhmousa et al 2020 both svm and rf can provide comparable high accuracy while both support vector machine svm and random forest rf are the most selected machine learning classifier over the recent years sheykhmousa et al 2020 conclusion on which classifier performs better in lulc classification is not clear thus this study compared the two classifiers and analysed their capability in terms of classification accuracy and visual appearance 3 1 2 1 support vector machine classifier a svm classifier based on the supervised non parametric statistical learning technique separates the data into classes by optimization of separation hyperplanes svm was first introduced in the late 1970 s and the strength of svm is its ability to solve the local extremum dilemma present in the machine learning techniques by obtaining a global optimal solution by solving the convex quadratic optimization problem the optimization is generally defined by applying soft margin or kernel functions polynomial radial basis gaussian radial basis sigmoid to solve inseparability issues caused by mixing effects which is common in remote sensing image classification in addition svm requires only small training sets to produce higher accuracy than a traditional classifier however it has shortcomings when dealing with noisy data mountrakis et al 2011 tamiminia et al 2020 3 1 2 2 random forest classifier random forest rf is the most popularly applied machine learning classifier belgiu and drăguţ 2016 and the most frequently used classifier on the gee platform tamiminia et al 2020 rf which is based on the decision tree method with an ensemble learning approach utilizes boosting and bagging procedures to solve the classification of satellite image pixels the boosting technique integrates multiple models to solve the same problem hence increasing the classification accuracy the accuracy of rf classification relies on two parameters namely the number of trees ntree and number of features mtry the classification accuracy of rf is more sensitive to mtry than ntree where a smaller mtry would shorten the processing time but provides lower accuracy it is common to set ntree as large as possible as this will not affect the efficiency and cause over fitting during the classification process belgiu and drăguţ 2016 3 2 lulc class descriptions this study classifies a total of six lulc classes lulc classes based on the local landuse map provided by the national land use information division department of town and country planning malaysia was referred and simplified water class in this study includes rivers ponds and dams in the study area forest class refers to the inland forest while mangrove class refers to wetland forest located by the river or shorelines agricultural class includes oil palm plantation rubber plantation and other agricultural lands the commercial industrial residential infrastructure and utilities and transportation road networks are classified as urban bare soil includes empty lands and cleared lands where the soil surface can be detected from the images 3 3 sampling points lack of field based data collection is always an issue when conducting a long term lulc analysis in this study on screen selection of sample points from high resolution google earth images were conducted to provide the training and validation points this method is theoretically proven and practiced in kanniah 2017 lin et al 2018 during the selection of the sample points the time slider function of google earth was used to ensure the data used to select the sample points were within the specific period of interest according to table 2 for all the periods 300 points were randomly identified and the portion of the points for each land use class were roughly distributed based on the area of each class for example 1 agriculture is the major land use in the jrb thus the majority sample points selected are for agriculture almost half of the total sample points and 2 the sample points for water on year 1990 is 50 while we increased the number of points to 60 after year 1995 since there were more water bodies found in the study area in order to reduce the impact of the location of the sample points to the classification results we tried to maintain most of the sample points at the same location throughout the 30 years study period unless land use change was identified visually during the sample point selection the selected sample points were imported to gee script to run the classification during the classification process the sample points were randomly divided into 2 categories namely training sample 70 and validation samples 30 3 4 post classification and accuracy assessment a minimum mapping unit mmu was applied at post classification to improve the quality of the classified maps a window size of 3 3 was used on each classified map to generalize spurious pixels according to the neighboring pixels this process can remove noise and salt pepper effects from the output maps the gee platform also supports classification analysis including the confusion matrix which is also used to compute the overall accuracy oa producer accuracy pa consumer accuracy ca and kappa coefficient kc oa is the ratio between the sum of the major diagonal to the total number of sample points pa and ca are two accuracy parameters to show the agreement between the sample points to a specific class from the perspective of the producer or the consumer respectively pa is computed by dividing the major diagonal value of the class samples that are correctly classified to the sum of the samples for that class ca is computed by dividing the major diagonal value by the total number of sample classified mapped as that class finally the kc was computed for each classification map to test whether the result is significantly better than a random classification a kc above 0 also refers to significant agreement between the classification map with the reference sample points congalton and green 2019 thus the oa pa ca and kc were reported in this study for both the svm and rf classification map of every selected period 3 5 lulc changes analysis located within the rapidly developing state of malaysia jrb has been subject to intense analysis on the lulc changes to show how and what are the major land uses that have changed over the study period besides comparison on the total area and percentage of each lulc class change detection analysis is normally conducted to detect the area changes from one class to another a matrix with computed pixel counts or area of the changes was produced from the change detection of two periods and maps were generated to visually identify the area of significant changes in order to understand the lulc changes in more detail an advance analysis method such as intensity analysis was introduced by aldwaik and pontius 2012 and tested on several sites including plum island in boston zhenlai county in china yang et al 2017 and two developing cities in southeast asia bangkok and manila estoque and murayama 2015 intensity analysis of lulc changes can be performed based on the data derived from the change detection matrix intensity analysis can be divided into three levels which are interval intensity category intensity and transition intensity the interval intensity compares the uniform intensity calculated as the rate of change of the whole study period to the rate of change of each time interval the annual rate of changes also can be computed by dividing the interval rates to the number of years of each period by comparing the annual intensity rate to the uniform intensity rate the lulc change of a specific area can be identified as slow or fast paced over a specific period the category intensity computes the annual change intensity of each category based on the gross gains and gross losses then the intensity is compared to the uniform intensity this comparison examines which category actively changes or stays dormant over the period the transition intensity explaining the gains or losses of a particular category are targeted from or avoided from which category it can highlight how intensely a category changed from or to another category the equations involved in computing the interval category and transition intensities can be referred to in aldwaik and pontius 2012 hypothetical errors of each time interval were calculated to explain the deviation of each classification map from the uniform transitions as shown in enaruvbe and pontius 2015 with consideration of classification errors may influence the accuracy of the intensity analysis 3 6 river morphology changes to investigate the morphological changes channel migration of the johor river the raster classification maps of the jrb were vectorized and the polygons of water bodies rivers dams ponds etc were extracted at a 30 meter spatial resolution of landsat composite images some parts of the river and tributes with width less than the landsat spatial resolution are not clearly identified due to the mixing pixel effects commonly occurring in remote sensing data therefore we limited the river morphology analysis to the main river johor river in the jrb fig 1 b fig 3 describes the steps applied to derive river centerlines and use the centerlines to compute river migration area and distance firstly the area of the johor river was computed based on the polygons and compared among the different years to understand the areal changes of the river over time secondly the centerlines of the river were generated from the river polygons fig 3 a b using the create thiessen polygon function in arcgis version 10 5 lewandowicz and flisek 2020 centerlines are commonly used to investigate the morphological changes of a river ibitoye 2021 kong et al 2020 during this process the centerlines were generated based on the boundary of the polygons so the centerlines can represent the changes of the shape and direction morphology of the river the length of the centerlines was then compared among the years to define the changes of the total length of johor river over the period the channel migration toolbox cmt legg et al 2014 developed by the department of ecology state of washington usa integrated in arcgis 10 5 was used to analyse the morphological changes the main purpose of cmt is to measure river migration rates along the entire river and within the river reaches sections of the river transects were drawn within the reaches to directly measure river migration at specific locations fig 3 c d legg et al 2014 three tools were used in the cmt to derive the migration area zone and distance of the river namely 1 reach average channel migration tool 2 transect generation tool and 3 transect channel migration tool by importing the river centerlines into the cmt the first tool overlays the centerlines to create polygons that represent the migration area zone during each specific period in order to analyse the river changes in a more detailed manner 13 reaches at different lengths were set along the river r 1 to r 13 table 3 the function of these reaches is to separate the entire river into sections so the migration rate of each reach can be clearly defined and analysed the second tool generates the transects within each reach at a user specified gap the distance between transects is relative to the width of the river where greater transect gap is recommended for wider river legg et al 2014 thus different number of transacts were generated for each reach considering the relative width of the river table 3 summarizes the gap set for the transects and the number of transects within each reach the third tool applied in this study overlays the transects on to the migration area polygons defined from tool 1 the lateral movements of centerlines across multiple periods can be measured using this tool and the distance of the migration at each transects are exported based on the transects migration distance table analysis such as the migration distance of specific transects mean migration distance within each reach and total migration distance of the entire river can be computed analysis of the impact of lulc changes on river morphology changes was performed by comparing the lulc change intensity with the total migration area and total migration distance computed from cmt furthermore specific locations with significant river migration were highlighted and the reasons for the river morphology change were discussed 4 results and analysis 4 1 classification maps and accuracy assessment classification procedures based on gee minimize the time and steps required to complete the classification of the jrb over three decades with 5 years interval classification maps for years 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 were produced based on the cloudless landsat image composites described in section 3 1 1 table 4 lists the pa ca oa and kc for each year and their respective classes statistically the rf classifier has higher oa and kc when compared to the svm classifier both svm and rf classifiers showed very high accuracy above 0 90 and rf recorded perfect classification accuracy on several occasions oa 1 00 according to breiman 2001 it is possible for rf classifier to produce oa of 1 0 due to several reasons when 1 the rf has built a full grown tree and 2 rf is based on the bootstrapped training sets that the out of bag method decreases the error rate in addition of the high accuracy of svm and rf the spatial distribution of the classification maps generated from svm fig 4 and rf fig s2 are also similar however from detail visual interpretation on the output maps we found that the svm classifier performed better on identifying narrow river when compared to the results from the rf classification the rivers identified using the svm classifier were found to be mis classified as their surrounding land use classes in the rf classifier fig 5 shows a zoomed location comparing this issue from fig 5 we can notice that the sayong river located at the western side of the johor river basin was correctly classified using the svm classifier but some parts of the sayong river were classified as agricultural area when the rf classifier was applied based on this finding we conclude that despite the rf classifier produced a higher classification accuracy it can only produce more generalized classification maps the svm classifier on the other hand is found to capture more details especially over narrower features such as rivers in the jrb region this finding is corresponded to zagajewski et al 2021 who found that svm has superiority on classifying heterogeneous area capture more features and detecting edge pixels heydari and mountrakis 2018 while rf tends to be more generalized on agricultural area dabija et al 2021 the potential of the rf classifier to delineate narrow features needs to be explored further therefore in the following section the results produced from the svm classification are described and discussed fig 4 shows the majority of the lulc of the jrb is for agricultural usage with agricultural land covering more than 60 150000 ha of the basin in all the years analyzed in this study this is followed by forest land that covers about 20 of the basin most of the forests are found at the northeastern part of the basin and other forest patches are located at the middle and the eastern part of the basin urban development is found to be expanding at the southern part of the basin while mangroves are located along the johor river and its estuary this type of lulc distribution is common in the sea region where the majority of forest lands were cleared for agricultural crops and urbanization surrounding the river kummu et al 2011 being the main water source for daily supply and industrial usage the construction of dams became a common practice in sea as well as at global scale primarily at the area of rapid population growth sabater et al 2018 such as in the jrb 4 2 lulc change analysis based on the classification maps as shown in fig 4 the area of each class was computed as in table 5 and plotted in fig 6 over the period of the 30 years examined a significant loss of land cover especially forest was identified and the most rapid reduction of forest was found between 1990 and 1995 with a total reduction of 20992 6 ha in the same period agricultural land expanded 15573 2 ha and most of these expansions were at the expense of forest destruction this transition of forest to agricultural land especially oil palm has a long history to support national income from commodity manufacturing and trading aznam yusof and bhattasali 2008 losses of mangrove areas were also detected during the study period although mangrove covers only less than 2 0 of the whole jrb region nearly 30 of mangrove losses were identified from 1990 to 2020 since most mangrove lands were located at the downstream of the jrb the major loss of mangrove areas was found to be associated with the development of the pasir gudang port and conversion to agricultural activities note that the lowest mangrove area recorded was in 2010 with 2822 2 ha then a regrowth of mangrove was noticed in years 2015 and 2020 increasing the total mangrove land to 3081 6 ha by 2020 the regrowth of mangrove within the past 10 years can be accredited to an increasing public awareness due to the policy of the iskandar malaysia regional development authority on mangrove conservation and restoration kanniah et al 2021 water is an essential resource that supports the daily life of the people living in the johor state and singapore chuah et al 2018 heng et al 2017 from 1990 to 1995 the construction of the linggui dam a reservoir with maximum capacity of 760 million cubic meters served as the main water supply source for the area at the northern side of the jrb the dam construction increased the coverage of water area in jrb from 8662 5 ha to 13619 9 ha with a net increase of 4957 4 ha 57 3 the linggui dam project also contributed partly to the loss of forest area within this period another increase in water bodies is found in 2020 where the construction of another dam seluyut dam increased areas covered by water to 15690 40 ha 6 6 which is the highest of the 30 years period besides dams sand mining and man made ponding along the river for economic and agricultural usage was also found to be the reason for the widening of johor river which consequently increased the water area and changed the river morphology the expansion of urban areas i e the penggerang industrial area at the southern east of the johor coast not in the jrb meant that more water was demanded for industrial usage and to support the daily water needs of the population that had moved into the area the urban expansion of the jrb rose from 4603 5 ha in 1990 to 10541 7 ha in 2020 which was more than a two fold gain over three decades the most rapid gain of urban area was between 2005 and 2010 which corresponds to the highest loss of bare soil area from 2005 to 2010 a change detection analysis was conducted to show generally how each lulc class changed during the 30 years period based on fig 6 and table 6 water urban and agricultural gained 6484 48 ha 6337 53 ha and 10699 29 ha respectively while forest mangrove and bare soil lost 21919 32 ha 1374 03 ha and 229 95 ha respectively a total of 24 28 of increment of water surface was recorded while the highest gain was from the urban class 68 55 from 4203 81 ha rising to 10541 34 ha agricultural land gained 10692 99 ha 11 01 over the same period the loss of natural ecosystems forest and mangrove was 45 82 and 42 79 respectively over the 30 years period the most significant lulc change was the transition from forest to agricultural land where 22191 57 ha 9 3 of the total land in jrb of forest land was cleared and used for agricultural activity bare soil is among the smallest lulc class but shows the highest percentage of change 94 17 due to the rapid land clearing and urban built up activities over the study period a more detailed analysis of change detection at 5 years intervals can be found in the change detection matrix in the supplementary document table s1 s6 4 3 lulc change intensity analysis the change detection matrix at 5 years intervals table s1 s6 can be used to provide information about the lulc intensity analysis note that we used the number of pixels but not the converted area ha as the main unit for intensity analysis to prevent any degradation of accuracy in the analysis during the process of pixel to area conversion fig 7 shows the interval intensity analysis for the jrb the left side of the plot describes the total percentage of changed area within each interval the highest interval change is noticed in the period between 2011 and 2015 while the period between 2016 and 2020 recorded the lowest change intensity among other periods the right side of the plot describes how fast the area changed annually similarly the fastest and slowest annual change was for periods between 2011 and 2015 and 2016 2020 respectively uniform intensity ui presenting the change intensity of the whole period 30 years was calculated and compared to the annual change area rate the uniform intensity in this study is 3 48 where only the two intervals 1990 1995 4 23 and 2011 2015 4 37 recorded a relatively faster rate more intense lulc changes then normal of change among the six periods three intervals 1996 2000 2001 2005 and 2016 2020 were found to have a slower annual change intensity than the ui during the interval between 2006 and 2010 the annual change rate was found to be almost similar to the ui all the bars on the right side of the plot indicate the rate of change of the jrb was not stationary throughout the study period we further analysed the category intensity change for each lulc class over the 6 intervals during the 30 years period fig 8 the bars on the left side of the plots indicate the annual change area number of pixels of each class including their gross gain and gross loss during each interval the bars on the right side of the plot indicate the annual change intensity of each class if the bar is longer than the uniform intensity line the changes of the respective class is active during the period if the bar is shorter than the uniform intensity line then the changes of the respective class is dormant during the period it can be noticed that forest and agricultural area recorded the most gain and or loss in each interval mainly because they have the largest coverage over the jrb and are rapidly changing however agricultural area and forest do not show the highest annual change intensity when compared to urban and bare soil the bars on the right hand side of the plots indicate the annual change intensity of each class which can explain that the lulc changes are simply due to the large size of the categoies or can be related to the intensity of changes of the category if the bar of the gain or loss is longer than the uniform intensity red dotted line the change of the lulc category is relatively active it is obvious that urban forest and bare soil have higher annual intensity and active changes gain and loss within each interval where depletion of forest land clearing and urban development are all significant factors of a rapidly developing region the bar of gain of urban and bare soil extends over the uniform line for all the intervals indicating the urban and bare soil gains are more intensive active than the other lulc similarly the bar of forest loss is always longer than the uniform line indicating active forest loss in the jrb throughout the 30 years period in all the plots the annual change intensity of the agricultural land during each time interval is found to be dormant annual changes less than the uniform intensity despite the agricultural area annual change being the highest in most of the intervals this indicates that although agricultural land has the highest annual gain and or loss the change of agricultural land was relatively consistent and dormant during the six intervals an active gain of water was found within the 1990 1995 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 periods over the study period two dams were built which is the main reason for the active gain of water bodies between 1990 and 1995 linggui dam and 2016 and 2020 seluyut dam on the other hand an active loss of water was identified between 2011 and 2015 particularly due to drought conditions resulting from an el nino event in 2015 low and loganathan 2019 at the transition level we focus our analysis on the natural lulc forest and the irreversible lulc urban to show areas where there were forest losses and where urban areas were gained from and whether these transitions were systematically targeted avoided from the specific class fig 9 demonstrates the annual transition rate and intensity from forest to other lulc for each period higher transition intensity from forest to water was identified during the 1990 1995 and 2016 2020 intervals particularly due to the occupancy of forest lands for dam construction this can be explained by forest being targeted for transition to water at the other intervals the intensity of forest transition to agricultural bare soil and mangrove was higher targeted transition clearance of forest to bare soil was noticed as four out of six intervals have higher annual transition intensity of bare soil than the uniform intensity as the urban expansion in jrb area is found doubled during the study period we hypothesized that the clearance of forest could be targeted to urban development however the forest clearance does not fully contribute to the urban transition as the annual transition intensity of urban is always below avoided transition the uniform intensity this may be because part of the clearance of forest became agricultural land instead of urban land this argument can be supported by the plots shown in fig 10 as 1 the annual gain intensity of urban from forest is always below the uniform intensity of all intervals showing systematic avoidance of transition over the period proving that forest is not the main lulc that is targeted for urban transformation and 2 bare soil has the highest annual transition intensity which is always higher than the uniform intensity value of all intervals showing that urban gains targeted bare soil more intensively compared to forest and other categories this condition also can be explained as bare soil is systematically targeted for transition to urban thus we can conclude that direct transition from forest to urban in jrb was avoided throughout the 30 years period over all the intervals the computed hypothetical annual transition errors are less than 4 in terms of accounting the apparent deviation from the uniform transitions of respective intervals note that the computation of hypothetical errors of uniform annual transition assumes the changes of a targeted category of the initial time allocated different area of the final time as shown in fig 8 high transition intensities from forest to bare soil and higher transition intensities from forest to agricultural than from forest to urban avoided transition indicates that most of the urban conversions are from agricultural and bare soil rather than from forest itself here a detailed investigation was performed to explore the main category ies that contributed to the increase of urban land analysis of the agricultural land losses could answer this query fig 11 analyzed the intensity of agricultural losses to bare soil and urban for the six intervals targeted clearance of agricultural land to bare soil was identified throughout the study period where all the annual transition intensity bars are longer than the uniform line of the respective intervals there is also targeted loss of agricultural land to urban except 2001 2005 this analysis proves that the lulc changes from systematically targeting transition of agricultural to bare soil and from bare soil to urban indicates that the lulc changes from forest to urban was avoided direct destruction of forest land for urban uses was inactive during the study period 4 4 river morphology analysis urbanization can impact the morphology of the river due to increase of streamflow runoff sediment transport etc the changes that occurred on the physical properties i e area length and migration area and distance of the johor river at every 5 years interval are presented in this section fig 13 shows the overlaid river polygons to show the changes of the river boundary over the years the centerlines and their length and areal extent derived from the johor river are presented in table 7 in general the area of water increased from 5442 46 ha in 1990 to 5684 94 ha in 2020 on the other hand the length of the centerlines increased from 1990 to 2005 then decreased from 2010 to 2020 the mean length of the centerlines is recorded as 90249 77 m for the analysis of channel migration the centerline of johor river is divided into 13 reaches fig 14 based on the centerline of year 1990 as the original state analysis on two outputs from the cmt are focused here including the river migration area and the river migration distance the river migration area refers to the area of polygons generated by overlaying the centerlines of subsequent years the river migration distance refers to the distance detected by overlaying the transects at specific locations along the centerlines table 8 explains the trends of johor river migration over the study period table 8 a shows the migration zones within each reach their total migration and the total polygons generated along the river over each interval and table 8 b reported the migrated distance detected by all the transects within each reach mean migration distance and their total over each period less migrated changed portion of the river is found within r 5 to r 9 italicized table 8 a b in general highest area migration 1853886 m2 of johor river occurred between 2010 and 2015 and least area migration 498609 m2 occurred from 1995 to 2000 we compared the annual change intensity fig 7 with the total migration area and total migration distance as shown in fig 12 the proportional relationship between lulc changes intensity with the total migration area and total mean migration distance shows that higher lulc change intensity can lead to higher river migration which could increase the river morphology changes over the respective period therefore the result implies that lulc changes can impact the river morphology of the jrb among the reaches higher migration shaded in table 8 a occurred in r 12 1188252 m2 and r 13 1986384 m2 this situation could be due to the r 12 and r 13 are located near the estuary which has the widest width along the johor river where a slight changes on the centerline will cause higher migration of area over these reaches fig 15 a showed the maps of the locations of r 12 and r 13 from fig 13 significant changes at both sides of r 12 and r 13 can be seen where on the left side of the river some areas were covered by water in 2010 but no water remained after 2015 we suspect this could be due to heavy development of the area where the senai desaru expressway indicated in fig 15 a was built which caused serious mangrove degradation and led to flooding in 2010 moreover on the right side of r 13 development of aquacultural activities were noticed which could be the main reason that contributed to the high changes recorded land reclamation wang et al 2019 near the estuary of johor river could also contributes to the high channel migration table 8 b captures more details of channel migration at specific locations several high mean migration distance values were detected and analyzed values with asterisk r 1 recorded relatively higher migration distance throughout the study period the main reason for the high migration distance is because this area is located at the outlet of linggui dam built on year 1992 where most of the impacts following the construction of dams could be detected highest migration distance of r 1 was detected over year 2015 2020 where a mean of 41 30 m of migration was recorded from the 10 transects generated within this reach fig 15 b highlighted the changes of r 1 several sand mining activities were noticed along the main river and these activities created ponding of water besides the river which have been classified as part of the river based on our classification algorithm the ponds created by sand mining activities can be clearly identified from the lulc classification map of year 2020 where forest and agricultural land were cleared for the purpose of sand mining the presence of these sand mining ponds changes occurred in lulc increased the migration area and distance of the river river morphology of r1 as shown in table 8 sand mining near the river if not properly managed can bring a negative impact to the river itself and the surrounding environment and ecosystem including shallowing the river and increasing sediment flow downstream fig 15 c displayed a meander closure along the r 2 between year 2010 and 2015 resulting a mean migration distance of 45 25 m the inlet of the river meander was found to be filled with soil possible reasons for this are due to the shortening of river or to avoid flooding over the plantation zone another high mean migration distance was detected due to plantation activities within r 4 between year 2005 2020 fig 15 d total mean migration distance of this reach from 2005 to 2020 is recorded as 80 08 m over this area ponds built along the river have been classified as the river since about 65 of the jrb is agricultural land these ponds were built to store water for irrigation purposes water from the river can flow into these ponds and support the surrounding plantation activities these ponds are located closely to the main river and have been classified as water in the lulc maps which we think could bring great impact to the river morphology changes therefore we include the area of ponds classified as the river in the analysis to show the impacts of these man made ponds to the morphology changes in addition a barrage was built at the kota tinggi town r 7 in 2017 to prevent the saline water flow to the upper stream lee binti zaharuddin 2015 and to prevent floods fig 15 e channel migration distance of 40 92 m was reported due to the change of water course and the barrage separated the river into two parts and increased the water area surrounding it the existence of the barrage could influence the biodiversity of the area impacting the fishery production due to a reduced flow of saline water sinha et al 1996 through the analysis of migration area and migration distance computed based on the river centerlines using the cmt the shape and width changes of johor river is analysed changes of the shape and width of johor river will affect the creation of the centerlines while the migration of centerlines can represent the changes of the river morphology during a specified area and period this section proved that significant morphology changes on johor river was identified where the largest changes found near the estuary of the river several locations with high migration distances were identified and proved that some human induced activities are the main causes of river morphology changes 5 discussion 5 1 lulc monitoring using gee remote sensing and geospatial technologies offer unique opportunities in mapping monitoring and quantitative analysis of land surface processes such as land degradation and deforestation and their impact on the biosphere dubovyk 2017 remote sensing has been used to classify lulc since the launch of landsat satellites in 1970 s souza filho et al 2016 although landsat data are available at every 16 day intervals frequent cloud cover especially in the tropical maritime regions like malaysia make only very few images available for producing change detection maps nevertheless compositing procedures mosaicking clear pixels from available partially cloudy images have been developed roy et al 2010 the google earth engine gee has become a popular platform for remote sensing image processing to eliminate clouds and lulc monitoring despite the gee provides comprehensive image composite method some issues are still noticeable on the composite images one of the issues is the presence of cloud shadow which could not be detected and removed based on the c function of mask cfmask algorithm used by landsat on gee to overcome this issue an improved cloud shadow filter must be developed in the near future barboza castillo et al 2020 specifically over the tropical region lulc classification in this study using gee with svm and rf classifiers showed high classification accuracy oa 0 90 and svm classifier was found advantageous on classifying narrow features as suggested by heydari and mountrakis 2018 zagajewski et al 2021 the capability of svm to classify narrow river could be due to the non linear hyperplanes theory which can successfully delineate water pixels surrounding by other lulc classes while rf which is based on the ensemble tree theory could mis group the water pixels into the other lulc classes during the voting process generally the use of gee increases the classification speed from the perspective of satellite data collection processing classification and accuracy assessment the methodology of this study can be utilized to a larger region i e state and national scale to enhance the lulc classification in terms of time and cost consumptions future study can utilize high spatial resolution remote sensing data which can improve the accuracy of lulc classification and change detection and includes the digital elevation model dem as input of slope during river centerline generation in order to enhance the quality of river morphology changes identification 5 2 lulc changes and impacts increased food production due to population growth has caused large scale forest clearance in the sea as a whole over the last 50 years maja and ayano 2021 similarly rapid growth in industrialization urbanization and aquaculture have also contributed to loss of arable lands and coastal ecosystems sejati et al 2020 extensive urbanization increases water scarcity issues which leads to the construction of dams and exploration of groundwater chen and trias 2020 impacts of lulc changes of river basins has been extensively studied and linked to climate change temperature precipitation etc and alteration of hydrological processes runoff discharge floods streamflow evapotranspiration lateral flow etc chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 getachew et al 2021 petchprayoon et al 2010 sinha et al 2020 zope et al 2017 deforestation and urbanization are two key factors that contribute to lulc changes of a river basin while the building of a reservoir or dam within a river basin has become very common in recent years behera et al 2018 li et al 2020 woldemichael et al 2012 to overcome water related issues the johor river basin is an area where tropical flora and fauna presents but population growth and urbanization have altered the lulc of the area dramatically as shown in this study the findings of this study are similar to our previous lulc study of the iskandar malaysia development region kanniah et al 2015 where loss of natural land cover forest and mangrove and gain of agricultural urban and bare soil were identified a total of 8 5 of forest loss and 0 5 of mangrove loss were identified during the study period in jrb which were converted into dams agricultural lands urban area and cleared bare soil to ensure water security for the local population and support regional singapore necessity dams were built in the jrb construction of a dam can have a strong impact on the river ecosystem where river flow regulations river channelization water abstraction are among the most influencing factors that cause river stress sabater et al 2018 the building of dams increased the areas covered by water in the study area where an increase of 4957 4 ha and 2000 ha were identified between 1990 and 1995 and 2015 2020 corresponding to the period when the linggui and the seluyut dams were built respectively besides damming building of a barrage and human exploration sand mining were also identified along the river changes of the rivers in a basin can have socio economic biodiversity hydrology and environmental impacts consequently the changes of these lulc could have caused changes in the river morphology from this study we identified the increase of water area when analyzing the main river johor river in the jrb which was mainly due to damming building of a barrage and human exploration sand mining inconsistencies in lulc change based on the intensity analysis in this study fig 7 to fig 11 clearly show the intensity of the lulc changes particularly the depletion of forests and agricultural lands for water dams and urban development within each interval at least 12 of land area was changed within jrb approximately 25 of area changes was identified on two intervals 1990 1995 and 2010 2015 the high area changes occurred between 1990 and 1995 could be due to the introduction of new development policy of the malaysia government while the development of iskandar malaysia region could be the reason for high changes occurred between year 2010 2015 the detailed analysis highlights hotspots in lulc change of bare soil 94 17 urban 68 55 forest 45 82 and mangrove 42 79 and it is useful to local stakeholders and policy makers for regulating and realizing sustainable development goals sdgs to prevent over exploration of land and resources in the area the expansion of oil palm and rubber plantation lands in the jrb over the past decades is found to correspond to the regional pattern gains and losses of bare soil were found always active over the study period indicating active forest clearance to bare soil and active transition of bare soil to urban development which is particular pattern of a rapidly developing region as it has been suggested previously this intensify lulc changes could bring severe impacts to the area including the changes of river morphology 5 3 river morphology changes based on the channel migration toolbox the area and distance changes of the johor river was detected based on the polygons and centerlines generated from the classification results higher river migration area and mean distance was identified during the period when there is higher lulc change intensity and vice versa fig 12 this finding supports our hypothesis that lulc changes can impact the river morphology in jrb changes of river morphology usually can only be detected over decades but human interference can directly induced channel adjustments surian and rinaldi 2003 recent studies concentrated on examining river morphology changes following the construction of dams li et al 2020 piqué et al 2016 and flood events magliulo and valente 2020 yousefi et al 2019 and found that these activities contribute to river morphology changes at different magnitudes due to the characteristics of the study area dingle et al 2019 concludes that tropical river characterized with higher channel migration rate then temperate however research on river morphological changes is found limited in the southeast asia from the analysis most of the migration captured in this study are human induced including mangrove degradation due to expressway construction r 12 and r 13 dam construction and sand mining activities r 1 agricultural activities r 2 and r 4 and the construction of barrage r 7 these anthropogenic activities although mainly targeted to improve humans livelihood particularly over the high populated area should be planned with a boarder perspective and according to international and local policies to prevent habitat fragmentation ecological impacts and assure water security and environmental sustainability hohensinner et al 2018 spada et al 2018 further research is required to explain the changes of the area of river over the time since these changes are mainly due to the combined effects of natural rainfall runoff drought tides etc and manmade activities sand mining aquaculture conversion etc the method introduced in this study can be developed as a toolkit to consistently investigate the migration and morphological changes of the rivers in the region 6 conclusion this study investigated the lulc changes of the johor river basin and the changes of river morphology over the period 1990 2020 based on remote sensing and gis techniques the google earth engine was applied with landsat imageries and two classifiers svm and rf were compared high classification accuracy was achieved with an overall accuracy above 90 while svm produced more detailed classification maps compared to rf with better capability to detect narrow river features increase of water and urban area based on the classification results indicate that jrb is a hotspot of urbanization with increasing water demand with the construction of two dams the main river johor river in the jrb was selected for river morphology change analysis intensity analysis on the classification results shows an average of 3 48 of jrb area underwent lulc changes annually forest urban and bare soil are the classes changing actively throughout the 30 years period activities including sand mining artificial meander closure and barrage construction were identified along the johor river and the impacts of these activities to the river migration is highlighted in this study however the impacts of these anthropogenic modifications to the ecosystem and environment are unknown a better understanding on how the lulc and river morphology changes in this river basin impacts the environment hydrological processes ecosystem services social and communities will become a critical subject to enhance and sustain future planning and management to ensure water security and
