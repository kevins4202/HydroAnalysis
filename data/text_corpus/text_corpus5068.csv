25340,the formalization of novel equations explicitly modelling the impact of extreme weather events into the crop model wofost ems existing modelling solution mms modified modelling solution is proposed as a way to reduce the uncertainty in estimations of crop yield a sensitivity analysis sa was performed to assess the effect of changing parameters values on the yield simulated by the model both ems and mms for different crops winter and durum wheat winter barley maize sunflower grown under a variety of conditions including future climate realisations in europe a two step sa was performed using global techniques the morris screening method for qualitative ranking of parameters was first used followed by the efast variance based method which attributes portions of variance in the model output to each parameter the results showed that the parameters related to the partitioning of assimilates to storage organs fotb and to the conversion efficiency of photosynthates into storage organs cvo generally affected considerably the simulated yield also underlying tight correlation with this output whereas the parameters involved with respiration rate q10 or specific leaf area sla became influential in case of unfavourable weather conditions major differences between ems and mms which includes a component simulating the impact of extreme weather events emerged in extreme cases of crop failure triggered by markedly negative minimum temperatures with few exceptions the two sa methods revealed the same parameter ranking we argue that the sa performed in this study can be useful in the design of crop modelling studies and in the implementation of crop yield forecasting systems in europe keywords climate scenarios crop parameters crop yield e fast method extreme weather events morris method sensitivity analysis wofost 1 introduction crop models mathematically represent the complex interactions between plant weather soil and agricultural practices they play an important role in understanding and quantifying the relationships or trade offs between crop management and environment on one side and cropping systems productivity on the other crop models have evolved over time increasing in complexity to meet the increasingly intricate challenges facing agriculture e g donatelli and confalonieri 2011 for instance the global carbon balance has become an issue of great societal concern in the last decades when the global emission of co2 has continued to increase together with its impact on climate ipcc 2013 this has required modelling efforts for instance to represent plant responses to co2 levels e g ethier and livingston 2004 and thus make crop models responsive to changing climate conditions asseng et al 2013 bassu et al 2014 li et al 2014 nowadays crop models are largely used to understand and anticipate the impacts of climate change on agricultural production e g ewert et al 2005 falloon and betts 2010 white et al 2011 supit et al 2012 nelson et al 2014 to support the implementation of adaptation strategies e g tingem et al 2009 fernandes et al 2012 perego et al 2014 cappelli et al 2015 and to design future crop ideotypes e g paleari et al 2017 however robust simulation models are needed for diagnosing and prognosing the impacts of environmental factors on the crop production systems and as a matter of fact some modelling studies have not been completely successful in addressing the impact of extreme weather events on crop production van der velde et al 2012 zinyengere et al 2014 extreme events such as heat waves cold shocks droughts and frost affect directly and indirectly cropping systems by altering physiology and behaviour of plants with impacts on the productivity as well as the seasonality and quality of crop production e g lesk et al 2016 moreover the additional heat that is generated from ongoing temperature rise has increased the chances for severe heat waves drought and other forms of extreme weather field et al 2012 suggestions have been put forward that most of the existing crop models need an overhaul or an update as they often fail to correctly describe how crops respond to the impact brought about by extreme weather events rötter et al 2011a formalizing the biophysical interactions between the crop and its environment has required the development of customized modelling solutions luo et al 2013 characterized by a large set of interdependent equations representing specific sub domains of the system accounting for such complex interactions has inevitably increased the number of input factors in crop models variables and parameters and the uncertainties associated with parameter values and their distributional assumptions driving variables climate soil and management and model structure e g gabrielle et al 2006 the structure of crop models is generally too complex to easily shed light on the relationship between input factors and output variables even more so the models are continuously improved with novel approaches parameter estimation in particular is a key challenge in model development in light of the crucial role in determining the quality of model predictions richter and sondgerath 1990 there is therefore a need to better understand the behaviour of crop models under a wide range of conditions also by identifying the parameters that have the greatest influence on outputs jacquez and perry 1990 brun et al 2001 haag 2006 sensitivity analysis sa is the main tool for a comprehensive evaluation of complex models e g rabitz 1989 omlin et al 2001 it assesses the changes in the model outputs due to changes in the values of input factors the latter being generated by sampling from inputs distributional range as a result sa provides a valuable method to identify properties that characterize the relationships between model outputs and input parameters and enhance the understanding of the system under study saltelli et al 2000 the distinction under specific conditions of application stearns 1992 between influential relevant and non influential parameters is generally based on sa results cariboni et al 2007 confalonieri et al 2009a by ranking model parameters based on their relevance from the most to the least important cryer and havens 1999 sa offers guidance to the design of experimental programs as well as to more efficient model development and calibration sa can be implemented either locally to examine the effect of minor variations of the parameter values on model results brun et al 2001 or globally to consider the entire range of parameter values xu and gertner 2007 confalonieri et al 2010a the latter is generally based on differential analysis through the use of taylor series e g pastres and ciavatta 2005 and monte carlo methods e g annan 2001 in particular there is a challenge in ensuring robust modelling approaches under changing climate conditions because the implicit assumption that well designed and calibrated models under current conditions will remain valid under future climate realizations can be an unrealistic one this is why the importance of improving the understanding of plant responses to the interactive effects of higher temperature and altered patterns of precipitation has been highlighted e g wang et al 2012 this study focused on the generic crop simulator wofost van diepen et al 1989 successfully used since years to reproduce growth and development of a variety of crops de wit et al 2012 boogaard et al 2013 to forecast crop yields https ec europa eu jrc en mars and within model intercomparison and ensemble studies e g todorovic et al 2008 palosuo et al 2011 bassu et al 2014 in this study we have performed a wide range of sa experiments on wofost using two versions of the model an implementation referred to as existing modelling solution ems and an improved model referred to as the modified modelling solution mms with the latter including a software component coupled to ems that explicitly takes into consideration the impacts of extreme weather events such as high and low temperatures water deficit and frost villalobos et al 2015 for both modelling solutions sa was performed for five crops at eight sites representative of contrasting conditions in europe italy spain switzerland and ukraine using two sa methods and under current and altered weather conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 wofost based modelling solutions wofost van diepen et al 1989 adopts a gross photosynthesis approach to calculate net carbon fixation explicitly considering phenological development light interception gross co2 assimilation transpiration growth and maintenance respiration crop development is reproduced as a temperature driven process optionally accounting for photoperiod instantaneous gross co2 assimilation estimated at three moments in the day for three depths into the canopy of plant leaves is computed on the basis of intercepted solar radiation and of a photosynthesis light response at leaf level light interception depends on total incoming radiation as modulated by photosynthetic leaf area and leaf angle distribution assimilates are partitioned to the various organs according to partitioning factors computed as a function of plant development stage a fraction of assimilates is allocated to roots first and then the remainder is split over the above ground organs including below ground storage organs such as tubers the emission of lai units is driven by temperature in the early stages and it depends on specific leaf area and leaf partitioned biomass later dead lai units i e leaves no more photosynthetically active are quantified as a function of self shading and senescence of old leaves the model simulates both potential and water limited production levels providing information on crop water use biomass growth and yield potential evapotranspiration is calculated via the penman equation frère and popov 1979 and water stress is represented by the ratio of actual to potential transpiration crop water use is calculated separately for crop canopy transpiration bare soil surface soil evaporation and soil surface with ponding water evaporation the capability of the standard wofost version ems was enhanced mms thanks to a dedicated component for the impact of extreme weather events villalobos et al 2015 movedi et al 2015 in particular the effects of severe cold and high temperatures frost and extreme water deficit on crop yields were accounted for by modulating the harvest index hi and lai only for frost according to stress related response functions 0 maximum reduction 1 no effect computed at a daily time step these variations are mediated by the time of occurrence of an extreme event the environmental conditions and the crop specific susceptibility the decline of crop yield can even lead to crop failure in the case of severe extreme weather conditions two development phases are identified where crops are most sensitive to weather extremes i around anthesis 1 week from anthesis with main effects on pollen viability fertilization and grain formation and ii from anthesis to physiological maturity with impacts related to rates of grain filling for temperature related damages crop temperature is estimated solving the surface energy balance equation and used the algorithms used to quantify the impact of weather extremes are fully documented in appendix a 2 2 sensitivity analysis methods the morris screening method morris 1991 as modified by campolongo et al 2007 was first applied to rank model parameters according to their influence on crop yield then the extended version efast saltelli et al 1999 of the fourier amplitude sensitivity test method fast cukier et al 1973 was applied to quantify the portion of the output variation due to changes in each parameter for the morris method the number of model runs for each sa experiment is equal to the number of trajectories r multiplied by n 1 with n being the number of parameters analysed according to confalonieri et al 2010a r was set equal to 5 the number of model runs c needed to complete a numerical experiment of sa with the efast method is equal to c n n s with n being the number of parameters and n s being the sample size we obtained the convergence of sensitivity indices with n s 330 which is above the minimum value of 128 indicated by wang et al 2013 and represents a balanced solution between computational cost and the ability to explore the full parameter space the parameters related to light interception gross photosynthesis respiration partitioning of photosynthates leaf area expansion and senescence were subject to sa phenology related parameters were not considered since they are limited in number and they are all potentially subject to local calibration confalonieri et al 2010a in wofost a high number of parameters are organized in afgen arbitrary function generator tables which describe the linear dependence of parameters dependent variables on average air temperature tavg or development stage dvs independent variables the number of pairs dvs parameter value tavg value which constitute afgen tables was reduced in order to avoid parameter distributions overlap during samples generation confalonieri 2010 considering the relatively small number of parameters investigated at most 31 all of them were analysed using both morris and the efast methods this allowed us to fully compare the results obtained with both sa methods 2 3 sensitivity analysis

scenarios the above methodology produced bias corrected daily series of surface air temperature minimum and maximum and rainfall different lengths of near past time slices correspond to the varying observational data series used for bias correction in different countries other variables needed to run the modelling solutions such as global solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were derived according to duveiller et al 2017 the beneficial effect of increasing co2 concentration on carbon assimilation rates was not considered in this study the main reason for this choice is that the study was performed within a project eu fp7 modextreme http modextreme org that targeted the wofost based platform adopted by the european commission to perform yield forecasts which in its current version does not consider the effects of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on crop productivity moreover the effect of increasing co2 concentration on carbon assimilation rates in the presence of more frequent and intense extreme weather events is still controversial this was highlighted by long et al 2006 and has been confirmed by two recent studies obermeier et al 2016 novak 2017 demonstrating that co2 fertilization effects decline or even disappear as weather becomes drier and warmer for each combination crop site nine contrasting years were considered three of them belonging to historical series and six belonging to projected weather series centred on 2050 at all sites the nine years were selected to be sufficiently contrasting in terms of coldest wettest warmest driest and average conditions as represented by yearly based agro climatic indicators peterson et al 2001 barnett et al 2006 the range of climatic conditions represented by each scenario and time slice is shown in fig 1 by means of indicators of aridity and heat wave frequency the possibility to discriminate between thermo pluviometric conditions associated with aridity b de martonne 1942 gradients in

sensitivity indices achieved by the top 10 ranked parameters across sites years and modelling solutions considered the parameter involved with partitioning to storage organs fotb100 for wheat and barley and fotb110 for maize remerged as the most influential in yield simulations and the most sensitive to variations in the conditions explored 0 06 total sensitivity index 0 59 median 0 27 conversely the simulations of sunflower yield revealed the predominance of leaf dynamics slatb000 and span versus photosynthesis related parameters the narrow range of variation of the total sensitivity index for both parameters denoted the primary role of temperature in limiting the leaf biomass conversion into leaf area at early crop stages regardless the site and year considered focusing on winter wheat simulations in the swiss sites several influential parameters were identified parameters related with life span at 35 c span partitioning to storage organs at flowering fotb100 conversion efficiency into storage organs cvo extinction coefficient for diffuse light at flowering kdiftb100 and conversion efficiency into leaves cvl are distinctly identifiable by high values of the efast total sensitivity index fig 3 and supplementary material from fig s1 to fig s3 certain balance in parameters ranking i e the model is sensitive to several parameters can be explained by the restrained meteorological variability which characterizes all the swiss sites indeed during the wheat cycle temperatures rarely exceed 30 c or drop below 8 c moreover water availability was always more than sufficient also in the years selected to represent warmest and driest conditions 650mmyear 1 evenly distributed throughout the crop cycle substantial differences between modelling solutions emerged in three years out of nine with mms determining crop failure in the coldest and wettest year at all the swiss sites due to the simulated effect of markedly negative minimum temperatures these unexpected results underline the need to further adapt the component accounting for extreme weather events which indicates very harmful impacts i e crop failure from a single day with minimum temperature below the threshold value for no damage at a time before hardening a plausible solution to limit the frequency of frost shocks from single events could be the modulation of the crop response to temperature changes also considering the number of multiple consecutive days with extreme minimum temperature over the critical period i e before hardening barlow et al 2015 the simulation of winter wheat in mediterranean countries italy supplementary material fig s4 spain supplementary material fig s5 provided quite different results with few exceptions fotb100 was indicated as the most influential in spain the parameter related with the relative increase in respiration rate per 10 c q10 had the highest total sensitivity index in the warmest and driest growing seasons in these years due to high average temperatures and water scarcity respiration rates are the factors that most affected crop growth and production tester and langridge 2010 in the other years characterized by high amounts of rainfall and low average temperatures cvo was instead the most influential in these cases the sub optimal conditions led to a decrease in the partitioning to storage organs daniel and triboi 2002 and made cvo assuming the highest relevance also in the ukrainian site cvo achieved high total sensitivity indices with the exception of the years referring to the baseline time frame i e 2004 2005 2007 supplementary material fig s6 for these years the parameter accounting for light use efficiency of single leaves at 10 c efftb010 emerged as the most influential indeed the conditions for growing wheat in this country are less favourable owing to low levels of solar radiation moreover for this site the component accounting for extreme weather events determined crop failure in several years due to low minimum temperatures in winter till 25 c in a recent study ma et al 2013 established through the same sensitivity analysis technique that amaxtb130 span and cvo are the most influential parameters when simulating winter wheat with wofost in the hebei province of china these information were profitably used by huang et al 2015 2016 to calibrate wofost for the simulation of winter wheat in the same location and to identify the parameters to being re initialized or re calibrated to include in wofost remotely sensed data the specific explored pedoclimatic conditions and the diverse varieties and crop management simulated led to different rankings among the parameters in the two studies underlying the importance of performing sensitivity analyses before running models in a given operative context herein the subset of wofost parameters to focus on was established according to the findings from previous studies carried out in european environments van diepen et al 1988 marletto et al 2005 priesack et al 2006 richter et al 2010 biernath et al 2011 rötter et al 2011a b stella et al 2014 while the limited number of points used in the afgen tables e g amaxtb 100 and 130 were not considered aimed at reducing possible overlaps between the distributions assigned to parameters the ranking of parameters for maize simulations in switzerland was the same at each site supplementary material from fig s7 to fig s10 the high values of the total sensitivity index associated with the parameter related with partitioning to storage organs right after flowering fotb110 underlined the key role of this parameter in simulating maize yield this was not the case for maize simulations performed in ukraine under the warmest and driest climate conditions where yields were mostly influenced by specific leaf area at emergence slatb000 supplementary material fig s11 these years were characterized by a scarcity of water supply if compared with the others on average 360mm against 832mm this condition limited maize growth and made the simulation mostly influenced by the parameters related with the simulation of the early crop establishment subedi and ma 2009 rather than by those related with crop productivity at full canopy the same rationale can be applied to the results achieved with sunflower simulation in spain cordoba site supplementary material fig s12 slatb000 achieved the highest total sensitivity indices up to three times higher than the second ranked parameter in all selected years and with both modelling solutions in this case sunflower production was limited by high temperatures which caused a reduction in the co2 assimilation rate this made slatb000 the most influential parameter for sunflower yield simulation the primary role of high temperatures in limiting crop growth and productivity is further underlined by the results achieved for the parameter span i e life span of leaves growing at 35 c which denoted a higher value of total sensitivity index with the mms rather than with the ems the results of winter barley simulations in spain granada site supplementary material fig s13 identified fotb100 extinction coefficient for diffuse light at flowering kdiftb100 and q10 as the most influential parameters only in the coldest and wettest year of the baseline time frame i e 1996 the parameters ranking was slightly different a reduction in the total sensitivity index achieved by fotb100 was counterbalanced by an increased total sensitivity index for cvo for this year indeed the high amount of rainfall and the low average temperatures determined a limited influence of the partitioning to storage organs in the simulation of crop yield as already discussed for winter wheat simulations in spain which was mostly influenced by cvo 3 2 comparison between sensitivity analysis methods the results obtained with the sa methods of morris and efast were compared fig 4 and 5 and supplementary material from fig s14 to fig s25 in terms of how they ranked parameters in particular the savage scores savage 1956 eq 1 were used to compare the parameters sensitivity metrics achieved with the two methods thus emphasising the ranking of the most influential parameters 1 s v k n i k n 1 i where svk n is the savage score for the k ranked parameter of a set of n parameters for the efast method the savage scores were computed considering the total sensitivity index whereas for the morris method we focused on μ which provides an indication of the overall influence of each parameter on the output the two methods provided similar parameter rankings being the linear regression between savage scores calculated for the two methods significant p 0 001 with r2 ranging from 0 61 to 0 98 considering all the values furthermore the ranking calculated based on the two methods for each combination crop site was the same for the two modelling solutions ems fig 4a mms fig 4b major differences between the two modelling solutions arose when the component simulating the impact of extreme weather events determined crop failure in these cases the correlation between parameter rankings was higher for the mms an example is provided by winter wheat simulations in the ukrainian site fig 5 where the complete yield losses in the coldest years were explained solely by variations in parameters involved with the effect of extreme negative temperatures on hi all other parameters were not relevant in the same years results achieved for ems led to major discrepancies in the ranking of model parameters fig 5a meaning that several parameters related to yield formation played a key role in explaining yield responses at suboptimal temperature for growth 4 conclusions the results of this sensitivity study increase the knowledge about the behaviour of the crop model wofost in the simulation of the yield of different crops across several european sites under current conditions and projected scenarios of climate change the simulated crop yield was mostly influenced by parameters related with storage organs indeed although with some exceptions the parameters involved in partitioning to storage organs around flowering fotb100 fotb110 and conversion efficiency into storage organs cvo had the highest total sensitivity indices nevertheless for sunflower simulations in spain and maize in ukraine results were mainly influenced by specific leaf area at emergence slatb000 underlying the importance of early crop establishment in case of sub optimal growth conditions some differences were observed between the results obtained for the two modelling solutions assessed in this study i e ems and mms in terms of both total sensitivity metrics and parameters ranking especially when the simulated impact of extreme weather events determined crop failure the two sa methods i e morris and efast provided similar parameters rankings this confirms the usefulness of the morris method which is less demanding in terms of computational time for identifying the most influential parameters and its suitability for screening purposes before the application of variance based methods computationally expensive in 2 step sa designs these results also indicate the need to further improve the component simulating the impacts of extreme weather events owing to its tendency to sometimes overestimate the impact of weather extremes the sa experiments led to identify the most influential parameters for the simulation of several crops across european sites spreading useful information to achieve the best trade off between parameterization effort and reliability of model estimates the coupling of the wofost model with the component simulating the impacts of extreme weather events and its application under climate change scenarios lays the basis to improve the in season crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting capabilities at eu level in the short and medium term indeed the crop yield forecasting system of the european commission lacks a dedicated module to consider the effects of climatic shocks or extreme events on yield formation this limit could even be exacerbated in the near future due to the likely increase in the frequency of climatic extremes due to climate change eea 2017 the development of an early forecasting and warning system more adherent to real conditions can thus be a valuable support to multiple stakeholders of the agricultural sector in ensuring citizens health protection crop needs and environment preservation according to local priorities and national european regulations as noted details about the effect of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration go beyond the aim of this study however as a natural evolution of what has already been presented dedicated routines can be arranged and implemented with the purpose of testing co2 effects within the european commission crop growth monitoring system

temperature as driven by mean crop temperature and water stress is calculated using the following equation 2 f 1 d a y i d a y m i n f t f w where f is the response function to crop temperature and water stress ft is the response function to average crop temperature fw is response function to extreme water stress in addition the effect of frost function of minimum crop temperature and extreme

25340,the formalization of novel equations explicitly modelling the impact of extreme weather events into the crop model wofost ems existing modelling solution mms modified modelling solution is proposed as a way to reduce the uncertainty in estimations of crop yield a sensitivity analysis sa was performed to assess the effect of changing parameters values on the yield simulated by the model both ems and mms for different crops winter and durum wheat winter barley maize sunflower grown under a variety of conditions including future climate realisations in europe a two step sa was performed using global techniques the morris screening method for qualitative ranking of parameters was first used followed by the efast variance based method which attributes portions of variance in the model output to each parameter the results showed that the parameters related to the partitioning of assimilates to storage organs fotb and to the conversion efficiency of photosynthates into storage organs cvo generally affected considerably the simulated yield also underlying tight correlation with this output whereas the parameters involved with respiration rate q10 or specific leaf area sla became influential in case of unfavourable weather conditions major differences between ems and mms which includes a component simulating the impact of extreme weather events emerged in extreme cases of crop failure triggered by markedly negative minimum temperatures with few exceptions the two sa methods revealed the same parameter ranking we argue that the sa performed in this study can be useful in the design of crop modelling studies and in the implementation of crop yield forecasting systems in europe keywords climate scenarios crop parameters crop yield e fast method extreme weather events morris method sensitivity analysis wofost 1 introduction crop models mathematically represent the complex interactions between plant weather soil and agricultural practices they play an important role in understanding and quantifying the relationships or trade offs between crop management and environment on one side and cropping systems productivity on the other crop models have evolved over time increasing in complexity to meet the increasingly intricate challenges facing agriculture e g donatelli and confalonieri 2011 for instance the global carbon balance has become an issue of great societal concern in the last decades when the global emission of co2 has continued to increase together with its impact on climate ipcc 2013 this has required modelling efforts for instance to represent plant responses to co2 levels e g ethier and livingston 2004 and thus make crop models responsive to changing climate conditions asseng et al 2013 bassu et al 2014 li et al 2014 nowadays crop models are largely used to understand and anticipate the impacts of climate change on agricultural production e g ewert et al 2005 falloon and betts 2010 white et al 2011 supit et al 2012 nelson et al 2014 to support the implementation of adaptation strategies e g tingem et al 2009 fernandes et al 2012 perego et al 2014 cappelli et al 2015 and to design future crop ideotypes e g paleari et al 2017 however robust simulation models are needed for diagnosing and prognosing the impacts of environmental factors on the crop production systems and as a matter of fact some modelling studies have not been completely successful in addressing the impact of extreme weather events on crop production van der velde et al 2012 zinyengere et al 2014 extreme events such as heat waves cold shocks droughts and frost affect directly and indirectly cropping systems by altering physiology and behaviour of plants with impacts on the productivity as well as the seasonality and quality of crop production e g lesk et al 2016 moreover the additional heat that is generated from ongoing temperature rise has increased the chances for severe heat waves drought and other forms of extreme weather field et al 2012 suggestions have been put forward that most of the existing crop models need an overhaul or an update as they often fail to correctly describe how crops respond to the impact brought about by extreme weather events rötter et al 2011a formalizing the biophysical interactions between the crop and its environment has required the development of customized modelling solutions luo et al 2013 characterized by a large set of interdependent equations representing specific sub domains of the system accounting for such complex interactions has inevitably increased the number of input factors in crop models variables and parameters and the uncertainties associated with parameter values and their distributional assumptions driving variables climate soil and management and model structure e g gabrielle et al 2006 the structure of crop models is generally too complex to easily shed light on the relationship between input factors and output variables even more so the models are continuously improved with novel approaches parameter estimation in particular is a key challenge in model development in light of the crucial role in determining the quality of model predictions richter and sondgerath 1990 there is therefore a need to better understand the behaviour of crop models under a wide range of conditions also by identifying the parameters that have the greatest influence on outputs jacquez and perry 1990 brun et al 2001 haag 2006 sensitivity analysis sa is the main tool for a comprehensive evaluation of complex models e g rabitz 1989 omlin et al 2001 it assesses the changes in the model outputs due to changes in the values of input factors the latter being generated by sampling from inputs distributional range as a result sa provides a valuable method to identify properties that characterize the relationships between model outputs and input parameters and enhance the understanding of the system under study saltelli et al 2000 the distinction under specific conditions of application stearns 1992 between influential relevant and non influential parameters is generally based on sa results cariboni et al 2007 confalonieri et al 2009a by ranking model parameters based on their relevance from the most to the least important cryer and havens 1999 sa offers guidance to the design of experimental programs as well as to more efficient model development and calibration sa can be implemented either locally to examine the effect of minor variations of the parameter values on model results brun et al 2001 or globally to consider the entire range of parameter values xu and gertner 2007 confalonieri et al 2010a the latter is generally based on differential analysis through the use of taylor series e g pastres and ciavatta 2005 and monte carlo methods e g annan 2001 in particular there is a challenge in ensuring robust modelling approaches under changing climate conditions because the implicit assumption that well designed and calibrated models under current conditions will remain valid under future climate realizations can be an unrealistic one this is why the importance of improving the understanding of plant responses to the interactive effects of higher temperature and altered patterns of precipitation has been highlighted e g wang et al 2012 this study focused on the generic crop simulator wofost van diepen et al 1989 successfully used since years to reproduce growth and development of a variety of crops de wit et al 2012 boogaard et al 2013 to forecast crop yields https ec europa eu jrc en mars and within model intercomparison and ensemble studies e g todorovic et al 2008 palosuo et al 2011 bassu et al 2014 in this study we have performed a wide range of sa experiments on wofost using two versions of the model an implementation referred to as existing modelling solution ems and an improved model referred to as the modified modelling solution mms with the latter including a software component coupled to ems that explicitly takes into consideration the impacts of extreme weather events such as high and low temperatures water deficit and frost villalobos et al 2015 for both modelling solutions sa was performed for five crops at eight sites representative of contrasting conditions in europe italy spain switzerland and ukraine using two sa methods and under current and altered weather conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 wofost based modelling solutions wofost van diepen et al 1989 adopts a gross photosynthesis approach to calculate net carbon fixation explicitly considering phenological development light interception gross co2 assimilation transpiration growth and maintenance respiration crop development is reproduced as a temperature driven process optionally accounting for photoperiod instantaneous gross co2 assimilation estimated at three moments in the day for three depths into the canopy of plant leaves is computed on the basis of intercepted solar radiation and of a photosynthesis light response at leaf level light interception depends on total incoming radiation as modulated by photosynthetic leaf area and leaf angle distribution assimilates are partitioned to the various organs according to partitioning factors computed as a function of plant development stage a fraction of assimilates is allocated to roots first and then the remainder is split over the above ground organs including below ground storage organs such as tubers the emission of lai units is driven by temperature in the early stages and it depends on specific leaf area and leaf partitioned biomass later dead lai units i e leaves no more photosynthetically active are quantified as a function of self shading and senescence of old leaves the model simulates both potential and water limited production levels providing information on crop water use biomass growth and yield potential evapotranspiration is calculated via the penman equation frère and popov 1979 and water stress is represented by the ratio of actual to potential transpiration crop water use is calculated separately for crop canopy transpiration bare soil surface soil evaporation and soil surface with ponding water evaporation the capability of the standard wofost version ems was enhanced mms thanks to a dedicated component for the impact of extreme weather events villalobos et al 2015 movedi et al 2015 in particular the effects of severe cold and high temperatures frost and extreme water deficit on crop yields were accounted for by modulating the harvest index hi and lai only for frost according to stress related response functions 0 maximum reduction 1 no effect computed at a daily time step these variations are mediated by the time of occurrence of an extreme event the environmental conditions and the crop specific susceptibility the decline of crop yield can even lead to crop failure in the case of severe extreme weather conditions two development phases are identified where crops are most sensitive to weather extremes i around anthesis 1 week from anthesis with main effects on pollen viability fertilization and grain formation and ii from anthesis to physiological maturity with impacts related to rates of grain filling for temperature related damages crop temperature is estimated solving the surface energy balance equation and used the algorithms used to quantify the impact of weather extremes are fully documented in appendix a 2 2 sensitivity analysis methods the morris screening method morris 1991 as modified by campolongo et al 2007 was first applied to rank model parameters according to their influence on crop yield then the extended version efast saltelli et al 1999 of the fourier amplitude sensitivity test method fast cukier et al 1973 was applied to quantify the portion of the output variation due to changes in each parameter for the morris method the number of model runs for each sa experiment is equal to the number of trajectories r multiplied by n 1 with n being the number of parameters analysed according to confalonieri et al 2010a r was set equal to 5 the number of model runs c needed to complete a numerical experiment of sa with the efast method is equal to c n n s with n being the number of parameters and n s being the sample size we obtained the convergence of sensitivity indices with n s 330 which is above the minimum value of 128 indicated by wang et al 2013 and represents a balanced solution between computational cost and the ability to explore the full parameter space the parameters related to light interception gross photosynthesis respiration partitioning of photosynthates leaf area expansion and senescence were subject to sa phenology related parameters were not considered since they are limited in number and they are all potentially subject to local calibration confalonieri et al 2010a in wofost a high number of parameters are organized in afgen arbitrary function generator tables which describe the linear dependence of parameters dependent variables on average air temperature tavg or development stage dvs independent variables the number of pairs dvs parameter value tavg value which constitute afgen tables was reduced in order to avoid parameter distributions overlap during samples generation confalonieri 2010 considering the relatively small number of parameters investigated at most 31 all of them were analysed using both morris and the efast methods this allowed us to fully compare the results obtained with both sa methods 2 3 sensitivity analysis

scenarios the above methodology produced bias corrected daily series of surface air temperature minimum and maximum and rainfall different lengths of near past time slices correspond to the varying observational data series used for bias correction in different countries other variables needed to run the modelling solutions such as global solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were derived according to duveiller et al 2017 the beneficial effect of increasing co2 concentration on carbon assimilation rates was not considered in this study the main reason for this choice is that the study was performed within a project eu fp7 modextreme http modextreme org that targeted the wofost based platform adopted by the european commission to perform yield forecasts which in its current version does not consider the effects of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration on crop productivity moreover the effect of increasing co2 concentration on carbon assimilation rates in the presence of more frequent and intense extreme weather events is still controversial this was highlighted by long et al 2006 and has been confirmed by two recent studies obermeier et al 2016 novak 2017 demonstrating that co2 fertilization effects decline or even disappear as weather becomes drier and warmer for each combination crop site nine contrasting years were considered three of them belonging to historical series and six belonging to projected weather series centred on 2050 at all sites the nine years were selected to be sufficiently contrasting in terms of coldest wettest warmest driest

conversely the simulations of sunflower yield revealed the predominance of leaf dynamics slatb000 and span versus photosynthesis related parameters the narrow range of variation of the total sensitivity index for both parameters denoted the primary role of temperature in limiting the leaf biomass conversion into leaf area at early crop stages regardless the site and year considered focusing on winter wheat simulations in the swiss sites several influential parameters were identified parameters related with life span at 35 c span partitioning to storage organs at flowering fotb100 conversion efficiency into storage organs cvo extinction coefficient for diffuse light at flowering kdiftb100 and conversion efficiency into leaves cvl are distinctly identifiable by high values of the efast total sensitivity index fig 3 and supplementary material from fig s1 to fig s3 certain balance in parameters ranking i e the model is sensitive to several parameters can be explained by the restrained meteorological variability which characterizes all the swiss sites indeed during the wheat cycle temperatures rarely exceed 30 c or drop below 8 c moreover water availability was always more than sufficient also in the years selected to represent warmest and driest conditions 650mmyear 1 evenly distributed throughout the crop cycle substantial differences between modelling solutions emerged in three years out of nine with mms determining crop failure in the coldest and wettest year at all the swiss sites due to the simulated effect of markedly negative minimum temperatures these unexpected results underline the need to further adapt the component accounting for extreme weather events which indicates very harmful impacts i e crop failure from a single day with minimum temperature below the threshold value for no damage at a time before hardening a plausible solution to limit the frequency of frost shocks from single events could be the modulation of the crop response to temperature changes also considering the number of multiple consecutive days with extreme minimum temperature over the critical period i e before hardening barlow et al 2015 the simulation of winter wheat in mediterranean countries italy supplementary material fig s4 spain supplementary material fig s5 provided quite different results with few exceptions fotb100 was indicated as the most influential in spain the parameter related with the relative increase in respiration rate per 10 c q10 had the highest total sensitivity index in the warmest and driest growing seasons in these years due to high average temperatures and water scarcity respiration rates are the factors that most affected crop growth and production tester and langridge 2010 in the other years characterized by high amounts of rainfall and low average temperatures cvo was instead the most influential in these cases the sub optimal conditions led to a decrease in the partitioning to storage organs daniel and triboi 2002 and made cvo assuming the highest relevance also in the ukrainian site cvo achieved high total sensitivity indices with the exception of the years referring to the baseline time frame i e 2004 2005 2007 supplementary material fig s6 for these years the parameter accounting for light use efficiency of single leaves at 10 c efftb010 emerged as the most influential indeed the conditions for growing wheat in this country are less favourable owing to low levels of solar radiation moreover for this site the component accounting for extreme weather events determined crop failure in several years due to low minimum temperatures in winter till 25 c in a recent study ma et al 2013 established through the same sensitivity analysis technique that amaxtb130 span and cvo are the most influential parameters when simulating winter wheat with wofost in the hebei province of china these information were profitably used by huang et al 2015 2016 to calibrate wofost for the simulation of winter wheat in the same location and to identify the parameters to being re initialized or re calibrated to include in wofost remotely sensed data the specific explored pedoclimatic conditions and the diverse varieties and crop management simulated led to different rankings among the parameters in the two studies underlying the importance of performing sensitivity analyses before running models in a given operative context herein the subset of wofost parameters to focus on was established according to the findings from previous studies carried out in european environments van diepen et al 1988 marletto et al 2005 priesack et al 2006 richter et al 2010 biernath et al 2011 rötter et al 2011a b stella et al 2014 while the limited number of points used in the afgen tables e g amaxtb 100 and 130 were not considered aimed at reducing possible overlaps between the distributions assigned to parameters the ranking of parameters for maize simulations in switzerland was the same at each site supplementary material from fig s7 to fig s10 the high values of the total sensitivity index associated with the parameter related with partitioning to storage organs right after flowering fotb110 underlined the key role of this parameter in simulating maize yield this was not the case for maize simulations performed in ukraine under the warmest and driest climate conditions where yields were mostly influenced by specific leaf area at emergence slatb000 supplementary material fig s11 these years were characterized by a scarcity of water supply if compared with the others on average 360mm against 832mm this condition limited maize growth and made the simulation mostly influenced by the parameters related with the simulation of the early crop establishment subedi and ma 2009 rather than by those related with crop productivity at full canopy the same rationale can be applied to the results achieved with sunflower simulation in spain cordoba site supplementary material fig s12 slatb000 achieved the highest total sensitivity indices up to three times higher than the second ranked parameter in all selected years and with both modelling solutions in this case sunflower production was limited by high temperatures which caused a reduction in the co2 assimilation rate this made slatb000 the most influential parameter for sunflower yield simulation the primary role of high temperatures in limiting crop growth and productivity is further underlined by the results achieved for the parameter span i e life span of leaves growing at 35 c which denoted a higher value of total sensitivity index with the mms rather than with the ems the results of winter barley simulations in spain granada site supplementary material fig s13 identified fotb100 extinction coefficient for diffuse light at flowering kdiftb100 and q10 as the most influential parameters only in the coldest and wettest year of the baseline time frame i e 1996 the parameters ranking was slightly different a reduction in the total sensitivity index achieved by fotb100 was counterbalanced by an increased total sensitivity index for cvo for this year indeed the high amount of rainfall and the low average temperatures determined a limited influence of the partitioning to storage organs in the simulation of crop yield as already discussed for winter wheat simulations in spain which was mostly influenced by cvo 3 2 comparison between sensitivity analysis methods the results obtained with the sa methods of morris and efast were compared fig 4 and 5 and supplementary material from fig s14 to fig s25 in terms of how they ranked parameters in particular the savage scores savage 1956 eq 1 were used to compare the parameters sensitivity metrics achieved with the two methods thus emphasising the ranking of the most influential parameters 1 s v k n i k n 1 i where svk n is the savage score for the k ranked parameter of a set of n parameters for the efast method the savage scores were computed considering the total sensitivity index whereas for the morris method we focused on μ which provides an indication of the overall influence of each parameter on the output the two methods provided similar parameter rankings being the linear regression between savage scores calculated for the two methods significant p 0 001 with r2 ranging from 0 61 to 0 98 considering all the values furthermore the ranking calculated based on the two methods for each combination crop site was the same for the two modelling solutions ems fig 4a mms fig 4b major differences between the two modelling solutions arose when the component simulating the impact of extreme weather events determined crop failure in these cases the correlation between parameter rankings was higher for the mms an example is provided by winter wheat simulations in the ukrainian site fig 5 where the complete yield losses in the coldest years were explained solely by variations in parameters involved with the effect of extreme negative temperatures on hi all other parameters were not relevant in the same years results achieved for ems led to major discrepancies in the ranking of model parameters fig 5a meaning that several parameters related to yield formation played a key role in explaining yield responses at suboptimal temperature for growth 4 conclusions the results of this sensitivity study increase the knowledge about the behaviour of the crop model wofost in the simulation of the yield of different crops across several european sites under current conditions and projected scenarios of climate change the simulated crop yield was mostly influenced by parameters related with storage organs indeed although with some exceptions the parameters involved in partitioning to storage organs around flowering fotb100 fotb110 and conversion efficiency into storage organs cvo had the highest total sensitivity indices nevertheless for sunflower simulations in spain and maize in ukraine results were mainly influenced by specific leaf area at emergence slatb000 underlying the importance of early crop establishment in case of sub optimal growth conditions some differences were observed between the results obtained for the two modelling solutions assessed in this study i e ems and mms in terms of both total sensitivity metrics and parameters ranking especially when the simulated impact of extreme weather events determined crop failure the two sa methods i e morris and efast provided similar parameters rankings this confirms the usefulness of the morris method which is less demanding in terms of computational time for identifying the most influential parameters and its suitability for screening purposes before the application of variance based methods computationally expensive in 2 step sa designs these results also indicate the need to further improve the component simulating the impacts of extreme weather events owing to its tendency to sometimes overestimate the impact of weather extremes the sa experiments led to identify the most influential parameters for the simulation of several crops across european sites spreading useful information to achieve the best trade off between parameterization effort and reliability of model estimates the coupling of the wofost model with the component simulating the impacts of extreme weather events and its application under climate change scenarios lays the basis to improve the in season crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting capabilities at eu level in the short and medium term indeed the crop yield forecasting system of the european commission lacks a dedicated module to consider the effects of climatic shocks or extreme events on yield formation this limit could even be exacerbated in the near future due to the likely increase in the frequency of climatic extremes due to climate change eea 2017 the development of an early forecasting and warning system more adherent to real conditions can thus be a valuable support to multiple stakeholders of the agricultural sector in ensuring citizens health protection crop needs and environment preservation according to local priorities and national european regulations as noted details about the effect of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration go beyond the aim of this study however as a natural evolution of what has already been presented dedicated routines can be arranged and implemented with the purpose of testing co2 effects within the european commission crop growth monitoring system

hydrometeorology appendix a key processes and modelling approaches for the impact of extreme events general framework for each day around anthesis the overall value of the response function to temperature as driven by mean crop temperature and water stress is calculated using the following equation 2 f 1 d a y i d a y m i n f t f w where f is the response function to crop temperature and water stress ft is the response function to average crop temperature fw is response function to extreme water stress in addition the effect of frost function of minimum crop temperature and extreme heat function of maximum crop temperature are computed as 3 f a f 1 d a y m i n f f f h where fa is overall response function to stresses ff is the response function to frost fh is the response function to extreme heat then the actual maximum hi that might be attained after anthesis is completed hiaa is computed as 4 h i a a f a h i m a x where hi max is the potential hi for the specific species from anthesis to maturity the component assumes that the hi increases linearly from zero to hiaa so the final hi is computed according to eq 5 5 h i h i a a d p a t where hi is the final hi

calculated according to eq 6 6 h i h i a a 1 f a t 1 d p a f a response to extreme water stress the extreme water stress can be expressed as the cumulative reduction in transpiration since transpiration becomes limited this limitation starts when the water content in the soil is equivalent to the concept of allowable depletion eq 7 which is the fraction of plant available water that can be extracted by the crop without negative effects on transpiration assimilation or growth 7 a d 0 04 a d 5 5 e t 0 where ad mm is the allowable depletion 0 1 ad 0 8 ad5 is a crop specific parameter

simulation of the crop response to frost is described using two distinct equations accounting for the impacts on harvest index ff1 eq 12 and lai ff2 as 12 f f 1 0 t m i n t 100 t m i n t 100 t 0 t 100

25341,there has been a growing interest on the study of the human ecosystems sustainability from an integrated point of view the recognition of sustainability as a complex long term problem has led to the development of tools that address it from a multidisciplinary perspective several mathematical models have been developed to support the understanding of the interactions between human activities and natural resources and the effect of economic and social issues on the sustainability of such ecosystems however only a few of them have considered these aspects holistically even more critical social aspects such as uneven distribution of goods and services have not been addressed developed countries have a larger pool of resources when facing environmental and social issues than developing countries along with larger resilience to external threats being able to rely on scientific and technological advances against poverty and inequity therefore these developed societies are socially fairer and more capable to become sustainable this work presents an integrated ecological economical social model which includes a crucial social aspect in the sustainability study such is inequity having two sectors of a population with different economic distribution values these two populations interact directly with each other representing a stratified society as an attempt to conceptually describe a real world human ecosystem where goods and natural resources are not evenly distributed also the system is under the influence of uncertain external instabilities due to the inclusion of real data series captured in the model by stochastic processes incorporated in demographic variables four typical kinds of societies with different levels of development and inequity were analyzed over the sixty percent of the times simulations led to a system collapse being the probability of collapse directly related to the inequity results suggest that societies with unevenly distributed economies are less sustainable than more equalitarian societies proving that economic equality is an important factor to consider in sustainability studies additionally a typical pattern for per capita wages was found in those cases where the system collapsed similar from a macroeconomic behavior in real world economies under economic crisis keywords sustainability social inequity economic distribution 1 sustainability under economic inequality the interest in the study of sustainability has increased considerably arising from the growing recognition that the current level of human activity damages significantly the environmental system that supports us and may eventually lead to ecosystem extinction and economic social collapse based on the principle everything that we need for our survival and well being depends either directly or indirectly on our natural environment national research council 2011 sustainability has emerged as a new multidisciplinary science field for analysis and evaluation of all ecosystems components and human development in an integrated way the main goal is usually searching for the creation and maintenance of the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony making this topic operationally and conceptually one of the most complex issues that modern science has faced cabezas and fath 2002 sustainability is commonly associated with sustainable development which is defined as the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs world commission on environment and development 1987 this is a very general definition that leads to different interpretations depending on the field of analysis for example in politics it leads a search for social justice and equity prugh et al 1999 in economy for non decreasing utilities pezzey 2004 in biology for maintaining the biotic levels aarts and nienhuis 1999 and in engineering for energetic efficiency and waste reduction sikdar et al 2004 it becomes evident that sustainability does not comprise a single goal or concept rather it involves the integration of many time interrelated dimensions and issues where disturbances or imbalances in any one have an impact on all hence sustainability is not a scalar value or a goal rather is a path through time whitmore et al 2006 as is shown in fig 1 as long as the system remains inside a balanced conceptual hyper tunnel it will be sustainable the system might also be able to temporarily get out in a self correcting unsustainable regime or if the deviation is large go into a collapsed unsustainable regime the collapse of a society can be understood as a catastrophic scenario due to the combination of diverse factors as quick population decline economic crisis and social deterioration up to the point that those factors make the existence of such society impossible and unsustainable this undesirable scenario is derived from a complex and usually not well known variety of factors environmental social cultural health economic or technological therefore sustainability relies largely on human ecosystems being able to withstand the increasing external uncertainties and perturbations xu et al 2015 in this context the concept of resilience becomes a key to sustainability resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to avoid catastrophic scenarios absorbing disturbances either economic social or environmental responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function identity and structure and maintaining the capacity for adaptation learning and transformation intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 hence a resilient human ecosystem is capable of achieving a dynamic stability that allows it to continue existing and provide essential services required by society therefore the study of sustainability requires at least a basic understanding of the relationship between production processes ecosystems and economies most of the efforts on the study of this research area have been directed to analyze the sustainability of real systems see for example the reviews made by liboni et al 2017 and liu et al 2007 such approaches are not predictive they can determine whether a system is moving through or away from sustainability only until the most recent data point the use of dynamic mathematical models featuring the critical components of a real ecosystem is a complementary approach that may help to understand the basic relationships that a formal study of sustainability requires there are many ecological models developed to understand and manage human impacts on specific ecological systems these formulations include different representative features of real ecosystems and their interaction such as the evaluation of the various environmental services in an ecosystem as a decision making tool heal 2000 or integrated approaches to represent complex ecological economic frameworks see van den bergh 1996 and conrad 2002 a more detailed and comprehensive review of these works can be found in whitmore et al 2006 these models generally have very high data requirements for the estimation of their parameters the use of compartmental models is an approach to study the evolution over time of ecological systems in a simplified way the approach consists of identifying a finite number of components that differ among each other by their dynamic behavior these components are called compartments and represent an amount of matter that is physically or theoretically delimited from the rest of the system the interconnection among the compartments is usually modeled through a system of differential equations being common the use of lotka volterra differential equations lotka 1925 volterra 1926 those equations are nonlinear first order equations that are used to describe the mass interactions among different species that interact to each other in similar way as a prey predator interaction for two species the system is defined by eqs 1 and 2 1 d x d t α x β y x 2 d y d t γ y δ x y where x is the number of elements from one species prey and y is the number of its predators dy dt and dx dt represents the growth of both populations at time t α is the natural growth factor of prey δ is the natural rate of death of predators whereas β and γ represent the interactions between both species that is β and γ represents how many prey die because of the predators and how many predators grow due to the consumption of prey using this approach cabezas et al 2007 have developed a compartmental model of sustainability in several stages to represent a conceptual ecosystem the model has been built in several stages at first the model was entirely ecological distributing compartments in four trophic levels plants herbivores carnivores and omnivores including also a nutrient pool fath et al 2003 in a second stage they included human activity aspects by categorizing the compartments into non domesticated and domesticated agricultural and livestock industries cabezas et al 2005a and the inclusion of a simple industrial process creating a new compartment cabezas et al 2005b then economic and social dimensions were included through product prices and labor those factors govern the domesticated compartment flows of the model cabezas et al 2007 and add political issues such as discharges fees shastri et al 2008 finally an energy component was incorporated such component involves an industry for energy production as well as a new pool which can also incorporate bioenergy production kotecha et al 2013 most of these models focus on the sustainability from an ecological point of view and to a lesser extent in an economic one leaving aside the social related issues but since sustainability is ultimately about human well being the social aspect must also be considered in general social inequity and sustainability are closely connected in a world with finite resources justice in distribution is a central theme to address when considering not only long term economic and social sustainability but also ecological sustainability martins 2015 therefore economic equality or a fair wealth distribution is along with health and education factors the most important features for life quality and therefore for social sustainability united nations development programme 2011 motesharrei et al 2014 have conceptually shown that societies under a strong economic stratification are more likely to collapse than societies with equal distributions of economic and ecological resources most of the models reported in the literature follow a deterministic approach however ecosystems are often subject to external influences and the estimation of their parameters generally implies a high degree of complexity such as those parameters involved in economic goods biological interactions or demographic rates in fact time dependent uncertainties are always present in these systems which can change significantly the system performance thus the exclusion of uncertainty could lead to non realistic solutions uncertainties can be incorporated into a formulation by using stochastic processes such as ito processes ito 1974 ito processes are represented by stochastic differential equations sde in which the increment of the state variable consists of two parts a deterministic term and a wiener process a wiener process also called brownian motion is the continuous limit of a random walk it consists of a sequence of random steps where the current value of a variable is composed of the past value plus an error term with zero mean and a variance that increases linearly with the time step ito 1974 these stochastic processes are mainly used in financial analysis however the scope of their application can be considerably extended andrew 1988 as in batch distillation rico ramirez et al 2003 in thermodynamic processes ulas and diwekar 2004 in estimating the optimal dose of drugs ulas and diwekar 2010 in crystallization processes yenkie and diwekar 2013 or batch biodiesel production benavides and diwekar 2013a b in this work we present an enhanced ecological economic social model based on the model presented by whitmore et al 2006 additional concepts are taken from the model by kotecha et al 2013 such as the compartment for energy production our model extends both of those approaches by proposing the incorporation of social inequity as a key concept in social sustainability this concept is incorporated by splitting the model into two human compartments in order to represent the differences in income demand and consumption levels further external influences are incorporated through ito processes on demographic parameters these additions aim to analyze how these factors conceptually affect the sustainability of the ecosystems 2 the stochastic stratified population model first the model is enhanced by including a variety of simplified sustainability indicators used to understand and assess the sustainable performance of a system then the model is also improved to represent a very simplified social stratification splitting the human sector into two strata 4 typical real world societies are analyzed as cases of study hence an inequity index has been defined and used to have a correct representation of such typical societies further real time series of mortality and natality are used to introduce into the model the uncertain real world trends of demography through stochastic processes only mortality and birth rates are assumed as stochastic processes because given the limitations of the model for practical purposes they are the only parameters for which real historical data are available that allows considering realistic scenarios that include crucial elements of an ecosystem of the real world in addition the dynamics of a human ecosystem is largely governed by the human sector then mortality and per capita births become two important factors that can be used to demonstrate the effect of uncertainties in the system performance the rest of the parameters allow a conceptual representation of the interactions among the various elements both natural and anthropogenic these parameters were taken directly from the works by whitmore et al 2006 and by kotecha et al 2013 2 1 model description the model is a conceptual representation of a human ecosystem with a macroeconomic society within a simplified ecological food network built from a compartmental approach the compartmental model presented in fig 2 is an extension of the works of cabezas et al 2007 and kotecha et al 2013 a total of 15 compartments organized trophically define the model structure three compartments conceptualize the different resource pools rp is the main source of biotic and abiotic resources of the system water nutrients sunlight etc accessible to all biological sectors through primary producers irp represents the resources derived from the residues due to human activity which are inaccessible to the human sector and are gradually reintegrated into the main source of resources similarly erp represents finite non renewable energetic resources oil natural gas etc the first trophic level is for primary producers p1 represents the agricultural sector p2 represents wild plants belonging to the state such as timber resources and p3 are wild plants that do not interact directly with humans the next trophic level consists of three compartments h1 is the livestock sector h2 are wild herbivores that consume p1 and h3 are herbivores isolated from the human sector two carnivores are also included c1 are protected species that have access to h1 and c2 are carnivores that do not interact directly with humans the last trophic level is the human sector as omnivore represented by two compartments hh1 represents a major fraction of society that has a relative low income and hh2 is the minor part which has a high income those compartments are keys to our approach for the incorporation of social stratification finally two extra compartments are generic representations of industries in a society ep is the energy production sector and is involves all manufacturing and services industries natural compartments are also classified into a domestic and wild depending upon whether the human sector governs or not their dynamics p2 h2 and c1 interact with the human sector through a fence and grazing labors in fig 2 the solid lines represent flows of natural mass consumption the dashed lines represent flows due to human activity the dotted lines are mass flows due to the death of the compartments and the waste disposal finally dot dash lines are service flows fig 2 is a graphical representation of the different physical elements of a human ecosystem and the mass relationships between them however the dynamics of such interactions is heavily governed by economic and social aspects these aspects are not explicitly presented in the illustration they are intrinsic elements that represent the influence that human activity has over the system performance therefore the mathematical model includes the calculation of these social economic elements as key issues of the system dynamics this section describes only the main components of the mathematical model used in this paper for a complete description see the accompanying supplementary information initially the model uses eq 3 to estimate the per capita wage wi for each population i according to both the supply demand gap of the product is and the available labor 3 w i a wi c wi is def is is tg λ θ d wi n hh i isdef and istg are the deficit and the inventory objectives of the is compartment respectively nhhi is the population size λ and θ are the yields of rp and p1 respectively awi cwi y dwi are constant parameters per capita wages same as demands and population size are determined for each population then a global per capita wage is obtained by weighting the value of each population as shown in eq 4 4 w i w i α i w is the global per capita wage α1 and α2 are the weight factors which depend on the total population fraction the economic sectors p1 h1 is y ep set the production and the price of their products through algebraic relationships before knowing their demands from hhi eq 5 illustrates this for p1 production such equation represents the relation between the supply demand gap and the prices of the products if the supply demand gap increases then both the price and the amount of the product are reduced further a positive change in wages will impact negatively in productions but positively in prices 5 p 1 p r o d a p 1 p r o d b p 1 p r o d w c p 1 p r o d p 1 d e f p 1 p 1 t g p1def and p1tg are the deficit and the inventory objectives of the p1 compartment respectively ap1prod cp1prod y dp1prod are constant parameters once the prices and productions are determined per capita demands of the system are calculated the per capita demand for the products of each of the four economic activities by each human compartment i are competing depending on the prices and demands of all of them eq 6 illustrates the case of p1 6 p 1 i d e m d p 1 i k p 1 i p 1 p 1 3 l p 1 i h 1 p 1 3 n p 1 i i s p 1 3 o p 1 i e e p z p 1 i p 1 d e m h 1 d e m i s d e m e e d e m where p1i dem is the demand of p1 by population i p1p h1p isp and eep are product prices p1dem h1dem isdem and eedem are product demands and dp1i kp1i lp1i np1i op1i and zp1i are demand parameters owns of each variable and each population the remaining mass flows are estimated from biological balances primary producers feed on rp and make this mass available to the rest of the ecosystem through the food web a small amount of mass from irp is recycled back into the system by p2 and p3 representing bacterial action all living compartments recycle mass back to rp through death ep supplies energy to hh and is by transforming er into a usable form of energy is produces valuable products to hh using p1 and rp the use of is and ep products only increases the mass of irp the dynamics of each compartment is formulated as lotka volterra type differential equations see eq 7 7 d y j d t k g j k y j y k m j y j where yj represents the mass of compartment j yk is the mass of a compartment different from j gjk is a growth parameter and mj is the mortality rate of compartment j although this model does not represent any particular human ecosystem one goal of this work is to achieve a more realistic approach that includes crucial and representative elements of the real world ecosystems as described above uncertainties must be considered when performing a sustainability analysis in order to have more accurate results two crucial parameters in the dynamics of the model are human mortality and birth rate which have clear time dependent uncertainties in their historical trend in real life the world bank 2017 therefore these parameters are represented using sde through ito processes as shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 d m h h i j m h h i j 1 δ t σ m i ε m δ t 9 d a p c b i j a p c b i j 1 δ t σ b i ε b δ t mhhij and apcbij are uncertain dynamic variables for population i and integration time j δt is the integration step size σmi and σbi are the variance parameters εm and εb are random values that have a unit normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of one finally the number of humans in both populations nhhi is estimated by eq 10 eq 10 involves the increase on the population due to births and its decrease due to natural deaths a health factor φ and an economic mobility factor emf which represent an interaction between both populations are also included 10 d n h h i d t p c b i n h h i m h h i n h h i φ i p c m i p c m i d n h h i e m f n h h emf is calculated by eq 11 it depends on the deviation of an ideal total income the iei index and a flow direction factor ψ which has a value of 1 for a population migrating to a level of higher income and 1 for a population

indicators when analyzing the sustainability of an ecosystem it is important to consider the different perspectives involved not doing could lead to wrong conclusions predicting welfare in one dimension while ignoring a possible chaotic future scenario in another dimension for this reason this work uses five different sustainability indicators adapted specifically to be measured in the proposed model 1 fisher information fi can be interpreted as a measure of the order or stability of a system or phenomenon frieden 1988 fi is the amount of information about the system state that can be obtained by measurements in one or more of their variables using fi cabezas and fath 2002 developed a sustainable regime hypothesis that establishes a close relationship between sustainability and the dynamic regime of a system the most recent version of this theory is summarized by gonzález mejía et al 2015 in four statements i a system in an orderly dynamic regime does not change its overall condition with time having a steady nonzero fi ii a steadily decreasing fi implies a loss of dynamic order denoting that the system is changing rapidly and losing stability iii an increasing fi indicates that the system is slowing and possibly becoming more ordered iv a significant and sometimes abrupt change in fi between two stable dynamic regimes denotes a regime shift 2 ecological footprint analysis efa efa attempts to capture the impact of human activity on the regenerative capacity of an environmental system chambers et al 2000 the efa calculates the biocapacity or equivalent available land of a region to support its population and the ecological footprint the ecological footprint is the equivalent land demand of the population the efa is estimated by eq 12 identifying the amount of bio productive land required to support an individual s annual average consumption and waste production wackernagel and rees 1996 12 e f a t b i o c a p a c i t y t f o o t p r i n t t analyzing this balance over time will reveal whether there is an ecological reserve or deficit and whether a population is moving towards or away from a sustainable regime hopton and white 2012 then a high value of this indicator is desirable 3 the net green regional product gnrp the gnrp is an indicator of economic sustainability of green accounting which incorporates the assumption that artificial capital can replace natural capital it represents a common approach to estimate sustainability from a welfare perspective in a simplified way gnrp is defined as the sum of the real value of consumption and the real value of the net investments asheim and weitzman 2001 as given by eq 13 13 g n r p t p t c t q t k t pt and qt are the vectors of real consumption and capital prices respectively ct is the vector of consumption that includes the goods and services kt is the vector of economically productive reserves of environmental resources a high value of gnrp is desirable and its analysis over time indicates whether the system is moving in or away from a sustainable path 4 per capita wages w could be directly related to the economic performance of the whole society then it can be reinterpretated as a macro economic real world parameter in this context the oecd defines the gross domestic product gdp as the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units the organization for economic co operation and development 2017 hence we assume that wages can be used as a representation of gdp per capita in the model however the model does not consider either the inflation nor the world gdp growing trend therefore a more correct analysis requires the estimation of the difference between gdp per capita of a region with global gdp per capita national accounting metrics such as the gdp can quantify the wealth of a region with regard to external economies as well as the efficiency of its use for the benefit of its population a society facing an economic crisis will most likely experience a falling gdp these crises are long term periods characterized by unemployment and low levels of trade and investment drying up the liquidity and rising falling prices due to inflation deflation an economic crisis can cause unpredictable and significant downward shifts in the level of demand lee and makhija 2009 and dramatically alter the level of resources available wan and yiu 2009 5 atmospheric concentration of co2eq global governmental agencies have established various multilateral goals and strategies to identify quantify and mitigate the adverse effects of the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases ghgs in the atmosphere tools such as ghg emission inventories iso 14064 or life cycle analysis lca account the overall ghgs that are directly or indirectly emitted by an individual organization event or product known as carbon footprint national audit office 2007 this magnitude is usually given in terms of equivalent carbon dioxide co2eq which is a unit used to measure and evaluate the global warming potential that each ghg has compared to carbon dioxide these analyses are complex and require a high level of detail being far from what the model used here is able to achieve however based on real historical values it is possible to set an initial concentration of co2eq in the model and determine the total contribution of the activity of the human sector and the mitigation by the natural sector to such concentration in each period of time in this way the dynamics of co2eq can be monitored according to the behavior of the system through eq 14 14 d c o 2 e q d t ω i y g h g i where y ghgi is the i th variable that involves ghg emission or absorption and ωi is the contribution in the co2eq concentration per unit of such i th variable obtained from world real data intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 2 3 capturing the stratification of a society in order to have a model that could represent social inequity variables related to income and goods resources consumption must be split into different components that reproduce the stratification in society to incorporate the concept of stratification into the model a simple relation defined as the income equity index iei is used in this work iei is obtained through eq 15 15 iei p m l i n m l where pm l is the percentage of the population that has a medium low income level and inm l is the percentage of the income that this sector of the population has with respect to the total population income to determine the value of iei as a representation of the level of inequality and development of a society this new index was compared to the widely used human development index hdi the human development index hdi is a measure of the human development of a society through the geometric mean of normalized indices that involve a long and healthy life access to knowledge and a decent standard of living if hdi is adjusted for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population it is called the inequality adjusted human development index ihdi foster et al 2005 as presented in eq 16 16 i h d i h d i μ μ 1 ζ μ is the arithmetic mean of the three dimensions of human development and μ1 ε is the arithmetic mean discounted by the level of inequality as given by the atkinson inequality measure with parameter ζ atkinson 1970 table 1 presents data of ihdi united nations development programme 2017 from eight countries four developed countries and four from the developing world in addition to the percentage of the total income that the approximately three quarters of the population with the lowest income have international labor organization 2017 table 1 also reports the corresponding values of iei as estimated through eq 15 table 1 shows a clear correlation between iei and ihdi therefore in this work iei is used a simplified approach to capture the level of inequity and development in a society an iei with a value of 1 is a representation of a completely egalitarian utopic world approximately a value between 1 and 1 5 represents a developed country whereas a higher value is indicative of a developing country iei can then be assumed as related to the values of consumption and demand of goods services and resources from a variety of typical real world societies in this work those values are represented with model variables such as population size nhh human mass hh wages w and demands of p1 h1 is and ep therefore in order to achieve a two population model with different stratification levels each of the original model variables nhh hh w etc have to split into two variables according to the given distributions levels of each society under analysis 3 results in order to have an adequate representation of the demographic behavior of both strata historical data on mortality and birth rates for high and low medium income societies were taken from the world bank 2017 these data were used to adjust time functions that were then used to obtain the ito processes fig 3 presents a comparison between historical data their adjusted functions and the corresponding stochastic processes once the uncertainties were incorporated through real data series different values of iei were used to model four cases of study representing four types of society 1 society type a it is an ideal society where goods and natural resources are equally distributed around all individuals 2 society type b it is a developed country 3 society type c it is a society in a stage of newly advanced economic development commonly named brics 4 society type d it is a developing country table 2 presents typical values of iei and the economic parameters for these 4 types of societies also table 2 shows the model variables associated to those economic parameters that were split to have two populations under economic stratification the data series used for the simulations are reported in the supplementary information provided along with this manuscript the resulting stochastic model is characterized by twenty six state variables that represent compartments and deficits two uncertain state variables which are human mortality and birth rate sixty seven algebraic variables such as internal flows and economic variables one hundred nineteen ecological economic and social constant parameters along with five sustainability indicators the model was coded and simulated on matlab r2012b one thousand times with an integration step equal to one year for a time horizon of 200 years in each case study the number of simulations in each case study intends to consider the possible scenarios occurring due to the uncertainty in the model parameters see fig 3 the values of the demographic parameters were taken from historical data the rest of the parameters were taken from the works of whitmore8 and kotecha 20 these data sets used are presented in the accompanying supplementary information due to the disturbances caused by the stratification and the external noise introduced to the model through dynamic uncertainties the model simulations frequently drive the system to an environmental economic social collapse in those cases some compartments are extinguished after that point variables profiles have no real sense and the simulation is stopped for society type a the system always remains in a relatively functional state over the time simulated on the contrary society type d collapses in each simulation meanwhile societies type b and c fall somewhere in between table 3 presents probabilities of a system collapse obtained a simple sensitivity analysis was also performed changing the values of the original parameters by 10 each at time and simulating the model to see the effects growing factor of p2 yields of p1 and rp to is and the factors of w and isp are the parameters that most influence the dynamic performance of the variables and sustainable indicators however the relationships inequity collapse probabilities remain the same moreover it is interesting to analyze the impact of the value of the stochastic parameter σ on the behavior of the model see eqs 8 and 9 collapse of the societies is avoided in all the cases if σ is reduced by 50 on the other hand an increment of 25 in its value results in a probability of collapse of 1 in all cases neither of those values however represents real world trends because of the large number of variables and samples only the profiles of key representative compartments for typical stable collapsed cases of societies type b c and d are shown along with the society type a profiles used as a basis for comparison only the mass variables of the four economic sectors livestock p1 agricultural h1 industrial is and energy ep were selected along with the human total population also sustainability indicators are presented fig 4 shows the typical profiles of stable cases of each society in all cases there is an increase in p1 and h1 with respect to the baseline on the contrary is and ee which present a decrease nevertheless there are not significant changes in system performance and the system achieves a stable state between years 50 100 human population has a parabolic behavior with a maximum of about 1 6 times the initial value in the year one hundred twenty as was mentioned earlier for society type d all simulations ended in collapse hence profiles for this society are not shown fig 5 shows typical sustainability indicators profiles for stable cases although the state variables profiles do not show significant differences between societies from a dynamic perspective from a sustainable point of view the indicators do show slight but important differences society type c has a larger gnrp value than type a but worst performance for efa w and co2eq society type b displays an intermediate behavior for fi society type b has a similar trend but a lower value than that of the baseline society type c presents an intermediate behavior for this indicator it shows two regime shifts one around year 70 and other more pronounced close to year 170 in fact according to if society c becomes more sustainable that society a in the last 25 years typical profiles for variables and indicators for cases in which the system collapses are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively society type a is again used as a basis for comparison at the beginning of the simulations the behaviors of all of the societies in both figures are similar from those of the stable cases however sometimes uncertainties in births per capita and mortality rates of both populations affect the dynamics of the system simultaneously which results into an abrupt exponential population growth such population growth leads the society to an economic collapse where average wages per capita go to zero further the large number of humans causes h1 to become insufficient to satisfy human demand favoring an increase in p1 production to accelerate h1 growing however p1 is also consumed by humans at a similar rate so that its increase is not enough to revert the negative gap demand offer of h1 also when the population explosion occurs human activities start to monopolize most of the mass resources leading to an imminent extinction of some natural compartments as h1 in fig 6 when the system collapses profiles of sustainability indicators show a chaotic behavior see fig 7 such behavior changes on each simulation depending upon the values of the uncertain parameters that situation makes difficult the use of such indicators as a sustainable metrics however for the case of per capita wages there is a clear pattern that appears when the system collapses first there is a slowly decreasing trend followed by a sudden increase in a few years and ending with a drastic fall in a couple of years this behavior is present in every single run in which system collapses no matter the kind of society trying to understand such a behavior a search was conducted on the world bank historical data from 1960 to 2014 the world bank 2017 we found that several countries show a similar behavior in real world to that of the wages in the model coinciding most of the times with periods of economic pre crisis fig 8 presents a comparison of three demonstrative examples of countries that show such performance with the economic crisis behavior found for russia and venezuela it denotes their current crisis meanwhile for mexico it fits the crisis of 1982 in the light of that result we do not argue nor claim that the model can predict or resolve a crisis collapse situation in a real world in fact given the scope of the model the formulation does not consider several economical and social components of significant complexity we believe that the pattern found is not the reason for a crisis but a consequence of it then it is remarkable that a simplified model as the one we are using is able to reproduce such behavior 4 conclusions we have analyzed the effect that social inequity has over the sustainability of a human ecosystem through the use of an integrated economic ecological social model with stratified population under uncertainty on demographic parameters a variety of indicators to measure the system sustainability were used to evaluate the system performance for 4 different societies under different levels of inequity to incorporate this social issue to the model we proposed the use of a simple index iei which appears to be an appropriate representation of the inequity level in world societies even though the model is fed in some parameters and variables with real data it is still a conceptual model in its basic structure the model aims to represent in a very generic way the characteristic elements of a human ecosystem nevertheless we consider that the theoretical basis over which it was constructed is enough to provide a qualitative tool that could help in the understanding of the significant interactions although their magnitudes may lack a real meaning in our analysis the probability of a system collapse is very high even for developed countries this does not mean that the model is predicting that more than 60 of current world societies are going to fall into crisis suddenly as stated earlier the model does not provide quantitative results or decisive conclusions rather qualitative estimations that should help into a deeper analysis under this premise the results show that the level of development of a society is directly related with its resilience within the current economic system the current levels of human activity and under the influence of external noise a relatively equalitarian society developed country has a bigger resilience than one with larger differences emerging economy and so much bigger than other where the inequity is high developing country due to the huge complexity that sustainability of ecosystems involves it is crucial the use of different sustainability indicators in order to make a combined analysis to obtain better and more complete conclusions the use of a single indicator could predict a long term welfare in one dimension while a possible chaotic scenario could be ignored in other causing decision makers to make wrong conclusions and to take erroneous decisions that could lead a system to a crisis regime or even collapse in a combined analysis it can be observed in the profiles that the sustainability indicators within an ecological perspective such efa ecological gnrp economic ecological and co2eq concentration ecological social presented qualitatively similar behavior being inverse for gnrp for models similar to the presented in this work the number of sustainability indicators can be reduced using only one instead of these three metrics we are not arguing that such indicators give same results but for the model characteristics their performance in tracking the system sustainability is comparable however we widely suggest keeping the use of fi and w also other sustainability indicators more complex may be included further the combined analysis of all sustainable indicators shows that societies with strong economic stratification are less sustainable than societies with economies evenly distributed this is due to the growing level of goods and services monopolization by a small sector of the population in societies under inequity therefore results demonstrate that the more egalitarian a society will be more sustainable and with larger resilience hence inequity is a very important social aspect to consider in sustainability analysis which affects considerably the sustainable performance of a human ecosystem additionally a recurrent dynamic behavior for the wages was found for cases in which the system collapses further historical data resembles a similar pattern appearing in economic crisis of real world societies to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this behavior is reported in the context of the sustainability moreover the magnitude of the temporal scale of such behavior is quite similar in the model compared to real world societies around 30 years this does not mean that the model can predict a crisis collapse situation given the limitations on its scope the formulation leaves aside important economic and social components however the behavior of the model is consistent with these situations at least with respect to the behavior of per capita wages we think that the pattern found is not the reason for crises but a consequence of the crisis factors in summary we believe that our analysis is a good step towards achieving an integrated tool for sustainability analysis of human ecosystems however we also recognize that the original model and the extensions we presented in this paper still have many weaknesses such as modeling assumptions simplifications and mixed empirical conceptual data even more sustainability is a very complex multidisciplinary topic which requires an analysis by experts from diverse fields it is expected that this work can be used to achieve a better understanding of the basic insights involved in sustainability analysis as well as a qualitative tool that helps in the development of more effective social policies and strategies to meet social needs while maintaining the economy and preserving natural resources acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the financial support provided by the mexican national council for science

25341,there has been a growing interest on the study of the human ecosystems sustainability from an integrated point of view the recognition of sustainability as a complex long term problem has led to the development of tools that address it from a multidisciplinary perspective several mathematical models have been developed to support the understanding of the interactions between human activities and natural resources and the effect of economic and social issues on the sustainability of such ecosystems however only a few of them have considered these aspects holistically even more critical social aspects such as uneven distribution of goods and services have not been addressed developed countries have a larger pool of resources when facing environmental and social issues than developing countries along with larger resilience to external threats being able to rely on scientific and technological advances against poverty and inequity therefore these developed societies are socially fairer and more capable to become sustainable this work presents an integrated ecological economical social model which includes a crucial social aspect in the sustainability study such is inequity having two sectors of a population with different economic distribution values these two populations interact directly with each other representing a stratified society as an attempt to conceptually describe a real world human ecosystem where goods and natural resources are not evenly distributed also the system is under the influence of uncertain external instabilities due to the inclusion of real data series captured in the model by stochastic processes incorporated in demographic variables four typical kinds of societies with different levels of development and inequity were analyzed over the sixty percent of the times simulations led to a system collapse being the probability of collapse directly related to the inequity results suggest that societies with unevenly distributed economies are less sustainable than more equalitarian societies proving that economic equality is an important factor to consider in sustainability studies additionally a typical pattern for per capita wages was found in those cases where the system collapsed similar from a macroeconomic behavior in real world economies under economic crisis keywords sustainability social inequity economic distribution 1 sustainability under economic inequality the interest in the study of sustainability has increased considerably arising from the growing recognition that the current level of human activity damages significantly the environmental system that supports us and may eventually lead to ecosystem extinction and economic social collapse based on the principle everything that we need for our survival and well being depends either directly or indirectly on our natural environment national research council 2011 sustainability has emerged as a new multidisciplinary science field for analysis and evaluation of all ecosystems components and human development in an integrated way the main goal is usually searching for the creation and maintenance of the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony making this topic operationally and conceptually one of the most complex issues that modern science has faced cabezas and fath 2002 sustainability is commonly associated with sustainable development which is defined as the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs world commission on environment and development 1987 this is a very general definition that leads to different interpretations depending on the field of analysis for example in politics it leads a search for social justice and equity prugh et al 1999 in economy for non decreasing utilities pezzey 2004 in biology for maintaining the biotic levels aarts and nienhuis 1999 and in engineering for energetic efficiency and waste reduction sikdar et al 2004 it becomes evident that sustainability does not comprise a single goal or concept rather it involves the integration of many time interrelated dimensions and issues where disturbances or imbalances in any one have an impact on all hence sustainability is not a scalar value or a goal rather is a path through time whitmore et al 2006 as is shown in fig 1 as long as the system remains inside a balanced conceptual hyper tunnel it will be sustainable the system might also be able to temporarily get out in a self correcting unsustainable regime or if the deviation is large go into a collapsed unsustainable regime the collapse of a society can be understood as a catastrophic scenario due to the combination of diverse factors as quick population decline economic crisis and social deterioration up to the point that those factors make the existence of such society impossible and unsustainable this undesirable scenario is derived from a complex and usually not well known variety of factors environmental social cultural health economic or technological therefore sustainability relies largely on human ecosystems being able to withstand the increasing external uncertainties and perturbations xu et al 2015 in this context the concept of resilience becomes a key to sustainability resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to avoid catastrophic scenarios absorbing disturbances either economic social or environmental responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function identity and structure and maintaining the capacity for adaptation learning and transformation intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 hence a resilient human ecosystem is capable of achieving a dynamic stability that allows it to continue existing and provide essential services required by society therefore the study of sustainability requires at least a basic understanding of the relationship between production processes ecosystems and economies most of the efforts on the study of this research area have been directed to analyze the sustainability of real systems see for example the reviews made by liboni et al 2017 and liu et al 2007 such approaches are not predictive they can determine whether a system is moving through or away from sustainability only until the most recent data point the use of dynamic mathematical models featuring the critical components of a real ecosystem is a complementary approach that may help to understand the basic relationships that a formal study of sustainability requires there are many ecological models developed to understand and manage human impacts on specific ecological systems these formulations include different representative features of real ecosystems and their interaction such as the evaluation of the various environmental services in an ecosystem as a decision making tool heal 2000 or integrated approaches to represent complex ecological economic frameworks see van den bergh 1996 and conrad 2002 a more detailed and comprehensive review of these works can be found in whitmore et al 2006 these models generally have very high data requirements for the estimation of their parameters the use of compartmental models is an approach to study the evolution over time of ecological systems in a simplified way the approach consists of identifying a finite number of components that differ among each other by their dynamic behavior these components are called compartments and represent an amount of matter that is physically or theoretically delimited from the rest of the system the interconnection among the compartments is usually modeled through a system of differential equations being common the use of lotka volterra differential equations lotka 1925 volterra 1926 those equations are nonlinear first order equations that are used to describe the mass interactions among different species that interact to each other in similar way as a prey predator interaction for two species the system is defined by eqs 1 and 2 1 d x d t α x β y x 2 d y d t γ y δ x y where x is the number of elements from one species prey and y is the number of its predators dy dt and dx dt represents the growth of both populations at time t α is the natural growth factor of prey δ is the natural rate of death of predators whereas β and γ represent the interactions between both species that is β and γ represents how many prey die because of the predators and how many predators grow due to the consumption of prey using this approach cabezas et al 2007 have developed a compartmental model of sustainability in several stages to represent a conceptual ecosystem the model has been built in several stages at first the model was entirely ecological distributing compartments in four trophic levels plants herbivores carnivores and omnivores including also a nutrient pool fath et al 2003 in a second stage they included human activity aspects by categorizing the compartments into non domesticated and domesticated agricultural and livestock industries cabezas et al 2005a and the inclusion of a simple industrial process creating a new compartment cabezas et al 2005b then economic and social dimensions were included through product prices and labor those factors govern the domesticated compartment flows of the model cabezas et al 2007 and add political issues such as discharges fees shastri et al 2008 finally an energy component was incorporated such component involves an industry for energy production as well as a new pool which can also incorporate bioenergy production kotecha et al 2013 most of these models focus on the sustainability from an ecological point of view and to a lesser extent in an economic one leaving aside the social related issues but since sustainability is ultimately about human well being the social aspect must also be considered in general social inequity and sustainability are closely connected in a world with finite resources justice in distribution is a central theme to address when considering not only long term economic and social sustainability but also ecological sustainability martins 2015 therefore economic equality or a fair wealth distribution is along with health and education factors the most important features for life quality and therefore for social sustainability united nations development programme 2011 motesharrei et al 2014 have conceptually shown that societies under a strong economic stratification are more likely to collapse than societies with equal distributions of economic and ecological resources most of the models reported in the literature follow a deterministic approach however ecosystems are often subject to external influences and the estimation of their parameters generally implies a high degree of complexity such as those parameters involved in economic goods biological interactions or demographic rates in fact time dependent uncertainties are always present in these systems which can change significantly the system performance thus the exclusion of uncertainty could lead to non realistic solutions uncertainties can be incorporated into a formulation by using stochastic processes such as ito processes ito 1974 ito processes are represented by stochastic differential equations sde in which the increment of the state variable consists of two parts a deterministic term and a wiener process a wiener process also called brownian motion is the continuous limit of a random walk it consists of a sequence of random steps where the current value of a variable is composed of the past value plus an error term with zero mean and a variance that increases linearly with the time step ito 1974 these stochastic processes are mainly used in financial analysis however the scope of their application can be considerably extended andrew 1988 as in batch distillation rico ramirez et al 2003 in thermodynamic processes ulas and diwekar 2004 in estimating the optimal dose of drugs ulas and diwekar 2010 in crystallization processes yenkie and diwekar 2013 or batch biodiesel production benavides and diwekar 2013a b in this work we present an enhanced ecological economic social model based on the model presented by whitmore et al 2006 additional concepts are taken from the model by kotecha et al 2013 such as the compartment for energy production our model extends both of those approaches by proposing the incorporation of social inequity as a key concept in social sustainability this concept is incorporated by splitting the model into two human compartments in order to represent the differences in income demand and consumption levels further external influences are incorporated through ito processes on demographic parameters these additions aim to analyze how these factors conceptually affect the sustainability of the ecosystems 2 the stochastic stratified population model first the model is enhanced by including a variety of simplified sustainability indicators used to understand and assess the sustainable performance of a system then the model is also improved to represent a very simplified social stratification splitting the human sector into two strata 4 typical real world societies are analyzed as cases of study hence an inequity index has been defined and used to have a correct representation of such typical societies further real time series of mortality and natality are used to introduce into the model the uncertain real world trends of demography through stochastic processes only mortality and birth rates are assumed as stochastic processes because given the limitations of the model for practical purposes they are the only parameters for which real historical data are available that allows considering realistic scenarios that include crucial elements of an ecosystem of the real world in addition the dynamics of a human ecosystem is largely governed by the human sector then mortality and per capita births become two important factors that can be used to demonstrate the effect of uncertainties in the system performance the rest of the parameters allow a conceptual representation of the interactions among the various elements both natural and anthropogenic these parameters were taken directly from the works by whitmore et al 2006 and by kotecha et al 2013 2 1 model description the model is a conceptual representation of a human ecosystem with a macroeconomic society within a simplified ecological food network built from a compartmental approach the compartmental model presented in fig 2 is an extension of the works of cabezas et al 2007 and kotecha et al 2013 a total of 15 compartments organized trophically define the model structure three compartments conceptualize the different resource pools rp is the main source of biotic and abiotic resources of the system water nutrients sunlight etc accessible to all biological sectors through primary producers irp represents the resources derived from the residues due to human activity which are inaccessible to the human sector and are gradually reintegrated into the main source of resources similarly erp represents finite non renewable energetic resources oil natural gas etc the first trophic level is for primary producers p1 represents the agricultural sector p2 represents wild plants belonging to the state such as timber resources and p3 are wild plants that do not interact directly with humans the next trophic level consists of three compartments h1 is the livestock sector h2 are wild herbivores that consume p1 and h3 are herbivores isolated from the human sector two carnivores are also included c1 are protected species that have access to h1 and c2 are carnivores that do not interact directly with humans the last trophic level is the human sector as omnivore represented by two compartments hh1 represents a major fraction of society that has a relative low income and hh2 is the minor part which has a high income those compartments are keys to our approach for the incorporation of social stratification finally two extra compartments are generic representations of industries in a society ep is the energy production sector and is involves all manufacturing and services industries natural compartments are also classified into a domestic and wild depending upon whether the human sector governs or not their dynamics p2 h2 and c1 interact with the human sector through a fence and grazing labors in fig 2 the solid lines represent flows of natural mass consumption the dashed lines represent flows due to human activity the dotted lines are mass flows due to the death of the compartments and the waste disposal finally dot dash lines are service flows fig 2 is a graphical representation of the different physical elements of a human ecosystem and the mass relationships between them however the dynamics of such interactions is heavily governed by economic and social aspects these aspects are not explicitly presented in the illustration they are intrinsic elements that represent the influence that human activity has over the system performance therefore the mathematical model includes the calculation of these social economic elements as key issues of the system dynamics this section describes only the main components of the mathematical model used in this paper for a complete description see the accompanying supplementary information initially the model uses eq 3 to estimate the per capita wage wi for each population i according to both the supply demand gap of the product is and the available labor 3 w i a wi c wi is def is is tg λ θ d wi n hh i isdef and istg are the deficit and the inventory objectives of the is compartment respectively nhhi is the population size λ and θ are the yields of rp and p1 respectively awi cwi y dwi are constant parameters per capita wages same as demands and population size are determined for each population then a global per capita wage is obtained by weighting the value of each population as shown in eq 4 4 w i w i α i w is the global per capita wage α1 and α2 are the weight factors which depend on the total population fraction the economic sectors p1 h1 is y ep set the production and the price of their products through algebraic relationships before knowing their demands from hhi eq 5 illustrates this for p1 production such equation represents the relation between the supply demand gap and the prices of the products if the supply demand gap increases then both the price and the amount of the product are reduced further a positive change in wages will impact negatively in productions but positively in prices 5 p 1 p r o d a p 1 p r o d b p 1 p r o d w c p 1 p r o d p 1 d e f p 1 p 1 t g p1def and p1tg are the deficit and the inventory objectives of the p1 compartment respectively ap1prod cp1prod y dp1prod are constant parameters once the prices and productions are determined per capita demands of the system are calculated the per capita demand for the products of each of the four economic activities by each human compartment i are competing depending on the prices and demands of all of them eq 6 illustrates the case of p1 6 p 1 i d e m d p 1 i k p 1 i p 1 p 1 3 l p 1 i h 1 p 1 3 n p 1 i i s p 1 3 o p 1 i e e p z p 1 i p 1 d e m h 1 d e m i s d e m e e d e m where p1i dem is the demand of p1 by population i p1p h1p isp and eep are product prices p1dem h1dem isdem and eedem are product demands and dp1i kp1i lp1i np1i op1i and zp1i are demand parameters owns of each variable and each population the remaining mass flows are estimated from biological balances primary producers feed on rp and make this mass available to the rest of the ecosystem through the food web a small amount of mass from irp is recycled back into the system by p2 and p3 representing bacterial action all living compartments recycle mass back to rp through death ep supplies energy to hh and is by transforming er into a usable form of energy is produces valuable products to hh using p1 and rp the use of is and ep products only increases the mass of irp the dynamics of each compartment is formulated as lotka volterra type differential equations see eq 7 7 d y j d t k g j k y j y k m j y j where yj represents the mass of compartment j yk is the mass of a compartment different from j gjk is a growth parameter and mj is the mortality rate of compartment j although this model does not represent any particular human ecosystem one goal of this work is to achieve a more realistic approach that includes crucial and representative elements of the real world ecosystems as described above uncertainties must be considered when performing a sustainability analysis in order to have more accurate results two crucial parameters in the dynamics of the model are human mortality and birth rate which have clear time dependent uncertainties in their historical trend in real life the world bank 2017 therefore these parameters are represented using sde through ito processes as shown in eqs 8 and 9 8 d m h h i j m h h i j 1 δ t σ m i ε m δ t 9 d a p c b i j a p c b i j 1 δ t σ b i ε b δ t mhhij and apcbij are uncertain dynamic variables for population i and integration time j δt is the integration step size σmi and σbi are the variance parameters εm and εb are random values that have a unit normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of one finally the number of humans in both populations nhhi is estimated by eq 10 eq 10 involves the increase on the population due to births and its decrease due to natural deaths a health factor φ and an economic mobility factor emf which represent an interaction between both populations are also included 10 d n h h i d t p c b i n h h i m h h i n h h i φ i p c m i p c m i d n h h i e m f n h h emf is calculated by eq 11 it depends on the deviation of an ideal total income the iei index and a flow direction factor ψ which has a value of 1 for a population migrating to a level of higher income and 1 for a population

indicators when analyzing the sustainability of an ecosystem it is important to consider the different perspectives involved not doing could lead to wrong conclusions predicting welfare in one dimension while ignoring a possible chaotic future scenario in another dimension for this reason this work uses five different sustainability indicators adapted specifically to be measured in the proposed model 1 fisher information fi can be interpreted as a measure of the order or stability of a system or phenomenon frieden 1988 fi is the amount of information about the system state that can be obtained by measurements in one or more of their variables using fi cabezas and fath 2002 developed a sustainable regime hypothesis that establishes a close relationship between sustainability and the dynamic regime of a system the most recent version of this theory is summarized by gonzález mejía et al 2015 in four statements i a system in an orderly dynamic regime does not change its overall condition with time having a steady nonzero fi ii a steadily decreasing fi implies a loss of dynamic order denoting that the system is changing rapidly and losing stability iii an increasing fi indicates that the system is slowing and possibly becoming more ordered iv a significant and sometimes abrupt change in fi between two stable dynamic regimes denotes a regime shift 2 ecological footprint analysis efa efa attempts to capture the impact of human activity on the regenerative capacity of an environmental system chambers et al 2000 the efa calculates the biocapacity or equivalent available land of a region to support its population and the ecological footprint the ecological footprint is the equivalent land demand of the population the efa is estimated by eq 12 identifying the amount of bio productive land required to support an individual s annual average consumption and waste production wackernagel and rees 1996 12 e f a t b i o c a p a c i t y t f o o t p r i n t t analyzing this balance over time will reveal whether there is an ecological reserve or deficit and whether a population is moving towards or away from a sustainable regime hopton and white 2012 then a high value of this indicator is desirable 3 the net green regional product gnrp the gnrp is an indicator of economic sustainability of green accounting which incorporates the assumption that artificial capital can replace natural capital it represents a common approach to estimate sustainability from a welfare perspective in a simplified way gnrp is defined as the sum of the real value of consumption and the real value of the net investments asheim and weitzman 2001 as given by eq 13 13 g n r p t p t c t q t k t pt and qt are the vectors of real consumption and capital prices respectively ct is the vector of consumption that includes the goods and services kt is the vector of economically productive reserves of environmental resources a high value of gnrp is desirable and its analysis over time indicates whether the system is moving in or away from a sustainable path 4 per capita wages w could be directly related to the economic performance of the whole society then it can be reinterpretated as a macro economic real world parameter in this context the oecd defines the gross domestic product gdp as the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units the organization for economic co operation and development 2017 hence we assume that wages can be used as a representation of gdp per capita in the model however the model does not consider either the inflation nor the world gdp growing trend therefore a more correct analysis requires the estimation of the difference between gdp per capita of a region with global gdp per capita national accounting metrics such as the gdp can quantify the wealth of a region with regard to external economies as well as the efficiency of its use for the benefit of its population a society facing an economic crisis will most likely experience a falling gdp these crises are long term periods characterized by unemployment and low levels of trade and investment drying up the liquidity and rising falling prices due to inflation deflation an economic crisis can cause unpredictable and significant downward shifts in the level of demand lee and makhija 2009 and dramatically alter the level of resources available wan and yiu 2009 5 atmospheric concentration of co2eq global governmental agencies have established various multilateral goals and strategies to identify quantify and mitigate the adverse effects of the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases ghgs in the atmosphere tools such as ghg emission inventories iso 14064 or life cycle analysis lca account the overall ghgs that are directly or indirectly emitted by an individual organization event or product known as carbon footprint national audit office 2007 this magnitude is usually given in terms of equivalent carbon dioxide co2eq which is a unit used to measure and evaluate the global warming potential that each ghg has compared to carbon dioxide these analyses are complex and require a high level of detail being far from what the model used here is able to achieve however based on real historical values it is possible to set an initial concentration of co2eq in the model and determine the total contribution of the activity of the human sector and the mitigation by the natural sector to such concentration in each period of time in this way the dynamics of co2eq can be monitored according to the behavior of the system through eq 14 14 d c o 2 e q d t ω i y g h g i where y ghgi is the i th variable that involves ghg emission or absorption and ωi is the contribution in the co2eq concentration per unit of such i th variable obtained from world real data intergovernmental panel on climate change 2014 2 3 capturing the stratification of a society in order to have a model that could represent social inequity variables related to income and goods resources consumption must be split into different components that reproduce the stratification in society to incorporate the concept of stratification into the model a simple relation defined as the income equity index iei is used in this work iei is obtained through eq 15 15 iei p m l i n m l where pm l is the percentage of the population that has a medium low income level and inm l is the percentage of the income that this sector of the population has with respect to the total population income to determine the value of iei as a representation of the level of inequality and development of a society this new index was compared to the widely used human development index hdi the human development index hdi is a measure of the human development of a society through the geometric mean of normalized indices that involve a long and healthy life access to knowledge and a decent standard of living if hdi is adjusted for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population it is called the inequality adjusted human development index ihdi foster et al 2005 as presented in eq 16 16 i h d i h d i μ μ 1 ζ μ is the arithmetic mean of the three dimensions of human development and μ1 ε is the arithmetic mean discounted by the level of inequality as given by the atkinson inequality measure with parameter ζ atkinson 1970 table 1 presents data of ihdi united nations development programme 2017 from eight countries four developed countries and four from the developing world in addition to the percentage of the total income that the approximately three quarters of the population with the lowest income have international labor organization 2017 table 1 also reports the corresponding values of iei as estimated through eq 15 table 1 shows a clear correlation between iei and ihdi therefore in this work iei is used a simplified approach to capture the level of inequity and development in a society an iei with a value of 1 is a representation of a completely egalitarian utopic world approximately a value between 1 and 1 5 represents a developed country whereas a higher value is indicative of a developing country iei can then be assumed as related to the values of consumption and demand of goods services and resources from a variety of typical real world societies in this work those values are represented with model variables such as population size nhh human mass hh wages w and demands of p1 h1 is and ep therefore in order to achieve a two population model with different stratification levels each of the original model variables nhh hh w etc have to split into two variables according to the given distributions levels of each society under analysis 3 results in order to have an adequate representation of the demographic behavior of both strata historical data on mortality and birth rates for high and low medium income societies were taken from the world bank 2017 these data were used to adjust time functions that were then used to obtain the ito processes fig 3 presents a comparison between historical data their adjusted functions and the corresponding stochastic processes once the uncertainties were incorporated through real data series different values of iei were used to model four cases of study representing four types of society 1 society type a it is an ideal society where goods and natural resources are equally distributed around all individuals 2 society type b it is a developed country 3 society type c it is a society in a stage of newly advanced economic development commonly named brics 4 society type d it is a developing country table 2 presents typical values of iei and the economic parameters for these 4 types of societies also table 2 shows the model variables associated to those economic parameters that were split to have two populations under economic stratification the data series used for the simulations are reported in the supplementary information provided along with this manuscript the resulting stochastic model is characterized by twenty six state variables that represent compartments and deficits two uncertain state variables which are human mortality and birth rate sixty seven algebraic variables such as internal flows and economic variables one hundred nineteen ecological economic and social constant parameters along with five sustainability indicators the model was coded and simulated on matlab r2012b one thousand times with an integration step equal to one year for a time horizon of 200 years in each case study the number of simulations in each case study intends to consider the possible scenarios occurring due to the uncertainty in the model parameters see fig 3 the values of the demographic parameters were taken from historical data the rest of the parameters were taken from the works of whitmore8 and kotecha 20 these data sets used are presented in the accompanying supplementary information due to the disturbances caused by the stratification and the external noise introduced to the model through dynamic uncertainties the model simulations frequently drive the system to an environmental economic social collapse in those cases some compartments are extinguished after that point variables profiles have no real sense and the simulation is stopped for society type a the system always remains in a relatively functional state over the time simulated on the contrary society type d collapses in each simulation meanwhile societies type b and c fall somewhere in between table 3 presents probabilities of a system collapse obtained a simple sensitivity analysis was also performed changing the values of the original parameters by 10 each at time and simulating the model to see the effects growing factor of p2 yields of p1 and rp to is and the factors of w and isp are the parameters that most influence the dynamic performance of the variables and sustainable indicators however the relationships inequity collapse probabilities remain the same moreover it is interesting to analyze the impact of the value of the stochastic parameter σ on the behavior of the model see eqs 8 and 9 collapse of the societies is avoided in all the cases if σ is reduced by 50 on the other hand an increment of 25 in its value results in a probability of collapse of 1 in all cases neither of those values however represents real world trends because of the large number of variables and samples only the profiles of key representative compartments for typical stable collapsed cases of societies type b c and d are shown along with the society type a profiles used as a basis for comparison only the mass variables of the four economic sectors livestock p1 agricultural h1 industrial is and energy ep were selected along with the human total population also sustainability indicators are presented fig 4 shows the typical profiles of stable cases of each society in all cases there is an increase in p1 and h1 with respect to the baseline on the contrary is and ee which present a decrease nevertheless there are not significant changes in system performance and the system achieves a stable state between years 50 100 human population has a parabolic behavior with a maximum of about 1 6 times the initial value in the year one hundred twenty as was mentioned earlier for society type d all simulations ended in collapse hence profiles for this society are not shown fig 5 shows typical sustainability indicators profiles for stable cases although the state variables profiles do not show significant differences between societies from a dynamic perspective from a sustainable point of view the indicators do show slight but important differences society type c has a larger gnrp value than type a but worst performance for efa w and co2eq society type b displays an intermediate behavior for fi society type b has a similar trend but a lower value than that of the baseline society type c presents an intermediate behavior for this indicator it shows two regime shifts one around year 70 and other more pronounced close to year 170 in fact according to if society c becomes more sustainable that society a in the last 25 years typical profiles for variables and indicators for cases in which the system collapses are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively society type a is again used as a basis for comparison at the beginning of the simulations the behaviors of all of the societies in both figures are similar from those of the stable cases however sometimes uncertainties in births per capita and mortality rates of both populations affect the dynamics of the system simultaneously which results into an abrupt exponential population growth such population growth leads the society to an economic collapse where average wages per capita go to zero further the large number of humans causes h1 to become insufficient to satisfy human demand favoring an increase in p1 production to accelerate h1 growing however p1 is also consumed by humans at a similar rate so that its increase is not enough to revert the negative gap demand offer of h1 also when the population explosion occurs human activities start to monopolize most of the mass resources leading to an imminent extinction of some natural compartments as h1 in fig 6 when the system collapses profiles of sustainability indicators show a chaotic behavior see fig 7 such behavior changes on each simulation depending upon the values of the uncertain parameters that situation makes difficult the use of such indicators as a sustainable metrics however for the case of per capita wages there is a clear pattern that appears when the system collapses first there is a slowly decreasing trend followed by a sudden increase in a few years and ending with a drastic fall in a couple of years this behavior is present in every single run in which system collapses no matter the kind of society trying to understand such a behavior a search was conducted on the world bank historical data from 1960 to 2014 the world bank 2017 we found that several countries show a similar behavior in real world to that of the wages in the model coinciding most of the times with periods of economic pre crisis fig 8 presents a comparison of three demonstrative examples of countries that show such performance with the economic crisis behavior found for russia and venezuela it denotes their current crisis meanwhile for mexico it fits the crisis of 1982 in the light of that result we do not argue nor claim that the model can predict or resolve a crisis collapse situation in a real world in fact given the scope of the model the formulation does not consider several economical and social components of significant complexity we believe that the pattern found is not the reason for a crisis but a consequence of it then it is remarkable that a simplified model as the one we are using is able to reproduce such behavior 4 conclusions we have analyzed the effect that social inequity has over the sustainability of a human ecosystem through the use of an integrated economic ecological social model with stratified population under uncertainty on demographic parameters a variety of indicators to measure the system sustainability were used to evaluate the system performance for 4 different societies under different levels of inequity to incorporate this social issue to the model we proposed the use of a simple index iei which appears to be an appropriate representation of the inequity level in world societies even though the model is fed in some parameters and variables with real data it is still a conceptual model in its basic structure the model aims to represent in a very generic way the characteristic elements of a human ecosystem nevertheless we consider that the theoretical basis over which it was constructed is enough to provide a qualitative tool that could help in the understanding of the significant interactions although their magnitudes may lack a real meaning in our analysis the probability of a system collapse is very high even for developed countries this does not mean that the model is predicting that more than 60 of current world societies are going to fall into crisis suddenly as stated earlier the model does not provide quantitative results or decisive conclusions rather qualitative estimations that should help into a deeper analysis under this premise the results show that the level of development of a society is directly related with its resilience within the current economic system the current levels of human activity and under the influence of external noise a relatively equalitarian society developed country has a bigger resilience than one with larger differences emerging economy and so much bigger than other where the inequity is high developing country due to the huge complexity that sustainability of ecosystems involves it is crucial the use of different sustainability indicators in order to make a combined analysis to obtain better and more complete conclusions the use of a single indicator could predict a long term welfare in one dimension while a possible chaotic scenario could be ignored in other causing decision makers to make wrong conclusions and to take erroneous decisions that could lead a system to a crisis regime or even collapse in a combined analysis it can be observed in the profiles that the sustainability indicators within an ecological perspective such efa ecological gnrp economic ecological and co2eq concentration ecological social presented qualitatively similar behavior being inverse for gnrp for models similar to the presented in this work the number of sustainability indicators can be reduced using only one instead of these three metrics we are not arguing that such indicators give same results but for the model characteristics their performance in tracking the system sustainability is comparable however we widely suggest keeping the use of fi and w also other sustainability indicators more complex may be included further the combined analysis of all sustainable indicators shows that societies with strong economic stratification are less sustainable than societies with economies evenly distributed this is due to the growing level of goods and services monopolization by a small sector of the population in societies under inequity therefore results demonstrate that the more egalitarian a society will be more sustainable and with larger resilience hence inequity is a very important social aspect to consider in sustainability analysis which affects considerably the sustainable performance of a human ecosystem additionally a recurrent dynamic behavior for the wages was found for cases in which the system collapses further historical data resembles a similar pattern appearing in economic crisis of real world societies to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this behavior is reported in the context of the sustainability moreover the magnitude of the temporal scale of such behavior is quite similar in the model compared to real world societies around 30 years this does not mean that the model can predict a crisis collapse situation given the limitations on its scope the formulation leaves aside important economic and social components however the behavior of the model is consistent with these situations at least with respect to the behavior of per capita wages we think that the pattern found is not the reason for crises but a consequence of the crisis factors in summary we believe that our analysis is a good step towards achieving an integrated tool for sustainability analysis of human ecosystems however we also recognize that the original model and the extensions we presented in this paper still have many weaknesses such as modeling assumptions simplifications and mixed empirical conceptual data even more sustainability is a very complex multidisciplinary topic which requires an analysis by experts from diverse fields it is expected that this work can be used to achieve a better understanding of the basic insights involved in sustainability analysis as well as a qualitative tool that helps in the development of more effective social policies and strategies to meet social needs while maintaining the economy and preserving natural resources acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the financial support provided by the mexican national council for science

25342,habitat destruction characterized by patch loss and patch fragmentation has been recognized as one of leading factors driving species loss although some studies have already explored how patch

classical metacommunity theory has been utilized to explore how species occupancy responds to patch loss in a food chain pillai et al 2010 in addition fortuna and bascompte 2006 performed simulations on a mutualistic plant animal system obtaining the parameter region of species persistence as well as the threshold of habitat loss where the community collapses according to fahrig 2002 2003 and liao et al 2013a b 2016a liao et al 2017a b c habitat destruction induces two extreme consequences patch loss and patch fragmentation where the former is the loss of available patches while the latter

2010 which has already been proven experimentally to affect species persistence carrara et al 2014 martinson and fagan 2014 burgett and chase 2015 thus it is necessary to further study how habitat configurational fragmentation affects species coexistence in plant animal interaction systems there are some researches assuming that species may have local eriksson 1989 liao et al 2013a b fukui and araki 2014 or global dispersal cain et al 2000 nathan et al 2008 mcconkey et al 2012 local dispersers are only able to colonize the neighbouring suitable patches while global dispersers are assumed to establish in any suitable patch randomly across the entire landscape hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a b 2016a b 2017a b c several single population models have concluded that patch fragmentation strongly impedes the growth of distance limited dispersers while long range dispersers are much less influenced johst and drechsler 2003 kallimanis et al 2006 liao et al 2013a b 2016a as a consequence species dispersal strategy e g local and global should be considered in plant animal interactions as plant species in most cases can only disperse within a shorter range than animal populations in order to characterize habitat fragmentation and local neighbouring dispersal the pair approximation technique pa has been used to describe the neighbouring correlation harada and iwasa 1994 liao et al 2016b using pa approach hiebeler 2000 2007 found in a fragmented landscape not only habitat loss but also habitat fragmentation can have a significant influence on species persistence furthermore liao et al 2016a recently performed an extension of patch dynamic model on a food chain in fragmented landscapes finding that long range dispersers at higher trophic levels display more sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation due to a trophic cascade using the pa method to characterize spatial patch clustering degree and local dispersal approximately such extended patch dynamic model allows one to explore the separate effects of patch loss and fragmentation despite the approximations this model can yield qualitatively similar results as more realistic spatially explicit simulations liao et al 2016a thus it can be further applied to other types of interactions such as competition mutualism e g pollination and facilitation here we stress that besides predation between plants and animals there also exist other plant animal interactions such as mutualism e g pollination neutralism 0 0 i e no interaction poison 0 i e nepenthes and insect competition and fruitivory 0 therefore we use an extended patch dynamic modeling framework developed by liao et al 2016a to describe the above six plant animal interactions in fragmented landscapes so as to explore how patch loss and fragmentation separately and interactively affect different plant animal interactions and which interaction is most robust to habitat destruction 2 methods 2 1 landscape structure similar to liao et al 2016a we assume the landscape includes two types of habitat patch unsuitable u and suitable s where u patches u patch loss are unsuitable for any species establishment while s patches is suitable for species colonization the clustering degree for a given patch for example s can be described by patch connectivity q s s ρ ss s in which the pair density ρ ss denotes the probability that a randomly chosen pair of neighboring patches both are suitable thus patch connectivity so called patch clustering degree q s s is the conditional probability that the neighbor of a target s patch is also an s patch here we adopt the von neumann neighborhood with each patch having four orthogonally adjacent patches z 4 the fragmentation degree of s patches is negatively related to their clustering degree defined as 1 q s s based on the orthogonal neighboring correlation method of landscape generation hiebeler 2000 2007 we have 1 2 1 s q s s 1 2 2 patch dynamic models of various plant animal interactions in a fragmented landscape where each suitable patch can be empty or occupied by either plant p or animal a we assume plant species have local neighbouring dispersal local dispersal while animal species can disperse globally across the landscape global dispersal as such plant species can only colonize the neighbouring unoccupied s patches while animal species can establish in any unoccupied suitable patches in the whole landscape similar to liao et al 2016a we can derive the patch dynamics for plant animal system without interactions i e neutralism as 2 d p d t c p p ρ p p ρ p u local dispersal e p p extinction d a d t c a a s a global dispersal e a a extinction all parameters are defined in table 1 in eq 2 the dynamics for both plant and animal include two terms species

states for a target p patch p u s unoccupied suitable patches and plant species can only colonize the unoccupied neighbouring s patches see more details in liao et al 2016a since the terms ρ pp and ρ pu change over time we further describe their transition rates in appendix a in supplementary material to construct the closed system the factor s a is the proportion of suitable patches unoccupied by animal species for poison 0 we assume animal species may mistakenly eat the poisonous leaf of plant species and then would go to die immediately similarly the patch dynamics of plant population include two terms colonization via neighbouring dispersal and intrinsic extinction yet the dynamics of animal populations consist of three parts colonization via global dispersal intrinsic extinction and additional extinction rate by mistakenly eating poisonous plant leaves therefore we have 3 d p d t c p p ρ p p ρ p u local dispersal e p p extinction d a d t c a a s a global dispersal e a a extinction μ a p p a poison we further construct the dynamics for ρ pp and ρ pu in appendix b in supplementary material to form the closed mathematical system examples for competition between plants and animal are scarce but they indeed exist in nature such as competition for space in the case of competition the patch dynamics for both plant and animal species include three terms colonization via local plant or global dispersal animal intrinsic extinction and increased extinction due to interspecific competition for space resources thus we drive 4 d p d t c p p ρ p p ρ p u local dispersal e p

supplementary material to construct the closed system for predation between plant and animal species the patch dynamics of plant species include three terms colonization with neighboring dispersal intrinsic extinction and increased extinction due to predation the patch dynamics for animal species consist of both colonization and intrinsic extinction see liao et al 2016a note that animal species can only colonize the suitable patches already occupied by plant species p a thus animal species cannot survive without plant species in a local patch this means where there are animal species there also exist plant species as such we can write 5 d p d t c p p ρ p p ρ p u local dispersal e p p extinction μ p a a predation d a d t c a a p a global dispersal e a a extinction in a similar way we further construct the dynamics for ρ pp and ρ pu in appendix d in supplementary material to form the closed system for fruitivory 0 we assume animal species can benefit from eating fruits of plant species e g energy acquisition while plant population dynamics are unaffected by animal population thus plant population dynamics include neighbouring colonization and intrinsic extinction while the animal species can only survive at the patches already occupied by plants p a as such we have 6 d p d t c p p ρ u p ρ p p local dispersal e p p extinction d a d t c a a p a global dispersal e a a extinction again the dynamics for ρ pp and ρ pu are shown in appendix e in supplementary material for mutualistic plant animal interaction plant species can only reproduce when insects e g honeybees are present in a local patch such as pollination at the same time animal species can survive and reproduce only when there are plant populations in a local patch this means where there is animal there are plants as such the plant can only survive but cannot reproduce without insects in a local patch consequently 7 d p d t c p a ρ a u ρ a a ρ a p local dispersal e p p extinction d a d t c a a p a global dispersal e a a extinction the term a ρ a u ρ a a ρ a p indicates that plant species can only colonize the neighbouring unoccupied s patches note the subscript p means the patches are only occupied by plant while no animals in a similar way the derived dynamics for ρ au ρ aa and ρ ap are shown in appendix f in supplementary material in the above six different plant animal interactions we use numerical methods via ode45 in matlab to derive the non trivial solutions in each simulation both species are initialized at low patch occupancy each case is run for enough time to achieve equilibrium state at steady state species survive if population size is larger than 10 6 otherwise it is considered to be extinct throughout this paper we explore a broad range of biologically realistic parameter combinations and the results presented for these combinations are qualitatively robust by varying patch availability s and connectivity qs s we seek to explore how patch loss and fragmentation interactively and separately affect species persistence in various plant animal interactions 3 results we utilize the patch dynamic model to test how patch availability and connectivity interact in modifying species persistence at different cases of plant animal interactions fig 1 in general increasing both patch availability and connectivity promotes species persistence and system stability in all cases see figs a1 a2 in appendix g in supplementary material in fig 1a c animal species with global dispersal are affected by patch availability while plant species with local dispersal are dominated by patch connectivity except in fig 1c where plant species are slightly influenced by patch availability at the same time both plant and animal species expectedly go extinct at low levels of patch availability and connectivity in fig 1d animal species in spite of global dispersal are negatively influenced by patch configurational fragmentation especially at low patch availability again plant species with neighbouring dispersal are only impacted by patch connectivity with higher connectivity increasing plant species persistence see fig a1 the results in fig 1e are similar to that in fig 1d interestingly both plant and animal populations in fig 1f decline simultaneously to extinction with reducing patch availability and connectivity when comparing system robustness to landscape fragmentation in these six plant animal interactions i e both plant and animal species can coexist in a wider parameter range of patch availability and connectivity we find that neutralism is most robust to habitat loss and fragmentation while mutualism displays the most vulnerability as shown in fig 2 our patch dynamic model allows one to explore the individual effect of patch connectivity or patch availability independent of patch availability or patch connectivity on population occupancy clearly plant population occupancy increases with an increase in patch availability and connectivity in fig 2a c e it should be emphasized that in a plant animal mutualistic interaction plant species is sharply decreased to zero at certain values of patch loss and fragmentation similarly animal populations display an almost linearly increases in patch occupancy with increasing patch availability see fig 2b d but in fig 2f we find that increasing patch connectivity does not affect animal population occupancy in neutralism 0 0 while surprisingly patch occupancy in 0 and is decreased in other interactions patch connectivity obviously promotes animal population occupancy and thus species persistence again animal species are sharply declined to zero extinction at certain thresholds of patch availability and connectivity the final observation is that in most cases neutralism can maintain highest patch occupancy for both plant and animal species while lowest population occupancies are kept in predation interaction yet both plant and animal species in mutualistic interactions are most vulnerable to patch loss and fragmentation than those in other interactions as they display largest extinction thresholds defined as the maximum patch loss fragmentation above which a specie just goes extinct for both patch availability and connectivity i e they have lowest tolerance to patch loss and fragmentation 4 discussion with the model we find that system with neutral interaction between plants and animals can tolerate highest patch loss and fragmentation relative to other plant animal interactions this is because the persistence of plant and animal species is only determined by their own demographic characteristics such as intrinsic colonization and extinction rates for example from an metapopulation perspective animal species would not suffer or benefit from variation in plant population occupancy and their equilibrium population occupancy a s e a c a at the same time plant species persistence is influenced by both patch loss and fragmentation in such case both animal and plant species can co occur at the same local patch and thus own more habitat patches than other interactions yet in other cases both plant and animal species can interact negatively or positively to influence their persistence for example in negative interaction competition animal species can not invade into the patches already occupied by plant species while plants simultaneously can not colonize the patches already occupied by animals as such the fraction of colonisable patches for plant and animal is decreased compared to neutralism 0 0 in a predation interaction whether animal species can persist strongly depends on plant population occupancy as animal population can not survive in a patch without prey plant species as such even patch fragmentation does not affect animal species directly because of global dispersal but animal species are indirectly influenced by patch fragmentation due to a trophic cascade as we know plant species with neighbor dispersal are greatly restricted by habitat fragmentation liao et al 2013a b thus plant populations are decreased with patch fragmentation which further results in reduction in animal population because of trophic interaction in a mutualistic interaction both plant and animal populations are interdependent of each other i e animal species can not survive and reproduce in a local patch without plant species while plant species can not reproduce without animal species because of insect pollination e g honeybee such double dependence greatly destabilizes their system stability therefore system with neutral interaction displays most robustness to both patch loss and fragmentation whilst mutualism leads to most vulnerable systems counter intuitively negative plant animal interactions for example harmful for one or both species show stronger tolerance to habitat destruction i e higher species persistence than positive interactions e g beneficial to one or both species in spite of lower patch occupancy taking versus for example as explained above this is because there exists a double dependence between plants and animals in mutualism which greatly restricts their population growth yet such double dependence does not exist in a competitive system as both plant and animal species can invade into the colony site of each other except that there is an extra cost for both plants and animals if they co occur at the same patch to compete for space resources a final observational result is that in most cases predation leads to lowest population occupancy for both plant and animal species in the face of landscape fragmentation this is due to the fact that plant populations suffer from two pressures environmental disturbance including patch loss and fragmentation as well as predation by animal populations such double pressures result in lowest patch occupancy for plants which further restricts the growth of animal population via trophic cascading effects yet this does not mean that such trophic system stability is most vulnerable to habitat destruction in summary we use a patch dynamic model to simulate how patch loss and fragmentation separately and interactively affect six plant animal interactions with the model we find that systems with neutral interaction display most robust to both patch loss and fragmentation while mutualism results in most vulnerable systems surprisingly systems with negative interactions can tolerate more habitat destruction than those with positive interactions overall our modeling predictions offer

intrinsic extinction and increased extinction due to predation the patch dynamics for animal species consist of both colonization and intrinsic extinction see liao et al 2016a note that animal species can only colonize the suitable patches already occupied by plant species p a thus animal species cannot survive without plant species in a local patch this means where there are animal species there

are present in a local patch such as pollination at the same time animal species can survive and reproduce only when there are plant populations in a local patch this means where there is animal there

we use numerical methods via ode45 in matlab to derive the non trivial solutions in each simulation both species are initialized at low patch occupancy each case is run for enough time to achieve equilibrium state at steady state species survive if population size is larger than 10 6 otherwise it is considered to be extinct throughout this paper we explore a broad range of biologically realistic parameter combinations and the results presented for these combinations are qualitatively robust by varying patch availability s and connectivity qs s we seek to explore how patch loss and fragmentation interactively and separately affect species persistence in various plant animal interactions 3 results we utilize the patch dynamic model to test how patch availability and connectivity interact in modifying species persistence at different cases of plant animal interactions fig 1 in general increasing both patch availability and connectivity promotes species persistence and system stability in all cases see figs a1 a2 in appendix g in supplementary material in fig 1a c animal species with global dispersal are affected by patch availability while plant species with local dispersal are dominated by patch connectivity except in fig 1c where plant species are slightly influenced by patch availability at the same time both plant and animal species expectedly go extinct at low levels of patch availability and connectivity in fig 1d animal species in spite of global dispersal are negatively influenced by patch configurational fragmentation especially at low patch availability again plant species with neighbouring dispersal are only impacted by patch connectivity with higher connectivity increasing plant species persistence see fig a1 the results in fig 1e are similar to that in fig 1d interestingly both plant and animal populations in fig 1f decline simultaneously to extinction with reducing patch availability and connectivity when comparing system robustness to landscape fragmentation in these six plant animal interactions i e both plant and animal species can coexist in a wider parameter range of patch availability and connectivity we find that neutralism is most robust to habitat loss and fragmentation while mutualism displays the most vulnerability as shown in fig 2 our patch dynamic model allows one to explore the individual effect of patch connectivity or patch availability independent of patch availability or patch connectivity on population occupancy clearly plant population occupancy increases with an increase in patch availability and connectivity in fig 2a c e it should be emphasized that in a plant animal mutualistic interaction plant species is sharply decreased to zero at certain values of patch loss and fragmentation similarly animal populations display an almost linearly increases in patch occupancy with increasing patch availability see fig 2b d but in fig 2f we find that increasing patch connectivity does not affect animal population occupancy in neutralism 0 0 while surprisingly patch occupancy in 0 and is decreased in other interactions patch connectivity obviously promotes animal population occupancy and thus species persistence again animal species are sharply declined to zero extinction at certain thresholds of patch availability and connectivity the final observation is that in most cases neutralism can maintain highest patch occupancy for both plant and animal species while lowest population occupancies are kept in predation interaction yet both plant and animal species in mutualistic interactions are most vulnerable to patch loss and fragmentation than those in other interactions as they display largest extinction thresholds defined as the maximum patch loss fragmentation above which a specie just goes extinct for both patch availability and connectivity i e they have lowest tolerance to patch loss and fragmentation 4 discussion with the model we find that system with neutral interaction between plants and animals can tolerate highest patch loss and fragmentation relative to other plant animal interactions this is because the persistence of plant and animal species is only determined by their own demographic characteristics such as intrinsic colonization and extinction rates for example from an metapopulation perspective animal species would not suffer or benefit from variation in plant population occupancy and their equilibrium population occupancy a s e a c a at the same time plant species persistence is influenced by both patch loss and fragmentation in such case both animal and plant species can co occur at the same local patch and thus own more habitat patches than other interactions yet in other cases both plant and animal species can interact negatively or positively to influence their persistence for example in negative interaction competition animal species can not invade into the patches already occupied by plant species while plants simultaneously can not colonize the patches already occupied by animals as such the fraction of colonisable patches for plant and animal is decreased compared to neutralism 0 0 in a predation interaction whether animal species can persist strongly depends on plant population occupancy as animal population can not survive in a patch without prey plant species as such even patch fragmentation does not affect animal species directly because of global dispersal but animal species are indirectly influenced by patch fragmentation due to a trophic cascade as we know plant species with neighbor dispersal are greatly restricted by habitat fragmentation liao et al 2013a b thus plant populations are decreased with patch fragmentation which further results in reduction in animal population because of trophic interaction in a mutualistic interaction both plant and animal populations are interdependent of each other i e animal species can not survive and reproduce in a local patch without plant species while plant species can not reproduce without animal species because of insect pollination e g honeybee such double dependence greatly destabilizes their system stability therefore system with neutral interaction displays most robustness to both patch loss and fragmentation whilst mutualism leads to most vulnerable systems counter intuitively negative plant animal interactions for example harmful for one or both species show stronger tolerance to habitat destruction i e higher species persistence than positive interactions e g beneficial to one or both species in spite of lower patch occupancy taking versus for example as explained above this is because there exists a double dependence between plants and animals in mutualism which greatly restricts their population growth yet such double dependence does not exist in a competitive system as both plant and animal species can invade into the colony site of each other except that there is an extra cost for both plants and animals if they co occur at the same patch to compete for space resources a final observational result is that in most cases predation leads to lowest population occupancy for both plant and animal species in the face of landscape fragmentation this is due to the fact that plant populations suffer from two pressures environmental disturbance including patch loss and fragmentation as well as predation by animal populations such double pressures result in lowest patch occupancy for plants which further restricts the growth of animal population via trophic cascading effects yet this does not mean that such trophic system stability is most vulnerable to habitat destruction in summary we use a patch dynamic model to simulate how patch loss and fragmentation separately and interactively affect six plant animal interactions with the model we find that systems with neutral interaction display most robust to both patch loss and fragmentation while mutualism results in most vulnerable systems surprisingly systems with negative interactions can tolerate more habitat destruction than those with positive interactions overall our modeling predictions offer

25343,structural and functional changes in a sandy beach ecosystem in the southwestern atlantic barra del chuy uruguay were assessed by contrasting four ecopath trophic models and performing temporal dynamic simulations using ecosim each model 1982 1989 1996 and 2012 represents a historical period of a clam fishery in which regulatory structure management tools and resource status varied substantially the results showed that this land ocean interface experienced significant changes reflected at the population and ecosystem levels owing to a combined effect of fishing and climate variability most system biomass excluding phytoplankton and detritus consisted of benthic invertebrates phytoplankton increased significantly over time whereas the biomass of benthic macrofaunal components varied among the periods due to bottom up processes mass mortalities of the harvested clams and fishing intensity major fishing impacts on the targeted clam and mass mortalities occurred concurrently with low phytoplankton biomass and clam recovery occurred in the absence of harvesting and increasing primary production ecosystem level attributes e g total system throughput ascendency showed considerable temporal fluctuations which were primarily related to changes in system productivity associated with a climatic shift from a cold phase to a warm phase and increasing onshore winds an analysis of robustness and order showed an ecosystem state lacking the flexibility to adapt to new perturbations dynamic simulations showed the prominent bottom up role of environmental variability on ecosystem function and structure temporal dynamics is conducted by changes in primary production forced mainly by temperature patterns the concurrent role of climate variations and fishing explained the long term dynamics of this ecosystem suggesting that sandy beaches are fragile social ecological systems whose services are increasingly threatened by long lasting stressors keywords sandy beach trophic modeling ecosystem approach to fisheries mesodesma mactroides ecopath with ecosim climatic variability 1 introduction the proper function of marine ecosystems is essential to sustain the services that they provide balvanera et al 2014 however diverse human activities impose a complex blend of effects on ecosystems costanza 1998 management of human activities in marine environments has evolved to better account for anthropogenic impacts and natural variability toward sustainable ecosystem services in this setting the ecosystem approach scbd 2004 has been developed as a planning procedure that integrates the management of human activities considering the structure and function of the ecosystems usually this approach requires practitioners to identify and take action on influences that are critical to the health of ecosystems thereby achieving sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services and maintenance of ecosystem integrity borja et al 2016 the ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf has been adopted to integrate the conservation of the structure diversity and function of ecosystems and the fisheries management actions taken to satisfy societal demands for food and economic benefits garcia et al 2003 fishery collapses may result from a combination of bottom up environmental and top down fishing effects e g overfishing and recruitment failures caused by adverse environmental conditions larkin 1996 boudreau et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to understand the species interactions along with the abiotic variables while recognizing the responses of fishers to changes in stock abundance in particular eaf requires an integrated system analysis that can differentiate between the human and natural factors underlying resource variability and ecosystem health in this vein climate variability strongly influences ocean productivity and these changes dramatically affect coastal marine ecosystems hoegh guldberg and bruno 2010 this is particularly noticeable in intertidal habitats that harbor valuable benthic small scale fisheries defeo et al 2016 where harvesting and environmental drivers acting together may alter demographic and life history traits of harvested species and may propagate to higher order ecological effects such as disruptions of food web linkages defeo et al 2013 food web based metrics are

on understanding population fluctuations of the target species the only one harvested in the study site as linked to environmental variability and fishing effort e g defeo et al 2016 however comprehensive studies to elucidate changes occurring in ecosystem structure and function and the interacting drivers of changes in these environments are still lacking we assessed temporal responses of the yellow clam population and ecosystem functioning and dynamics to concurrent changes in fishery management scenarios and primary production the research strategy included the implementation of static trophic models representing four different historical periods to obtain ecological indicators employed to analyze structural and functional changes in the ecosystem this description was complemented with dynamic simulations considering temporal changes in primary production fishing effort and trophic effects thus the main questions addressed were 1 how did the ecosystem structure and function changed over 30 years and 2 what were the main factors driving these changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area bcb is a dissipative sandy beach mean grain size 0 20mm sorting 0 70mm

macrobenthic communities among uruguayan beaches lercari and defeo 2006 2015 2 2 static food web modelling for each period a mass balanced model was developed through ecopath with ecosim 6 ewe6 the static trophic model ecopath assumes mass balance such that the production of a given ecological group is equal to the biomass lost to fishing or export predation and natural mortality other than predation christensen and walters 2004 the model considers that all inputs are equal to the outputs for each species or group through a series of simultaneous lineal equations which for each functional group is expressed as b i p b i e e i i 1 n b j q j b j d c j i e x i 0 where b is the biomass for group species i p b is the production biomass ratio ee is the ecotrophic efficiency indicating the proportion of the production that is utilized in the system values close to 1 mean a high utilization and values close to 0 represent a group having neither predation nor fishing in the system essington 2007 dc ji is the fraction of the prey i in the diet of the predator j qj bj is the consumption biomass ratio for predator j and exi is the export for prey i considering this equation for n groups a system of lineal equations is developed where at least three of the four parameters of each group b p b q b and ee must be known while the other one is estimated by the model to explore the consequences of fishing and environmental changes for the bcb trophic flows and the food web structure we modeled four periods of contrasting conditions during the past 30 years table 1 the first model represented the first period of the fishery 1981 1986 in which centralized management cm and open access led to a sharp increase in catches this phase was followed by a 2 year fishery closure and a reorganization of fishers into an informal co management scheme co m defeo 1998 this second period lasted 7 years 1987 1994 a third period 1994 2007 was characterized by mass mortalities mm that decimated clam populations across their entire distribution range including bcb ortega et al 2012 the yellow clam fishery was reopened in 2009 under an ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf and co management as the institutionalized lawn 19175 mechanism for stakeholder participation gianelli et al 2015 we followed the ecopath with the ecosim approach to perform an ecotrophic description for each period by computing both attributes for each trophic group and ecosystem level analysis christensen and walters 2004 regarding climatic variability in this region ortega et al 2013 the first and second historical periods cm and co m were characterized by the influence of cold waters in the area whereas warmer conditions dominated the last two periods mm and eaf on the other hand meridional wind speed anomaly mwsa proved to be critical in this ecosystem ortega et al 2013 oscillated around the mean until mid 2000s where a pronounced increase was observed 2 2 1 functional groups and parameterization this work covers a period of more than 30 years so the input data comes from a variety of sources detailed in supplementary materials a whenever possible we compiled period specific input data otherwise information was taken from the third modeled period lercari et al 2010 and assumed constant for all remaining periods our models describe a system dominated by macroinvertebrates and whenever possible we opt to conform functional groups by individual species biomass estimates were mainly obtained from intensive field sampling phytoplankton biomass was calculated from chlorophyll assessments or cell counts and converted to wet biomass odebrecht et al 1995a macrofaunal biomass estimates were obtained for each period through a systematic sampling from the sand dunes to the subtidal see defeo et al 1992 for methodological details performed at least seasonally for each period bird biomass was estimated based on seasonal surveys conducted on 2006 and 2012 p bi and q bi ratios were taken from previous studies made on the same system or from published information and corrected for local seawater temperature opitz 1996 dcij estimates were mainly compiled from published studies supplementary materials a yellow clam annual catch and effort were obtained from the national fisheries institute dinara official records ortega et al 2012 input data for every

sources of input data and diet matrices of every functional group and model is presented in supplementary materials a and b 2 2 2 model estimations analysis several properties of trophic network flows and topology were assessed ulanowicz 1996 a total system throughput tst is a measure of the ecosystem size in terms of biomass flows ulanowicz 1996 and was calculated as the sum of all flows consumption respiration detritus and export in the system b finn s cycling index which corresponds to the amount of tst that is recycled in a system allesina and ulanowicz 2004 c system omnivory index soi characterizes the extent to which an ecosystem exhibits web like features and may be also an attribute of ecosystem maturity christensen 1995 and was calculated as the average omnivory index of all consumers weighted by the logarithm of each consumer s food intake d connectance index ci was estimated as the ratio of the number of actual links to the number of possible links in the food web dunne et al 2002 we also used ascendency a overhead o and development capacity c as a triad of indicators derived from information theory ulanowicz 1996 if the location of a unit of energy is known the uncertainty about where it will flows is reduced by an amount called the average mutual information this magnitude captures the organization of the flow structure in a network then a is calculated as the average mutual information in a system scaled by the total system throughput tst in this way it quantifies both the level of activity and the degree of organization of the system the upper limit of a is c representing the scope of the system for further development o the difference between the c and a represents the ecosystem potential for recovery or innovative restructuring i e resilience patrıcio and marques 2006 following ulanowicz et al 2009 we measured sustainability in the bcb ecosystem by positioning the modeled periods in a hypothetical curve of ecosystem order vs ecosystem fitness for evolution or robustness ecosystem order a is defined as a a c 1 a 0 and is a relative measure of a or viewed as the organized power flowing within the system kharrazi et al 2013 the system s fitness for evolution f ka ln a where k e log e is a measure of the system s potential to evolve or self organize kharrazi et al 2013 all models were balanced according to the conditions referring to physiological and thermodynamics constrains christensen and walters 2004 it must be noted that only slight modifications of the diet input data were needed to attain mass balance supplementary materials b the ecopath pedigree index routine was used to describe the origin and quality of the data in the models pauly et al 2000 to ensure confidence and quality in the model design parameterization and fitting we followed the guidelines and criteria proposed by link 2010 and heymans et al 2016 2 3 temporal dynamic simulations the ecosim software was developed as a time dynamic simulation tool based on the static ecosystem description obtained by the ecopath model the set of linear equations implemented in ecopath are represented as differential equations walters et al 1997 christensen et al 2005 with the form d b i d t g i j q j i j q i j i i m i f i e i b i where dbi dt represents the biomass growth rate during a period of time for the group i gi is the net growth efficiency production consumption ratio mi is the non predation natural mortality rate fi is fishing mortality rate ei is the emigration rate ii is the immigration rate and qij is the consumption rate

forcing effects mij is the mediation forcing effects i e environmental time series and dj is the effects of handling time as a limit to consumption rate dj was used as default here and the feeding

walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 a critical step in development of reliable models is to show that they can at least reproduce observed historical responses to disturbances such as fishing and climate forcing ecosim walters et al 1997 allows fitting the model to an independent observed time series heymans et al 2016 using a hindcast procedure two ecosystem drivers fishing effort and primary production were included in the dynamic model of the last period eaf to explore their relative effects on the observed biomass and catch of m mactroides from 1993 to 2013 to this end we applied the automatic fitting procedure recently included in the ewe 6 5 version scott et al 2016 which is based on the conceptual approach developed by mackinson et al 2009 a combination of hypotheses models was parameterized to evaluate the top down fishing and bottom up controls changes in pp on the observed time series selecting the scenario that minimized the difference between observed and predicted values alternative hypotheses were tested to assess the isolated or combined effects of changes in predator prey dynamics i e predation vulnerability primary production pp and fishing effort on long term trends in yellow clam biomass and catch eight hypotheses were parameterized and compared considering the increase in the number of parameters and complexity a baseline a single scenario with no fishing effort f or environmental data pp applied to drive the model all vulnerabilities v were set to 2 default mixed control b baseline and trophic effects f v pp trophic effects were considered using an optimization search routine that iteratively finds a combination of values in the vulnerability matrix those more sensitive that minimizes the sum of squares ss of model predictions 10 most sensitive vulnerabilities producing the largest change on the ss were identified using the ecosim vulnerability search routine and allowed to change by the fitting procedure c baseline and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp an optimization search routine was used to draw a time series of annual relative pp representing historical productivity trends driving the model in this case pp was changed slightly in each run until a best fit to the time series reference data was achieved the maximum number of spline points allowed in the search of pp time series was 16 d baseline trophic effects and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp this hypothesis combined the three procedures mentioned previously the best fitting was obtained by changing trophic effects vulnerabilities and the annual relative pp time series restrictions on the number of vulnerabilities and spline points in the pp were the same that in b and c respectively e fishing f v pp relative fishing effort on the unique exploited species was included as a model driver resulting in a single ecosim scenario f fishing and trophic effects f v pp relative fishing effort was included

annual pp time series was applied as in c h fishing trophic effects and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp this hypothesis included all the possible ecosystem drivers relative fishing effort optimal vulnerabilities and the annual pp time series estimated following b and c following scott et al 2016 the automated routine tests all fitting combinations and sorts the diverse models by minimizing model predictions to time series observations using the weighted sum of squared differences ss and or the akaike information criterion aic this criterion penalizes for fitting too many parameters based on the number of time series available for estimating the ss the formula used for the aic was defined as a i c n log m i n s s n 2 k where n is the total number of observations minss is the minimum sum of squares and k is the number of parameters estimated in addition the procedure also calculates the aicc to address small sample size defined as a i c c a i c 2 k k 1 n k 1 best fit model was selected based on a combination of low ss low aicc and the visualization of the fitting along all the reference time series the time series of pp anomaly obtained by the fitting procedure mentioned above was related to environmental variables using the spearman s rank order correlation test alexander et al 2015 to assess their relative influence in the dynamics of the system

averaging mwsa from a 10 x 20 grid cells at 1000mb pressure level and ssta from 4 x 3 grid cells of the south atlantic ocean shelf and the adjacent oceanic region 3 results 3 1 static food web

thermodynamic and physiological constraints and showed normal trends for biomass and vital rates across trophic levels e g a decline in biomass of larger sized organisms at upper trophic levels supplementary materials c species composition presence absence showed minor long term changes and most of the system s biomass excluding phytoplankton and detritus consisted of benthic invertebrates table 3 the ecosystem structure in terms of biomass clearly differed among the periods fig 2 in the first period nearly 50 of the total macrofaunal biomass was composed exclusively of m mactroides and 25 was composed of other filter feeders including e brasiliensis and d hanleyanus in the second period co m no major relative changes in m mactroides biomass were observed whereas the other sympatric filter feeders decreased and gastropods increased in the third period mm m mactroides biomass dropped nearly 40 whereas the biomasses of d hanleyanus and e brasiliensis reached their highest values 33 and 43 respectively concurrently gastropods decreased in biomass but maintained their status as the most abundant non filter feeding group in the last period eaf the biomass of m mactroides represented nearly 98 of the total macrobenthic community in the second period co m large biomasses of predatory gastropods were found o auricularia and o formicacorsii and the polychaete h olivieri had a higher biomass than that in the previous period table 2 in the fourth period eaf an increase in m mactroides biomass occurred in conjunction with a very low abundance of gastropods the only remaining invertebrate predators were h olivieri and the gastropod b duarteii phytoplankton biomass increased by a factor of 7 from the first cm to the last period eaf table 2 trophic levels table 3 estimated for benthic invertebrates fish and seabird functional groups were within the usual range eddy et al 2017 found in coastal estuarine ecosystems in the first regime cm filter feeders and detritivores dominated the system with few invertebrates acting as intermediate predators gastropods and vertebrates fishes and birds as top predators in the third period mm the trophic level of invertebrate predators increased and nearly matched that of the vertebrates table 3 the analysis of ecosystem level attributes table 4 showed that tst was lowest during the first modeled period cm and tended to increase over time except during the third mm period flow partitioning estimates exports respiration consumption and flows to detritus showed very similar functions for the four periods most flows were assigned to detritus 45 50 of tst and exports 43 48 and only a minor proportion was assigned to consumption and respiration in the food web 3 12 the relative importance of consumption and respiration increased in the co m period total biomass and the system omnivory index connectance index and total biomass total throughput did not show clear temporal trends the indicators derived from the network analysis showed that the a increased over time ranging from 47 in the first period cm to 78 in the last period eaf consequently overhead decreased while order i e relative a increased and fitness to evolve or robustness decreased fig 3 3 2 dynamic simulations and model fitting fig 4 shows the models fitted for each hypothesis tested in all cases aicc exponentially increased with the number of parameters the best fit was obtained when considering fishing trophic effects and pp anomaly simultaneously scenarios including pp anomaly present smaller aicc values than scenarios considering fishing and trophic effects thus pp may be considered as the most influential variable on system dynamics followed by fishing and trophic effects the model that yielded the lowest aicc showed a mismatch between predicted and observed data in the last years of the reference time series when the highest clam biomass occurred taking into account that the choice of the best fit model may be subjective as it only reflects the statistical fit scott et al 2016 our best model was selected among those with lower aicc but lowest ss which provided a best match between observed and predicted along the simulated time series the selected model accurately reproduced long term trends in biomass and catch for the yellow clam m mactroides table 5 fig 5 this model takes into consideration the fishing effort a 8 spline points pp anomaly and a phytoplankton mesodesma mactroides vulnerability value of 1 06 reflecting a bottom up control in this trophic interaction all other vulnerabilities maintain the default i e 2 mixed control value time series used during ecosim analysis are shown on supplementary materials e 3 3 climatic variability and effects on pp sst was the only variable significantly correlated with the annual mean time series of pp anomaly for the region spearman s rank order correlation of 0 8 supplementary materials e these results suggest that pp anomaly was largely influenced by sst in the region 4 discussion 4 1 main trends our study shows the following a bcb experienced important changes that were reflected at the species and ecosystem levels b clam population recovery happened in the absence of harvesting during an increase in primary production of the system and c ecosystem level attributes showed considerable temporal fluctuations primarily related to changes in system productivity theses changes were associated with a climatic shift from a cold phase to a warm phase that ocurred in the region the first period cm coincided with low primary production and high fishing pressure associated with low m mactroides biomass small system size tst and organization a c in the second period the co m was accompanied by a tenfold increase in phytoplankton and high m mactroides biomass which increased the overall ecosystem biomass changing the trophic levels and modifying network attributes during these 2 periods the system was in a cold regime when offshore winds prevailed the third period mm was characterized by an intermediate level of primary production and a marked reduction in m mactroides biomass concurrent with an increase in other sympatric filter feeders this occurred after a switch to the north direction in wind speed anomalies and a regime shift from a cold to a warm phase ortega et al 2013 the overall biomass was the lowest of all periods with changes in trophic network attributes finally the eaf period showed high primary production and m mactroides biomass together with the highest system size tst and organization a c in this period warmer temperatures and onshore winds prevailed in the area 4 2 ecosystem structure biomass distribution across trophic levels showed considerable changes among the periods during the second period co m an increase in total biomass was driven primarily by invertebrate species notably m mactroides and also by an elevated in situ pp the recovery of m mactroides cannot be ascribed solely to the reduction in fishing effort but appears to be the result of a complex combination of moderate exploitation bioeconomic factors and climate variability ortega et al 2012 our results suggest that fluctuations in primary production were an important forcing factor for m mactroides biomass moreover the increasing trend in pp was accompanied by an increase in temperature and a northward shift in wind direction and speed anomaly therefore bottom up mechanisms may play a relevant role in the structure of beach communities and should be further explored 4 3 ecosystem level attributes the total system throughput tst as a measure of a system size or vigor also showed considerable fluctuations primarily related to changes in system productivity high tst values may be related to a high availability of nutrients that results in a high export of biomass griffiths et al 1983 mclachlan 1983 and may be influenced by two factors elevated pp at the surf zone of some dissipative sandy beaches odebrecht et al 2014 and terrigenous detritus inputs bergamino et al 2013 at bcb asterionellopsis guyunusae a diatom species adapted to surf zone conditions may reach a high abundance generating not only a vast algal standing stock chl a 1647μgl 1 but also elevated pp rates reaching 6 0mgcl 1 h 1 odebrecht et al 1995a reynaldi 2000 rörig and garcia 2003 this last feature may explain the elevated tst found in bcb strong temporal variability is typical of these algal blooms which are driven primarily by seasonal meteorological patterns but are also influenced by large scale events such as enso which may lead to significant inter annual changes in surf diatom populations odebrechtet al 2014 in this sense the increase in temperature and onshore winds northwards documented here may trigger autochthonous primary production as supported by the observation that average phytoplankton concentrations tended to increase over time in near shore waters boyce and worm 2015 changes in temperature and nutrient supply rates have been described as leading causes of these phytoplankton trends boyce and worm 2015 southerly onshore winds could be the main factor accumulating cells at surf zones of sandy beaches in the southwestern atlantic odebrecht et al 1995a the indices based on primary production e g pp r or pp b were greater than 1 in the four modeled periods suggesting that bcb remained in a lower development state this result may be due to the almost constant excess of nutrients rather than ecological succession this possibility has been proposed by heymans and mclachlan 1996 who have noted that the episodic nature of production giving rise to a high pp b ratio e g in upwelling systems should be taken not as an indicator of system immaturity but instead as a highly adaptive response to the physical nature of the oceanographic regime in contrast with these observations the intermediate to high estimated values of the indicators of ecosystem growth and development suggest a trend toward a more mature ecosystem state from the first to the last modeled periods thus the increase in maturity in this particular system may not be related to higher primary production but may reflect an enhanced organization of the food web ulanowicz 1996 furthermore the overhead i e the degrees of freedom available to the system diminished from the first cm to the last eaf period thus suggesting that this system has a minor amount of flexibility to adapt its food web structure to perturbations ulanowicz 2004 the elevated degree of order and the low fitness to evolve robustness found in the final period eaf is a potential early warning sign to take into account when managing the yellow clam fishery ecosystems showing high ascendency may be considered to be rigid and to lack sufficient freedom and flexibility to adapt to perturbations this situation may be encompassed into the adaptive cycles perspective holling 1973 white et al 2010 putting our studied area at the end of a conservation phase probably facing a release phase if external and or intrinsic perturbations occurs analyses of how ecosystems are distributed over the domain of robustness and degree of order a vs f see fig 3 and thus the criteria defining the ecosystem vitality window are beginning to be reported fath 2014 however a values between 0 3 and 0 5 are frequent in ecological networks ulanowicz et al 2014 nevertheless the four modeled periods showed a 0 5 which may be attributed to the small dimensions less than 20 compartments of the sandy beach network and the nutrient overabundance thus highlighting the uniqueness of these ecosystems 4 4 temporal simulations the model was able to reproduce the reference time series of the dominant species m mactroides which represents the only fishery resource in the ecosystem when we assessed the differential contributions of abiotic forcing and fishing effort to fit the reference data the prominent bottom up role of environmental variability on ecosystem function and structure became evident this observation is in line with the model independent conclusions obtained by ortega et al 2016 regarding the concurrent effects of climate and harvesting acting as interacting distal and proximate factors österblom et al 2016 concerning the former long term variations in ssta in the study region displayed a regime shift from a cold to a warm phase after 1997 ortega et al 2012 in addition mwsa displayed a quasi decadal oscillatory pattern with an increasing trend over time ortega et al 2013 our long term analysis has revealed the drastic effects of climatic variability producing large fluctuations and shifts in abundance of sandy beach macrofauna see also arntz et al 1987 celentano and defeo 2016 this is especially noticeable in broadcast spawners with planktonic larval dispersal as the yellow clam which usually behave as resurgent populations mclachlan et al 1996 these species are very sensitive to variations in sea water temperature and concurrent changes in environmental conditions defeo et al 2016 indeed our work suggests that specific mechanisms causing these trends may be ascribed to changes in pp forced by temperature and wind patterns these changes could also drastically alter habitat quality and ecosystem health properties including changes in beach morphodynamics ortega et al 2013 and increasing occurrence of red tides odebrecht et al 1995b the drastic yellow clam population fluctuations were accompanied by increasing occurrence of pathogens and body abnormalities ortega et al 2016 our long term holistic analysis showed the importance of implementing a broad environmental monitoring program that considers not only the targeted species and fishing indicators but also the trophic relationships and primary production fluctuations occurring in the ecosystem bcb attained a highly organized structure thus losing robustness may make it vulnerable to environmental fluctuations this conclusion highlights the need to conduct dynamic simulations of environmental and fishery scenarios in these fragile social

25343,structural and functional changes in a sandy beach ecosystem in the southwestern atlantic barra del chuy uruguay were assessed by contrasting four ecopath trophic models and performing temporal dynamic simulations using ecosim each model 1982 1989 1996 and 2012 represents a historical period of a clam fishery in which regulatory structure management tools and resource status varied substantially the results showed that this land ocean interface experienced significant changes reflected at the population and ecosystem levels owing to a combined effect of fishing and climate variability most system biomass excluding phytoplankton and detritus consisted of benthic invertebrates phytoplankton increased significantly over time whereas the biomass of benthic macrofaunal components varied among the periods due to bottom up processes mass mortalities of the harvested clams and fishing intensity major fishing impacts on the targeted clam and mass mortalities occurred concurrently with low phytoplankton biomass and clam recovery occurred in the absence of harvesting and increasing primary production ecosystem level attributes e g total system throughput ascendency showed considerable temporal fluctuations which were primarily related to changes in system productivity associated with a climatic shift from a cold phase to a warm phase and increasing onshore winds an analysis of robustness and order showed an ecosystem state lacking the flexibility to adapt to new perturbations dynamic simulations showed the prominent bottom up role of environmental variability on ecosystem function and structure temporal dynamics is conducted by changes in primary production forced mainly by temperature patterns the concurrent role of climate variations and fishing explained the long term dynamics of this ecosystem suggesting that sandy beaches are fragile social ecological systems whose services are increasingly threatened by long lasting stressors keywords sandy beach trophic modeling ecosystem approach to fisheries mesodesma mactroides ecopath with ecosim climatic variability 1 introduction the proper function of marine ecosystems is essential to sustain the services that they provide balvanera et al 2014 however diverse human activities impose a complex blend of effects on ecosystems costanza 1998 management of human activities in marine environments has evolved to better account for anthropogenic impacts and natural variability toward sustainable ecosystem services in this setting the ecosystem approach scbd 2004 has been developed as a planning procedure that integrates the management of human activities considering the structure and function of the ecosystems usually this approach requires practitioners to identify and take action on influences that are critical to the health of ecosystems thereby achieving sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services and maintenance of ecosystem integrity borja et al 2016 the ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf has been adopted to integrate the conservation of the structure diversity and function of ecosystems and the fisheries management actions taken to satisfy societal demands for food and economic benefits garcia et al 2003 fishery collapses may result from a combination of bottom up environmental and top down fishing effects e g overfishing and recruitment failures caused by adverse environmental conditions larkin 1996 boudreau et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to understand the species interactions along with the abiotic variables while recognizing the responses of fishers to changes in stock abundance in particular eaf requires an integrated system analysis that can differentiate between the human and natural factors underlying resource variability and ecosystem health in this vein climate variability strongly influences ocean productivity and these changes dramatically affect coastal marine ecosystems hoegh guldberg and bruno 2010 this is particularly noticeable in intertidal habitats that harbor valuable benthic small scale fisheries defeo et al 2016 where harvesting and environmental drivers acting together may alter demographic and life history traits of harvested species and may propagate to higher order ecological effects such as disruptions of food web linkages defeo et al 2013 food web based metrics are fundamental measures of ecosystem structure and function cury and christensen 2005 libralato et al 2014 which convey information about the dynamics patterns and processes of fisheries management ices 2014 fisheries regulation pollution reduction pest control and other management activities benefit from information about food web components which are also necessary for defining the environmental sustainability of marine ecosystems fath 2015 eu directive 2008 some food web indicators are potentially useful as proxies for decision criteria in eaf link 2002 shannon et al 2014 including the mean trophic levels of the catches and the primary production required to sustain the fisheries pauly et al 1998 branch et al 2010 moreover comparative modeling studies in which trophic representations of the same system are developed for different time periods shannon et al 2014 coll et al 2009 allow comparisons of the changes in ecosystem structure and trophic relationships due to fishing environmental perturbations or combinations thereof corrales et al 2015 in this way modeling can provide scientifically based information on ecosystem health to regulatory and management systems and constitute an essential input in data poor situations such as in the benthic small scale fisheries referred above in latin america few studies have focused on analyzing the changes in food web structure in relation to resource management and environmental variations ortiz and wolff 2002 neira et al 2014 barra del chuy beach bcb is an exposed intertidal ecosystem on the atlantic coast of uruguay with a rich and abundant benthic community defeo et al 1992 in this highly productive ecosystem seabirds fishes and gastropods are top predators lercari et al 2010 the trophic function of this system elucidated through stable isotopes shows the combined importance of autochthonous phytoplankton and terrestrial organic matter infueling the food web bergamino et al 2013 the yellow clam mesodesma mactroides constitutes a major portion of the total community biomass at bcb it has been harvested by indigenous people since prehistoric times villamarzo 2010 during the past 50 years this species has been subject to a small scale fishery ortega et al 2012 which has undergone contrasting phases of management regulatory and resource status gianelli et al 2015 several studies have focused on understanding population fluctuations of the target species the only one harvested in the study site as linked to environmental variability and fishing effort e g defeo et al 2016 however comprehensive studies to elucidate changes occurring in ecosystem structure and function and the interacting drivers of changes in these environments are still lacking we assessed temporal responses of the yellow clam population and ecosystem functioning and dynamics to concurrent changes in fishery management scenarios and primary production the research strategy included the implementation of static trophic models representing four different historical periods to obtain ecological indicators employed to analyze structural and functional changes in the ecosystem this description was complemented with dynamic simulations considering temporal changes in primary production fishing effort and trophic effects thus the main questions addressed were 1 how did the ecosystem structure and function changed over 30 years and 2 what were the main factors driving these changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area bcb is a dissipative sandy beach mean grain size 0 20mm sorting 0 70mm

intertidal sandy beaches are peculiar ecosystems because of their small dimensions and ecological simplicity the high productivity of this microtidal system sustains the highest diversity of macrobenthic communities among uruguayan beaches lercari and defeo 2006 2015 2 2 static food web modelling for each period a mass balanced model was developed through ecopath with ecosim 6 ewe6 the static trophic model ecopath assumes mass balance such that the production of a given ecological group is equal to the biomass lost to fishing or export predation and natural mortality other than predation christensen and walters 2004 the model considers that all inputs are equal to the outputs for each species or group through a series of simultaneous lineal equations which for each functional group is expressed as b i p b i e e i i 1 n b j q j b j d c j i e x i 0 where b is the biomass for group species i p b is the production biomass ratio ee is the ecotrophic efficiency indicating the proportion of the production that is utilized in the system values close to 1 mean a high utilization and values close to 0 represent a group having neither predation nor fishing in the system essington 2007 dc ji is the fraction of the prey i in the diet of the predator j qj bj is the consumption biomass ratio for predator j and exi is the export for prey i considering this equation for n groups a system of lineal equations is developed where at least three of the four parameters of each group b p b q b and ee must be known while the other one is estimated by the model to explore the consequences of fishing and environmental changes for the bcb trophic flows and the food web structure we modeled four periods of contrasting conditions during the past 30 years table 1 the first model represented the first period of the fishery 1981 1986 in which centralized management cm and open access led to a sharp increase in catches this phase was followed by a 2 year fishery closure and a reorganization of fishers into an informal co management scheme co m defeo 1998 this second period lasted 7 years 1987 1994 a third period 1994 2007 was characterized by mass mortalities mm that decimated clam populations across their entire distribution range including bcb ortega et al 2012 the yellow clam fishery was reopened in 2009 under an ecosystem approach to fisheries eaf and co management as the institutionalized lawn 19175 mechanism for stakeholder participation gianelli et al 2015 we followed the ecopath with the ecosim approach to perform an ecotrophic description for each period by computing both attributes for each trophic group and ecosystem level analysis christensen and walters 2004 regarding climatic variability in this region ortega et al 2013 the first and second historical periods cm and co m were characterized by the influence of cold waters in the area whereas warmer conditions dominated the last two periods mm and eaf on the other hand meridional wind speed anomaly mwsa proved to be critical in this ecosystem ortega et al 2013 oscillated around the mean until mid 2000s where a pronounced increase was observed 2 2 1 functional groups and parameterization this work covers a period of more than 30 years so the input data comes from a variety of sources detailed in supplementary materials a whenever possible we compiled period specific input data otherwise information was taken from the third modeled period lercari et al 2010 and assumed constant for all remaining periods our models describe a system dominated by macroinvertebrates and whenever possible we opt to conform functional groups by individual species biomass estimates were mainly obtained from intensive field sampling phytoplankton biomass was calculated from chlorophyll assessments or cell counts and converted to wet biomass odebrecht et al 1995a macrofaunal biomass estimates were obtained for each period through a systematic sampling from the sand dunes to the subtidal see defeo et al 1992 for methodological details performed at least seasonally for each period bird biomass was estimated based on seasonal surveys conducted on 2006 and 2012 p bi and q bi ratios were taken from previous studies made on the same system or from published information and corrected for local seawater temperature opitz 1996 dcij estimates were mainly compiled from published studies supplementary materials a yellow clam annual catch and effort were obtained from the national fisheries institute dinara official records ortega et al 2012 input data for every balanced model is shown in table 2 while diet information before and after the balance is shown in supplementary materials b detailed information about functional groups composition references of sources of input data and diet matrices of every functional group and model is presented in supplementary materials a and b 2 2 2 model estimations analysis several properties of trophic network flows and topology were assessed ulanowicz 1996 a total system throughput tst is a measure of the ecosystem size in terms of biomass flows ulanowicz 1996 and was calculated as the sum of all flows consumption respiration detritus and export in the system b finn s cycling index which corresponds to the amount of tst that is recycled in a system allesina and ulanowicz 2004 c system omnivory index soi characterizes the extent to which an ecosystem exhibits web like features and may be also an attribute of ecosystem maturity christensen 1995 and was calculated as the average omnivory index of all consumers weighted by the logarithm of each consumer s food intake d connectance index ci was estimated as the ratio of the number of actual links to the number of possible links in the food web dunne et al 2002 we also used ascendency a overhead o and development capacity c as a triad of indicators derived from information theory ulanowicz 1996 if the location of a unit of energy is known the uncertainty about where it will flows is reduced by an amount called the average mutual information this magnitude captures the organization of the flow structure in a network then a is calculated as the average mutual information in a system scaled by the total system throughput tst in this way it quantifies both the level of activity and the degree of organization of the system the upper limit of a is c representing the scope of the system for further development o the difference between the c and a represents the ecosystem potential for recovery or innovative restructuring i e resilience patrıcio and marques 2006 following ulanowicz et al 2009 we measured sustainability in the bcb ecosystem by positioning the modeled periods in a hypothetical curve of ecosystem order vs ecosystem fitness for evolution or robustness ecosystem order a is defined as a a c 1 a 0 and is a relative measure of a or viewed as the organized power flowing within the system kharrazi et al 2013 the system s fitness for evolution f ka ln a where k e log e is a measure of the system s potential to evolve or self organize kharrazi et al 2013 all models were balanced according to the conditions referring to physiological and thermodynamics constrains christensen and walters 2004 it must be noted that only slight modifications of the diet input data were needed to attain mass balance supplementary materials b the ecopath pedigree index routine was used to describe the origin and quality of the data in the models pauly et al 2000 to ensure confidence and quality in the model design parameterization and fitting we followed the guidelines and criteria proposed by link 2010 and heymans et al 2016 2 3 temporal dynamic simulations the ecosim software was developed as a time dynamic simulation tool based on the static ecosystem description obtained by the ecopath model the set of linear equations implemented in ecopath are represented as differential equations walters et al 1997 christensen et al 2005 with the form d b i d t g i j q j i j q i j i i m i f i e i b i where dbi dt represents the biomass growth rate during a period of time for the group i gi is the net growth efficiency production consumption ratio mi is the non predation natural mortality rate fi is fishing mortality rate ei is the emigration rate ii is the immigration rate and qij is the consumption rate which is estimated following the foraging arena concept walters et al 1997 where bi are divided into two components one vulnerable and other invulnerable to predation q i j a i j v i j b i b j t i t j s i j m i j d j v i j v i j t i m i j a i j m i j b j s i j t j d j the transfer rate between these two components called vulnerability vij expresses the rate where the prey moves between being vulnerable and not vulnerable for a given predator aij is the effective search rate for i by j ti and tj are the relative feeding time for prey and predator sij indicates the seasonal or long term forcing effects mij is the mediation forcing effects i e environmental time series and dj is the effects of handling time as a limit to consumption rate dj was used as default here and the feeding time adjustment rate was set to 0 christensen et al 2005 vulnerabilities determine the control type in each predator prey interaction bottom up 1 i e donor driven mixed default value 2 or top down 2 walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 a critical step in development of reliable models is to show that they can at least reproduce observed historical responses to disturbances such as fishing and climate forcing ecosim walters et al 1997 allows fitting the model to an independent observed time series heymans et al 2016 using a hindcast procedure two ecosystem drivers fishing effort and primary production were included in the dynamic model of the last period eaf to explore their relative effects on the observed biomass and catch of m mactroides from 1993 to 2013 to this end we applied the automatic fitting procedure recently included in the ewe 6 5 version scott et al 2016 which is based on the conceptual approach developed by mackinson et al 2009 a combination of hypotheses models was parameterized to evaluate the top down fishing and bottom up controls changes in pp on the observed time series selecting the scenario that minimized the difference between observed and predicted values alternative hypotheses were tested to assess the isolated or combined effects of changes in predator prey dynamics i e predation vulnerability primary production pp and fishing effort on long term trends in yellow clam biomass and catch eight hypotheses were parameterized and compared considering the increase in the number of parameters and complexity a baseline a single scenario with no fishing effort f or environmental data pp applied to drive the model all vulnerabilities v were set to 2 default mixed control b baseline and trophic effects f v pp trophic effects were considered using an optimization search routine that iteratively finds a combination of values in the vulnerability matrix those more sensitive that minimizes the sum of squares ss of model predictions 10 most sensitive vulnerabilities producing the largest change on the ss were identified using the ecosim vulnerability search routine and allowed to change by the fitting procedure c baseline and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp an optimization search routine was used to draw a time series of annual relative pp representing historical productivity trends driving the model in this case pp was changed slightly in each run until a best fit to the time series reference data was achieved the maximum number of spline points allowed in the search of pp time series was 16 d baseline trophic effects and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp this hypothesis combined the three procedures mentioned previously the best fitting was obtained by changing trophic effects vulnerabilities and the annual relative pp time series restrictions on the number of vulnerabilities and spline points in the pp were the same that in b and c respectively e fishing f v pp relative fishing effort on the unique exploited species was included as a model driver resulting in a single ecosim scenario f fishing and trophic effects f v pp relative fishing effort was included as a model driver optimal vulnerabilities were identified as in b g fishing and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp relative fishing effort was included as a model driver and in addition the annual pp time series was applied as in c h fishing trophic effects and environmentally driven changes in pp f v pp this hypothesis included all the possible ecosystem drivers relative fishing effort optimal vulnerabilities and the annual pp time series estimated following b and c following scott et al 2016 the automated routine tests all fitting combinations and sorts the diverse models by minimizing model predictions to time series observations using the weighted sum of squared differences ss and or the akaike information criterion aic this criterion penalizes for fitting too many parameters based on the number of time series available for estimating the ss the formula used for the aic was defined as a i c n log m i n s s n 2 k where n is the total number of observations minss is the minimum sum of squares and k is the number of parameters estimated in addition the procedure also calculates the aicc to address small sample size defined as a i c c a i c 2 k k 1 n k 1 best fit model was selected based on a combination of low ss low aicc and the visualization of the fitting along all the reference time series the time series of pp anomaly obtained by the fitting procedure mentioned above was related to environmental variables using the spearman s rank order correlation test alexander et al 2015 to assess their relative influence in the dynamics of the system these variables are intended to reflect long term trends and variability of regional climate and included i sea surface temperature sst ii sst anomaly ssta iii meridional wind speed anomaly mwsa and iv three different annual measures of the oceanic niño index oni maximum minimum and average mwsa sst and ssta data were downloaded from the open access iri ldeo climate data library kalnay et al 1996 reynolds et al 2002 historical oni measures were obtained from the noaa climate prediction center accessed september 29th noaa climate prediction centre 2015 regional mwsa and ssta were calculated by averaging mwsa from a 10 x 20 grid cells at 1000mb pressure level and ssta from 4 x 3 grid cells of the south atlantic ocean shelf and the adjacent oceanic region 3 results 3 1 static food web modeling basic estimated parameters i e model outputs produced for each functional group allowed us to compare long term variations in the ecosystem structure table 3 the four models fulfilled the thermodynamic and physiological constraints and showed normal trends for biomass and vital rates across trophic levels e g a decline in biomass of larger sized organisms at upper trophic levels supplementary materials c species composition presence absence showed minor long term changes and most of the system s biomass excluding phytoplankton and detritus consisted of benthic invertebrates table 3 the ecosystem structure in terms of biomass clearly differed among the periods fig 2 in the first period nearly 50 of the total macrofaunal biomass was composed exclusively of m mactroides and 25 was composed of other filter feeders including e brasiliensis and d hanleyanus in the second period co m no major relative changes in m mactroides biomass were observed whereas the other sympatric filter feeders decreased and gastropods increased in the third period mm m mactroides biomass dropped nearly 40 whereas the biomasses of d hanleyanus and e brasiliensis reached their highest values 33 and 43 respectively concurrently gastropods decreased in biomass but maintained their status as the most abundant non filter feeding group in the last period eaf the biomass of m mactroides represented nearly 98 of the total macrobenthic community in the second period co m large biomasses of predatory gastropods were found o auricularia and o formicacorsii and the polychaete h olivieri had a higher biomass than that in the previous period table 2 in the fourth period eaf an increase in m mactroides biomass occurred in conjunction with a very low abundance of gastropods the only remaining invertebrate predators were h olivieri and the gastropod b duarteii phytoplankton biomass increased by a factor of 7 from the first cm to the last period eaf table 2 trophic levels table 3 estimated for benthic invertebrates fish and seabird functional groups were within the usual range eddy et al 2017 found in coastal estuarine ecosystems in the first regime cm filter feeders and detritivores dominated the system with few invertebrates acting as intermediate predators gastropods and vertebrates fishes and birds as top predators in the third period mm the trophic level of invertebrate predators increased and nearly matched that of the vertebrates table 3 the analysis of ecosystem level attributes table 4 showed that tst was lowest during the first modeled period cm and tended to increase over time except during the third mm period flow partitioning estimates exports respiration consumption and flows to detritus showed very similar functions for the four periods most flows were assigned to detritus 45 50 of tst and exports 43 48 and only a minor proportion was assigned to consumption and respiration in the food web 3 12 the relative importance of consumption and respiration increased in the co m period total biomass and the system omnivory index connectance index and total biomass total throughput did not show clear temporal trends the indicators derived from the network analysis showed that the a increased over time ranging from 47 in the first period cm to 78 in the last period eaf consequently overhead decreased while order i e relative a increased and fitness to evolve or robustness decreased fig 3 3 2 dynamic simulations and model fitting fig 4 shows the models fitted for each hypothesis tested in all cases aicc exponentially increased with the number of parameters the best fit was obtained when considering fishing trophic effects and pp anomaly simultaneously scenarios including pp anomaly present smaller aicc values than scenarios considering fishing and trophic effects thus pp may be considered as the most influential variable on system dynamics followed by fishing and trophic effects the model that yielded the lowest aicc showed a mismatch between predicted and observed data in the last years of the reference time series when the highest clam biomass occurred taking into account that the choice of the best fit model may be subjective as it only reflects the statistical fit scott et al 2016 our best model was selected among those with lower aicc but lowest ss which provided a best match between observed and predicted along the simulated time series the selected model accurately reproduced long term trends in biomass and catch for the yellow clam m mactroides table 5 fig 5 this model takes into consideration the fishing effort a 8 spline points pp anomaly and a phytoplankton mesodesma mactroides vulnerability value of 1 06 reflecting a bottom up control in this trophic interaction all other vulnerabilities maintain the default i e 2 mixed control value time series used during ecosim analysis are shown on supplementary materials e 3 3 climatic variability and effects on pp sst was the only variable significantly correlated with the annual mean time series of pp anomaly for the region spearman s rank order correlation of 0 8 supplementary materials e these results suggest that pp anomaly was largely influenced by sst in the region 4 discussion 4 1 main trends our study shows the following a bcb experienced important changes that were reflected at the species and ecosystem levels b clam population recovery happened in the absence of harvesting during an increase in primary production of the system and c ecosystem level attributes showed considerable temporal fluctuations primarily related to changes in system productivity theses changes were associated with a climatic shift from a cold phase to a warm phase that ocurred in the region the first period cm coincided with low primary production and high fishing pressure associated with low m mactroides biomass small system size tst and organization a c in the second period the co m was accompanied by a tenfold increase in phytoplankton and high m mactroides biomass which increased the overall ecosystem biomass changing the trophic levels and modifying network attributes during these 2 periods the system was in a cold regime when offshore winds prevailed the third period mm was characterized by an intermediate level of primary production and a marked reduction in m mactroides biomass concurrent with an increase in other sympatric filter feeders this occurred after a switch to the north direction in wind speed anomalies and a regime shift from a cold to a warm phase ortega et al 2013 the overall biomass was the lowest of all periods with changes in trophic network attributes finally the eaf period showed high primary production and m mactroides biomass together with the highest system size tst and organization a c in this period warmer temperatures and onshore winds prevailed in the area 4 2 ecosystem structure biomass distribution across trophic levels showed considerable changes among the periods during the second period co m an increase in total biomass was driven primarily by invertebrate species notably m mactroides and also by an elevated in situ pp the recovery of m mactroides cannot be ascribed solely to the reduction in fishing effort but appears to be the result of a complex combination of moderate exploitation bioeconomic factors and climate variability ortega et al 2012 our results suggest that fluctuations in primary production were an important forcing factor for m mactroides biomass moreover the increasing trend in pp was accompanied by an increase in temperature and a northward shift in wind direction and speed anomaly therefore bottom up mechanisms may play a relevant role in the structure of beach communities and should be further explored 4 3 ecosystem level attributes the total system throughput tst as a measure of a system size or vigor also showed considerable fluctuations primarily related to changes in system productivity high tst values may be related to a high availability of nutrients that results in a high export of biomass griffiths et al 1983 mclachlan 1983 and may be influenced by two factors elevated pp at the surf zone of some dissipative sandy beaches odebrecht et al 2014 and terrigenous detritus inputs bergamino et al 2013 at bcb asterionellopsis guyunusae a diatom species adapted to surf zone conditions may reach a high abundance generating not only a vast algal standing stock chl a 1647μgl 1 but also elevated pp rates reaching 6 0mgcl 1 h 1 odebrecht et al 1995a reynaldi 2000 rörig and garcia 2003 this last feature may explain the elevated tst found in bcb strong temporal variability is typical of these algal blooms which are driven primarily by seasonal meteorological patterns but are also influenced by large scale events such as enso which may lead to significant inter annual changes in surf diatom populations odebrechtet al 2014 in this sense the increase in temperature and onshore winds northwards documented here may trigger autochthonous primary production as supported by the observation that average phytoplankton concentrations tended to increase over time in near shore waters boyce and worm 2015 changes in temperature and nutrient supply rates have been described as leading causes of these phytoplankton trends boyce and worm 2015 southerly onshore winds could be the main factor accumulating cells at surf zones of sandy beaches in the southwestern atlantic odebrecht et al 1995a the indices based on primary production e g pp r or pp b were greater than 1 in the four modeled periods suggesting that bcb remained in a lower development state this result may be due to the almost constant excess of nutrients rather than ecological succession this possibility has been proposed by heymans and mclachlan 1996 who have noted that the episodic nature of production giving rise to a high pp b ratio e g in upwelling systems should be taken not as an indicator of system immaturity but instead as a highly adaptive response to the physical nature of the oceanographic regime in contrast with these observations the intermediate to high estimated values of the indicators of ecosystem growth and development suggest a trend toward a more mature ecosystem state from the first to the last modeled periods thus the increase in maturity in this particular system may not be related to higher primary production but may reflect an enhanced organization of the food web ulanowicz 1996 furthermore the overhead i e the degrees of freedom available to the system diminished from the first cm to the last eaf period thus suggesting that this system has a minor amount of flexibility to adapt its food web structure to perturbations ulanowicz 2004 the elevated degree of order and the low fitness to evolve robustness found in the final period eaf is a potential early warning sign to take into account when managing the yellow clam fishery ecosystems showing high ascendency may be considered to be rigid and to lack sufficient freedom and flexibility to adapt to perturbations this situation may be encompassed into the adaptive cycles perspective holling 1973 white et al 2010 putting our studied area at the end of a conservation phase probably facing a release phase if external and or intrinsic perturbations occurs analyses of how ecosystems are distributed over the domain of robustness and degree of order a vs f see fig 3 and thus the criteria defining the ecosystem vitality window are beginning to be reported fath 2014 however a values between 0 3 and 0 5 are frequent in ecological networks ulanowicz et al 2014 nevertheless the four modeled periods showed a 0 5 which may be attributed to the small dimensions less than 20 compartments of the sandy beach network and the nutrient overabundance thus highlighting the uniqueness of these ecosystems 4 4 temporal simulations the model was able to reproduce the reference time series of the dominant species m mactroides which represents the only fishery resource in the ecosystem when we assessed the differential contributions of abiotic forcing and fishing effort to fit the reference data the prominent bottom up role of environmental variability on ecosystem function and structure became evident this observation is in line with the model independent conclusions obtained by ortega et al 2016 regarding the concurrent effects of climate and harvesting acting as interacting distal and proximate factors österblom et al 2016 concerning the former long term variations in ssta in the study region displayed a regime shift from a cold to a warm phase after 1997 ortega et al 2012 in addition mwsa displayed a quasi decadal oscillatory pattern with an increasing trend over time ortega et al 2013 our long term analysis has revealed the drastic effects of climatic variability producing large fluctuations and shifts in abundance of sandy beach macrofauna see also arntz et al 1987 celentano and defeo 2016 this is especially noticeable in broadcast spawners with planktonic larval dispersal as the yellow clam which usually behave as resurgent populations mclachlan et al 1996 these species are very sensitive to variations in sea water temperature and concurrent changes in environmental conditions defeo et al 2016 indeed our work suggests that specific mechanisms causing these trends may be ascribed to changes in pp forced by temperature and wind patterns these changes could also drastically alter habitat quality and ecosystem health properties including changes in beach morphodynamics ortega et al 2013 and increasing occurrence of red tides odebrecht et al 1995b the drastic yellow clam population fluctuations were accompanied by increasing occurrence of pathogens and body abnormalities ortega et al 2016 our long term holistic analysis showed the importance of implementing a broad environmental monitoring program that considers not only the targeted species and fishing indicators but also the trophic relationships and primary production fluctuations occurring in the ecosystem bcb attained a highly organized structure thus losing robustness may make it vulnerable to environmental fluctuations this conclusion highlights the need to conduct dynamic simulations of environmental and fishery scenarios in these fragile social

25344,drought can trigger both immediate and time lagged responses of terrestrial ecosystems and even cause sizeable positive feedbacks to climate warming in this study the influences of interactive

simulations from three configurations of clm4 5 c carbon cycle only cn dynamic carbon and nitrogen cycle cndv dynamic carbon and nitrogen cycle as well as dynamic vegetation between 1961 and 2010

changing climate and is likely to increase in frequency for the foreseeable future dai 2013 qian et al 2011 stocker et al 2013 china experienced frequent severe droughts during the second half of the 20th century zou et al 2005 and faces a projected increase in drought risk in the future wang and chen 2014 therefore it is necessary to explore the impact of drought on the carbon fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems this will advance our understanding of the mechanism of carbon and water coupling under drought conditions and provide information needed for policy making site level measurements from a global observation network schwalm et al 2010 sun et al 2006 and satellite based observations zhang et al 2012 zhao and running 2010 zscheischler et al 2014 usually have been used to quantify the impacts of drought on the carbon fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems compared to in situ and satellite based observations process based terrestrial carbon cycle models can better capture the coupling mechanism between increasing climate extremes and decreasing carbon uptake reichstein et al 2013 zeng et al 2005 and have been used to examine the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to droughts over china liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 xiao et al 2009 yuan et al 2014 for example xiao et al 2009 used a process based biogeochemistry model the terrestrial ecosystem model to investigate the impact of twentieth century droughts on the terrestrial carbon cycle in china and found that severe and extended drought substantially reduced the countryside annual net primary production npp and net ecosystem production nep moreover results showed that strong decreases in npp were mainly responsible for the anomalies in annual nep during the drought periods heterotrophic respiration also experienced a strong decrease but with smaller magnitude xiao et al 2009 yuan et al 2014 pointed that the multiyear precipitation reduction changed the regional carbon uptake of 0 011pgcyr 1 in northern china from 1982 to 1998 to a net source of 0 018pgc yr 1 from 1999 to 2011 and the average maize yield from 1999 to 2011 was reduced by 440kgha 1 yr 1 compared with linear trend yields during the summer of 2013 southern china experienced the strongest drought on record for the past 113years which significantly reduced the satellite based vegetation index gpp and evapotranspiration xie et al 2016 and altered the regional carbon cycle yuan et al 2016 as one of the most important factors in terrestrial carbon cycle nitrogen n plays an important role in the coupling between carbon and water by affecting photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance bonan and levis 2010 gotangco castillo et al 2012 thornton et al 2009 the process of carbon nitrogen water coupling leads to a change in canopy transpiration the changing transpiration then affects photosynthesis through water stress lee et al 2013 furthermore n limitation can decrease the positive effect of co2 fertilization on the vegetation productivity in unmanaged ecosystems langley and megonigal 2010 leaf photosynthesis may be more sensitive to reduced stomatal conductance at elevated co2 levels when n is limited mcmurtrie et al 2008 in addition dynamic vegetation dv models have been designed to be coupled with some land surface models for the study of global ecosystem climate interactions zeng et al 2008 the incorporation of dv in land models has been found to reduce the seasonal variability in predicted leaf area and moisture fluxes gotangco castillo et al 2012 and enhance climate persistence in earth system models by introducing long term memory to the earth system delire et al 2004 however few studies have examined the influences of including the n cycle and dv on simulating the responses of terrestrial carbon cycle to drought the process based model community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 oleson et al 2013 has an option for running a prognostic carbon nitrogen model thornton et al 2007 or a dynamic global vegetation model gotangco castillo et al 2012 levis et al 2004 zeng et al 2008 or both in this study it was used to present an analysis on the relationships between drought indicated by the standardized precipitation index spi and vegetation production in china the model simulations were compared with gridded observational carbon flux data jung et al 2009 2011 the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the diverse impacts of the interactive n and dv on the simulated changes in the response of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle to drought 2 investigate such responses across plant functional types and climatic regions and 3 discuss why the carbon nitrogen coupling and dynamical vegetation would predict different responses to drought compared to the carbon only configuration 2 model and methods 2 1 model descriptions the clm4 5 model is the latest version of the clm family and contains detailed biophysics hydrology and biogeochemistry representations oleson et al 2013 compared to previous versions clm4 5 has many new modifications in the physical and biogeochemical parameterizations bonan et al 2011 koven et al 2013 li et al 2013 oleson et al 2013 the clm4 5 model can be operated with a dynamic carbon cycle only clm45 c or with an interactive carbon nitrogen cycle clm45 cn in addition the clm45 cn model configuration includes an option to include vegetation dynamics clm45 cndv a general description of the carbon nitrogen cycle and dynamic vegetation processes in clm4 5 is provided in section 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 respectively further detailed descriptions can be found in oleson et al 2013 2 1 1 carbon nitrogen cycle in the clm45 cn model the biophysical framework of clm oleson et al 2013 is merged with the prognostic carbon and nitrogen dynamics of the terrestrial biogeochemistry model biome bgc biome biogeochemical cycles thornton and rosenbloom 2005 the integrated model is fully prognostic with respect to all carbon and nitrogen state variables in the vegetation litter and soil organic matter and retains all prognostic quantities for water and energy in the vegetation snow soil column from clm4 5 these state variables are tracked for leaf live stem dead stem live coarse root dead coarse root and fine root pools in clm45 cn the maximum rate of carboxylation vcmax for leaf level photosynthesis is calculated as following thornton and zimmermann 2007 1 v c m a x v c m a x 25 f t v f d y l β t 2 v c m a x 25 n a f l n r f n r a r 25 where vcmax25 is the maximum rate of carboxylation at 25 c tv and dyl are leaf temperature and day length respectively na is the area based n concentration flnr fnr and a r25 are three constant parameters which represent the fraction of leaf n in rubisco the mass ratio of total rubisco molecular mass to n in rubisco and the specific activity of rubisco respectively βt is a soil water stress function representing the influences of soil moisture on leaf level photosynthesis in addition soil water has a direct effect on the leaf stomatal conductance gs i e the inverse of stomatal resistance rs through the ball berry conductance model expressed as eq 3 collatz et al 1991 3 1 r s g s m a n c s p a t m h s b β t where m is a plant functional type pft dependent parameter an is leaf net photosynthesis cs is the co2 partial pressure at the leaf surface patm is the atmospheric pressure hs is the leaf surface humidity b is the minimum stomatal conductance and βt is a soil water stress function the function βt ranges from one when the soil is wet to near zero when the soil is dry and is given 4 β t i w i r i where wi is a plant wilting factor and depends on the soil water potential of each soil layer ri is the distribution of roots in layer i and depends on the plant functional type oleson et al 2013 eq 4 suggests that soil moisture estimations affect the accuracy of terrestrial carbon fluxes through the soil water stress function βt in turn βt has a large impact on soil water content simulation through the transpiration in each layer called the soil moisture sink term evapotranspiration loss in the soil water equation jia et al 2013a the canopy level photosynthesis or gross primary production gpp is derived by summing the sunlit and shaded leaf level photosynthesis rates multiplied by the sunlit and shaded leaf area indices including potential reductions due to limited availability of mineral nitrogen oleson et al 2013 the carbon available for allocation to new growth is calculated at each model time step total plant nitrogen demand for each time step is calculated from the carbon allometry and nitrogen concentration for each tissue type specified by the pft overall the leaf level photosynthesis is used to calculate the gpp and gpp is scaled by the nitrogen limitation factor in the carbon and nitrogen allocation module the clm45 cn model also simulates both autotrophic ra and heterotrophic respiration rh autotrophic respiration is equivalent to the sum of maintenance respiration rm and growth respiration rg rm is calculated as a function of the temperature and n concentration of live tissues thornton and rosenbloom 2005 and rg is calculated as a constant fraction 0 3 of the carbon allocated to growth heterotrophic respiration is the carbon released to the atmosphere during the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter the npp is calculated by removing the autotrophic respiration ra from the gpp eq 5 5 n p p g p p r a and the nep is the balance between npp and rh eq 6 6 n e p n p p r h g p p r e where ecosystem respiration re is the sum of the ra and rh positive values of nep indicate net carbon gain by the ecosystem i e the ecosystem is a carbon sink and negative values signify a net carbon loss i e the ecosystem is a carbon source 2 1 2 dynamic vegetation the clm45 cndv model can simulate only unmanaged vegetation which includes the tree grass and shrub pfts using biogeography rules that are climate based gotangco castillo et al 2012 oleson et al 2013 crops may exist in the carbon nitrogen component but the interactive crop management model was not included in the simulations performed for the present study in clm45 cndv tree mortality occurs as a result of fire anthropogenic land cover change wind throw insect attack disease heat stress low growth efficiency and increasing age levis et al 2004 oleson et al 2013 the latter two effects are directly or indirectly driven by climatic trends and correspond best to the type of mortality events that have been reported for the field sites drought reduces the growth efficiency of trees expressed as npp per leaf area when a pft ends the year with negative npp it is removed from the grid cell and its carbon is converted to litter the age related mortality can be influenced indirectly by drought episodes since water scarcity changes the composition of trees in terms of their maximum non stressed longevity levis et al 2004 2 1 3 atmospheric forcing data in this study clm4 5 was forced using a 110year 1901 2010 observation based atmospheric forcing data set the climate research unit cru national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis cruncep viovy 2011 this data set comprises six hourly interval data on precipitation solar radiation air temperature pressure humidity and wind it is a combination of two existing datasets the cru ts3 2 half degree monthly data covering the period 1901 2002 mitchell and jones 2005 and the ncep reanalysis 2 5 six hourly data covering the period from 1948 to near present the cruncep dataset has been used to force the clm in several studies of vegetation growth evapotranspiration and the terrestrial carbon cycle mao et al 2012 piao et al 2012 shi et al 2013 2 2 experimental design in this study the control experiment was a default clm45 c simulation with prescribed nitrogen limitation bonan and levis 2010 thornton et al 2007 the treatments were the clm45 cn and clm45 cndv simulations which used the same atmospheric forcing data as the clm45 c simulation but the spin up processes were slightly different based on the sub data set from 1901 to 1960 the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations were first spun up using land cover atmospheric co2 and n deposition levels from the year 1850 to attain a near equilibrium state then they were run to 1961 forced by repeating the 60year sub data set 1901 1960 with the transient co2 concentration n deposition and historical land use data spanning 1850 1960 to obtain the initial conditions for the start of simulations a complete spin up of the dv in clm4 5 first requires establishment of the carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes in this study the process for spinning up clm45 cndv was similar to that of gotangco castillo et al 2012 beginning from the end of the clm45 cn transient simulation in 1850 the dv was spun up from bare ground in a 2400 year offline clm45 cndv simulation with repeating 1901 1960 meteorological variables performed as an equilibrium spin up after that the 60 year data were used to force the clm45 cndv and obtain the initial conditions for the year 1961 finally the 1961 2010 atmospheric forcing data were used to force the three simulations clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv using initial conditions from 1961 clm45 c and clm45 cn used the surface data for the year 2000 while clm45 cndv updates biogeography annually gotangco castillo et al 2012 oleson et al 2013 noted that all simulations were performed at a horizontal resolution of 0 5 0 5 and in half hour time steps and the co2 concentration was held fixed at year 2000 levels 368 9 ppmv gotangco castillo et al 2012 in this study the focus was on comparing the three simulations over the past five decades 1961 2010 some results are considered within specific sub regions in china defined as such according to regional climatic characteristics fig 1 a liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 piao et al 2009 2 3 observational data for evaluation jung et al 2011 generated a gridded carbon flux data set by upscaling fluxnet measurements from eddy covariance flux tower sites to the global scale using the machine learning technique model tree ensembles hereafter mte jung et al 2009 the mtes were first trained to predict carbon fluxes at site level based on remote sensing indices climate and meteorological data and information on land use then the trained mtes were applied to generate global fields at a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution with a monthly temporal resolution jung et al 2011 the mte data used in this study include gpp and net ecosystem exchange nee covering the mainland china from 1982 to 2010 although the mte data are not direct carbon flux measurements they have been proved to agree better with the fluxnet observations than some ecosystem models jung et al 2011 wang et al 2015 for example modeling efficiency and root mean square error rmse of mean gpp at the site level is 0 74 and 270gcm 2 yr 1 while the rmse of three ecosystem models lpj orchidee biome bgc for the gpp of forests in europe was about 420gcm 2 yr 1 wang et al 2015 found that compared to the clm4 cn the mte data agreed better with ground based gpp observations with lower rmses 38 and 11gcm 2 month 1 for the forest and grass respectively and higher correlation coefficients 0 9 and 0 99 for the forest and grass respectively in addition the co2 fertilization effect is not explicitly included in this dataset the same configuration as the simulations of this work therefore we used the mte data as the reference to evaluate the three clm4 5 simulations in the present study 2 4 methods researchers have developed many indexes to monitor different types of drought mckee et al 1993 palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 as one of the simplest drought indexes spi has been proved to be suitable for quantifying most drought events lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 furthermore the spi commonly has been used to consider the effect of drought on the terrestrial carbon cycle due to its simplicity temporal flexibility and spatial consistency liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 since only the effect of precipitation was considered in this study the spi index was chosen as an appropriate index by which to quantify the drought severity in china the spi was computed by first fitting a probability density function pdf to the frequency distribution of precipitation over a specific time scale of interest this was performed separately for each month or whatever the temporal basis was of the raw precipitation time series and for each spatial location each pdf was then transformed into a standardized normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mckee et al 1993 a clear and detailed description for calculating the spi can be found in lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 in the present study the spi with five running time intervals i e 1 3 6 9 12 months covering the period from 1961 to 2010 was used using spi as an indicator a drought was considered to occur when the spi was less than zero mckee et al 1993 as described by mckee et al 1993 and zhang et al 2012 drought in a given year can be classified into nine categories according to the 12 month spi through to the end of december table 1 the effects of the drought on carbon flux are assessed using a standardized anomaly index sai katz and glantz 1986 which has been used in past research liu et al 2014 lotsch et al 2005 pei et al 2013 the sai is defined as the standardized departure from the average values using eq 7 7 s a i i c f i m e a n s t d where cfi is the carbon flux value for the year i and mean and std are the mean and standard deviation respectively of the annual values from 1961 to 2010 3 results 3 1 characterization of drought events in china during the past 50 years during the past five decades 1961 2010 china witnessed several drought events with different intensities and areal extents dai 2013 qian et al 2011 the means of the annual spi the 12 month spi through to the end of december and the percentages of the total areas in china affected by different drought intensities in each year show several years of extreme drought fig 2 in particular china experienced extensive drought in 1965 1966 1968 1972 1978 and 1986 between 1961 and 1990 spi 0 35 fig 2a when more than 24 of the total area in china was affected by moderate severe and extreme drought fig 2b the year 1986 showed the lowest value of spatially averaged spi during the last 50 years spi 0 51 and the area of china affected by severe and extreme drought was 15 approximately 1 4 millionkm2 drought was also observed across approximately 750 ground based meteorological stations liu et al 2014 over the last two decades 1991 2010 the drought events in 1997 and 2006 were the most serious spi 0 2 as more than 20 of the area in china was affected by moderate or even more severe drought according to the spatial distribution fig 3 of drought during the key years identified above most regions of china in 1986 experienced drought events except for parts of southwest china northeast china and northwest china fig 3f in 1972 vast areas of china 14 also experienced severe and extreme drought fig 3d even though drought did not occur widely throughout china in 1965 the severity was mostly severe to extreme where drought occurred 18 of the total area of china mainly in the tibetan plateau inner mongolia and north china fig 3a drought continued into 1966 but occurred in different areas mainly the middle and southeastern areas of china southeast china and north china experienced severe drought in 1978 fig 3e and 1997 fig 3g whereas the drought events in 2006 were mostly mild fig 3h 3 2 temporal variations of carbon fluxes and their responses to droughts in general the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations exhibited a similar temporal variation in their carbon flux anomalies and showed a clear decline of terrestrial ecosystem productivity during periods of drought figs s1a and s1b due to the low soil water stress function βt fig s1d moreover it is clearly seen from fig 4 that the carbon fluxes existed a significant decrease with the increase of drought intensity the decrease of spi however the introduction of the n cycle decreased the mean annual predicted carbon fluxes for example the annual gpp and nep for the clm45 cn simulation were 7 5pgcyr 1 and 0 18pgcyr 1 respectively compared to 10 9pgcyr 1 and 0 53pgcyr 1 respectively for the clm45 c simulation furthermore the clm45 cn simulation predicted lower inter annual variability iav in gpp and nep as measured by the standard deviation compared with the clm45 c simulation the iavs of gpp and nep for the clm45 cn simulation were 0 27pgcyr 1 and 0 21pgcyr 1 respectively while stdgpp 0 32pgcyr 1 and stdnep 0 26pgcyr 1 for the clm45 c simulation fig s1 the reduction in the carbon fluxes gpp and nep from clm45 cn compared to those of clm45 c can be explained as following since the c n biogeochemistry is active the amount of n required to support the potential growth is diagnosed in clm45 cn and gpp is reduced if n availability is insufficient to sustain the potential biomass increment in contrast clm45 c uses a prescribed n factor which varies among plant functional types to represent n constraints on photosynthesis fig 5 illustrates the difference in n limitation between the c n coupling model and c only model by presenting the spatial distribution of annual mean values of an instantaneous n limitation factor this factor is the ratio of down regulated gpp to potential gpp and expressed as a scalar ranging from 0 to 1 with values closer to 0 indicating stronger n limitation it is seen that clm45 cn fig 5b shows a stronger n limitation over the southeast central and northeast parts of china suggesting fewer amount of n than clm45 c fig 5a nevertheless the changes in n limitation over other areas were small on the order of 5 fig 5c it suggests that the availability of mineral n in clm45 cn is insufficient to maintain required plant c n stoichiometry and sustain the potential biomass increment because canopy level photosynthesis or gpp is derived by summing the sunlit and shaded leaf level rates scaled by the sunlit and shaded leaf area indices and limited to the availability of mineral n unmet plant n demand is translated back to a carbon supply surplus which is eliminated through reduction of gpp representing direct downregulation of photosynthetic rate under n limitation the indirect n limitation effect of reduced allocation to new growth on light capture is another significant downregulation mechanism in the model which operates on longer time scales and has a strong influence on global scale plant soil system states and fluxes thornton et al 2007 it is noted that the reduction in gpp may lead to a decrease in lai which then induces a reduction in canopy evapotranspiration oleson et al 2013 although the reduction in evapotranspiration may lead to an accumulation of soil water and increase the soil water stress function βt fig 4d and thus increase n mineralization the changes in soil water in tropical rainforest and boreal forest regions e g over most parts of southern china are insignificant lee et al 2013 therefore decreasing canopy level photosynthesis due to the stronger n limitation in clm45 cn would directly decrease the predicted national total gpp in china in addition lower n content in clm45 cn also decreased autotrophic respiration because tissue n content is a suitable index of cellular metabolic rate oleson et al 2013 the total heterotrophic demand for mineral n is in competition with the total plant n demand from all pfts sharing space on a single soil column limited mineral n in clm45 cn also decreased the heterotrophic respiration however the reduction of re fig 4c has a smaller magnitude fig 4c than that of gpp which then leads to a decrease of nep in clm45 cn compared to clm45 c notably the difference between the influences of the magnitude of n limitation and the dynamics of the internal n cycle on the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to drought was not separated in this study the annual carbon flux predicted by the clm45 cn simulation under drought conditions were relatively smaller than those from the clm45 c simulation fig 4 and s1 for example the predicted total nep in china in 1986 spi 0 51 decreased by 0 53pgcyr 1 and 0 32pgcyr 1 in the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations respectively due to continuous water scarcity in 1965 spi 0 45 and 1966 spi 0 36 a clear reduction in nep was predicted for 1966 fig s1a nep decreased by 0 69pgcyr 1 and 0 37pgcyr 1 for the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations respectively the same results were obtained for gpp fig s1b in addition under the drought conditions less available soil water reduced nitrogen mineralization and increased nitrogen limitation felzer et al 2011 this increased the correlation coefficient r 0 67 between the spi and gpp anomalies fig s1b for clm45 cn compared with clm45 c r 0 62 meanwhile since tissue n content has a close relationship with autotrophic respiration the correlation between the spi and re anomalies also increased in clm45 cn fig s1c however the correlation between spi and nep decreased r 0 51 and 0 45 for clm45 c and clm45 cn respectively we have not identified a mechanism explaining the reduction in the sensitivity of nep predictions to variation in precipitation in clm45 cn compared to clm45 c in general compared to the default pft map of clm4 5 used both in clm45 c and clm45 cn fig 6 a table 2 the dv simulation in the clm4 5 model produced a reasonably accurate vegetation distribution over northwest and northeast china however the predicted distribution over north and southeast china was less accurate fig 6 because clm45 cndv can simulate only unmanaged vegetation the crop pfts for the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations over northern china were instead comprised of deciduous broadleaf trees in addition the incorporation of the dv model in clm4 5 tended to decrease evergreen forests in the clm45 cndv simulation over southern china which further reduced the mean 7 3pgcyr 1 and iav 0 19pgcyr 1 of predicted gpp fig 4b nevertheless clm45 cndv predicted a slight increase in the nep mean value 0 43pgcyr 1 compared to clm45 cn 0 18pgcyr 1 these differences were due mainly to the different biogeography and mortality processes clm45 cndv changes the cn framework only as needed to simulate biogeography which induces the differences of the pft distribution fig 6 moreover clm45 cn assumes the whole plant mortality to be a constant rate of 2 yr 1 for all vegetation types in contrast clm45 cndv calculates the gap mortality based on heat stress and growth efficiency the different mortality algorithm of clm45 cndv resulted in lower vegetation mortality compared to clm45 cn gotangco castillo et al 2012 thus the clm45 cndv simulation maintained more total vegetation carbon and generated less litter and soil carbon than the clm45 cn simulation which in turn reduced heterotrophic respiration to give higher nep the intensity of the predicted change in gpp induced by drought also was dampened by the dv model for example the total gpp in china according to the clm45 cndv simulation decreased by only 0 3pgc yr 1 and 0 2pgcyr 1 in 1966 and 1986 respectively compared to reductions of 0 53pgcyr 1 and 0 46pgcyr 1 in the clm45 cn simulation further because the spatio temporal variations of the dv distribution had a stronger response to the atmospheric forcing data due to the incorporation of the dv model than did the static vegetation distribution in the clm45 c or clm45 cn simulations the spi contributed more to the gpp anomalies r 0 74 and re r 0 68 but clm45 cndv showed a weak relationship between the soil water stress function βt and drought index spi r 0 42 while the clm45 c r 0 64 and clm45 cn r 0 63 showed similar correlation coefficients between these two parameters fig s1d compared to the mte data between 1982 and 2010 all three clm4 5 configurations captured the temporal variation of gpp well before 2002 but showed large discrepancies thereafter fig s1b the clm45 c overestimated the mean of total gpp in china 10 9pgcyr 1 while clm45 cn 7 5pgcyr 1 and clm45 cndv 7 3pgcyr 1 predicted gpp that was closer to the mte dataset 7 0pgcyr 1 in addition clm45 c 0 32pgcyr 1 and clm45 cn 0 27pgcyr 1 overestimated the iav in gpp compared to the mte data 0 19pgcyr 1 while the clm45 cndv simulation 0 18pgcyr 1 showed a slight underestimation since no nep observations were available the nee data from mte were used to evaluate the clm4 5 simulations by multiplying the nee data by a factor of 1 0 however the accuracy for this transformation may have been affected by some disturbances e g biomass burning or land use oleson et al 2013 the iav of nep in chinese terrestrial ecosystems between 1982 and 2010 was predicted to be 0 26 0 21 and 0 06pgcyr 1 by the clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv simulations respectively compared to 0 08pgcyr 1 for the mte data it is noted that current attempts to produce maps of nee from flux towers have been much less successful than for gpp jung et al 2011 3 3 carbon cycle extremes in china s terrestrial ecosystems as the most severe drought over the past 50 years occurred in 1986 fig 3f the corresponding spatial distribution of the sais for the terrestrial ecosystem carbon fluxes nep gpp re fig 7 was of particular interest the predicted gpp mainly decreased over most of the tibetan plateau and parts of southwest southeast and northern china fig 7 middle panel in these areas there was also a clear decrease in ecosystem respiration fig 7 right panel compared to gpp and re there were large differences in the nep predictions among the spatial patterns produced by the three clm4 5 configurations fewer areas experienced the extreme decrease in carbon sequestration nep according to the clm45 cndv simulation compared to the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations although the drought events in 1965 fig 3a and 1966 fig 3b were not the most severe continuous water scarcity led to the greatest reduction in vegetation productivity of all the years in 1966 fig 8 the decrease in gpp mainly occurred in the central areas of china fig 8 middle panel and the three clm4 5 configurations produced similar spatial patterns except for lower sais simulated by clm45 cndv however the clm45 cndv simulation showed a greater decrease in re over central and southeast china due to differences in the representation of vegetation types in three model configurations this area is mainly covered by crop and evergreen needleleaf forest for the fixed pft in the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations fig 6a but by deciduous broadleaf forest in the clm45 cndv simulation fig 6 3 4 the lagged effects of drought on gpp and nep drought not only has immediate effects on the carbon cycle but also can initiate lagged responses pei et al 2013 reichstein et al 2013 as shown in fig 9 for the past 50years the sai of simulated gpp gppsai was closely correlated with the spi over southern china r 0 6 p 0 05 especially over cropland and grassland regions the accumulative lagged effect of drought on the gppsai occurred over relatively short timescales e g 1 3months over most areas of southern and central china over the tibetan plateau southwest china and northwest china the nep responded to drought over longer timescales 6 12months the clm45 cn simulation fig 9d predicted a similar response to drought as the clm45 c simulation fig 9b in contrast the dv model triggered a stronger response with higher correlations in northern and northeast china fig 9e and longer timescales in qinghai province fig 9f these differences further prove that the inclusion of both interactive n and dv simulations in the clm4 5 model yields a stronger response of gpp to drought compared to inclusion of the interactive n simulation alone this may be because the cndv configuration is able to adjust the response according to both the nitrogen carbon interaction and the establishment and mortality of vegetation fig 6 the nep is a balance between gpp and re so the complex relationship between re and the spi led to a weaker correlation between the nepsai and the spi compared to that between gpp and spi fig 10 the maximum correlation coefficients for the clm45 cndv simulation mainly occurred over the tibetan plateau and inner mongolia fig 10a and c and also across northern and northeast china fig 10e compared to gppsai nepsai was not significantly correlated with the spi p 0 05 over many vegetation covered areas of southern china fig 10 left panel in addition drought had a longer lagged effect on nep than on gpp fig 10 right panel 4 discussion 4 1 effects of climate conditions and vegetation types previous studies have pointed out that the effects of drought on terrestrial ecosystems are dependent on the vegetation types and climate regions liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 reichstein et al 2013 for the three clm4 5 simulations the anomalies of annual gpp and re were significantly correlated with the annual mean spi p 0 05 over all of the sub regions in china fig 11 the response of gpp to drought was relatively strong r 0 6 over most of the nine sub regions fig 11a both the clm45 cn and clm45 cndv simulations increased the correlations of gpp with annual spi compared to the clm45 c simulation the comparatively lower correlations in southwest china may have occurred because ample water is usually available for the vegetation growth in this area while radiation is an important climate driver of gpp jia et al 2013b nemani et al 2003 there were significant discrepancies in the simulated response of re to drought among the three clm4 5 configurations fig 11b compared to the clm45 c simulation the clm45 cn simulation produced higher correlations of re with annual spi the incorporation of the dv model further strengthened the predicted response to drought which is consistent with the results shown in fig s1 the sais of predicted nep for the three simulations showed positive and significant correlations with the annual spi over arid and semiarid regions regions r2 r3 and r4 as well as in northeast china r1 but the correlations were not significant over southwest china fig 11c in addition the nep anomalies from the clm45 cndv simulations were not significantly correlated with the annual spi over central and southern parts of china r5 r7 and r8 overall the predicted anomalies of annual gpp and re were significantly correlated with the annual mean spi p 0 05 over all of the pfts notably there is no evergreen needleleaf forest based on the clm4 5 surface data set in china in the clm45 cndv simulation fig 6 or in simulations that exclude the dv model fig 1b compared to other pfts the gpp of the evergreen broadleaf forest had a lower correlation with spi fig 12 a and a similar response can be seen for re fig 12b these results indicate that water may not be the most important climate factor controlling evergreen broadleaf forest liu et al 2014 which exists mainly over southern china fig 1b while radiation dominantly drives its iav of productivity of this pft jia et al 2013b nemani et al 2003 in addition both croplands and grasslands were predicted to have higher correlations between the annual mean nep anomalies and the spi fig 12c the effects of human activities e g irrigation grazing were not taken into consideration in this study yet the two vegetation types do not have much capability in resisting severe drought and they are water sensitive for example they cannot obtain water from deeper soil layers with their shadow roots during the drought period compared with forest ecosystems and thus the nep would be greatly reduced wu and chen 2013 when sufficient soil moisture and favorable temperatures are available the nep also tends to respond more rapidly this high sensitivity has been demonstrated in previous studies huxman et al 2004 wu and chen 2013 to further investigate the effect of interactive n cycle on the response of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle to drought across pfts we examined the relationship between the total n mineralization flux and soil water stress function βt for 6 pfts over china fig 13 it is seen that clm45 cn has lower n mineralization than clm45 c for all pfts which suggests that the incorporation of interactive n cycle clearly reduces the availability of n mineralization and thus induces the reductions of gpp and re fig 4 and s1 fig 13 also shows that the n mineralization decreases with the decrease of soil water stress function βt e g intensification of drought for both clm45 c and clm45 cn over all pfts except the ebf fig 13b the reason is similar to that for the carbon fluxes fig 12 which may be due to that evergreen broadleaf forest exists mainly over southern china fig 1b where soil moisture is sufficient nemani et al 2003 jia et al 2013b liu et al 2014 in addition the correlations between the n availability and soil water availability for clm45 cn are higher over all pfts than those for clm45 c except the ebf this confirms that the carbon nitrogen coupling increases the relationship between the n mineralization and soil water and thus strengthens the predicted response of gpp to drought fig s1 4 2 impacts of drought intensity to better understand the drought sensitivities of the three model configurations responses to three levels of drought 25 50 and 75 reductions in precipitation were examined through two ideal site level drought experiments located in temperate deciduous forest 51 25 n 126 75 e and grass 46 25 n 116 25 e ecosystems respectively the three configurations clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv were compared to determine the level of the agreement in the timing and magnitude of the predicted responses of ecosystem carbon fluxes to different levels of drought fig 14 all model simulations followed a standardized spin up similar to that described in section 2 2 and were initialized from these spin ups followed by three years 2003 2005 of reduced precipitation for each site the three drought levels 25 50 and 75 reductions in precipitation are denoted hereafter as d25 d50 and d75 respectively while d0 identifies the control simulation under observed precipitation 0 reduction notably precipitation was reduced all year but other meteorological variables were not manipulated the incorporation of interactive n and dv simulations decreased predicted gpp and nep under different drought levels at both sites fig 14 compared to the simulation with the basic clm4 5 model as drought intensity increased there was increasing disagreement in the magnitude of carbon fluxes predicted by the basic and amended clm4 5 models for the grass ecosystem the discrepancy between clm45 c and clm45 cn became smaller as drought intensity increased e g d50 and d75 fig 13d and f compared to the forest pft grass showed a quicker decrease in gpp suggesting that it is more sensitive to drought due to relatively short roots 4 3 uncertainties of the clm4 5 simulations as described in section 3 2 and shown in fig 4 clm45 c overestimated the mean and iav of gpp compared to the mte data in contrast the incorporation of the interactive n cycle simulation into clm4 5 decreased the mean and iav of predicted gpp by 31 and 16 respectively the addition of the dv model led to a further reduction of 3 and 33 in the mean and iav of predicted gpp respectively these results suggest that the inclusion of interactive n i e modifying clm45 c to clm45 cn has greater impact on the averaged values of predicted gpp than does the further addition of the dv model i e modifying clm45 cn to clm45 cndv for carbon sequestration by the terrestrial ecosystems i e nep in china clm45 c and clm45 cn overestimated the iav while clm45 cndv showed a slight underestimation compared to the mte data jung et al 2011 in fact the average nep in china predicted by the clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv models was 0 52 0 18 and 0 42pgcyr 1 respectively the clm45 cn simulation is comparable to the results from five process based ecosystem models piao et al 2009 which produced nep estimates ranging from 0 13pgcyr 1 to 0 22pgcyr 1 with an average of 0 173 0 039pgcyr 1 the clm45 c and clm45 cndv models overestimated nep compared to the results of piao et al 2009 it is noted that the analysis of the carbon nitrogen coupling is subject to some limitations in the present study nitrogen deposition and application increased significantly in china during recent decades which might regulate the terrestrial carbon cycle in china but these factors were not considered in this paper 5 summary in this study the effects of incorporating the interactive n and dynamic vegetation simulations in the process based land surface model clm4 5 were investigated specifically examined were the effects on the predicted response of the terrestrial carbon cycle across china to drought as indicated by the spi china experienced several drought events with different intensities and areal extents from 1961 to 2010 especially notable years include 1965 1966 1968 1972 1978 and 1986 in which the spi 0 35 and more than 24 of the total area in china was affected by either moderate severe or extreme drought due to the continuous scarcity of soil water across 1965 and 1966 the total predicted nep of china declined by 0 69pgcyr 1 and 0 37pgcyr 1 in 1966 according to the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations respectively compared to the default pft map of clm4 5 the clm45 cndv produced a similar vegetation distribution over northwest and northeast china except the differences over southern china where the deciduous forest was observed in clm45 cndv instead of the evergreen needleleaf forest in general incorporating the interactive n and dv into the clm4 5 model mostly reduced the annual means and iav of the simulated terrestrial carbon fluxes i e gpp and nep except for a slight increase in the nep mean value predicted by clm45 cndv 0 43pgcyr 1 compared to that by clm45 cn 0 18pgcyr 1 this difference was mainly due to clm45 cndv s different mortality algorithm based on heat stress and growth efficiency compared to the mte data 7 0pgcyr 1 between 1982 and 2010 clm45 c overestimates the annual gpp of the terrestrial ecosystems over china 10 9pgcyr 1 while clm45 cn 7 5pgcyr 1 and clm45 cndv 7 3pgcyr 1 have lower biases in addition clm45 c 0 32pgcyr 1 and clm45 cn 0 27pgcyr 1 overestimate the iav in gpp compared to the mte data 0 19pgcyr 1 while the clm45 cndv simulation 0 18pgcyr 1 shows a slight underestimation the carbon nitrogen coupling strengthened the predicted response of gpp to drought yielding a higher correlation with spi r c 0 62 r cn 0 67 but a weaker sensitivity of nep to spi r c 0 51 r cn 0 45 results also showed that drought has an accumulative lagged effect on gpp and that clm45 cndv predicted the longest lagged responses among the three clm4 5 configurations the lagged effects on gpp occurred over relatively shorter timescales in humid and warm areas e g southern and central china and over longer timescales across the tibetan plateau in contrast the predicted response of the nep to drought was not significant over many vegetation covered areas and the lagged effect occurred over longer timescales because ecosystem respiration had a complex relationship with drought this study provides an indication of the impacts of drought on the terrestrial carbon cycle with or without the use of interactive n and vegetation dynamics the results can provide insight into how the clm4 5 model predicts different response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to drought depending on whether simulations incorporate the interactive n and dv due to limited observations however the present study did not examine which version of the model could better simulate vegetation response to drought in addition although certain results from the present work are model specific this approach can be applied to compare the impacts of drought on terrestrial carbon cycle using carbon only models versus prognostic carbon nitrogen models or models with static versus dynamic vegetation acknowledgments this research was supported by the national

25344,drought can trigger both immediate and time lagged responses of terrestrial ecosystems and even cause sizeable positive feedbacks to climate warming in this study the influences of interactive

simulations from three configurations of clm4 5 c carbon cycle only cn dynamic carbon and nitrogen cycle cndv dynamic carbon and nitrogen cycle as well as dynamic vegetation between 1961 and 2010 showed that the incorporation of a prognostic n cycle and dv into clm4 5 reduce the predicted annual means and inter annual variability of predicted gross primary production gpp and net ecosystem

20th century zou et al 2005 and faces a projected increase in drought risk in the future wang and chen 2014 therefore it is necessary to explore the impact of drought on the carbon fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems this will advance our understanding of the mechanism of carbon and water coupling under drought conditions and provide information needed for policy making site level

to droughts over china liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 xiao et al 2009 yuan et al 2014 for example xiao et al 2009 used a process based biogeochemistry model the terrestrial ecosystem model to investigate the impact of twentieth century droughts on the terrestrial carbon cycle in china and found that severe and extended drought substantially reduced the countryside annual net primary production npp and net ecosystem production nep moreover results showed that strong decreases in npp were mainly responsible for the anomalies in annual nep during the drought periods heterotrophic respiration also experienced a strong decrease but with smaller magnitude xiao et al 2009 yuan et al 2014 pointed that the multiyear precipitation reduction changed the regional carbon uptake of 0 011pgcyr 1 in northern china from 1982 to 1998 to a net source of 0 018pgc yr 1 from 1999 to 2011 and the average maize yield from 1999 to 2011 was reduced by 440kgha 1 yr 1 compared with linear trend yields during the summer of 2013 southern china experienced the strongest drought on record for the past 113years which significantly reduced the satellite based vegetation index gpp and

coupling between carbon and water by affecting photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance bonan and levis 2010 gotangco castillo et al 2012 thornton et al 2009 the process of carbon nitrogen water coupling leads to a change in canopy transpiration the changing transpiration then affects photosynthesis through water stress lee et al 2013 furthermore n limitation can decrease the positive effect of co2 fertilization on the vegetation productivity in unmanaged ecosystems langley and megonigal 2010 leaf photosynthesis may be more sensitive to reduced stomatal conductance at elevated co2 levels when n is limited mcmurtrie et al 2008 in addition dynamic vegetation dv models have been designed to be coupled with some land surface models for the study of global ecosystem climate interactions zeng et al 2008 the incorporation of dv in land models has been found to reduce the seasonal variability in predicted leaf area and moisture fluxes gotangco castillo et al 2012 and enhance climate persistence in earth system models by introducing long term memory to the earth system delire et al 2004 however few studies have examined the influences of including the n cycle and dv on simulating the responses of terrestrial carbon cycle to drought the process based model community land model version 4 5 clm4 5 oleson et al 2013 has an option for running a prognostic carbon nitrogen model thornton et al 2007 or a dynamic global vegetation model gotangco castillo et al 2012 levis et al 2004 zeng et al 2008 or both in this study it was used to present an analysis on the relationships between drought indicated by the standardized precipitation index spi and vegetation production in china the model simulations were compared with gridded observational carbon flux data jung et al 2009 2011 the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the diverse impacts of the interactive n and dv on the simulated changes in the response of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle to drought 2 investigate such responses across plant functional types and climatic regions and 3 discuss why the carbon nitrogen coupling and dynamical vegetation would predict different responses to drought compared to the carbon only configuration 2 model and methods 2 1 model descriptions the clm4 5 model is the latest version of the clm family and contains detailed biophysics hydrology and biogeochemistry representations oleson et al 2013 compared to previous versions clm4 5 has many new modifications in the physical and biogeochemical parameterizations bonan et al 2011 koven et al 2013 li et al 2013 oleson et al 2013 the clm4 5 model can be operated with a dynamic carbon cycle only clm45 c or with an interactive carbon nitrogen cycle clm45 cn in addition the clm45 cn model configuration includes an option to include vegetation dynamics clm45 cndv a general description of the carbon nitrogen cycle and dynamic vegetation processes in clm4 5 is provided in section 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 respectively further detailed descriptions can be found in oleson et al 2013 2 1 1 carbon nitrogen cycle in the clm45 cn model the biophysical framework of clm oleson et al 2013 is merged with the prognostic carbon and nitrogen dynamics of the terrestrial biogeochemistry model biome bgc biome biogeochemical cycles thornton and rosenbloom 2005 the integrated model is fully prognostic with respect to all carbon and nitrogen state variables in the vegetation litter and soil organic matter and retains all prognostic quantities for water and energy in the vegetation snow soil column from clm4 5 these state variables are tracked for leaf live stem dead stem live coarse root dead coarse root and fine root pools in clm45 cn the maximum rate of carboxylation vcmax for leaf level photosynthesis is calculated as following thornton and zimmermann 2007 1 v c m a x v c m a x 25 f t v f d y l β t 2 v c m a x 25 n a f l n r f n r a r 25 where vcmax25 is the maximum rate of carboxylation at 25 c tv and dyl are leaf temperature and day length respectively na is the area based n concentration flnr fnr and a r25 are three constant parameters which represent the fraction of leaf n in rubisco the mass ratio of total rubisco molecular mass to n in rubisco and the specific activity of rubisco respectively βt is a soil water stress function representing the influences of soil moisture on leaf level photosynthesis in addition soil water has a direct effect on the leaf stomatal conductance gs i e the inverse of stomatal resistance rs through the ball berry conductance model expressed as eq 3 collatz et al 1991 3 1 r s g s m a n c s p a t m h s b β t where m is a plant functional type pft dependent parameter an is leaf net photosynthesis cs is the co2 partial pressure at the leaf surface patm is the atmospheric pressure hs is the leaf surface humidity b is the minimum stomatal conductance and βt is a soil water stress function the function βt ranges from one when the soil is wet to near zero when the soil is dry and is given 4 β t i w i r i where wi is a plant wilting factor and depends on the soil water potential of each soil layer ri is the distribution of roots in layer i and depends on the plant functional type oleson et al 2013 eq 4 suggests that soil moisture estimations affect the accuracy of terrestrial carbon fluxes through the soil water stress function βt in turn βt has a large impact on soil water content simulation through the transpiration in each layer called the soil moisture sink term evapotranspiration loss in the soil water equation jia et al 2013a the canopy level photosynthesis or gross primary production gpp is derived by summing the sunlit and shaded leaf level photosynthesis rates multiplied by the sunlit and shaded leaf area indices including potential reductions due to limited availability of mineral nitrogen oleson et al 2013 the carbon available for allocation to new growth is calculated at each model time step total plant nitrogen demand for each time step is calculated from the carbon allometry and nitrogen concentration for each tissue type specified by the pft overall the leaf level photosynthesis is used to calculate the gpp and gpp is scaled by the nitrogen limitation factor in the carbon and nitrogen allocation module the clm45 cn model also simulates both autotrophic ra and heterotrophic respiration rh autotrophic respiration is equivalent to the sum of maintenance respiration rm and growth respiration rg rm is calculated as a function of the temperature and n concentration of live tissues thornton and rosenbloom 2005 and rg is calculated as a constant fraction 0 3 of the carbon allocated to growth heterotrophic respiration is the carbon released to the atmosphere during the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter the npp is calculated by removing the autotrophic respiration ra from the gpp eq 5 5 n p p g p p r a and the nep is the balance between npp and rh eq 6 6 n e p n p p r h g p p r e where ecosystem respiration re is the sum of the ra and rh positive values of nep indicate net carbon gain by the ecosystem i e the ecosystem is a carbon sink and negative values signify a net carbon loss i e the ecosystem is a carbon source 2 1 2 dynamic vegetation the clm45 cndv model can simulate only unmanaged vegetation which includes the tree grass and shrub pfts using biogeography rules that are climate based gotangco castillo et al 2012 oleson et al 2013 crops may exist in the carbon nitrogen component but the interactive crop management model was not included in the simulations performed for the present study in clm45 cndv tree mortality occurs as a result of fire anthropogenic land cover change wind throw insect attack disease heat stress low growth efficiency and increasing age levis et al 2004 oleson et al 2013 the latter two effects are directly or indirectly driven by climatic trends and correspond best to the type of mortality events that have been reported for the field sites drought reduces the growth efficiency of trees expressed as npp per leaf area when a pft ends the year with negative npp it is removed from the grid cell and its carbon is converted to litter the age related mortality can be influenced indirectly by drought episodes since water scarcity changes the composition of trees in terms of their maximum non stressed longevity levis et al 2004 2 1 3 atmospheric forcing data in this study clm4 5 was forced using a 110year 1901 2010 observation based atmospheric forcing data set

slightly different based on the sub data set from 1901 to 1960 the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations were first spun up using land cover atmospheric co2 and n deposition levels from the year 1850 to attain a near equilibrium state then they were run to 1961 forced by repeating the 60year sub data set 1901 1960 with the transient co2 concentration n deposition and historical land use data spanning 1850 1960 to obtain the initial conditions for the start of simulations a complete spin up of the dv in clm4 5 first requires establishment of the carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes in this study the process for spinning up clm45 cndv was similar to that of gotangco castillo et al 2012 beginning from the end of the clm45 cn transient simulation in 1850 the dv was spun up from bare ground in a 2400 year offline clm45 cndv simulation with repeating 1901 1960 meteorological variables performed as an equilibrium spin up after that the 60 year data were used to force the clm45 cndv and obtain the initial conditions for the year 1961 finally the 1961 2010 atmospheric forcing data were used to force the three simulations clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv using initial conditions from 1961 clm45 c and clm45 cn used the surface data for the year 2000 while clm45 cndv updates biogeography annually gotangco castillo et al 2012 oleson et al 2013 noted that all simulations were performed at a horizontal resolution of 0 5 0 5 and in half hour time steps and the co2 concentration was held fixed at year 2000 levels 368 9 ppmv gotangco castillo et al 2012 in this study the focus was on comparing the three simulations over the past five decades 1961 2010 some results are considered within specific sub regions in china defined as such according to regional climatic characteristics fig 1 a liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 piao et al 2009 2 3 observational data for evaluation jung et al 2011 generated a gridded carbon flux data set by upscaling fluxnet measurements from eddy covariance flux tower sites to the global scale using the machine learning technique model tree ensembles hereafter mte jung et al 2009 the mtes were first trained to predict carbon fluxes at site level based on remote sensing indices climate and meteorological data and information on land use then the trained mtes were applied to generate global fields at a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution with a monthly temporal resolution jung et al 2011 the mte data used in this study include gpp and net ecosystem exchange nee covering the mainland china from 1982 to 2010 although the mte data are not direct carbon flux measurements they have been proved to agree better with the fluxnet observations than some ecosystem models jung et al 2011 wang et al 2015 for example modeling efficiency and root mean square error rmse of mean gpp at the site level is 0 74 and 270gcm 2 yr 1 while the rmse of three ecosystem models lpj orchidee biome bgc for the gpp of forests in europe was about 420gcm 2 yr 1 wang et al 2015 found that compared to the clm4 cn the mte data agreed better with ground based gpp observations with lower rmses 38 and 11gcm 2 month 1 for the forest and grass respectively and higher correlation coefficients 0 9 and 0 99 for the forest and grass respectively in addition the co2 fertilization effect is not explicitly included in this dataset the same configuration as the simulations of this work therefore we used the mte data as the reference to evaluate the three clm4 5 simulations in the present study 2 4 methods researchers have developed many indexes to monitor different types of drought mckee et al 1993 palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 as one of the simplest drought indexes spi has been proved to be suitable for quantifying most drought events lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 furthermore the spi commonly has been used to consider the effect of drought on the terrestrial carbon cycle due to its simplicity temporal flexibility and spatial consistency liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 since only the effect of precipitation was considered in this study the spi index was chosen as an appropriate index by which to quantify the drought severity in china the spi was computed by first fitting a probability density function pdf to the frequency distribution of precipitation over a specific time scale of interest this was performed separately for each month or whatever the temporal basis was of the raw precipitation time series and for each spatial location each pdf was then transformed into a standardized normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mckee et al 1993 a clear and detailed description for calculating the spi can be found in lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 in the present study the spi with five running time intervals i e 1 3 6 9 12 months covering the period from 1961 to 2010 was used using spi as an indicator a drought was considered to occur when the spi was less than zero mckee et al 1993 as described by mckee et al 1993 and zhang et al 2012 drought in a given year can be classified into nine categories according to the 12 month spi through to the end of december table 1 the effects of the drought on carbon flux are assessed using a standardized anomaly index sai katz and glantz 1986 which has been used in past research liu et al 2014 lotsch et al 2005 pei et al 2013 the sai is defined as the standardized departure from the average values using eq 7 7 s a i i c f i m e a n s t d where cfi is the carbon flux value for the year i and mean and std are the mean and standard deviation respectively of the annual values from 1961 to 2010 3 results 3 1 characterization of drought events in china during the past 50 years during the past five decades 1961 2010 china witnessed several drought events with different intensities and areal extents dai 2013 qian et al 2011 the means of the annual spi the 12 month spi through to the end of december and the percentages of the total areas in china affected by different drought intensities in each year show several years of extreme drought fig 2 in particular china experienced extensive drought in 1965 1966 1968 1972 1978 and 1986 between 1961 and 1990 spi 0 35 fig 2a when more than 24 of the total area in china was affected by moderate severe and extreme drought fig 2b the year 1986 showed the lowest value of spatially averaged spi during the last 50 years spi 0 51 and the area of china affected by severe and extreme drought was 15 approximately 1 4 millionkm2 drought was also observed across approximately 750 ground based meteorological stations liu et al 2014 over the last two decades 1991 2010 the drought events in 1997 and 2006 were the most serious spi 0 2 as more than 20 of the area in china was affected by moderate or even more severe drought according to the spatial distribution fig 3 of drought during the key years identified above most regions of china in 1986 experienced drought events except for parts of southwest china northeast china and northwest china fig 3f in 1972 vast areas of china 14 also experienced severe and extreme drought fig 3d even though drought did not occur widely throughout china in 1965 the severity was mostly severe to extreme where drought occurred 18 of the total area of china mainly in the tibetan plateau inner mongolia and north china fig 3a drought continued into 1966 but occurred in different areas mainly the middle and southeastern areas of china southeast china and north china experienced severe drought in 1978 fig 3e and 1997 fig 3g whereas the drought events in 2006 were mostly mild fig 3h 3 2 temporal variations of carbon fluxes and their responses to droughts in general the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations exhibited a similar temporal variation in their carbon flux anomalies and showed a clear decline of terrestrial ecosystem productivity during periods of drought figs s1a and s1b due to the low soil water stress function βt fig s1d moreover it is clearly seen from fig 4 that the carbon fluxes existed a significant decrease with the increase of drought intensity the decrease of spi however the introduction of the n cycle decreased the mean annual predicted carbon fluxes for example the annual gpp and nep for the clm45 cn simulation were 7 5pgcyr 1 and 0 18pgcyr 1 respectively compared to 10 9pgcyr 1 and 0 53pgcyr 1 respectively for the clm45 c simulation furthermore the clm45 cn simulation predicted lower inter annual variability iav in gpp and nep as measured by the standard deviation compared with the clm45 c simulation the iavs of gpp and nep for the clm45 cn simulation were 0 27pgcyr 1 and 0 21pgcyr 1 respectively while stdgpp 0 32pgcyr 1 and stdnep 0 26pgcyr 1 for the clm45 c simulation fig s1 the reduction in the carbon fluxes gpp and nep from clm45 cn compared to those of clm45 c can be explained as following since the c n biogeochemistry is active the amount of n required to support the potential growth is diagnosed in clm45 cn and gpp is reduced if n availability is insufficient to sustain the potential biomass increment in contrast clm45 c uses a prescribed n factor which varies among plant functional types to represent n constraints on photosynthesis fig 5 illustrates the difference in n limitation between the c n coupling model and c only model by presenting the spatial distribution of annual mean values of an instantaneous n limitation factor this factor is the ratio of down regulated gpp to potential gpp and expressed as a scalar ranging from 0 to 1 with values closer to 0 indicating stronger n limitation it is seen that clm45 cn fig 5b shows a stronger n limitation over the southeast central and northeast parts of china suggesting fewer amount of n than clm45 c fig 5a nevertheless the changes in n limitation over other areas were small on the order of 5 fig 5c it suggests that the availability of mineral n in clm45 cn is insufficient to maintain required plant c n stoichiometry and sustain the potential biomass increment because canopy level photosynthesis or gpp is derived by summing the sunlit and shaded leaf level rates scaled by the sunlit and shaded leaf area indices and limited to the availability of mineral n unmet plant n demand is translated back to a carbon supply surplus which is eliminated through reduction of gpp representing direct downregulation of photosynthetic rate under n limitation the indirect n limitation effect of reduced allocation to new growth on light capture is another significant downregulation mechanism in the model which operates on longer time scales and has a strong influence on global scale plant soil system states and fluxes thornton et al 2007 it is noted that the reduction in gpp may lead to a decrease in lai which then induces a reduction in canopy evapotranspiration oleson et al 2013 although the reduction in evapotranspiration may lead to an accumulation of soil water and increase the soil water stress function βt fig 4d and thus increase n mineralization the changes in soil water in tropical rainforest and boreal forest regions e g over most parts of southern china are insignificant lee et al 2013 therefore decreasing canopy level photosynthesis due to the stronger n limitation in clm45 cn would directly decrease the predicted national total gpp in china in addition lower n content in clm45 cn also decreased autotrophic respiration because tissue n content is a suitable index of cellular metabolic rate oleson et al 2013 the total heterotrophic demand for mineral n is in competition with the total plant n demand from all pfts sharing space on a single soil column limited mineral n in clm45 cn also decreased the heterotrophic respiration however the reduction of re fig 4c has a smaller magnitude fig 4c than that of gpp which then leads to a decrease of nep in clm45 cn compared to clm45 c notably the difference between the influences of the magnitude of n limitation and the dynamics of the internal n cycle on the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to drought was not separated in this study the annual carbon flux predicted by the clm45 cn simulation under drought conditions were relatively smaller than those from the clm45 c simulation fig 4 and s1 for example the predicted total nep in china in 1986 spi 0 51 decreased by 0 53pgcyr 1 and 0 32pgcyr 1 in the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations respectively due to continuous water scarcity in 1965 spi 0 45 and 1966 spi 0 36 a clear reduction in nep was predicted for 1966 fig s1a nep decreased by 0 69pgcyr 1 and 0 37pgcyr 1 for the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations respectively the same results were obtained for gpp fig s1b in addition under the drought conditions less available soil water reduced nitrogen mineralization and increased nitrogen limitation felzer et al 2011 this increased the correlation coefficient r 0 67 between the spi and gpp anomalies fig s1b for clm45 cn compared with clm45 c r 0 62 meanwhile since tissue n content has a close relationship with autotrophic respiration the correlation between the spi and re anomalies also increased in clm45 cn fig s1c however the correlation between spi and nep decreased r 0 51 and 0 45 for clm45 c and clm45 cn respectively we have not identified a mechanism explaining the reduction in the sensitivity of nep predictions to variation in precipitation in clm45 cn compared to clm45 c in general compared to the default pft map of clm4 5 used both in clm45 c and clm45 cn fig 6 a table 2 the dv simulation in the clm4 5 model produced a reasonably accurate vegetation distribution over northwest and northeast china however the predicted distribution over north and southeast china was less accurate fig 6 because clm45 cndv can simulate only unmanaged vegetation the crop pfts for the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations over northern china were instead comprised of deciduous broadleaf trees in addition the incorporation of the dv model in clm4 5 tended to decrease evergreen forests in the clm45 cndv simulation over southern china which further reduced the mean 7 3pgcyr 1 and iav 0 19pgcyr 1 of predicted gpp fig 4b nevertheless clm45 cndv predicted a slight increase in the nep mean value 0 43pgcyr 1 compared to clm45 cn 0 18pgcyr 1 these differences were due mainly to the different biogeography and mortality processes clm45 cndv changes the cn framework only as needed to simulate biogeography which induces the differences of the pft distribution fig 6 moreover clm45 cn assumes the whole plant mortality to be a constant rate of 2 yr 1 for all vegetation types in contrast clm45 cndv calculates the gap mortality based on heat stress and growth efficiency the different mortality algorithm of clm45 cndv resulted in lower vegetation mortality compared to clm45 cn gotangco castillo et al 2012 thus the clm45 cndv simulation maintained more total vegetation carbon and generated less litter and soil carbon than the clm45 cn simulation which in turn reduced heterotrophic respiration to give higher nep the intensity of the predicted change in gpp induced by drought also was dampened by the dv model for example the total gpp in china according to the clm45 cndv simulation decreased by only 0 3pgc yr 1 and 0 2pgcyr 1 in 1966 and 1986 respectively compared to reductions of 0 53pgcyr 1 and 0 46pgcyr 1 in the clm45 cn simulation further because the spatio temporal variations of the dv distribution had a stronger response to the atmospheric forcing data due to the incorporation of the dv model than did the static vegetation distribution in the clm45 c or clm45 cn simulations the spi contributed more to the gpp anomalies r 0 74 and re r 0 68 but clm45 cndv showed a weak relationship between the soil water stress function βt and drought index spi r 0 42 while the clm45 c r 0 64 and clm45 cn r 0 63 showed similar correlation coefficients between these two parameters fig s1d compared to the mte data between 1982 and 2010 all three clm4 5 configurations captured the temporal variation of gpp well before 2002 but showed large discrepancies thereafter fig s1b the clm45 c overestimated the mean of total gpp in china 10 9pgcyr 1 while clm45 cn 7 5pgcyr 1 and clm45 cndv 7 3pgcyr 1 predicted gpp that was closer to the mte dataset 7 0pgcyr 1 in addition clm45 c 0 32pgcyr 1 and clm45 cn 0 27pgcyr 1 overestimated the iav in gpp compared to the mte data 0 19pgcyr 1 while the clm45 cndv simulation 0 18pgcyr 1 showed a slight underestimation since no nep observations were available the nee data from mte were used to evaluate the clm4 5 simulations by multiplying the nee data by a factor of 1 0 however the accuracy for this transformation may have been affected by some disturbances e g biomass burning or land use oleson et al 2013 the iav of nep in chinese terrestrial ecosystems between 1982 and 2010 was predicted to be 0 26 0 21 and 0 06pgcyr 1 by the clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv simulations respectively compared to 0 08pgcyr 1 for the mte data it is noted that current attempts to produce maps of nee from flux towers have been much less successful than for gpp jung et al 2011 3 3 carbon cycle extremes in china s terrestrial ecosystems as the most severe drought over the past 50 years occurred in 1986 fig 3f the corresponding spatial distribution of the sais for the terrestrial ecosystem carbon fluxes nep gpp re fig 7 was of particular interest the predicted gpp mainly decreased over most of the tibetan plateau and parts of southwest southeast and northern china fig 7 middle panel in these areas there was also a clear decrease in ecosystem respiration fig 7 right panel compared to gpp and re there were large differences in the nep predictions among the spatial patterns produced by the three clm4 5 configurations fewer areas experienced the extreme decrease in carbon sequestration nep according to the clm45 cndv simulation compared to the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations although the drought events in 1965 fig 3a and 1966 fig 3b were not the most severe continuous water scarcity led to the greatest reduction in vegetation productivity of all the years in 1966 fig 8 the decrease in gpp mainly occurred in the central areas of china fig 8 middle panel and the three clm4 5 configurations produced similar spatial patterns except for lower sais simulated by clm45 cndv however the clm45 cndv simulation showed a greater decrease in re over central and southeast china due to differences in the representation of vegetation types in three model configurations this area is mainly covered by crop and evergreen needleleaf forest for the fixed pft in the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations fig 6a but by deciduous broadleaf forest in the clm45 cndv simulation fig 6 3 4 the lagged effects of drought on gpp and nep drought not only has immediate effects on the carbon cycle but also can initiate lagged responses pei et al 2013 reichstein et al 2013 as shown in fig 9 for the past 50years the sai of simulated gpp gppsai was closely correlated with the spi over southern china r 0 6 p 0 05 especially over cropland and grassland regions the accumulative lagged effect of drought on the gppsai occurred over relatively short timescales e g 1 3months over most areas of southern and central china over the tibetan plateau southwest china and northwest china the nep responded to drought over longer timescales 6 12months the clm45 cn simulation fig 9d predicted a similar response to drought as the clm45 c simulation fig 9b in contrast the dv model triggered a stronger response with higher correlations in northern and northeast china fig 9e and longer timescales in qinghai province fig 9f these differences further prove that the inclusion of both interactive n and dv simulations in the clm4 5 model yields a stronger response of gpp to drought compared to inclusion of the interactive n simulation alone this may be because the cndv configuration is able to adjust the response according to both the nitrogen carbon interaction and the establishment and mortality of vegetation fig 6 the nep is a balance between gpp and re so the complex relationship between re and the spi led to a weaker correlation between the nepsai and the spi compared to that between gpp and spi fig 10 the maximum correlation coefficients for the clm45 cndv simulation mainly occurred over the tibetan plateau and inner mongolia fig 10a and c and also across northern and northeast china fig 10e compared to gppsai nepsai was not significantly correlated with the spi p 0 05 over many vegetation covered areas of southern china fig 10 left panel in addition drought had a longer lagged effect on nep than on gpp fig 10 right panel 4 discussion 4 1 effects of climate conditions and vegetation types previous studies have pointed out that the effects of drought on terrestrial ecosystems are dependent on the vegetation types and climate regions liu et al 2014 pei et al 2013 reichstein et al 2013 for the three clm4 5 simulations the anomalies of annual gpp and re were significantly correlated with the annual mean spi p 0 05 over all of the sub regions in china fig 11 the response of gpp to drought was relatively strong r 0 6 over most of the nine sub regions fig 11a both the clm45 cn and clm45 cndv simulations increased the correlations of gpp with annual spi compared to the clm45 c simulation the comparatively lower correlations in southwest china may have occurred because ample water is usually available for the vegetation growth in this area while radiation is an important climate driver of gpp jia et al 2013b nemani et al 2003 there were significant discrepancies in the simulated response of re to drought among the three clm4 5 configurations fig 11b compared to the clm45 c simulation the clm45 cn simulation produced higher correlations of re with annual spi the incorporation of the dv model further strengthened the predicted response to drought which is consistent with the results shown in fig s1 the sais of predicted nep for the three simulations showed positive and significant correlations with the annual spi over arid and semiarid regions regions r2 r3 and r4 as well as in northeast china r1 but the correlations were not significant over southwest china fig 11c in addition the nep anomalies from the clm45 cndv simulations were not significantly correlated with the annual spi over central and southern parts of china r5 r7 and r8 overall the predicted anomalies of annual gpp and re were significantly correlated with the annual mean spi p 0 05 over all of the pfts notably there is no evergreen needleleaf forest based on the clm4 5 surface data set in china in the clm45 cndv simulation fig 6 or in simulations that exclude the dv model fig 1b compared to other pfts the gpp of the evergreen broadleaf forest had a lower correlation with spi fig 12 a and a similar response can be seen for re fig 12b these results indicate that water may not be the most important climate factor controlling evergreen broadleaf forest liu et al 2014 which exists mainly over southern china fig 1b while radiation dominantly drives its iav of productivity of this pft jia et al 2013b nemani et al 2003 in addition both croplands and grasslands were predicted to have higher correlations between the annual mean nep anomalies and the spi fig 12c the effects of human activities e g irrigation grazing were not taken into consideration in this study yet the two vegetation types do not have much capability in resisting severe drought and they are water sensitive for example they cannot obtain water from deeper soil layers with their shadow roots during the drought period compared with forest ecosystems and thus the nep would be greatly reduced wu and chen 2013 when sufficient soil moisture and favorable temperatures are available the nep also tends to respond more rapidly this high sensitivity has been demonstrated in previous studies huxman et al 2004 wu and chen 2013 to further investigate the effect of interactive n cycle on the response of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle to drought across pfts we examined the relationship between the total n mineralization flux and soil water stress function βt for 6 pfts over china fig 13 it is seen that clm45 cn has lower n mineralization than clm45 c for all pfts which suggests that the incorporation of interactive n cycle clearly reduces the availability of n mineralization and thus induces the reductions of gpp and re fig 4 and s1 fig 13 also shows that the n mineralization decreases with the decrease of soil water stress function βt e g intensification of drought for both clm45 c and clm45 cn over all pfts except the ebf fig 13b the reason is similar to that for the carbon fluxes fig 12 which may be due to that evergreen broadleaf forest exists mainly over southern china fig 1b where soil moisture is sufficient nemani et al 2003 jia et al 2013b liu et al 2014 in addition the correlations between the n availability and soil water availability for clm45 cn are higher over all pfts than those for clm45 c except the ebf this confirms that the carbon nitrogen coupling increases the relationship between the n mineralization and soil water and thus strengthens the predicted response of gpp to drought fig s1 4 2 impacts of drought intensity to better understand the drought sensitivities of the three model configurations responses to three levels of drought 25 50 and 75 reductions in precipitation were examined through two ideal site level drought experiments located in temperate deciduous forest 51 25 n 126 75 e and grass 46 25 n 116 25 e ecosystems respectively the three configurations clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv were compared to determine the level of the agreement in the timing and magnitude of the predicted responses of ecosystem carbon fluxes to different levels of drought fig 14 all model simulations followed a standardized spin up similar to that described in section 2 2 and were initialized from these spin ups followed by three years 2003 2005 of reduced precipitation for each site the three drought levels 25 50 and 75 reductions in precipitation are denoted hereafter as d25 d50 and d75 respectively while d0 identifies the control simulation under observed precipitation 0 reduction notably precipitation was reduced all year but other meteorological variables were not manipulated the incorporation of interactive n and dv simulations decreased predicted gpp and nep under different drought levels at both sites fig 14 compared to the simulation with the basic clm4 5 model as drought intensity increased there was increasing disagreement in the magnitude of carbon fluxes predicted by the basic and amended clm4 5 models for the grass ecosystem the discrepancy between clm45 c and clm45 cn became smaller as drought intensity increased e g d50 and d75 fig 13d and f compared to the forest pft grass showed a quicker decrease in gpp suggesting that it is more sensitive to drought due to relatively short roots 4 3 uncertainties of the clm4 5 simulations as described in section 3 2 and shown in fig 4 clm45 c overestimated the mean and iav of gpp compared to the mte data in contrast the incorporation of the interactive n cycle simulation into clm4 5 decreased the mean and iav of predicted gpp by 31 and 16 respectively the addition of the dv model led to a further reduction of 3 and 33 in the mean and iav of predicted gpp respectively these results suggest that the inclusion of interactive n i e modifying clm45 c to clm45 cn has greater impact on the averaged values of predicted gpp than does the further addition of the dv model i e modifying clm45 cn to clm45 cndv for carbon sequestration by the terrestrial ecosystems i e nep in china clm45 c and clm45 cn overestimated the iav while clm45 cndv showed a slight underestimation compared to the mte data jung et al 2011 in fact the average nep in china predicted by the clm45 c clm45 cn and clm45 cndv models was 0 52 0 18 and 0 42pgcyr 1 respectively the clm45 cn simulation is comparable to the results from five process based ecosystem models piao et al 2009 which produced nep estimates ranging from 0 13pgcyr 1 to 0 22pgcyr 1 with an average of 0 173 0 039pgcyr 1 the clm45 c and clm45 cndv models overestimated nep compared to the results of piao et al 2009 it is noted that the analysis of the carbon nitrogen coupling is subject to some limitations in the present study nitrogen deposition and application increased significantly in china during recent decades which might regulate the terrestrial carbon cycle in china but these factors were not considered in this paper 5 summary in this study the effects of incorporating the interactive n and dynamic vegetation simulations in the process based land surface model clm4 5 were investigated specifically examined were the effects on the predicted response of the terrestrial carbon cycle across china to drought as indicated by the spi china experienced several drought events with different intensities and areal extents from 1961 to 2010 especially notable years include 1965 1966 1968 1972 1978 and 1986 in which the spi 0 35 and more than 24 of the total area in china was affected by either moderate severe or extreme drought due to the continuous scarcity of soil water across 1965 and 1966 the total predicted nep of china declined by 0 69pgcyr 1 and 0 37pgcyr 1 in 1966 according to the clm45 c and clm45 cn simulations respectively compared to the default pft map of clm4 5 the clm45 cndv produced a similar vegetation distribution over northwest and northeast china except the differences over southern china where the deciduous forest was observed in clm45 cndv instead of the evergreen needleleaf forest in general incorporating the interactive n and dv into the clm4 5 model mostly reduced the annual means and iav of the simulated terrestrial carbon fluxes i e gpp and nep except for a slight increase in the nep mean value predicted by clm45 cndv 0 43pgcyr 1 compared to that by clm45 cn 0 18pgcyr 1 this difference was mainly due to clm45 cndv s different mortality algorithm based on heat stress and growth efficiency compared to the mte data 7 0pgcyr 1 between 1982 and 2010 clm45 c overestimates the annual gpp of the terrestrial ecosystems over china 10 9pgcyr 1 while clm45 cn 7 5pgcyr 1 and clm45 cndv 7 3pgcyr 1 have lower biases in addition clm45 c 0 32pgcyr 1 and clm45 cn 0 27pgcyr 1 overestimate the iav in gpp compared to the mte data 0 19pgcyr 1 while the clm45 cndv simulation 0 18pgcyr 1 shows a slight underestimation the carbon nitrogen coupling strengthened the predicted response of gpp to drought yielding a higher correlation with spi r c 0 62 r cn 0 67 but a weaker sensitivity of nep to spi r c 0 51 r cn 0 45 results also showed that drought has an accumulative lagged effect on gpp and that clm45 cndv predicted the longest lagged responses among the three clm4 5 configurations the lagged effects on gpp occurred over relatively shorter timescales in humid and warm areas e g southern and central china and over longer timescales across the tibetan plateau in contrast the predicted response of the nep to drought was not significant over many vegetation covered areas and the lagged effect occurred over longer timescales because ecosystem respiration had a complex relationship with drought this study provides an indication of the impacts of drought on the terrestrial carbon cycle with or without the use of interactive n and vegetation dynamics the results can provide insight into how the clm4 5 model predicts different response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to drought depending on whether simulations incorporate the interactive n and dv due to limited observations however the present study did not examine which version of the model could better simulate vegetation response to drought in addition although certain results from the present work are model specific this approach can be applied to compare the impacts of drought on
