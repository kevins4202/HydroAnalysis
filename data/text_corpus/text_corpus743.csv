3715,time varying parameters which are often expressed in functional forms have been widely used to improve hydrological modeling here we assume that the time varying parameters may be caused by deficiencies of the model structures to justify this point the simhyd model was selected as the base model and the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used to identify the temporal variation of parameters a synthetic experiment was designed to prove that model parameters can partly compensate for the structure deficiencies while the parameters time varying is unavoidable when the structure error has been involved two real case studies in the tongtianhe and xunhe basins were then conducted to explore the modifications of model structures based on the implications of time varying parameters the results are summarized as follows 1 model structural deficiencies can be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time varying 2 guided by the identified time varying parameters the energy based snow module was added and the interception module was removed in the tongtianhe basin and the infiltration was modified to follow a power function of the soil moisture in the xunhe basin as a result the model performance has been improved and the parameter variations have been diminished 3 the modifications of the simhyd model structure outperformed the models with time varying parameters in functional forms this study provides insights into the compensatory relationship between model structural deficiencies and parameters and proposes a method to improve model structures by time varying parameters keywords simhyd structural deficiencies time varying parameters structure modifications data assimilation 1 introduction the hydrological model is one of the most effective tools to describe the rainfall runoff relationship haque et al 2015 herman et al 2013 by presenting complex real world hydrological processes as simplified mathematical systems konapala et al 2020 pathiraja et al 2016 singh and frevert 2006 however uncertainties arise in the simplification process exploring and reducing the sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling is therefore essential to improve runoff prediction ability liu and gupta 2007 thiboult et al 2016 forcing data model parameters and model structure are the three main sources of uncertainties in hydrological modeling jiang et al 2018 smith et al 2008 xu et al 2021 measurement errors of forcing data baldassarre and montanari 2009 and a temporal spatial mismatch of data resolution affect model performance balin et al 2010 model parameters are calibrated to match the observed historical data and tend to be uncertain since it is hard to identify a set of unique optimal parameters and obtain adapted parameters under the changing climate qi et al 2019 sellami et al 2015 xie et al 2020 model structure uncertainties result from imperfect representations of hydrological processes including the simplifications and omissions of physical processes clark et al 2008 gupta et al 1998 moreover for basins under diverse hydro meteorological conditions models are often selected according to previous experience e g habit practicality convenience rather than tailored based on physical processes spieler et al 2020 structural errors arise because it is difficult to build a new model specific to a basin or select a single best model under different environmental conditions fenicia et al 2011 gao et al 2020 the importance of model structure has been addressed in several studies poulin et al 2011 mentioned that structural uncertainties significantly impact the model performance more than parameter estimation uncertainties thus the disposition of input and parameter uncertainties is insufficient for reliable predictions gourley and vieux 2006 therefore research on structural uncertainty plays a key role in hydrological modeling gao et al 2020 three typical techniques are used to handle model structural uncertainties 1 multi model ensembles combine predictions of alternative model structures by model weights to complement each other and reduce structural uncertainties moges et al 2021 samani et al 2018 sehgal et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 2 flexible modular frameworks including fuse clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 and raven craig et al 2020 can be used to test a wide variety of modeling paradigms to understand the structural uncertainty 3 time varying parameter functions are applied as extensions of the model structure due to the wrong missing representation of physical processes or catchment changes grigg and hughes 2018 westra et al 2014 xiong et al 2019 for the last method parameter variations are normally obtained based on functions of meteorological factors zeng et al 2019 catchment characteristics deng et al 2018 and time such as a sine function pan et al 2019 westra et al 2014 developed the storage capacity parameter of the gr4j model into a function which describes seasonality annual variability and longer term trends streamflow predictions especially in dry periods were significantly enhanced when the storage capacity parameter varied over time however the relationships between the parameters and influence indicators are hard to be perfectly represented by functions since the physical mechanism of the compensation relationship is unclear thus an assumption is raised that time varying parameter forms can partly compensate for the inferior model structure caused by imperfect representations of the real world including a particular poorly represented process or a major change in catchment conditions if this is true with time invariant parameters as the target the temporal evolution of parameters can provide insights into structural inadequacies a hydrological model with time invariant parameters is easier to understand and use pathiraja et al 2016 the objective of this study is to propose a method for diagnosing hydrological model structural deficiencies and then improving the structure by time varying parameters three questions should be explored to fulfill this aim 1 whether a compensation relationship exists between the model parameters and structure 2 whether the model structure modified based on time varying parameters improves hydrological predictions and reduces parameter temporal variations and 3 which method is more effective by comparing the modified model structures and functional forms of time varying parameters the paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the methodologies the synthetic experiment is described in section 3 followed by the description of real world basins in section 4 the results and discussion of the case studies are presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes the main conclusions of the study 2 methodology the flow chart of the methodologies is presented in fig 1 the simhyd model section 2 1 is selected as the base model sensitive parameters are screened out to reduce the computational cost by the parameter sensitivity analysis section 2 2 the enkf method is used to identify the temporal variation of the sensitive parameters section 2 3 the influence factors are selected from the potential hydro climatic factors by the correlation analysis with time varying parameters section 2 4 based on the implications of influence factors model structure modifications section 2 5 1 are employed to improve model performance the functional forms of time varying parameters section 2 5 2 are established as the benchmark for comparison purposes the evaluation metrics section 2 6 are used to assess the model performance 2 1 hydrological model simhyd a conceptual hydrological model simhyd is used in this study simhyd was developed by chiew et al 2002 has seven parameters and can simulate daily or monthly runoff with time series of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration the model has been successfully tested in numerous areas including australia chiew et al 2002 china zhan et al 2014 and other countries yu and zhu 2015 the model structure of simhyd by chiew et al 2002 is presented in fig 2 and the parameters are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 2 the rainfall is first intercepted by the vegetation cover the parameter insc mm represents the interception store capacity the excess water is subjected to an infiltration function eq 1 that determines the infiltration capacity inf 1 inf m i n c o e f f e s q sms smsc e x c where the parameter coeff mm is the maximum infiltration loss when the soil moisture store sms is empty the parameter sq is the infiltration loss exponent controlling the rate of decrease in the infiltration capacity the infiltration capacity decreases until the soil moisture increases to the soil moisture store capacity smsc mm the exc is the rainfall after the interception when the rainfall intensity after interception exceeds the infiltration capability the infiltration capacity is satisfied and the remainder becomes the infiltration excess runoff the infiltrated water is divided into interflow int groundwater store recharge rec and soil moisture store interflow is generated by a linear function of soil moisture storage groundwater recharge is also estimated by a linear function of soil moisture storage the remaining infiltration replenishes the soil moisture store 2 int s u b sms smsc i n f 3 rec c r a k sms smsc i n f i n t 4 bas k g w where the parameter sub and crak are the constants of proportionality controlling the division of the infiltration the outflow coefficient k in the linear function of groundwater storage gw eq 4 controls the estimation of baseflow evapotranspiration et from the soil is calculated by a linear function of soil moisture storage and cannot excess the potential evapotranspiration pet 5 et m i n 10 sms smsc p e t the total streamflow is formed by summing the three runoff components infiltration excess runoff interflow and baseflow since the simhyd model runs with a daily time step in this study four parameters are added for the flow routing of three runoff components the number of linear reservoirs n and the storage coefficient nk in the instantaneous unit hydrograph are used in the surface runoff routing the recession constants ki and kg in linear reservoirs are employed for the routing of the interflow and baseflow respectively the genetic rosenbrock and simplex algorithms are combined to calibrate model parameters the optimal parameters obtained by the genetic algorithm is used as the initial values of the rosenbrock algorithm and the optimal parameters of the rosenbrock algorithm is then used as the initial values of the simplex algorithm chen et al 2012 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 2 2 the morris method sensitivity analysis sa can be used to screen out the key parameters that significantly impact the outputs of hydrological models jiang et al 2015 global sa such as the morris method morris 1991 and the sobol method sobol 1993 is most commonly used in hydrological modeling applications baroni and tarantola 2014 song et al 2015 the morris method was selected in this study since it provides similar results to the sobol method with a reduced computational burden king and perera 2013 rebolho et al 2018 zhang and liu 2021 the morris method estimates the parameter sensitivity by calculating the standardized effect of the same change δ of the input parameter king and perera 2013 the elementary effect ee i is calculated as follows 6 ee i f p 1 p 2 p i 1 p i δ p i 1 p n f p 1 p 2 p n δ where p 1 p 2 p n correspond to n input parameters f p is the objective function δ is a positive or negative change which is a multiple of 1 m 1 m is the number of levels the ee i is computed over k trajectories 7 μ i 1 k j 1 k ee i j 8 σ i 1 k j 1 k ee i j 1 k j 1 k ee i j 2 where μ i and σ i are the mean absolute value and standard deviation of the elementary effects ee i j j 1 2 k respectively μ i estimates the influence of the input parameter p i on the target function f p a larger μ i value implies that the output f p is more sensitive to the parameter p i a larger σ i value indicates that the parameter p i has stronger interactions with other input parameters 2 3 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter is selected since it is applicable to a variety of nonlinear problems and has been successfully used in time invariant parameter estimations for hydrological models abbaszadeh et al 2019 the monte carlo method is used to generate an ensemble of state simulations in the kalman filter to update the state variables and error covariance matrix deng et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 the implementation of the enkf is as follows 1 construct state equations and observation equations based on the selected state and observation variables 2 initialize the state variable ensembles at the first time step by a gaussian distribution 3 initialize the background field in the time step k 1 by the analyzed variables in the time step k the parameters and state variables are then forecasted by perturbing the analyzed variables in the previous time step 4 perturb the observations and calculate the kalman gain matrix the forecasted parameters and state variables at time step k 1 can then be updated into the analysis values 2 4 correlation analysis between time varying parameters and hydro climatic indicators the pearson correlation analysis is used to explore the most influence indicators related to the parameter variations since the linear relation has been proved to be a simple and effective functional type with strong extensibility based on the previous research deng et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the hydro climatic indicators including the precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e relative humidity wet sunshine duration sun temperature t highest temperature tmax lowest temperature tmin wind speed vw and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are mainly considered in this study the pearson correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 to1 the correlation relationship is stronger when r is closer to 1 2 5 model modifications 2 5 1 modifications of the model structure the structure of the base model could be modified for specific catchments under the implications of the identified hydro climatic indicators a conceptual model consists of several modules such as evapotranspiration infiltration runoff generation and routing different modules would be influenced by various factors eq 9 9 module f a b x where module is a structure module in the model and is subjected to the function of catchment factors a b x the conceptualization of the specific module can be reconsidered when the corresponding influence factors are identified in the correlation analysis for example the potential evapotranspiration pet and rainfall p represent the energy demand and water supply respectively which are two limitations in the evapotranspiration process eq 10 the modifications of the evapotranspiration module are possible when the potential evapotranspiration and rainfall are identified as influence factors 10 et f p e t p where et is the actual evapotranspiration 2 5 2 functional forms of time varying parameters the functional forms of time varying parameters are established as the benchmarks several studies have linked parameter variation with covariates that reflect hydro climatic dynamics of a catchment deng et al 2019 merz and bloeschl 2009 yang et al 2009 the linear relationship eq 11 is considered in the study 11 para a x b where x is the influence catchment indicator and para is the identified time varying parameter a and b are the parameters of the functions 2 6 evaluation metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the logarithmic transformed nselog kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the volume error ve and the structural risk minimization srm schoups et al 2008 are used to evaluate model performance the metrics are defined as follows 12 nse 1 i 1 n q si q oi 2 i 1 n q oi q o 2 13 nse log 1 i 1 n l o g q si l o g q o 2 i 1 n l o g q oi l o g q o 2 14 kge 1 r 1 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 15 ve i 1 n q si q oi i 1 n q oi 16 kge srm 1 k n k n l n k n lnn 2 n 1 1 k g e where q oi and q si are observed and simulated runoff q o and l o g q o are the mean value of the observed runoff and the logarithmic transformed observed runoff r is the linear correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated runoff σ obs and σ sim are standard deviations of the observed and simulated runoff μ obs and μ sim are means of the observed and simulated runoff n is the length of runoff series and k is the number of parameters nse values range from minus infinity to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance the logarithmic transformed nselog has greater emphasis on low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 zhu et al 2020 kge describes correlation and errors in variability and bias between simulated and observed flow with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance the volume error ve is used to evaluate the bias between the observed and simulated runoff a ve value of 0 indicates no bias in the runoff volume and a positive value means the simulation overestimates the overall runoff the srm is to balance the model complexity and efficiency which has been proved effective to reduce overparameterization the lower srm represents better performance kgesrm is used in the study in summary the simhyd is diagnosed based on the influence factors of time varying parameters the diagnose steps include 1 sensitive parameters are screened out 2 sensitive parameters are identified as time varying parameters 3 the influence factors of time varying parameters are analyzed 4 the model structure is modified based on the implications of influence factors the modified model is then regarded as the new base model and diagnosed repeatedly until the assimilated parameters are relatively stable over time 3 synthetic experiment 3 1 synthetic experiment setups a controlled synthetic experiment was designed to explore the compensatory relationship between the model structure and parameters it is difficult to perfectly simulate hydrological processes in real world basins because the true model and parameters are unknown however a true model and controllable structural errors can be used to discuss the compensatory relationship between the model structure and parameters the steps of the synthetic experiment are illustrated in fig 3 as follows 1 the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship was first generated the simyhd model is driven by the synthetic parameters and the forcing data the simhyd model and synthetic parameters are the true model structure and parameters for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship 2 a model with structural deficiencies simhyd in was then calibrated for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship simhyd in was formed after the deletion of the interception store from simhyd for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship structural errors existed in the simhyd in model 3 the sensitive parameters in simhyd and simhyd in were screened out by the morris method and then identified as time varying parameters by enkf using synthetic runoff respectively the union of most sensitive parameters based on the objective functions nse and ve was selected in the study the temporal variations of assimilated parameters in the two models are compared 3 2 the compensation between structural errors and time varying parameters the controlled synthetic experiment aims to explore the relationship between the temporal variation of parameters and model structural deficiencies the sensitive parameters of simhyd and simhyd in were the same the soil moisture storage capacity smsc and the constant of proportionality in the interflow equation sub fig 4 shows the true values calibrated values and temporal evolutions of the assimilated parameters in simhyd and simhyd in dashed red dashed black solid yellow lines and solid blue lines denote the true parameters calibrated parameters assimilated smsc and assimilated sub respectively both smsc and sub of simhyd were relatively stable and gradually converged to the true values the calibrated parameters deviated from true values when simhyd in was calibrated the assimilated parameters of simhyd in showed significant temporal fluctuations the performance indexes of the model with the true calibrated and assimilated parameters are listed in table 2 the structure and parameters of simhyd were true for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship thus all the model performance indexes using the true calibrated and assimilated parameters produced a perfect simulation in the simhyd model however the different parameter schemes in simhyd in resulted in different model performance when simhyd in using true parameters the nses were close to zero and the ves were 1 in calibration and validation periods the poor performance was understandable because simhyd in had significant structural errors for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship nevertheless the calibrated model performed well with parameters that deviated from true values both in calibration and validation periods when assimilated the nses were closer to 1 in the calibration period the synthetic experiment showed that calibrated parameters could partly compensate for the structure deficiencies which was consistent with the finding of viglione et al 2018 however the parameter s time varying was unavoidable when the structure error was involved the time varying parameters further improved the model performance without reducing structural errors thus model structural deficiencies can be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time varying 4 studied catchments and data two real case studies were used to demonstrate how to diagnose the deficiencies of model structure based on the implications of time varying parameters 4 1 tongtianhe basin the tongtianhe basin fig 5 in qinghai province china covers an area of about 140 000 km2 with an averaging elevation being 5 000 m a s l the mainstream across the basin is approximately 1206 km and drains through the outlet in zhimenda the mean annual precipitation is about 440 mm the total precipitation in may september accounts for approximately 86 of the annual precipitation li et al 2020 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 796 mm the tongtianhe basin lies on the tibet plateau and the solar radiation is intense owing to the thin air the vegetation is sparse in the basin and the area is mainly covered by alpine meadow and grassland the mean annual runoff is approximately 99 mm the meteorological data used in the tongtianhe basin include precipitation relative humidity sunshine duration temperature highest temperature lowest temperature and wind speed from 1 1 1983 until 12 31 2012 the meteorological point data are obtained from five meteorological stations including yushu tuotuohe qulaima wudaoliang and qingshuihe the areal precipitation data is calculated using the thiessen polygon method the potential evapotranspiration is derived by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the daily runoff is from the observation in the zhimenda hydrological station the ndvi is obtained from tucker et al 2005 4 2 xunhe basin the xunhe basin fig 5 in shaanxi province china covers an area of about 6 448 km2 with an averaging elevation ranging from 200 to 3 000 m a s l the mainstream across the basin is approximately 218 km and drains into the hanjiang river through the outlet in xiangjiaping station the mean annual precipitation is about 850 mm the mean annual runoff is approximately 357 mm the meteorological data used in the xunhe basin include precipitation relative humidity sunshine duration temperature highest temperature lowest temperature and wind speed from 1 1 1991 until 12 31 2001 the areal precipitation is calculated based on 28 rainfall stations other meteorological data are obtained from the zheng an meteorological station the areal pan evaporation is from two gauged stations and the daily runoff is from the observation in xiangjiaping hydrological station 5 results and discussion 5 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the setup of the morris method in the study is m 12 k 1000 fig 6 presents the parameter sensitivities of simhyd based on two objective functions nse and ve the sensitive parameters have larger μ whereas the points distributed around the y axis are insensitive parameters the union of most sensitive parameters based on nse and ve was selected the results showed that the soil moisture storage capacity smsc and the constant of proportionality in the interflow equation sub were selected in the tongtianhe basin since they were the most sensitive parameters for nse and ve respectively the soil moisture module is the core part of the model the calculations of evaporation infiltration excess runoff interflow and base flow involve soil moisture smsc thus plays an important role in the entire calculation process sub is the proportionality constant in the equation of saturation excess runoff and interflow saturation excess runoff is an important runoff generation type several studies have also reported that interflow dominantly contributes to storm runoff in headwater basins fan et al 2015 swarowsky et al 2012 the importance of saturation excess runoff and interflow can explain the high sensitivity of sub similarly the infiltration loss exponent sq was selected in the xunhe basin since sq was the most sensitive both for nse and ve 5 2 parameter identification and correlation analysis the simhyd model was calibrated in the studied basins the insensitive parameters were kept constant and sensitive parameters were identified as time varying parameters based on the observed runoff the daily values and multi year mean daily values of sensitive parameters in the tongtianhe and xunhe basins are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively both smsc and sub fluctuated significantly in the tongtianhe basin fig 7 when calculated into the multi year daily mean values the seasonal trends were obvious smsc was found to decrease in march reach the minimum around may and then increase until september sub values also gradually changed between march and september the trend of sub was increased first and then decreased which is the opposite of smsc in the xunhe basin the time varying sq also showed seasonal variations fig 8 the sq was bigger in the summer the pearson correlation analysis between the time varying parameters and hydro climatic indicators is used to explore the most influence indicators in fig 9 the correlation analysis indicated that smsc was strongly related to the potential evapotranspiration r 0 6 in the tongtianhe basin wind speed temperature variables t tmax tmin and ndvi also influenced the variations of smsc r 0 4 the potential evapotranspiration and wind speed were two main factors for sub in the tongtianhe basin r 0 4 in the xunhe basin the precipitation and relative humidity were considered as influence factors for sq r 0 4 the hydro climatic indicators with r 0 4 would be used for the establishment of parameter functional forms and model modifications 5 3 modifications of model structures 5 3 1 tongtianhe basin the tongtianhe basin is located in the source region of the yangtze river and the multi year average temperature is lower than 0 c thus the snowmelt is important in the hydrological cycle of the tongtianhe basin the temperature based and energy based methods are two main alternative methods to simulate snow melting the models used are described in the appendix table 3 shows the model performance of simhyd and simhyd sn simhyd with snow module in the tongtianhe basin fig 10 shows the intra annual variability of parameters in different models the temperature based or energy based simhyd sn behaved better than the simhyd from the aspects of nse nselog kge ve and kgesrm in calibration and validation periods both the parameter variability of the temperature based simhyd sn and energy based simhyd sn decreased in comparison with the simhyd model the inferior performance of smhyd was understandable since simhyd had structural errors in the tongtianhe basin nevertheless the decreased parameter variability in simhyd sn proved that time varying parameters in simhyd were compensating for the incorrect model structure the temperature variables potential evapotranspiration wind speed and ndvi were identified as influence factors based on the correlation analysis between hydro climatic indicators and time varying parameters both the calculation theories of the temperature based and energy based methods have a relation with the temperature since the potential evapotranspiration represents the energy supply and the wind speed influence the convective conductive heat transfer qh in the energy based method simhyd sn was established by adding the energy based method into simhyd the simhyd sn with temperature based method was also implemented as the candidate model for comparison compared with the simhyd sn model using temperature based method the simhyd sn with energy based method significantly enhanced the performance the nselog kge and kgesrm in the validation period changed from 0 75 0 78 0 26 in the temperature based model to 0 82 0 82 0 21 in the energy based model respectively although both the temperature based simhyd sn and energy based simhyd sn reduced the parameter variability in the simhyd model the fluctuations of time varying parameters in the energy based simhyd sn were less obvious fig 10 thus the simhyd sn with energy based method was more advantageous in the tongtianhe basin from aspects of performance metrics and parameter variability another noticeable influence indicator was ndvi the vegetation in the tongtianhe basin is sparse the main cover types are meadow and grassland wang et al 2018 which have weak interception ability van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 thus the simhyd sn was modified into simhyd sn in by removing the interception module tentatively the performance of simhyd sn in was further improved based on simhyd sn table 3 the seasonal variations of smsc and sub were not obvious thus the simhyd sn in with energy based method was recommended in the tongtianhe basin 5 3 2 xunhe basin the time varying sq of the simhyd model in the xunhe basin was identified with seasonality the precipitation and relative humidity were identified as influence factors since the precipitation influenced infiltration directly the infiltration process in simhyd was modified in the xunhe basin the infiltration is subjected to an exponential function of the soil moisture in simhyd the power function of the soil moisture is also commonly used to calculate the infiltration in hydrological models such as the standard hbv model thus the simhyd was modified into simhyd inf by replacing the infiltration with the hbv approach see appendix for model description another modification of simhyd in the xunhe basin was the evapotranspiration module the precipitation after interception module infiltrates into the soil for runoff generation replenishment of soil moisture and evapotranspiration in simhyd in several models such as the gr4j model the precipitation is to satisfy the potential evapotranspiration before infiltrating into the soil described in the appendix thus the simhyd was modified into simhyd e to make the precipitation after interception satisfy the potential evapotranspiration first the simhyd inf behaved better than the simhyd in terms of nse nselog kge ve and kgesrm table 3 although the simhyd had one parameter more than the simhyd inf table a1 the performance of simhyd e in low flow simulations was poor in contrast to the parameter variation in the simhyd the seasonal variability of time variant sq was still obvious in the simhyd e the shape coefficient of the infiltration function β was identified as time varying in simhyd inf the seasonal variability was smaller in simhyd inf fig 10 the compensation between time varying parameters and model structure deficiencies was weaker in simhyd inf thus the simhyd inf was recommended in the xunhe basin by the proposed method to verify the metrics between models were significantly different the ensemble results were obtained in the experiment with different random seeds in the calibration algorithm genetic algorithm fig 11 and fig 12 show evaluation results of ensembles in tongtianhe and xunhe basins respectively the energy based simhyd sn in model outperformed other models significantly in terms of nse nselog kge and kgesrm in the tongtianhe basin p 0 05 while the simhyd inf model was significant based on nse nselog and ve in the xunhe basin 5 4 performance comparison between modifications of model structures and models with linear functional forms of time varying parameters the linear functional forms of time varying parameters were constructed as the benchmark modifications constants a and b in eq 11 were calibrated together with the other model parameters to drive the model in the tongtianhe basin both smsc and sub were predicted by the functional forms of potential evapotranspiration wind speed temperature variables respectively the functional forms were adopted to predict the time varying sq based on hydro climatic indicators including the precipitation and relative humidity in the xunhe basin table 4 shows the performance of simhyd with time varying parameters in functional forms the performance indexes of simhyd with time varying parameters were generally better than simhyd with constant parameters in the studied basins nevertheless structure modifications derived by the proposed method simhyd sn in in the tongtianhe basin and simhyd inf in the xunhe basin could further improve the performance in addition the linear multivariate functions were established in each basin the principal component analysis pca was employed to de correlate the input variables the first three principal components were extracted in the tongtianhe basin which could explain 99 of the original variables including potential evapotranspiration wind speed and temperature variables t tmax tmin two principal components were extracted in the xunhe basin compared with linear univariate functions of time varying parameters the linear multivariate functions could provide better performance in several metrics but fail to improve kgesrm as more complex functions were applied table 4 both linear univariate and multivariate functions did not outperform the model structure selected in the studied basins the results implied that the improvements of the model performance achieved by the linear univariate or multivariate functions of time varying parameters were limited the model structure can be regarded as deficient in hydrological modeling both when a process is particular poorly represented and a major change occurs in catchment conditions westra et al 2014 further explanatory variables could be found for time varying parameters caused by both wrong missing process representation and non stationarity catchment conditions and the model is extended by time varying parameter functions however the relationships between the parameters and explanatory variables were hard to be perfectly represented by functions a proper structure would be more effective to enhance the modeling ability since the structure describes physical processes more clearly 6 conclusions this study aims to diagnose hydrological structural errors and improve model performance through the implication of time varying parameters the simhyd model was applied in daily runoff simulations and the time variations of sensitive parameters were identified by the enkf method a synthetic experiment was designed to demonstrate the compensation relationship between the model structure and parameters two real case studies in the tongtianhe and xunhe basins were conducted to explore the modifications of model structures based on the implications of time varying parameters the following conclusions were drawn 1 the results of a controlled synthetic experiment showed that model structural errors could be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time varying simhyd in had notable structural errors for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship the assimilated parameters in simhyd in showed severe fluctuations and improved the prediction the parameters time varying was unavoidable when the structure error was involved 2 the time varying parameters provide guidance for modifications of model structures by identifying the influence indicators in the studied basins in the tongtianhe basin the temperature variables potential evapotranspiration wind speed and ndvi were identified as the influence indicators of the time varying smsc and sub combined with the basin characteristics the addition of the energy based snow module and the deletion of the interception module were implemented for simhyd in the tongtianhe basin similarly the precipitation and relative humidity were identified as the influence indicators of the time varying sq in the xunhe basin the infiltration was modified to be subjected to the power function of the soil moisture the modifications improved model performance and diminished the parameter variations 3 the modifications of the model structure are more effective to enhance runoff simulations than linear univariate or multivariate functional forms of time varying parameters in the studied basins the time varying parameters yielded better performance indexes than the base model the structure modifications which help the model more accurately illustrate the hydrological processes significantly enhanced the model efficiency from the aspects of nse nselog kge ve and kgesrm this study demonstrated that the time varying parameters could provide effective implications for modifications of model structures further work will focus on identifying appropriate model structures by time varying parameters based on flexible modular frameworks credit authorship contribution statement liting zhou conceptualization

3715,time varying parameters which are often expressed in functional forms have been widely used to improve hydrological modeling here we assume that the time varying parameters may be caused by deficiencies of the model structures to justify this point the simhyd model was selected as the base model and the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used to identify the temporal variation of parameters a synthetic experiment was designed to prove that model parameters can partly compensate for the structure deficiencies while the parameters time varying is unavoidable when the structure error has been involved two real case studies in the tongtianhe and xunhe basins were then conducted to explore the modifications of model structures based on the implications of time varying parameters the results are summarized as follows 1 model structural deficiencies can be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time varying 2 guided by the identified time varying parameters the energy based snow module was added and the interception module was removed in the tongtianhe basin and the infiltration was modified to follow a power function of the soil moisture in the xunhe basin as a result the model performance has been improved and the parameter variations have been diminished 3 the modifications of the simhyd model structure outperformed the models with time varying parameters in functional forms this study provides insights into the compensatory relationship between model structural deficiencies and parameters and proposes a method to improve model structures by time varying parameters keywords simhyd structural deficiencies time varying parameters structure modifications data assimilation 1 introduction the hydrological model is one of the most effective tools to describe the rainfall runoff relationship haque et al 2015 herman et al 2013 by presenting complex real world hydrological processes as simplified mathematical systems konapala et al 2020 pathiraja et al 2016 singh and frevert 2006 however uncertainties arise in the simplification process exploring and reducing the sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling is therefore essential to improve runoff prediction ability liu and gupta 2007 thiboult et al 2016 forcing data model parameters and model structure are the three main sources of uncertainties in hydrological modeling jiang et al 2018 smith et al 2008 xu et al 2021 measurement errors of forcing data baldassarre and montanari 2009 and a temporal spatial mismatch of data resolution affect model performance balin et al 2010 model parameters are calibrated to match the observed historical data and tend to be uncertain since it is hard to identify a set of unique optimal parameters and obtain adapted parameters under the changing climate qi et al 2019 sellami et al 2015 xie et al 2020 model structure uncertainties result from imperfect representations of hydrological processes including the simplifications and omissions of physical processes clark et al 2008 gupta et al 1998 moreover for basins under diverse hydro meteorological conditions models are often selected according to previous experience e g habit practicality convenience rather than tailored based on physical processes spieler et al 2020 structural errors arise because it is difficult to build a new model specific to a basin or select a single best model under different environmental conditions fenicia et al 2011 gao et al 2020 the importance of model structure has been addressed in several studies poulin et al 2011 mentioned that structural uncertainties significantly impact the model performance more than parameter estimation uncertainties thus the disposition of input and parameter uncertainties is insufficient for reliable predictions gourley and vieux 2006 therefore research on structural uncertainty plays a key role in hydrological modeling gao et al 2020 three typical techniques are used to handle model structural uncertainties 1 multi model ensembles combine predictions of alternative model structures by model weights to complement each other and reduce structural uncertainties moges et al 2021 samani et al 2018 sehgal et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 2 flexible modular frameworks including fuse clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 and raven craig et al 2020 can be used to test a wide variety of modeling paradigms to understand the structural uncertainty 3 time varying parameter functions are applied as extensions of the model structure due to the wrong missing representation of physical processes or catchment changes grigg and hughes 2018 westra et al 2014 xiong et al 2019 for the last method parameter variations are normally obtained based on functions of meteorological factors zeng et al 2019 catchment characteristics deng et al 2018 and time such as a sine function pan et al 2019 westra et al 2014 developed the storage capacity parameter of the gr4j model into a function which describes seasonality annual variability and longer term trends streamflow predictions especially in dry periods were significantly enhanced when the storage capacity parameter varied over time however the relationships between the parameters and influence indicators are hard to be perfectly represented by functions since the physical mechanism of the compensation relationship is unclear thus an assumption is raised that time varying parameter forms can partly compensate for the inferior model structure caused by imperfect representations of the real world including a particular poorly represented process or a major change in catchment conditions if this is true with time invariant parameters as the target the temporal evolution of parameters can provide insights into structural inadequacies a hydrological model with time invariant parameters is easier to understand and use pathiraja et al 2016 the objective of this study is to propose a method for diagnosing hydrological model structural deficiencies and then improving the structure by time varying parameters three questions should be explored to fulfill this aim 1 whether a compensation relationship exists between the model parameters and structure 2 whether the model structure modified based on time varying parameters improves hydrological predictions and reduces parameter temporal variations and 3 which method is more effective by comparing the modified model structures and functional forms of time varying parameters the paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the methodologies the synthetic experiment is described in section 3 followed by the description of real world basins in section 4 the results and discussion of the case studies are presented in section 5 section 6 summarizes the main conclusions of the study 2 methodology the flow chart of the methodologies is presented in fig 1 the simhyd model section 2 1 is selected as the base model sensitive parameters are screened out to reduce the computational cost by the parameter sensitivity analysis section 2 2 the enkf method is used to identify the temporal variation of the sensitive parameters section 2 3 the influence factors are selected from the potential hydro climatic factors by the correlation analysis with time varying parameters section 2 4 based on the implications of influence factors model structure modifications section 2 5 1 are employed to improve model performance the functional forms of time varying parameters section 2 5 2 are established as the benchmark for comparison purposes the evaluation metrics section 2 6 are used to assess the model performance 2 1 hydrological model simhyd a conceptual hydrological model simhyd is used in this study simhyd was developed by chiew et al 2002 has seven parameters and can simulate daily or monthly runoff with time series of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration the model has been successfully tested in numerous areas including australia chiew et al 2002 china zhan et al 2014 and other countries yu and zhu 2015 the model structure of simhyd by chiew et al 2002 is presented in fig 2 and the parameters are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 2 the rainfall is first intercepted by the vegetation cover the parameter insc mm represents the interception store capacity the excess water is subjected to an infiltration function eq 1 that determines the infiltration capacity inf 1 inf m i n c o e f f e s q sms smsc e x c where the parameter coeff mm is the maximum infiltration loss when the soil moisture store sms is empty the parameter sq is the infiltration loss exponent controlling the rate of decrease in the infiltration capacity the infiltration capacity decreases until the soil moisture increases to the soil moisture store capacity smsc mm the exc is the rainfall after the interception when the rainfall intensity after interception exceeds the infiltration capability the infiltration capacity is satisfied and the remainder becomes the infiltration excess runoff the infiltrated water is divided into interflow int groundwater store recharge rec and soil moisture store interflow is generated by a linear function of soil moisture storage groundwater recharge is also estimated by a linear function of soil moisture storage the remaining infiltration replenishes the soil moisture store 2 int s u b sms smsc i n f 3 rec c r a k sms smsc i n f i n t 4 bas k g w where the parameter sub and crak are the constants of proportionality controlling the division of the infiltration the outflow coefficient k in the linear function of groundwater storage gw eq 4 controls the estimation of baseflow evapotranspiration et from the soil is calculated by a linear function of soil moisture storage and cannot excess the potential evapotranspiration pet 5 et m i n 10 sms smsc p e t the total streamflow is formed by summing the three runoff components infiltration excess runoff interflow and baseflow since the simhyd model runs with a daily time step in this study four parameters are added for the flow routing of three runoff components the number of linear reservoirs n and the storage coefficient nk in the instantaneous unit hydrograph are used in the surface runoff routing the recession constants ki and kg in linear reservoirs are employed for the routing of the interflow and baseflow respectively the genetic rosenbrock and simplex algorithms are combined to calibrate model parameters the optimal parameters obtained by the genetic algorithm is used as the initial values of the rosenbrock algorithm and the optimal parameters of the rosenbrock algorithm is then used as the initial values of the simplex algorithm chen et al 2012 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 2 2 the morris method sensitivity analysis sa can be used to screen out the key parameters that significantly impact the outputs of hydrological models jiang et al 2015 global sa such as the morris method morris 1991 and the sobol method sobol 1993 is most commonly used in hydrological modeling applications baroni and tarantola 2014 song et al 2015 the morris method was selected in this study since it provides similar results to the sobol method with a reduced computational burden king and perera 2013 rebolho et al 2018 zhang and liu 2021 the morris method estimates the parameter sensitivity by calculating the standardized effect of the same change δ of the input parameter king and perera 2013 the elementary effect ee i is calculated as follows 6 ee i f p 1 p 2 p i 1 p i δ p i 1 p n f p 1 p 2 p n δ where p 1 p 2 p n correspond to n input parameters f p is the objective function δ is a positive or negative change which is a multiple of 1 m 1 m is the number of levels the ee i is computed over k trajectories 7 μ i 1 k j 1 k ee i j 8 σ i 1 k j 1 k ee i j 1 k j 1 k ee i j 2 where μ i and σ i are the mean absolute value and standard deviation of the elementary effects ee i j j 1 2 k respectively μ i estimates the influence of the input parameter p i on the target function f p a larger μ i value implies that the output f p is more sensitive to the parameter p i a larger σ i value indicates that the parameter p i has stronger interactions with other input parameters 2 3 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter is selected since it is applicable to a variety of nonlinear problems and has been successfully used in time invariant parameter estimations for hydrological models abbaszadeh et al 2019 the monte carlo method is used to generate an ensemble of state simulations in the kalman filter to update the state variables and error covariance matrix deng et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 the implementation of the enkf is as follows 1 construct state equations and observation equations based on the selected state and observation variables 2 initialize the state variable ensembles at the first time step by a gaussian distribution 3 initialize the background field in the time step k 1 by the analyzed variables in the time step k the parameters and state variables are then forecasted by perturbing the analyzed variables in the previous time step 4 perturb the observations and calculate the kalman gain matrix the forecasted parameters and state variables at time step k 1 can then be updated into the analysis values 2 4 correlation analysis between time varying parameters and hydro climatic indicators the pearson correlation analysis is used to explore the most influence indicators related to the parameter variations since the linear relation has been proved to be a simple and effective functional type with strong extensibility based on the previous research deng et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the hydro climatic indicators including the precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e relative humidity wet sunshine duration sun temperature t highest temperature tmax lowest temperature tmin wind speed vw and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are mainly considered in this study the pearson correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 to1 the correlation relationship is stronger when r is closer to 1 2 5 model modifications 2 5 1 modifications of the model structure the structure of the base model could be modified for specific catchments under the implications of the identified hydro climatic indicators a conceptual model consists of several modules such as evapotranspiration infiltration runoff generation and routing different modules would be influenced by various factors eq 9 9 module f a b x where module is a structure module in the model and is subjected to the function of catchment factors a b x the conceptualization of the specific module can be reconsidered when the corresponding influence factors are identified in the correlation analysis for example the potential evapotranspiration pet and rainfall p represent the energy demand and water supply respectively which are two limitations in the evapotranspiration process eq 10 the modifications of the evapotranspiration module are possible when the potential evapotranspiration and rainfall are identified as influence factors 10 et f p e t p where et is the actual evapotranspiration 2 5 2 functional forms of time varying parameters the functional forms of time varying parameters are established as the benchmarks several studies have linked parameter variation with covariates that reflect hydro climatic dynamics of a catchment deng et al 2019 merz and bloeschl 2009 yang et al 2009 the linear relationship eq 11 is considered in the study 11 para a x b where x is the influence catchment indicator and para is the identified time varying parameter a and b are the parameters of the functions 2 6 evaluation metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the logarithmic transformed nselog kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the volume error ve and the structural risk minimization srm schoups et al 2008 are used to evaluate model performance the metrics are defined as follows 12 nse 1 i 1 n q si q oi 2 i 1 n q oi q o 2 13 nse log 1 i 1 n l o g q si l o g q o 2 i 1 n l o g q oi l o g q o 2 14 kge 1 r

value of the observed runoff and the logarithmic transformed observed runoff r is the linear correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated runoff σ obs and σ sim are standard deviations of the observed and simulated runoff μ obs and μ sim are means of the observed and simulated runoff n is the length of runoff series and k is the number of parameters nse values range from minus infinity to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance the logarithmic transformed nselog has greater emphasis on low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 zhu et al 2020 kge describes correlation and errors in variability and bias between simulated and observed flow with values closer to 1 indicating better model performance the volume error ve is used to evaluate the bias between the observed and simulated runoff a ve value of 0 indicates no bias in the runoff volume and a positive value means the simulation overestimates the overall runoff the srm is to balance the model complexity and efficiency which has been proved effective to reduce overparameterization the lower srm represents better performance kgesrm is used in the study in summary the simhyd is diagnosed based on the influence factors of time varying parameters the diagnose steps include 1 sensitive parameters are screened out 2 sensitive parameters are identified as time varying parameters 3 the influence factors of time varying parameters are analyzed 4 the model structure is modified based on the implications of influence factors the modified model is then regarded as the new base model and diagnosed repeatedly until the assimilated parameters are relatively stable over time 3 synthetic experiment 3 1 synthetic experiment setups a controlled synthetic experiment was designed to explore the compensatory relationship between the model structure and parameters it is difficult to perfectly simulate hydrological processes in real world basins because the true model and parameters are unknown however a true model and controllable structural errors can be used to discuss the compensatory relationship between the model structure and parameters the steps of the synthetic experiment are illustrated in fig 3 as follows 1 the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship was first generated the simyhd model is driven by the synthetic parameters and the forcing data the simhyd model and synthetic parameters are the true model structure and parameters for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship 2 a model with structural deficiencies simhyd in was then calibrated for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship simhyd in was formed after the deletion of the interception store from simhyd for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship structural errors existed in the simhyd in model 3 the sensitive parameters in simhyd and simhyd in were screened out by the morris method and then identified as time varying parameters by enkf using synthetic runoff respectively the union of most sensitive parameters based on the objective functions nse and ve was selected in the study the temporal variations of assimilated parameters in the two models are compared 3 2 the compensation between structural errors and time varying parameters the controlled synthetic experiment aims to explore the relationship between the temporal variation of parameters and model structural deficiencies the sensitive parameters of simhyd and simhyd in were the same the soil moisture storage capacity smsc and the constant of proportionality in the interflow equation sub fig 4 shows the true values calibrated values and temporal evolutions of the assimilated parameters in simhyd and simhyd in dashed red dashed black solid yellow lines and solid blue lines denote the true parameters calibrated parameters assimilated smsc and assimilated sub respectively both smsc and sub of simhyd were relatively stable and gradually converged to the true values the calibrated parameters deviated from true values when simhyd in was calibrated the assimilated parameters of simhyd in showed significant temporal fluctuations the performance indexes of the model with the true calibrated and assimilated parameters are listed in table 2 the structure and parameters of simhyd were true for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship thus all the model performance indexes using the true calibrated and assimilated parameters produced a perfect simulation in the simhyd model however the different parameter schemes in simhyd in resulted in different model performance when simhyd in using true parameters the nses were close to zero and the ves were 1 in calibration and validation periods the poor performance was understandable because simhyd in had significant structural errors for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship nevertheless the calibrated model performed well with parameters that deviated from true values both in calibration and validation periods when assimilated the nses were closer to 1 in the calibration period the synthetic experiment showed that calibrated parameters could partly compensate for the structure deficiencies which was consistent with the finding of viglione et al 2018 however the parameter s time varying was unavoidable when the structure error was involved the time varying parameters further improved the model performance without reducing structural errors thus model structural deficiencies can be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time varying 4 studied catchments and data two real case studies were used to demonstrate how to diagnose the deficiencies of model structure based on the implications of time varying parameters 4 1 tongtianhe basin the tongtianhe basin fig 5 in qinghai province china covers an area of about 140 000 km2 with an averaging elevation being 5 000 m a s l the mainstream across the basin is approximately 1206 km and drains through the outlet in zhimenda the mean annual precipitation is about 440 mm the total precipitation in may september accounts for approximately 86 of the annual precipitation li et al 2020 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 796 mm the tongtianhe basin lies on the tibet plateau and the solar radiation is intense owing to the thin air the vegetation is sparse in the basin and the area is mainly covered by alpine meadow and grassland the mean annual runoff is approximately 99 mm the meteorological data used in the tongtianhe basin include precipitation relative humidity sunshine duration temperature highest temperature lowest temperature and wind speed from 1 1 1983 until 12 31 2012 the meteorological point data are obtained from five meteorological stations including yushu tuotuohe qulaima wudaoliang and qingshuihe the areal precipitation data is calculated using the thiessen polygon method the potential evapotranspiration is derived by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the daily runoff is from the observation in the zhimenda hydrological station the ndvi is obtained from tucker et al 2005 4 2 xunhe basin the xunhe basin fig 5 in shaanxi province china covers an area of about 6 448 km2 with an averaging elevation ranging from 200 to 3 000 m a s l the mainstream across the basin is approximately 218 km and drains into the hanjiang river through the outlet in xiangjiaping station the mean annual precipitation is about 850 mm the mean annual runoff is approximately 357 mm the meteorological data used in the xunhe basin include precipitation relative humidity sunshine duration temperature highest temperature lowest temperature and wind speed from 1 1 1991 until 12 31 2001 the areal precipitation is calculated based on 28 rainfall stations other meteorological data are obtained from the zheng an meteorological station the areal pan evaporation is from two gauged stations and the daily runoff is from the observation in xiangjiaping hydrological station 5 results and discussion 5 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the setup of the morris method in the study is m 12 k 1000 fig 6 presents the parameter sensitivities of simhyd based on two objective functions nse and ve the sensitive parameters have larger μ whereas the points distributed around the y axis are insensitive parameters the union of most sensitive parameters based on nse and ve was selected the results showed that the soil moisture storage capacity smsc and the constant of proportionality in the interflow equation sub were selected in the tongtianhe basin since they were the most sensitive parameters for nse and ve respectively the soil moisture module is the core part of the model the calculations of evaporation infiltration excess runoff interflow and base flow involve soil moisture smsc thus plays an important role in the entire calculation process sub is the proportionality constant in the equation of saturation excess runoff and interflow saturation excess runoff is an important runoff generation type several studies have also reported that interflow dominantly contributes to storm runoff in headwater basins fan et al 2015 swarowsky et al 2012 the importance of saturation excess runoff and interflow can explain the high sensitivity of sub similarly the infiltration loss exponent sq was selected in the xunhe basin since sq was the most sensitive both for nse and ve 5 2 parameter identification and correlation analysis the simhyd model was calibrated in the studied basins the insensitive parameters were kept constant and sensitive parameters were identified as time varying parameters based on the observed runoff the daily values and multi year mean daily values of sensitive parameters in the tongtianhe and xunhe basins are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively both smsc and sub fluctuated significantly in the tongtianhe basin fig 7 when calculated into the multi year daily mean values the seasonal trends were obvious smsc was found to decrease in march reach the minimum around may and then increase until september sub values also gradually changed between march and september the trend of sub was increased first and then decreased which is the opposite of smsc in the xunhe basin the time varying sq also showed seasonal variations fig 8 the sq was bigger in the summer the pearson correlation analysis between the time varying parameters and hydro climatic indicators is used to explore the most influence indicators in fig 9 the correlation analysis indicated that smsc was strongly related to the potential evapotranspiration r 0 6 in the tongtianhe basin wind speed temperature variables t tmax tmin and ndvi also influenced the variations of smsc r 0 4 the potential evapotranspiration and wind speed were two main factors for sub in the tongtianhe basin r 0 4 in the xunhe basin the precipitation and relative humidity were considered as influence factors for sq r 0 4 the hydro climatic indicators with r 0 4 would be used for the establishment of parameter functional forms and model modifications 5 3 modifications of model structures 5 3 1 tongtianhe basin the tongtianhe basin is located in the source region of the yangtze river and the multi year average temperature is lower than 0 c thus the snowmelt is important in the hydrological cycle of the tongtianhe basin the temperature based and energy based methods are two main alternative methods to simulate snow melting the models used are described in the appendix table 3 shows the model performance of simhyd and simhyd sn simhyd with snow module in the tongtianhe basin fig 10 shows the intra annual variability of parameters in different models the temperature based or energy based simhyd sn behaved better than the simhyd from the aspects of nse nselog kge ve and kgesrm in calibration and validation periods both the parameter variability of the temperature based simhyd sn and energy based simhyd sn decreased in comparison with the simhyd model the inferior performance of smhyd was understandable since simhyd had structural errors in the tongtianhe basin nevertheless the decreased parameter variability in simhyd sn proved that time varying parameters in simhyd were compensating for the incorrect model structure the temperature variables potential evapotranspiration wind speed and ndvi were identified as influence factors based on the correlation analysis between hydro climatic indicators and time varying parameters both the calculation theories of the temperature based and energy based methods have a relation with the temperature since the potential evapotranspiration represents the energy supply and the wind speed influence the convective conductive heat transfer qh in the energy based method simhyd sn was established by adding the energy based method into simhyd the simhyd sn with temperature based method was also implemented as the candidate model for comparison compared with the simhyd sn model using temperature based method the simhyd sn with energy based method significantly enhanced the performance the nselog kge and kgesrm in the validation period changed from 0 75 0 78 0 26 in the temperature based model to 0 82 0 82 0 21 in the energy based model respectively although both the temperature based simhyd sn and energy based simhyd sn reduced the parameter variability in the simhyd model the fluctuations of time varying parameters in the energy based simhyd sn were less obvious fig 10 thus the simhyd sn with energy based method was more advantageous in the tongtianhe basin from aspects of performance metrics and parameter variability another noticeable influence indicator was ndvi the vegetation in the tongtianhe basin is sparse the main cover types are meadow and grassland wang et al 2018 which have weak interception ability van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 thus the simhyd sn was modified into simhyd sn in by removing the interception module tentatively the performance of simhyd sn in was further improved based on simhyd sn table 3 the seasonal variations of smsc and sub were not obvious thus the simhyd sn in with energy based method was recommended in the tongtianhe basin 5 3 2 xunhe basin the time varying sq of the simhyd model in the xunhe basin was identified with seasonality the precipitation and relative humidity were identified as influence factors since the precipitation influenced infiltration directly the infiltration process in simhyd was modified in the xunhe basin the infiltration is subjected to an exponential function of the soil moisture in simhyd the power function of the soil moisture is also commonly used to calculate the infiltration in hydrological models such as the standard hbv model thus the simhyd was modified into simhyd inf by replacing the infiltration with the hbv approach see appendix for model description another modification of simhyd in the xunhe basin was the evapotranspiration module the precipitation after interception module infiltrates into the soil for runoff generation replenishment of soil moisture and evapotranspiration in simhyd in several models such as the gr4j model the precipitation is to satisfy the potential evapotranspiration before infiltrating into the soil described in the appendix thus the simhyd was modified into simhyd e to make the precipitation after interception satisfy the potential evapotranspiration first the simhyd inf behaved better than the simhyd in terms of nse nselog kge ve and kgesrm table 3 although the simhyd had one parameter more than the simhyd inf table a1 the performance of simhyd e in low flow simulations was poor in contrast to the parameter variation in the simhyd the seasonal variability of time variant sq was still obvious in the simhyd e the shape coefficient of the infiltration function β was identified as time varying in simhyd inf the seasonal variability was smaller in simhyd inf fig 10 the compensation between time varying parameters and model structure deficiencies was weaker in simhyd inf thus the simhyd inf was recommended in the xunhe basin by the proposed method to verify the metrics between models were significantly different the ensemble results were obtained in the experiment with different random seeds in the calibration algorithm genetic algorithm fig 11 and fig 12 show evaluation results of ensembles in tongtianhe and xunhe basins respectively the energy based simhyd sn in model outperformed other models significantly in terms of nse nselog kge and kgesrm in the tongtianhe basin p 0 05 while the simhyd inf model was significant based on nse nselog and ve in the xunhe basin 5 4 performance comparison between modifications of model structures and models with linear functional forms of time varying parameters the linear functional forms of time varying parameters were constructed as the benchmark modifications constants a and b in eq 11 were calibrated together with the other model parameters to drive the model in the tongtianhe basin both smsc and sub were predicted by the functional forms of potential evapotranspiration wind speed temperature variables respectively the functional forms were adopted to predict the time varying sq based on hydro climatic indicators including the precipitation and relative humidity in the xunhe basin table 4 shows the performance of simhyd with time varying parameters in functional forms the performance indexes of simhyd with time varying parameters were generally better than simhyd with constant parameters in the studied basins nevertheless structure modifications derived by the proposed method simhyd sn in in the tongtianhe basin and simhyd inf in the xunhe basin could further improve the performance in addition the linear multivariate functions were established in each basin the principal component analysis pca was employed to de correlate the input variables the first three principal components were extracted in the tongtianhe basin which could explain 99 of the original variables including potential evapotranspiration wind speed and temperature variables t tmax tmin two principal components were extracted in the xunhe basin compared with linear univariate functions of time varying parameters the linear multivariate functions could provide better performance in several metrics but fail to improve kgesrm as more complex functions were applied table 4 both linear univariate and multivariate functions did not outperform the model structure selected in the studied basins the results implied that the improvements of the model performance achieved by the linear univariate or multivariate functions of time varying parameters were limited the model structure can be regarded as deficient in hydrological modeling both when a process is particular poorly represented and a major change occurs in catchment conditions westra et al 2014 further explanatory variables could be found for time varying parameters caused by both wrong missing process representation and non stationarity catchment conditions and the model is extended by time varying parameter functions however the relationships between the parameters and explanatory variables were hard to be perfectly represented by functions a proper structure would be more effective to enhance the modeling ability since the structure describes physical processes more clearly 6 conclusions this study aims to diagnose hydrological structural errors and improve model performance through the implication of time varying parameters the simhyd model was applied in daily runoff simulations and the time variations of sensitive parameters were identified by the enkf method a synthetic experiment was designed to demonstrate the compensation relationship between the model structure and parameters two real case studies in the tongtianhe and xunhe basins were conducted to explore the modifications of model structures based on the implications of time varying parameters the following conclusions were drawn 1 the results of a controlled synthetic experiment showed that model structural errors could be diagnosed by testing whether parameters are time varying simhyd in had notable structural errors for the synthetic rainfall runoff relationship the assimilated parameters in simhyd in showed severe fluctuations and improved the prediction the parameters time varying was unavoidable when the structure error was involved 2 the time varying parameters provide guidance for modifications of model structures by identifying the influence indicators in the studied basins in the tongtianhe basin the temperature variables potential evapotranspiration wind speed and ndvi were identified as the influence indicators of the time varying smsc and sub combined with the basin characteristics the addition of the energy based snow module and the deletion of the interception module were implemented for simhyd in the tongtianhe basin similarly the precipitation and relative humidity were identified as the influence indicators of the time varying sq in the xunhe basin the infiltration was modified to be subjected to the power function of the soil moisture the modifications improved model performance and diminished the parameter variations 3 the modifications of the model structure are more effective to enhance runoff simulations than linear univariate or multivariate functional forms of time varying parameters in the studied basins the time varying parameters yielded better performance indexes than the base model the structure modifications which help the model more accurately illustrate the hydrological processes significantly enhanced the model efficiency from the aspects of nse nselog kge ve and kgesrm this study demonstrated that the time varying parameters could provide effective implications for modifications of model structures further

3716,numerous studies have projected that drought will become more severe under changing climatic conditions which will have a profound impact on terrestrial ecosystems around the world while a wide range of drought indices has been extensively applied to assess droughts various issues have been raised such as over or underestimation of drought conditions feature extraction techniques or transformations used to develop the indices in this study a new composite drought index cdi was developed using the integration of potential and actual evapotranspiration climatic water balance and precipitation the proposed cdi was evaluated by comparing it with soil moisture palmer drought severity index pdsi scaled crop yield index scyi evaluation integrated drought index eidi and standardized runoff index sri in china our results demonstrate that together with pdsi cdi performs well in monitoring drought over 2417 grid cells obtained from in situ latitude and longitude it was found that cdi performs better than the pdsi and eidi for reliable soil moisture detection and stable drought monitoring in the study area compared to pdsi cdi shows a more positive correlation with scyi for seasonal maize and wheat cdi has less false alarm ratio in the detection of mild to extreme drought events compared to pdsi keywords composite drought index pdsi spi drought precipitation 1 introduction as a typical extreme event drought is a poorly understood and complex progressive natural hazard that causes substantial damage to the environment society and economy including agricultural output around the world wilhite 2012 guha sapir et al 2004 elhag and zhang 2018 generally the drought is caused by a negative imbalance of water due to excessive evapotranspiration or lack of precipitation for a prolonged period over a region wilhite and glantz 1985 mckee et al 1993 ma et al 2021 scientific evidence provided in the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has confirmed a shift in weather patterns towards the extremes since the 1950s ipcc 2007 although drought cannot be prevented accurate information of its spatiotemporal features is essential to devise contingency plans to mitigate its potential effects it is therefore essential to develop new models or new indices incorporating dominant causative variables for an improved detection and planning of droughts droughts have been widely categorized into four classes such as meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts according to the national centers for environmental information ncei of national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www ncei noaa gov meteorological drought happens when an area remains dry over a long period because of reduced precipitation while hydrological droughts describe reduced water supplies in reservoirs and streams caused by the meteorological drought when crops are affected by these droughts as a result of declined soil moisture agricultural droughts occur finally the socioeconomic drought is related to the supply and demand of multiple commodities due to weather related water shortages over the decades many drought indices have been developed to monitor and quantify droughts one of the earlier indices was the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 which is based on soil moisture evapotranspiration runoff and precipitation another index i e standardized precipitation index spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 has been extensively used to monitor meteorological droughts faiz et al 2021 liu et al 2021 kalisa et al 2020 the spi is a multiscale drought index and can serve at any time scales ranging from 1 to 48 months however the application of spi became limited under global warming conditions because it neglects the effect of temperature on drought to fix this deficiency vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed the standardized evapotranspiration precipitation index spei which considers the interaction of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation the temperature condition index and land surface temperature index were proposed based on near surface temperature to monitor droughts as well du et al 2013 kogan et al 2012 ezzine et al 2014 di̇ki̇ci̇ et al 2020 recently satellite based datasets indices e g the vegetation cover index vci has been also developed to assess droughts caccamo et al 2011 gu et al 2007 park et al 2004 son et al 2012 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2017b faiz et al 2019 di ki ci and aksel 2020 the vci can be used to explicitly represent the role of vegetation conditions in the drought kogan et al 2015 also the soil moisture content index smci was developed to assess agricultural drought by considering the prospective soil moisture sims et al 2002 likewise these indices have a huge variation in time scales with the greatest correlation to the effects of drought depending on their respective soil properties the geology and the climate zone it has been widely reported that the correlations between drought and spei are somewhat greater than spi boschetti et al 2013 wang et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2012 faiz et al 2019 faiz et al 2018 khan et al 2018 khan et al 2017 for rain fed agriculture the best correlations of drought impacts occur with spei at 2 3 month time scales while 9 12 month time scales are needed for irrigated agriculture which is more reliant on soil water storage and irrigation stagge et al 2015 depending on catchment characteristics time scales of drought indices are particularly relevant and crucial lópez moreno et al 2013 stagge et al 2015 for example 1 3 month short and 6 12 month seasonal anomalies of spi and spei refer to the impact of drought on the freshwater ecosystem and water supply stagge et al 2015 khan et al 2017 khan et al 2018 in addition to their different time scales drought indices have other important features for example some indices are focused on agricultural aspects while others are centered on meteorological aspects spei reflect meteorological drought considering precipitation and temperature while vci reveals vegetation conditions without accounting for precipitation and temperature similarly smci primarily reflects the soil moisture related drought without accounting for precipitation or temperature the lagging effect of soil moisture in response to precipitation is very important over space and time shen et al 2019 chen et al 2020 therefore it may be more appropriate to integrate soil moisture data with potential and actual evapotranspiration and precipitation to develop an index for more comprehensive monitoring of drought china is frequently struck by weather related disasters that directly affect agricultural areas and result in enormous decreases in crop yield the mean yield loss due to floods and droughts was up to 1 62 1010 kg yr from 1950 to 2013 in areas of china stricken by agricultural disasters wan et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 currently due to these frequent meteorological disasters and extreme weather events northeast china s average annual area afflicted by agricultural disasters is approximately 6 43 104 km2 with 60 5 of this area impacted by catastrophic droughts the drought impacted regions exceeded 1 16 105 km2 in 2007 making drought the main risk affecting northeast china s agricultural production guo et al 2017 likewise a huge economic loss is reported every year due to agricultural droughts in inner mongolia costing up to 200 million rmb on average in 2011 3 4 million livestock 4 9 million people and 100 million hectares of crops were affected by the drought in southern china liu zhang 2002 reported a severe drought in northern china from 1972 to 1999 which resulted in zero flow for more than 7 months in the yellow river a summary of utilization of drought indices and key findings of the impact of drought over different regions in china is given in table 1 studies in the united states and europe are focused on observations of terrestrial variations when studying the regional applicability of drought indices different drought indices present contradictory abilities in the monitoring of droughts in different regions of the world due to regional physical and environmental differences raising questions about the applicability of the drought index kim et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 issues related to over or underestimation of drought conditions feature extraction techniques or transformations that were used to develop those indices have been discussed shlens 2005 sheffield et al 2012 rajsekhar et al 2015 consequently a simple and easy drought index is necessary which can reflect meteorological and agricultural drought conditions providing a composite hydro agro meteorologic drought indicator by combining the hydro climatic observations with soil moisture data therefore in this study we propose a composite drought index cdi and evaluate it against standardized runoff index sri soil moisture data obtained from climate change initiative cci evaluation integrated drought index eidi and statistical indicators across china the cdi is developed using a combination of actual evapotranspiration meteorological and climatic water balance conditions this research aims to develop a new composite drought index suitable for drought monitoring and assess its performance in assessing the spatial pattern of droughts events across china another objective is to use the cdi to provide a theoretical basis and to establish a baseline framework for monitoring droughts under current climate conditions 2 data sets we used monthly temperatures precipitation humidity wind speed downward short and longwave radiation during 2001 2018 from the climate meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 climate meteorological forcing dataset is an environmental and near surface meteorological variables reanalysis data product for china the cmfd is made through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ station data from more than 700 china meteorological administration stations he et al 2020 cmfd has been widely used for large scale hydrological modelling because of its high accuracy ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2017b the data quality is already tested in previous studies he et al 2020 wu et al 2019 huang et al 2020 we used the actual evapotranspiration data from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 product the pml v2 et product was driven by the gldas 2 1 meteorological forcing and modis leaf area index lai albedo emissivity zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b a wide range of validations using eddy covariance measured data suggested that pml v2 has greatly improved the accuracy in estimated et when compared with the previous models zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b in this study pml actual evapotranspiration pml aet was calculated by summing up the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from vegetation direct evaporation from the soil and transpiration from vegetation to validate the newly developed cdi versus another drought index we used the soil moisture streamflow and crop yield data the soil moisture came from the active and passive combined soil moisture product from the climate change initiative cci sm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 temporal resolution daily at 0 5 to 5 cm layer depth from 2001 to 2018 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 cci sm was tested in southwestern china and showed meaningful accuracy when compared to the gauged data ma et al 2021 therefore we used cci sm data for validation purposes daily streamflow data for three basins 46 gauges for huanghe 18 gauges huabei and 21 gauges for huaihe basin were obtained from the china hydrology yearbooks the daily streamflow data were aggregated to monthly data for each catchment we used regional average data for a specific catchment the annual crop yield data wheat and maize for different provinces were collected from the china statistical yearbooks yearbook 2016 yearbook 2018 3 methods 3 1 composite drought index to develop a composite drought index three indices were integrated including the modified rainfall anomaly index raim the water balance anomaly index wbai which calculates water balance using potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and the moisture index mi based on actual evapotranspiration aet the proposed cdi can be written as a cdi with mi case 1 1 cdi a r a i m b w b a i c p a e t p aet where abc are the coefficients for rai m wbai and p a e t p aet mi according to the meteorological drought grade mdg china gb t 20481 2006 the coefficients a b c are obtained by the dividing of the average value of an index rai m wbai and mi less than 0 5 by the peak negative value of an index rai m wbai and mi during 2001 2018 the purpose of using these coefficients is to obtain a similar drought classification to that given in the mdg the average values abc for each province are presented in table 2 raim wbai and mi are calculated based on extreme dry or wet periods climatic water balance and pml aet data instead of those based on direct input of precipitation and evapotranspiration values the selection of raim and wbai is based on the understanding that these indices used straightforward approaches and that the application of these indices does not require fitting of a probability distribution to the data unlike other indices hänsel et al 2016 hänsel et al 2019 for the average distribution the median water balance and precipitation total are used as proxies while the average of extreme dry and wet cases defines the distribution variability the contribution of indices used in developing cdi was assessed by rwa package https cran r project org web packages rwa readme readme html in the r language environment the contribution of all indices is presented in fig 5f a cdi without mi case 2 cdi can also be computed by neglecting mi using the following equation 2 cdi a r a i m b w b a i where raim and wbai the coefficients a and b are the same to eq 1 raim for the aggregation period can be calculated as 3 ra i m s c a l e f a c t o r r i r e r where r i and r are the total precipitation of any month i and median monthly precipitation of the base period 2001 2018 for the respective month e is the mean of the highest 10 those the 90th percentile and the lowest 10 those the 10th percentile of extreme precipitation totals for the baseline period for positive anomalies of r i r the events 90th percentile are used along with negative anomalies 10th percentile the scale factor is negative for r i r and positive for wbai was calculated by using the same technique as raim and replacing the precipitation values with water balance here climatic water balance was calculated similarly to spei 4 wbai s c a l e f a c t o r w i w e w where w i and w are the climatic water balance total of any month i and the median monthly water balance of the base period 2001 2018 for the respective month e is the mean of the highest 10 those the 90th percentile and 10 lowest those the 10th percentile of the extreme water balance for the baseline period for positive anomalies of w i w the events greater than the 90th percentile are used and those less than the 10th percentile are used for negative anomalies the scale factor is negative for w i w and positive for w i w in both eqs 3 and 4 the scaling factor was derived by the test of the comparability of the distribution of the spi and the raim hänsel et al 2016 hänsel et al 2019 for both indices the value of the scaling factor is 1 7 this scale factor could be used to standardize indices to make different indices comparable any other scaling factor can also be used as the name says this factor just scales the results for comparison purposes with other different indices as in our case in this study raim was calculated at a one month time scale while wbai was calculated at a 3 month time scale since different time scales reflect different types of drought stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 hänsel et al 2019 for example the shorter time scales refer to agricultural water supplies while longer time scales are used for reservoir storage and stream flows furthermore cross wavelet transform is used in this study to assess the relationship between spi 1 vs raim 1 and spei 3 vs wbai 3 in the time frequency domain cross wavelet transform is an effective method to find the association between two time series grinsted et al 2004 li et al 2020 for more information please refer to the supplementary results section 3 2 validation indices smci scyi and eidi crop yield resistance and tolerance to water shortage are vital indicators for drought monitoring therefore we used the soil moisture to assess the ability of cdi since it is a significant drought related variable that needs to address any drought index validation the indices used to develop cdi have different kinds of variables precipitation only or climatic water balance using temperature and precipitation hence an aggregated index is needed to evaluate the performance of cdi therefore the proposed cdi is validated against the scaled crop yield index scyi eidi and smci cdi has been defined in table 3 the smci can be calculated as follows sánchez et al 2016 5 smc i x y z m max m x y z m max m min smc i x y z is the soil moisture at x pixel y month of z year from the cci sm data while m max and m min are the absolute values of the selected period 2001 2018 of smci at x pixel the scyi can be calculated as follows shen et al 2019 6 scy i x y y x y min y x max y x min y i where y x y is the yield of x type crop during y year while max y x and min y x are the maximum and minimum values respectively of crop yield for the period 2001 2018 of x crop the evaluation integrated drought index eidi was also developed based on dry days to analyze the dryness and wetness pattern in the study area and to make the comparison with cdi eidi can be written as eidi s t a n d a r d i z e d o f m e a n s n u m b e r o f d r y d a y s a v e r a g e d u r a t i o n o f d r y p e r i o d s c o n s e c u t i v e d r y d a y s s t a n d a r d i z e d number o f l o w p r e c i p i t a t i o n d a y s s p i 7 where the number of dry days is when the daily precipitation is less than 1 mm the average duration of dry days constant order of dry days when daily precipitation is less than 1 mm consecutive dry days are maximum duration of dr y periods when precipitation less than 1 mm and the number of low precipitation days is days with daily precipitation only less than 5 mm based on indices classifications maximum drought is indicated by very low negative values of cdi and other indices raim wbai and mi while maximum yield is indicated by very high positive values 3 3 statistical analysis we carried out pearson correlation analysis to find the correlation between cdi and different indices like sri shukla and wood 2008 and pdsi additionally two statistical matrices given by false alarm ratio far and probability of detection pod are also used to detect mild to extreme events between sri cdi and sri pdsi pod and far can be calculated as 8 pod e a e a e c f a r e b e a e b where e a is the number of mild to extreme events detections that match to event hits observations e b is the number of event detections that do not match to observed events and is the number of no event detections matching to observed events 4 results 4 1 comparing cdi with pdsi and eidi in the drought months to examine the performance of cdi the wetting and drying patterns were calculated for cdi pdsi and eidi for drought months reported by different studies in 2006 and 2010 to 2011 based on the index specific classifications barriopedro et al 2012 sun and yang 2012 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b figs 2 4 show wetness and dryness patterns drought conditions in july august 2006 and april 2010 to september 2011 indices reflect similar wetness and dryness pattern during the selected period but in some cases cdi has superiority compared to pdsi and eidi for example in august 2006 cdi captured droughts in anhui hubei guizhou chongqing sichuan zhejiang provinces which comes with a huge loss more than 1 1 billion was also reported in many studies but pdsi missed hubei province on the other hand cdi and pdsi show severe drought while eidi captured mild drought in the same region fig 2 likewise for 2010 to 2011 cdi and pdsi captured winter drought in most of china northern and southwest china but eidi captured more wetting patterns than dryness figs 3 and 4 pdsi is very sensitive to temperature variations and may overestimate the drought conditions sheffield et al 2012 shen et al 2019 whichmay explain different drought events captured by the pdsi when compared with cdi the results are consistent with previous studies that reported better performance of multi scale indices than pdsi peña gallardo et al 2019b mavromatis 2007 sun et al 2012 in the case of eidi performance to capture different drought events compared to cdi eidi is integrated based on dry days and spi which are purely obtained from precipitation dataset and inclusion of mi in cdi which is based on actual evapotranspiration and classification of cdi with regional coefficients may be the reason to capture higher drought events 4 2 validation against soil moisture data soil moisture has a direct impact on agricultural production and crop growth and soil moisture is thus a critical factor in assessing agricultural drought conditions additionally monitoring the soil moisture deficit is the primary way to monitor agricultural drought in this study data from cci sm was extracted which represents soil moisture conditions from the top 0 5 to 5 cm soil layer fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between cci sm and three drought indices including cdi with mi case1 and cdi without mi case 2 pdsi and eidi in both cases such as cdi with mi and cdi without mi had a much less negative correlation compared to pdsi and eidi in more than 50 of pixels the correlation coefficient is 0 68 0 672 and 0 61 for the correlations between cci sm and cdi with mi pdsi and iedi respectively likewise the correlation coefficient is 0 611 between cci sm and cdi without mi besides the positive correlation of 0 2 for the cdis with mi and without mi vs cci sm covers more than 85 of pixels while for the pdsi vs cci sm and iedi vs cci sm correlation of 0 2 only covers about 60 40 of pixels we also calculate the difference between cdi s case 1 and case 2 and found that cdi has a significant correction 0 5 in the southwest and central south of china figs 1 and 5 eidi shows the maximum number of grid points that had a negative correlation with cci sm mostly were concentrated in southern china north china plain and northeastern china pdsi displayed a negative correlation in certain regions in northern china the above validation results suggest that cdis with mi or without mi have a better capability to capture soil moisture variability compared to pdsi and eidi the lower correlation of the indices may illustrate the effect of time scales when calculating the drought conditions in the study area 4 3 validation against scaled crop yield index and sri major cereal crops wheat and maize are grown in most parts of china northeast provinces are primarily known for their maize crop likewise east south central henan province and northeast xinjiang province are famous for wheat production therefore cdi was evaluated to examine its performance for these two crops based on the availability of crop yield data from the national bureau of statistics fig 6a b cdi had a significant positive correlation for maize crop and wheat crop yields in most of the growing months cdi also showed a negative correlation with both scaled crop yields fig 6a pdsi depicted a similar pattern of correlation with maize and wheat crop yields fig 6b both cdi and pdsi exhibit similar negative correlation patterns in different months but the values of positive correlation of cdi are higher than pdsi suggesting that it is more effective in detecting drought impacts on grain yield figs 7 and 8 show the correlation between cdi and sri between pdsi and sri and their statistical matrix false alarm ratio and probability of detection based on mild to extreme events the cdi has a positive coefficient with sri in the three selected catchments huabei huanghe and huaihe only the streamflow data was available for these catchments the maximum correlation was 0 87 huabei for july while the minimum was found in august huanghe on the other hand pdsi showed negative correlation non significant with sri in the huabei and huanghe catchments moreover detection of drought events by cdi was maximum with less false alarm ratio far in huabei and huaihe catchments a similar scenario was presented by pdsi but the probability of detection was less than cdi in two catchments fig 8 5 discussion we used different indices at multiple scales to develop a comprehensive drought index that was able to capture drought in different environments the composite drought index cdi which is based on climatic water balance given by potential and actual evapotranspirations and precipitation well captured drought months in different provinces the results compared well with earlier studies barriopedro et al 2012 liu et al 2017 sun and yang 2012 fig 3 likewise cdi has also reflected satisfactory soil moisture conditions during the 2001 to 2018 period fig 5 we found that cdi was able to capture drought impacts on grain yield in the region cdi did not however yield higher correlations with sri than those by pdsi with sri although its correlation with streamflow drought was reasonable the probability of detection rates of mild to extreme streamflow drought events is higher than the false alarm rate in two catchments our results revealed that a combination of different time scales and use of the highest 10 the 90th percentile and 10 lowest the 10th percentile of the extreme water balance is useful for capturing drought conditions this is valuable for monitoring soil moisture conditions and agricultural planning moreover the performance of cdi for soil moisture streamflow grain yield data showed the value of incorporating actual evapotranspiration along with other water balance parameters and a combination of different time scales in a composite index the uncertainties due to shortcomings in the method and effects of environmental disruption are unavoidable in the results faiz et al 2020 yin et al 2013 for example the use of scale factors to get comparability of wetness and dryness distributions although different scale factors are tested to get a suitable scale factor for these distributions in raim and wbai still further improvements are needed to simplify these procedures furthermore selection of stations and data quality may also impact the results therefore results of cdi should also be tested using data from other regions with different hydroclimatic environments although a weak correlation between cdi and scyi was found better quality crop yield data may be able to produce a better correlation global surface temperature and variations in precipitation may lead to different dryness behavior in different parts of the world dai et al 1998 ipcc 2007 most parts of china are prone to drought including the eastern region of northeast southeast and southwest regions for example the songnen and sanjiang plains in northeast china have experienced the most severe drought conditions guo et al 2017 gao et al 2018 faiz et al 2020 shao et al 2018 with a decreasing precipitation trend wang et al 2005 severe drought also hit inner mongolia in the first three months of the growing season while liaoning endured extreme drought events throughout the season shen et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider the variables for a robust drought indicator that can recognize the drought at different useable water sources guttman 1999 vicente serrano et al 2010 to develop cdi wbai 3 is used since climatic water balance is sensitive to soil moisture conditions santos et al 2010 shen et al 2019 as the temperature directly impacts evapotranspiration it could have a greater impact on land surface water balance in restricted water resource areas sheffield and wood 2008 syed et al 2008 the mechanisms of temperature and evapotranspiration and its effects on drought are more complex and the effect of evapotranspiration on usable water resources is not yet well understandable vicente serrano et al 2010 the pdsi has been widely used to monitor agricultural drought and for performance evaluation with different drought indices in different regions of the world trenberth et al 2014 jiménez muñoz et al 2016 shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 consequently we also employed pdsi for evaluation purposes and found that pdsi and eidi show a different pattern in the same period of dryness over the area it is however noted that pdsi is very sensitive to temperature variations and may overestimate the drought conditions sheffield et al 2012 shen et al 2019 during analysis the better performance of pdsi was expected however pdsi showed a weaker performance compared to cdi these results are consistent with previous studies by liu et al 2018 and peña gallardo et al 2019a peña gallardo et al 2019b used spi pdsi spei and z index and documented that the z index is best for identifying the crop stress compared to other indices used in his analysis moreover numerous prior studies also used pdsi while associating their results with multiscale indices to find that multi scale indices performance was better compared to the pdsi mavromatis 2007 sun et al 2012 liu et al 2018 used pdsi spei and spi in northern china plain to monitor agricultural drought conditions and documented that pdsi is not usual for monitoring the agricultural drought conditions therefore the cdi was developed to evaluate and analyze the drought events in this study soil moisture is an important variable that directly relates to drought tang and piechota 2009 soil moisture plays an important role in groundwater storage and runoff process as well as in the land and atmospheric interactions as a result greater soil moisture during vegetation growth may contribute to more evapotranspiration conversely a lesser amount of soil moisture results in smaller runoff and more infiltration therefore soil moisture plays an important role in crop characteristics and their response to dryness contreras and hunink 2015 this justifies the integration of soil moisture data to improve the cdi for agricultural drought monitoring 6 conclusions a composite drought index was proposed that combines the climatic drought index raim 1 accounting for the precipitation wbai 3 accounting for water balance and mi moisture index based on actual evapotranspiration and precipitation compared to other indices used in this study cdi has a better representation of the features related to the interaction between potential evapotranspiration water balance precipitation and soil moisture thereby improving its ability to detect agricultural and climatic drought conditions moreover cdi showed a positive correlation with soil moisture data at 0 5 to 5 cm soil layers in several catchments in china this suggests that the cdi could be used to assess agricultural as well as climatic drought conditions extreme events captured by cdi and its comparison with previous studies revealed cdi s strength in the detection of drought conditions validation of cdi with sri showed that cdi captured the hydrological drought as good as other indices pdsi in the study area cdi has a better correlation with a scaled yield crop index in most cases compared with pdsi more studies on the relationship between changes in atmospheric circulation and drought trends along with the application of econometric models could contribute to explaining losses and impacts from drought on agriculture 7 glossary ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change

3716,numerous studies have projected that drought will become more severe under changing climatic conditions which will have a profound impact on terrestrial ecosystems around the world while a wide range of drought indices has been extensively applied to assess droughts various issues have been raised such as over or underestimation of drought conditions feature extraction techniques or transformations used to develop the indices in this study a new composite drought index cdi was developed using the integration of potential and actual evapotranspiration climatic water balance and precipitation the proposed cdi was evaluated by comparing it with soil moisture palmer drought severity index pdsi scaled crop yield index scyi evaluation integrated drought index eidi and standardized runoff index sri in china our results demonstrate that together with pdsi cdi performs well in monitoring drought over 2417 grid cells obtained from in situ latitude and longitude it was found that cdi performs better than the pdsi and eidi for reliable soil moisture detection and stable drought monitoring in the study area compared to pdsi cdi shows a more positive correlation with scyi for seasonal maize and wheat cdi has less false alarm ratio in the detection of mild to extreme drought events compared to pdsi keywords composite drought index pdsi spi drought precipitation 1 introduction as a typical extreme event drought is a poorly understood and complex progressive natural hazard that causes substantial damage to the environment society and economy including agricultural output around the world wilhite 2012 guha sapir et al 2004 elhag and zhang 2018 generally the drought is caused by a negative imbalance of water due to excessive evapotranspiration or lack of precipitation for a prolonged period over a region wilhite and glantz 1985 mckee et al 1993 ma et al 2021 scientific evidence provided in the fifth report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has confirmed a shift in weather patterns towards the extremes since the 1950s ipcc 2007 although drought cannot be prevented accurate information of its spatiotemporal features is essential to devise contingency plans to mitigate its potential effects it is therefore essential to develop new models or new indices incorporating dominant causative variables for an improved detection and planning of droughts droughts have been widely categorized into four classes such as meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts according to the national centers for environmental information ncei of national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www ncei noaa gov meteorological drought happens when an area remains dry over a long period because of reduced precipitation while hydrological droughts describe reduced water supplies in reservoirs and streams caused by the meteorological drought when crops are affected by these droughts as a result of declined soil moisture agricultural droughts occur finally the socioeconomic drought is related to the supply and demand of multiple commodities due to weather related water shortages over the decades many drought indices have been developed to monitor and quantify droughts one of the earlier indices was the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 which is based on soil moisture evapotranspiration runoff and precipitation another index i e standardized precipitation index spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 has been extensively used to monitor meteorological droughts faiz et al 2021 liu et al 2021 kalisa et al 2020 the spi is a multiscale drought index and can serve at any time scales ranging from 1 to 48 months however the application of spi became limited under global warming conditions because it neglects the effect of temperature on drought to fix this deficiency vicente serrano et al 2010 proposed the standardized evapotranspiration precipitation index spei which considers the interaction of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation the temperature condition index and land surface temperature index were proposed based on near surface temperature to monitor droughts as well du et al 2013 kogan et al 2012 ezzine et al 2014 di̇ki̇ci̇ et al 2020 recently satellite based datasets indices e g the vegetation cover index vci has been also developed to assess droughts caccamo et al 2011 gu et al 2007 park et al 2004 son et al 2012 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2017b faiz et al 2019 di ki ci and aksel 2020 the vci can be used to explicitly represent the role of vegetation conditions in the drought kogan et al 2015 also the soil moisture content index smci was developed to assess agricultural drought by considering the prospective soil moisture sims et al 2002 likewise these indices have a huge variation in time scales with the greatest correlation to the effects of drought depending on their respective soil properties the geology and the climate zone it has been widely reported that the correlations between drought and spei are somewhat greater than spi boschetti et al 2013 wang et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2012 faiz et al 2019 faiz et al 2018 khan et al 2018 khan et al 2017 for rain fed agriculture the best correlations of drought impacts occur with spei at 2 3 month time scales while 9 12 month time scales are needed for irrigated agriculture which is more reliant on soil water storage and irrigation stagge et al 2015 depending on catchment characteristics time scales of drought indices are particularly relevant and crucial lópez moreno et al 2013 stagge et al 2015 for example 1 3 month short and 6 12 month seasonal anomalies of spi and spei refer to the impact of drought on the freshwater ecosystem and water supply stagge et al 2015 khan et al 2017 khan et al 2018 in addition to their different time scales drought indices have other important features for example some indices are focused on agricultural aspects while others are centered on meteorological aspects spei reflect meteorological drought considering precipitation and temperature while vci reveals vegetation conditions without accounting for precipitation and temperature similarly smci primarily reflects the soil moisture related drought without accounting for precipitation or temperature the lagging effect of soil moisture in response to precipitation is very important over space and time shen et al 2019 chen et al 2020 therefore it may be more appropriate to integrate soil moisture data with potential and actual evapotranspiration and precipitation to develop an index for more comprehensive monitoring of drought china is frequently struck by weather related disasters that directly affect agricultural areas and result in enormous decreases in crop yield the mean yield loss due to floods and droughts was up to 1 62 1010 kg yr from 1950 to 2013 in areas of china stricken by agricultural disasters wan et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 currently due to these frequent meteorological disasters and extreme weather events northeast china s average annual area afflicted by agricultural disasters is approximately 6 43 104 km2 with 60 5 of this area impacted by catastrophic droughts the drought impacted regions exceeded 1 16 105 km2 in 2007 making drought the main risk affecting northeast china s agricultural production guo et al 2017 likewise a huge economic loss is reported every year due to agricultural droughts in inner mongolia costing up to 200 million rmb on average in 2011 3 4 million livestock 4 9 million people and 100 million hectares of crops were affected by the drought in southern china liu zhang 2002 reported a severe drought in northern china from 1972 to 1999 which resulted in zero flow for more than 7 months in the yellow river a summary of utilization of drought indices and key findings of the impact of drought over different regions in china is given in table 1 studies in the united states and europe are focused on observations of terrestrial variations when studying the regional applicability of drought indices different drought indices present contradictory abilities in the monitoring of droughts in different regions of the world due to regional physical and environmental differences raising questions about the applicability of the drought index kim et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 issues related to over or underestimation of drought conditions feature extraction techniques or transformations that were used to develop those indices have been discussed shlens 2005 sheffield et al 2012 rajsekhar et al 2015 consequently a simple and easy drought index is necessary which can reflect meteorological and agricultural drought conditions providing a composite hydro agro meteorologic drought indicator by combining the hydro climatic observations with soil moisture data therefore in this study we propose a composite drought index cdi and evaluate it against standardized runoff index sri soil moisture data obtained from climate change initiative cci evaluation integrated drought index eidi and statistical indicators across china the cdi is developed using a combination of actual evapotranspiration meteorological and climatic water balance conditions this research aims to develop a new composite drought index suitable for drought monitoring and assess its performance in assessing the spatial pattern of droughts events across china another objective is to use the cdi to provide a theoretical basis and to establish a baseline framework for monitoring droughts under current climate conditions 2 data sets we used monthly temperatures precipitation humidity wind speed downward short and longwave radiation during 2001 2018 from the climate meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 climate meteorological forcing dataset is an environmental and near surface meteorological variables reanalysis data product for china the cmfd is made through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ station data from more than 700 china meteorological administration stations he et al 2020 cmfd has been widely used for large scale hydrological modelling because of its high accuracy ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2017b the data quality is already tested in previous studies he et al 2020 wu et al 2019 huang et al 2020 we used the actual evapotranspiration data from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 product the pml v2 et product was driven by the gldas 2 1 meteorological forcing and modis leaf area index lai albedo emissivity zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b a wide range of validations using eddy covariance measured data suggested that pml v2 has greatly improved the accuracy in estimated et when compared with the previous models zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b in this study pml actual evapotranspiration pml aet was calculated by summing up the evaporation of intercepted rainfall from vegetation direct evaporation from the soil and transpiration from vegetation to validate the newly developed cdi versus another drought index we used the soil moisture streamflow and crop yield data the soil moisture came from the active and passive combined soil moisture product from the climate change initiative cci sm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 temporal resolution daily at 0 5 to 5 cm layer depth from 2001 to 2018 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 cci sm was tested in southwestern china and showed meaningful accuracy when compared to the gauged data ma et al 2021 therefore we used cci sm data for validation purposes daily streamflow data for three basins 46 gauges for huanghe 18 gauges huabei and 21 gauges for huaihe basin were obtained from the china hydrology yearbooks the daily streamflow data were aggregated to monthly data for each catchment we used regional average data for a specific catchment the annual crop yield data wheat and maize for different provinces were collected from the china statistical yearbooks yearbook 2016 yearbook 2018 3 methods 3 1 composite drought index to develop a composite drought index three indices were integrated including the modified rainfall anomaly index raim the water balance anomaly index wbai which calculates water balance using potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and the moisture index mi based on actual evapotranspiration aet the proposed cdi can be written as a cdi with mi case 1 1 cdi a r a i m b w b a i c p a e t p aet where abc are the coefficients for rai m wbai and p a e t p aet mi according to the meteorological drought grade mdg china gb t 20481 2006 the coefficients a b c are obtained by the dividing of the average value of an index rai m wbai and mi less than 0 5 by the peak negative value of an index rai m wbai and mi during 2001 2018 the purpose of using these coefficients is to obtain a similar drought classification to that given in the mdg the average values abc for each province are presented in table 2 raim wbai and mi are calculated based on extreme dry or wet periods climatic water balance and pml aet data instead of those based on direct input of precipitation and evapotranspiration values the selection of raim and wbai is based on the understanding that these indices used straightforward approaches and that the application of these indices does not require fitting of a probability distribution to the data unlike other indices hänsel et al 2016 hänsel et al 2019 for the average distribution the median water balance and precipitation total are used as proxies while the average of extreme dry and wet cases defines the distribution variability the contribution of indices used in developing cdi was assessed by rwa package https cran r project org web packages rwa readme readme html in the r language environment the contribution of all indices is presented in fig 5f a cdi without mi case 2 cdi can also be computed by neglecting mi using the following equation 2 cdi a r a i m b w b a i where raim and wbai the coefficients a and b are the same to eq 1 raim for the aggregation period can be calculated as 3 ra i m s c a l e f a c t o r r i r e r where r i and r are the total precipitation of any month i and median monthly precipitation of the base period 2001 2018 for the respective month e is the mean of the highest 10 those the 90th percentile and the lowest 10 those the 10th percentile of extreme precipitation totals for the baseline period for positive anomalies of r i r the events 90th percentile are used along with negative anomalies 10th percentile the scale factor is negative for r i r and positive for wbai was calculated by using the same technique as raim and replacing the precipitation values with water balance here climatic water balance was calculated similarly to spei 4 wbai s c a l e f a c t o r w i w e w where w i and w are the climatic water balance total of any month i and the median monthly water balance of the base period 2001 2018 for the respective month e is the mean of the highest 10 those the 90th percentile and 10 lowest those the 10th percentile of the extreme water balance for the baseline period for positive anomalies of w i w the events greater than the 90th percentile are used and those less than the 10th percentile are used for negative anomalies the scale factor is negative for w i w and positive for w i w in both eqs 3 and 4 the scaling factor was derived by the test of the comparability of the distribution of the spi and the raim hänsel et al 2016 hänsel et al 2019 for both indices the value of the scaling factor is 1 7 this scale factor could be used to standardize indices to make different indices comparable any other scaling factor can also be used as the name says this factor just scales the results for comparison purposes with other different indices as in our case in this study raim was calculated at a one month time scale while wbai was calculated at a 3 month time scale since different time scales reflect different types of drought stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 hänsel et al 2019 for example the shorter time scales refer to agricultural water supplies while longer time scales are used for reservoir storage and stream flows furthermore cross wavelet transform is used in this study to assess the relationship between spi 1 vs raim 1 and spei 3 vs wbai 3 in the time frequency domain cross wavelet transform is an effective method to find the association between two time series grinsted et al 2004 li et al 2020 for more information please refer to the supplementary results section 3 2 validation indices smci scyi and eidi crop yield resistance and tolerance to water shortage are vital indicators for drought monitoring therefore we used the soil moisture to assess the ability of cdi since it is a significant drought related variable that needs to address any drought index validation the indices used to develop cdi have different kinds of variables precipitation only or climatic water balance using temperature and precipitation hence an aggregated index is needed to evaluate the performance of cdi therefore the proposed cdi is validated against the scaled crop yield index scyi eidi and smci cdi has been defined in table 3 the smci can be calculated as follows sánchez et al 2016 5 smc i x y z m max m x y z m max m min smc i x y z is the soil moisture at x pixel y month of z year from the cci sm data while m max and m min are the absolute values of the selected period 2001 2018 of smci at x pixel the scyi can be calculated as follows shen et al 2019 6 scy i x y y x y min y x max y x min y i where y x y is the yield of x type crop during y year while max y x and min y x are the maximum and minimum values respectively of crop yield for the period 2001 2018 of x crop the evaluation integrated drought index eidi was also developed based on dry days to analyze the dryness and wetness pattern in the study area and to make the comparison with cdi eidi can be written as eidi s t a n d a r d i z e d o f m e a n s n u m b e r o f d r y d a y s a v e r a g e d u r a t i o n o f d r y p e r i o d s c o n s e c u t i v e d r y d a y s s t a n d a r d i z e d number o f l o w p r e c i p i t a t i o n d a y s s p i 7 where the number of dry days is when the daily precipitation is less than 1 mm the average duration of dry days constant order of dry days when daily precipitation is less than 1 mm consecutive dry days are maximum duration of dr y periods when precipitation less than 1 mm and the number of low precipitation days is days with daily precipitation only less than 5 mm based on indices classifications maximum drought is indicated by very low negative values of cdi and other indices raim wbai and mi while maximum yield is indicated by very high positive values 3 3 statistical analysis we carried out pearson correlation analysis to find the correlation between cdi and different indices like sri shukla and wood 2008 and pdsi additionally two statistical matrices given by false alarm ratio far and probability of detection pod are also used to detect mild to extreme events between sri cdi and sri pdsi pod and far can be calculated as 8 pod e a e a e c f a r e b e a e b where e a is the number of mild to extreme events detections that match to event hits observations e b is the number of event detections that do not match to observed events and is the number of no event detections matching to observed events 4 results 4 1 comparing cdi with pdsi and eidi in the drought months to examine the performance of cdi the wetting and drying patterns were calculated for cdi pdsi and eidi for drought months reported by different studies in 2006 and 2010 to 2011 based on the index specific classifications barriopedro et al 2012 sun and yang 2012 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b figs 2 4 show wetness and dryness patterns drought conditions in july august 2006 and april 2010 to september 2011 indices reflect similar wetness and dryness pattern during the selected period but in some cases cdi has superiority compared to pdsi and eidi for example in august 2006 cdi captured droughts in anhui hubei guizhou chongqing sichuan zhejiang provinces which comes with a huge loss more than 1 1 billion was also reported in many studies but pdsi missed hubei province on the other hand cdi and pdsi show severe drought while eidi captured mild drought in the same region fig 2 likewise for 2010 to 2011 cdi and pdsi captured winter drought in most of china northern and southwest china but eidi captured more wetting patterns than dryness figs 3 and 4 pdsi is very sensitive to temperature variations and may overestimate the drought conditions sheffield et al 2012 shen et al 2019 whichmay explain different drought events captured by the pdsi when compared with cdi the results are consistent with previous studies that reported better performance of multi scale indices than pdsi peña gallardo et al 2019b mavromatis 2007 sun et al 2012 in the case of eidi performance to capture different drought events compared to cdi eidi is integrated based on dry days and spi which are purely obtained from precipitation dataset and inclusion of mi in cdi which is based on actual evapotranspiration and classification of cdi with regional coefficients may be the reason to capture higher drought events 4 2 validation against soil moisture data soil moisture has a direct impact on agricultural production and crop growth and soil moisture is thus a critical factor in assessing agricultural drought conditions additionally monitoring the soil moisture deficit is the primary way to monitor agricultural drought in this study data from cci sm was extracted which represents soil moisture conditions from the top 0 5 to 5 cm soil layer fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between cci sm and three drought indices including cdi with mi case1 and cdi without mi case 2 pdsi and eidi in both cases such as cdi with mi and cdi without mi had a much less negative correlation compared to pdsi and eidi in more than 50 of pixels the correlation coefficient is 0 68 0 672 and 0 61 for the correlations between cci sm and cdi with mi pdsi and iedi respectively likewise the correlation coefficient is 0 611 between cci sm and cdi without mi besides the positive correlation of 0 2 for the cdis with mi and without mi vs cci sm covers more than 85 of pixels while for the pdsi vs cci sm and iedi vs cci sm correlation of 0 2 only covers about 60 40 of pixels we also calculate the difference between cdi s case 1 and case 2 and found that cdi has a significant correction 0 5 in the southwest and central south of china figs 1 and 5 eidi shows the maximum number of grid points that had a negative correlation with cci sm mostly were concentrated in southern china north china plain and northeastern china pdsi displayed a negative correlation in certain regions in northern china the above validation results suggest that cdis with mi or without mi have a better capability to capture soil moisture variability compared to pdsi and eidi the lower correlation of the indices may illustrate the effect of time scales when calculating the drought conditions in the study area 4 3 validation against scaled crop yield index and sri major cereal crops wheat and maize are grown in most parts of china northeast provinces are primarily known for their maize crop likewise east south central henan province and northeast xinjiang province are famous for wheat production therefore cdi was evaluated to examine its performance for these two crops based on the availability of crop yield data from the national bureau of statistics fig 6a b cdi had a significant positive correlation for maize crop and wheat crop yields in most of the growing months cdi also showed a negative correlation with both scaled crop yields fig 6a pdsi depicted a similar pattern of correlation with maize and wheat crop yields fig 6b both cdi and pdsi exhibit similar negative correlation patterns in different months but the values of positive correlation of cdi are higher than pdsi suggesting that it is more effective in detecting drought impacts on grain yield figs 7 and 8 show the correlation between cdi and sri between pdsi and sri and their statistical matrix false alarm ratio and probability of detection based on mild to extreme events the cdi has a positive coefficient with sri in the three selected catchments huabei huanghe and huaihe only the streamflow data was available for these catchments the maximum correlation was 0 87 huabei for july while the minimum was found in august huanghe on the other hand pdsi showed negative correlation non significant with sri in the huabei and huanghe catchments moreover detection of drought events by cdi was maximum with less false alarm ratio far in huabei and huaihe catchments a similar scenario was presented by pdsi but the probability of detection was less than cdi in two catchments fig 8 5 discussion we used different indices at multiple scales to develop a comprehensive drought index that was able to capture drought in different environments the composite drought index cdi which is based on climatic water balance given by potential and actual evapotranspirations and precipitation well captured drought months in different provinces the results compared well with earlier studies barriopedro et al 2012 liu et al 2017 sun and yang 2012 fig 3 likewise cdi has also reflected satisfactory soil moisture conditions during the 2001 to 2018 period fig 5 we found that cdi was able to capture drought impacts on grain yield in the region cdi did not however yield higher correlations with sri than those by pdsi with sri although its correlation with streamflow drought was reasonable the probability of detection rates of mild to extreme streamflow drought events is higher than the false alarm rate in two catchments our results revealed that a combination of different time scales and use of the highest 10 the 90th percentile and 10 lowest the 10th percentile of the extreme water balance is useful for capturing drought conditions this is valuable for monitoring soil moisture conditions and agricultural planning moreover the performance of cdi for soil moisture streamflow grain yield data showed the value of incorporating actual evapotranspiration along with other water balance parameters and a combination of different time scales in a composite index the uncertainties due to shortcomings in the method and effects of environmental disruption are unavoidable in the results faiz et al 2020 yin et al 2013 for example the use of scale factors to get comparability of wetness and dryness distributions although different scale factors are tested to get a suitable scale factor for these distributions in raim and wbai still further improvements are needed to simplify these procedures furthermore selection of stations and data quality may also impact the results therefore results of cdi should also be tested using data from other regions with different hydroclimatic environments although a weak correlation between cdi and scyi was found better quality crop yield data may be able to produce a better correlation global surface temperature and variations in precipitation may lead to different dryness behavior in different parts of the world dai et al 1998 ipcc 2007 most parts of china are prone to drought including the eastern region of northeast southeast and southwest regions for example the songnen and sanjiang plains in northeast china have experienced the most severe drought conditions guo et al 2017 gao et al 2018 faiz et al 2020 shao et al 2018 with a decreasing precipitation trend wang et al 2005 severe drought also hit inner mongolia in the first three months of the growing season while liaoning endured extreme drought events throughout the season shen et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider the variables for a robust drought indicator that can recognize the drought at different useable water sources guttman 1999 vicente serrano et al 2010 to develop cdi wbai 3 is used since climatic water balance is sensitive to soil moisture conditions santos et al 2010 shen et al 2019 as the temperature directly impacts evapotranspiration it could have a greater impact on land surface water balance in restricted water resource areas sheffield and wood 2008 syed et al 2008 the mechanisms of temperature and evapotranspiration and its effects on drought are more complex and the effect of evapotranspiration on usable water resources is not yet well understandable vicente serrano et al 2010 the pdsi has been widely used to monitor agricultural drought and for performance evaluation with different drought indices in different regions of the world trenberth et al 2014 jiménez muñoz et al 2016 shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 consequently we also employed pdsi for evaluation purposes and found that pdsi and eidi show a different pattern in the same period of dryness over the area it is however noted that pdsi is very sensitive to temperature variations and may overestimate the drought conditions sheffield et al 2012 shen et al 2019 during analysis the better performance of pdsi was expected however pdsi showed a weaker performance compared to cdi these results are consistent with previous studies by liu et al 2018 and peña gallardo et al 2019a peña gallardo et al 2019b used spi pdsi spei and z index and documented that the z index is best for identifying the crop stress compared to other indices used in his analysis moreover numerous prior studies also used pdsi while associating their results with multiscale indices to find that multi scale indices performance was better compared to the pdsi mavromatis 2007 sun et al 2012 liu et al 2018 used pdsi spei and spi in northern china plain to monitor agricultural drought conditions and documented that pdsi is not usual for monitoring the agricultural drought conditions therefore the cdi was developed to evaluate and analyze the drought events in this study soil moisture is an important variable that directly relates to drought tang and piechota 2009 soil moisture plays an important role in groundwater storage and runoff process as well as in the land and atmospheric interactions as a result greater soil moisture during vegetation growth may contribute to more evapotranspiration conversely a lesser amount of soil moisture results in smaller runoff and more infiltration therefore soil moisture plays an important role in crop characteristics and their response to dryness contreras and hunink 2015 this justifies the integration of soil moisture data to improve the cdi for agricultural drought monitoring 6 conclusions a composite drought index was proposed that combines the climatic drought index raim 1 accounting for the precipitation wbai 3 accounting for water balance and mi moisture index based on actual evapotranspiration and precipitation compared to other indices used in this study cdi has a better representation of the features related to the interaction between potential evapotranspiration water balance precipitation and soil moisture thereby improving its ability to detect agricultural and climatic drought conditions moreover cdi showed a positive correlation with soil moisture data at 0 5 to 5 cm soil layers in several catchments in china this suggests that the cdi could be used to assess agricultural as well as climatic drought conditions extreme events captured by cdi and its comparison with previous studies revealed cdi s strength in the detection of drought conditions validation of cdi with sri showed that cdi captured the hydrological drought as good as other indices pdsi in the study area cdi has a better correlation with a scaled yield crop index in most cases compared with pdsi more studies on the relationship between changes in atmospheric circulation and drought trends along with the application of econometric models could contribute to explaining losses and impacts from drought on agriculture 7 glossary ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change

3717,quantification of groundwater recharge is one of the most important issues in hydrogeology especially in view of the ongoing changes in climate and land use in this study we use numerical models of 1d vertical flow in the vadose zone and the water table fluctuation wtf analysis to investigate local scale recharge of a shallow sandy aquifer in the brda outwash plain in northern poland we show that these two methods can be jointly used to improve confidence in recharge estimation a set of preliminary numerical simulations based on soil water content measurements from 4 grassland and pine forest profiles provided a wide range of recharge estimates 263 mm to 839 mm for a 3 year period additional simulations were performed with the lower boundary condition specified as a functional relationship between the groundwater table elevation and the rate of groundwater outflow from the vertical profile horizontal drains boundary condition in this way we could reproduce the water table fluctuations resulting from recharge and lateral discharge to nearby lakes the agreement between simulated and observed groundwater levels differed depending on the specific set of parameters characterizing vadose zone flow which allowed us to find the most representative parameter sets and refine the range of plausible recharge estimates 501 mm to 573 mm per 3 years the recharge rates from wtf 410 mm to 606 mm per 3 years were in good agreement with numerical simulations providing that the effect of the natural recession of groundwater table due to lateral outflow was considered master recession curve method our results show that i the proposed approach combining 1d vadose zone modeling and wtf improves recharge estimation ii multiple types of observations including groundwater table positions are needed to calibrate and validate vadose zone flow models and iii extended periods of observations and simulations are necessary to capture year to year variability in the recharge rates keywords groundwater recharge hydrus 1d water table fluctuation vadose zone flow 1 introduction sustainable management of groundwater resources requires an accurate estimation of groundwater recharge flux this knowledge is essential to quantify the safe yield of an aquifer in the hydrological balance of catchment bouwer 1989 de vries simmers 2002 sophocleous 1991 the groundwater recharge flux also plays a significant role in the transport of contaminants because it determines the travel time through the unsaturated zone e g sousa et al 2013 szymkiewicz et al 2018b 2019 contaminant load reaching the aquifer e g szymkiewicz et al 2020 directions of groundwater flow in shallow aquifers e g scanlon et al 2002a and consequently vulnerability of aquifers and in particular groundwater intakes to health related hazards this is particularly true for shallow unconfined aquifers such as aquifers located on outwash plains an outwash plain also named sandur is mostly a sandy deposit formed by glacial ablation water it is a geomorphological form widely occurring in the glacial landscape of the north european plain fennoscandia northern siberia canada and the northern us a significant spatial extent and high hydraulic conductivity of the outwash deposits make sandurs abundant groundwater bodies commonly used to supply water several studies have been carried out in recent years to quantify groundwater recharge on outwash plains and other sandy deposits of similar character in temperate and cold climates their results are summarized in table 1 in terms of the average annual recharge and the recharge precipitation ratio ω in colder areas such as finland sweden and western canada where melting of snow and ice rapidly reaches groundwater şen 2015 recharge can reach almost 70 of the yearly precipitation in warmer and more humid regions recharge is usually lower because of less snow and longer vegetation period which increase evapotranspiration et groundwater recharge in the north european plain e g poland or western russia with a more continental climate precipitation 500 700 mm yr is about 9 24 of precipitation in forested or agricultural areas in the lowlands with more abundant rainfall greater than700 mm yr such as northern germany belgium or the eastern coast of north america recharge ranges between 13 and 34 of precipitation in agricultural areas 24 51 in coniferous forests and 28 53 in grasslands a variety of methods is used to estimate groundwater recharge they can be broadly categorized as physical techniques water budget methods numerical modeling and tracer methods healy 2010 scanlon et al 2002a within these groups we can distinguish methods based on measurements from different hydrological compartments i e the unsaturated zone the saturated zone and surface water using several methods is recommended to obtain reliable results healy 2010 lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002a simmers 1997 in the studies of callahan et al 2012 huet et al 2016 jie et al 2011 krogulec 2010 liu et al 2014 szilagyi et al 2011 and zomlot et al 2015 recharge estimations in temperate climate were conducted with at least two methods numerical models of vadose zone flow are increasingly applied to obtain recharge estimates including most of the studies reported in table 1 unsaturated zone models can be based on the solution of the richards equation e g hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 the kinematic wave equation e g modflow uzf niswonger et al 2006 or soil water balance equations e g wetspass batelaan de smedt 2001 and help schroeder et al 1994 the required computer programs are often freely available they can represent a number of factors influencing recharge in a physically based manner which makes them an ideal tool for capturing the variability of recharge in space and time and for investigating scenarios of land use or climate change however such models require a significant number of parameters that may be difficult to obtain consequently the resulting recharge estimates are prone to uncertainties resulting from a spatial variability of soil e g layering b uncertainty in the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions and c uncertainty in parameters determining root water uptake and et e g leaf area index lai and root depth in order to provide a meaningful prediction of recharge vadose zone models must be calibrated and validated against field measurements and other methods of recharge estimation jie et al 2011 this is not a simple task since data on vadose zone flow and et are difficult to obtain moreover including this data in the calibration process does not guarantee that a unique set of model parameters is derived brunner et al 2012 showed that at least in some scenarios using et data in calibration constrains the vadose zone model better than soil moisture measurements while the most valuable input for model calibration is represented by groundwater heads jie et al 2011 proposed an approach to cross validate recharge rates from the soil water balance model using observations of groundwater table fluctuations they calculated specific yield based on the recharge estimate from the soil model and the increment of groundwater table observed in the corresponding time period the obtained values of specific yield were compared to the expected values for the aquifer to check if the measured water table fluctuations are consistent with the simulated recharge episodes groundwater level measurements are simpler to perform and usually more available than vadose zone data or et measurements however including them in a state of the art 1d vertical model of vadose zone flow based on richards equation is not straightforward as it is related to the choice of the boundary condition bc at the bottom of the soil column in vadose zone flow simulations the bottom bc is often formulated in terms of the water pressure head corresponding to the measured position of the water table which can be constant or variable in time if the water table elevation varies rapidly in time using it as the bc can lead to unphysical water fluxes at the bottom of the unsaturated zone which causes errors in recharge estimations beegum et al 2018 moreover using a pressure head based bc does not allow reproducing the natural sequence of water table fluctuations resulting from infiltration and et processes occurring in the vadose zone alternatively the bottom of the soil column can be assumed impermeable brunner et al 2012 in this case one can represent water table fluctuations due to vadose zone processes but the influence of lateral groundwater flow is neglected which is unrealistic for many aquifers especially those discharging to nearby surface water bodies the third option is the free drainage boundary condition where the bottom of the soil column is above the groundwater table and outflow is driven by gravity with the vertical pressure head gradient equal to zero e g he et al 2021 healy 2010 ines mohanty 2008 šimůnek et al 2013 zendehboudi et al 2012 the bottom flux gives an estimate of recharge but the exact arrival time of recharge at the water table cannot be reproduced and information about water table elevation is not included in the model in this study we suggest using yet another option for the bottom bc in vadose zone simulations i e the pressure head dependent flux the bottom of the soil profile is below the groundwater table and the outflow rate from the saturated zone is calculated as a function of the current water table position the function contains two parameters which are calibrated using the observed water table levels the calibration procedure can be performed for different sets of vadose zone and et parameters to find which parameters allow for the best agreement between the observed and calculated water table fluctuations in this way uncertainty related to the estimation of vadose zone parameters and the resulting recharge rates is reduced besides their utility for the calibration and validation of vadose zone flow models groundwater level observations in shallow unconfined aquifers can be used to estimate recharge by the water table fluctuation method wtf healy 2010 scanlon et al 2002a this method requires only one parameter the specific yield sy unfortunately sy is difficult to determine as it depends on the type of soil the depth to the groundwater table and water dynamics in the vadose zone healy 2010 the simplest variant of wtf is the rise method rutledge unpublished manuscript after delin et al 2007 which assumes that recharge events only occur when there is an increase in the groundwater level the rise method tends to underestimate recharge in reality the changes in the groundwater level are driven by other processes besides recharge and et especially lateral flow towards streams lakes and other surface water bodies thus recharge also often occurs when the water table is stagnant or decreases but this is masked by lateral outflow in order to account for this factor the mrc method has been proposed heppner nimmo 2005 delin et al 2007 heppner et al 2007 jie et al 2011 in this approach a master recession curve mrc is identified for a specific observation well using observations from dry periods mrc represents a decrease in the groundwater level due to lateral outflow and other discharge processes in the absence of recharge the rate of the water table decline δh δt decreases with a decreasing water table elevation h and several approaches have been proposed to establish a functional relationship between these two quantities nimmo et al 2015 the water level increments are calculated with respect to the mrc leading to higher recharge estimates than using the rise method delin et al 2007 thus the results of the wtf analysis are affected by uncertainty related to the choice between the rise and mrc methods the estimation of mrc and specific yield the aim of our study was to combine vadose zone flow modeling based on the richards equation with pressure head dependent flux as the bottom bc and the wtf analysis in order to reduce the uncertainty in recharge estimation the two methods are applied to local scale recharge estimates on the experimental site on the brda outwash plain in northern poland another objective was to assess time variability of the recharge in a 3 year observation period which contained an extremely wet year followed by an extremely dry year the influence of land cover grassland vs pine forest and the related estimates of lai and root depth on groundwater recharge were also investigated 2 study area field measurements were carried out on a site near tuchola town in northern poland this area is a part of the brda sandur considered to be the largest outwash plain in poland the experimental site is almost completely surrounded by four lakes fig 1 the land is covered mainly by pine forests with some open grasslands crop fields and dispersed low buildings summer houses and farms according to the data from the weather station in chojnice 35 km from the experimental site for the period 1951 2019 the yearly average air temperature in the region is 7 4 c and the average annual precipitation is 581 mm figure 1 presents the soil profiles obtained from 4 observation boreholes p1 and p4 in pine forest p2 and p3 on grassland in each profile we can distinguish two sand layers sa1 and sa2 separated by a loamy sand sandy loam layer salo occurring about 1 5 m below the ground level and 1 5 to 2 m thick moreover in p1 and p4 we distinguished a layer of topsoil ts based on the observed differences in soil water dynamics with respect to sa1 below the vadose zone is a shallow aquifer with the water table at a depth of 6 to 7 m and the bottom at a depth of about 15 m the aquifer is composed of fine medium sand with gravel it is recharged by infiltrating precipitation and drained by surrounding lakes which are connected to brda river with a stream below the shallow aquifer is a layer of weakly permeable glacial till 15 to 24 m below ground level b g l not shown in the profiles which overlies a deeper confined aquifer the lower aquifer also composed of glaciofluvial sand with gravel is recharged by the upper aquifer which was confirmed by oficjalska and gregosiewicz 2000 and muter 2002 measurements performed in another borehole in october 2016 showed that the piezometric level in the deeper aquifer was about 0 6 m below the groundwater table in the shallow aquifer which corresponds to a vertical hydraulic gradient of 0 095 there is a regional tendency of lowering groundwater tables in shallow unconfined aquifers within the brda outwash plain jaworska szulc et al 2017 the analysis of groundwater levels in 10 monitoring wells for the period of 2003 2016 obtained from the monitoring network showed a long term trend of water table lowering since 1990 in most cases the groundwater table has been below the monthly average water level since 2006 the tendency is related to lower infiltration recharge likely caused by climate change less snow cover irregular and more intensive rainfall events in summer the lowering of the water table in the shallow aquifer may reduce or eliminate the recharge gradient between the shallow and deeper aquifers which could be a long term and potentially irreversible effect preliminary numerical simulations of vadose zone flow based on literature data gumuła kawęcka et al 2018 showed significant year to year variability of groundwater recharge following changes in annual precipitation in the period 2003 2016 regional scale estimations of average annual groundwater recharge in the brda river watershed from baseflow measurements were given by hobot et al 2012 they range from 155 mm yr for the upper part of the watershed above tuchola to 193 mm yr for the whole watershed which corresponds to 26 and 33 of the average precipitation in chojnice respectively 3 methods 3 1 field measurements of hydrological data continuous soil and groundwater data measurements were carried out from april 15 2017 to april 14 2020 in 4 observation profiles p1 p4 the water table level and the electric conductivity of groundwater were recorded using sensors baro divers decagon devices ctd 10 placed in piezometers screened in the interval of approximately 5 to 11 m below the ground level b g l in each piezometer volumetric water content was measured in each profile using automatic sensors tdr decagon devices gs3 and fdr delta t devices sm150 at four depths ranging from 20 cm to 450 cm b g l fig 1 meteorological data precipitation temperature air pressure relative humidity wind speed and direction and solar radiation was collected by a weather station located in an open field p2 from april 15 2017 to july 30 2019 an additional pluviometer was placed in the forest p1 to estimate interception all measurements of weather soil and groundwater data were recorded by automatic data loggers in 10 minute intervals 3 2 soil hydraulic characteristics several methods were applied to estimate hydraulic characteristics for soils at the site they included pedotransfer functions based on particle soil distribution single ring infiltrometer tests tension infiltrometer tests saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements with the aardvark permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp and measurements of soil water retention functions with sand kaolinite apparatus a detailed presentation of the results is outside the scope of this report and will be the subject of a separate study here we use data derived from field measurements to constrain calibration of vadose zone flow models we assumed that each soil layer is homogeneous and isotropic within each specific profile but parameters of the same layer may differ between profiles hydraulic characteristics of soils were described with the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 1a s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n g m g 1b k k s k r k s s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m g m g 2 where se is the effective saturation θ r is the residual volumetric water content θ s is the saturated volumetric water content α is the parameter related to the average pore size l 1 ng mg are parameters related to the pore size distribution mg 1 1 ng k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity and τ is a parameter related to pore geometry the saturated water contents θ s for the ts sa1 and salo layers were set equal to the average porosity as measured on undisturbed soil samples since no undisturbed samples were taken from sa2 we assumed that it is more compact due to the self weight of the soil and set θ s 0 35 which was the minimum value measured in the upper layer sa1 the residual water contents θ r were set to be slightly below the smallest values measured by soil moisture probes in the ts sa1 and sa2 layers while in salo we set it to 0 057 an average value for loamy sand according to carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks for the ts and sa1 layers were obtained from single ring infiltrometer tests and measurements with the aardvark permeameter and from permeameter measurements and pumping tests for the sa2 layer pumping tests were conducted in piezometers to determine the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer wells were pumped with a constant rate of about 4 6 m3 h the water level was measured in 15 minute intervals until drawdown stabilized hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on the dupuit method with the forchheimer correction for partial penetration the radius of drawdown was estimated using the kusakin empirical formula pazdro kozerski 1990 due to these simplifying assumptions the calculated hydraulic conductivity must be considered as approximate nevertheless it is in good agreement with the measurements using the aardvark permeameter in the same sand layer sa2 about 1 5 2 m above the water table the pore connectivity parameter τ was set to the default value of 0 5 in all soil layers except sa2 in p1 where τ was calibrated to ensure better agreement between field measurements of water content and simulations the remaining parameters i e α and n for all layers and ks for salo were found by calibration of the numerical model described below permeameter measurements of ks for the salo layer were not included in the calibration due to the large variability of results and potential errors 3 3 numerical simulations with a constant water table numerical models of vadose zone flow were developed for each profile using the hydrus 1d computer program šimůnek et al 2013 hydrus 1d solves the richards equation describing vertical flow in a variably saturated soil profile 2 θ h t z k h h z k h z s h where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 t is time t h is the water pressure head negative in the unsaturated zone z is the spatial coordinate l k h is the hydraulic conductivity function of the unsaturated medium lt 1 and s h is a sink function representing water uptake by plant roots l3l 3t 1 for spatial discretization of eq 4 hydrus 1d uses galerkin type linear finite elements with mass lumping while a fully implicit first order scheme is used for time discretization further details about the numerical scheme can be found in the code documentation šimůnek et al 2013 the code has been validated in a large number of applications šimůnek et al 2008 2016 many of them related to the estimation of groundwater recharge e g batalha et al 2018 grinevskii novoselova 2011 leterme et al 2012 leterme mallants 2011 pozdniakov et al 2015 scanlon et al 2002b šimůnek et al 2016 szymkiewicz et al 2018a twarakavi et al 2008 two series of simulations were carried out in the first series the profile depth was set to the average depth to groundwater table measured in the observation period as shown in fig 1 and the bottom boundary condition was given as h 0 const these simulations were used to calibrate the models and estimate groundwater recharge we used uniform spatial discretization with 1 cm node spacing in order to avoid the influence of the initial condition on the results we applied a 3 year warm up period starting with the water pressure distribution close to field capacity and using weather data from the chojnice station an atmospheric boundary condition was specified on the soil surface using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fluxes no water ponding was assumed to occur at the soil surface instantaneous runoff and the minimum allowed pressure head on the soil surface in dry periods separating stage 1 from stage 2 of evaporation was set to 1000 m we used precipitation measured by rain gauge at p2 grassland in the main simulation period from april 15 2017 to april 14 2020 and measurements from the chojnice weather station in the warm up period april 15 2014 april 14 2017 interception was included according to the model implemented in hydrus 1d based on von hoyningen hüne 1983 braden 1985 and van dam et al 1997 3 i a l a i 1 1 1 p s c f a l a i where i is interception lt 1 a is the interception constant lt 1 lai is leaf area index p is precipitation lt 1 scf is the soil cover fraction estimated as scf 1 exp 0 463 lai the interception constant a was set to 0 25 mm for grassland a typical value for crops and 0 37 mm for the forest the latter value ensured the best agreement between the interception calculated in the hydrus model and the interception measured on site difference in precipitation recorded by gauges on the open field and in the forest potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as implemented in hydrus 1d using daily weather data measured at the site 2017 20 and in chojnice 2014 17 when calculating pet we used a typical range of lai based on scurlock et al 2001 the average lai in temperate evergreen needle leaf forests is 5 47 with a standard deviation of 3 37 since pine forests in poland tend to have sparse canopies jagodziński kałucka 2008 we took lai 2 10 and 5 47 as our site s lower and upper estimates respectively for grasslands scurlock et al 2001 reports average lai 1 71 1 19 as the area has a relatively dense grass cover we took lai 1 71 and 2 90 as the upper and lower estimates respectively lai was assumed constant throughout the year since both types of plant cover are perennial and winters in the simulated period were relatively mild see section 4 1 and table 2 for the same reason we did not consider soil freezing preliminary simulations showed that the difference in recharge estimates with and without soil freezing is negligible according to de beer s law pet was divided into the potential evaporation flux at the soil surface and potential transpiration in the root zone šimůnek et al 2013 we assumed nonlinear root distribution with depth according to jackson et al 1996 4 y 1 β d where y is the cumulative root fraction from 0 to 1 β 0 943 for grassland p2 and p3 or 0 976 for temperate coniferous forest p1 and p4 and d is a depth in cm the resulting root density sharply decreases with depth which is consistent with the fact that even in pine forests the majority of roots typically occur within the uppermost 20 cm of the soil and only very few roots can be found below 1 5 m rutkowski et al 2017 sainju good 1993 root water uptake of grass and pine forest was estimated with the feddes et al 1978 macroscopic model the plant specific stress response function parameters were taken from de silva et al 2008 for each observation profile we simulated two scenarios using the lower and upper estimates of lai in each scenario the soil parameters not derived from field measurements were found using inverse modeling by fitting the numerical solution to measured water contents in each profile time series of daily averaged water contents in 30 days intervals from all four depths p1 p2 p4 20 50 150 450 cm and p3 10 90 180 280 cm were used for that purpose the optimization of soil hydraulic parameters was carried out using the marquardt levenberg algorithm implemented in hydrus 1d the recharge estimate corresponding to the calibrated soil parameters was taken as the final result of the simulation in each scenario 3 4 numerical simulations with lateral groundwater outflow the second series of simulations aimed to validate the numerical models described in the previous section by reproducing observed variations in groundwater table elevations for each profile we used the set of calibrated parameters from the earlier simulations the only changes introduced in the second series of simulations were i extending each profile to a depth of 8 m keeping the same node spacing of 1 cm to include the upper part of the aquifer in the sa2 layer and ii setting the bottom boundary condition to a relationship between the hydraulic head and flux to represent lateral groundwater discharge to nearby lakes for this purpose we used the horizontal drains feature of hydrus 1d the simplest analytical formula describing flow to drain available in hydrus is a simplification of hooghoudt s equation 5 q dr 4 k dr l dr 2 h h dr 2 c h h dr 2 where qdr is the lateral outflow discharge to drains per unit area kdr is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ldr is the drain spacing h is the water table elevation in the soil profile hdr is the water table elevation in the drain and c 4kdr ldr 2 is a lumped parameter representing hydraulic conductance of the aquifer and aquifer lake interface unfortunately no detailed water level measurements in the lakes were performed and it likely changed during the observation period on the other hand groundwater flow was influenced by factors not represented in eq 5 e g vertical hydraulic gradients or low permeability of the lake bottom sediments in principle it is possible to use more complex models instead of eq 5 but then more parameters need to be estimated or calibrated for the sake of simplicity we used eq 5 and considered hdr and c as fitting parameters their values were estimated by manual calibration based on the difference between the observed and calculated positions of the water table in each profile calculated as the sum of square errors ssq σ hobs hsim 2 where hobs and hsim are the observed and simulated elevations of the groundwater table hydrus 1d allows two options to incorporate the calculated flux qdr in the discrete form of the richards equation it can be added to the bottom node as a boundary condition in the strict sense or it can be distributed over all nodes below the groundwater table as a sink term the latter option seemed more consistent physically with the assumption of horizontal groundwater flow and was used in our simulations 3 5 estimation of specific yield we combined several approaches to derive a plausible range of specific yield values for our site including literature data johnson 1967 healy 2010 and the empirical formula of bieciński pazdro kozerski 1990 commonly used in poland which links sy to the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ks 6 s y 0 117 k s 7 where ks is given in m d in the above formula we used the estimate of ks in the sa2 layer in each profile finally we also estimated sy from hydrus 1d simulations with a lateral outflow boundary condition for each day of the simulation we calculated the volume of water in the lower section of the profile which contained fluctuating water table the zone included in the calculations stretched from the bottom of the profile to some height above the water table as discussed later assuming that the soil profile represents a column of 1 m2 cross section we express the volume of water as the equivalent water height hw in meters the specific yield syi for a given day i was calculated as 7 s yi δ h wi δ h i where δhwi is the daily change in water volume and δhi is the daily change in groundwater table position both quantities can be either positive for increasing water table or negative for decreasing water table the final value of sy was obtained as an average of syi for all days of the simulation period due to transient effects one can obtain syi negative or larger than soil porosity for some days these values were excluded from the calculation of the average sy some consideration is needed to choose the upper limit of the zone affected by the water table fluctuations which is the basis for calculating hw if the upper limit is too close to the water table it is in the capillary zone and the resulting sy is very small if it is too close to the soil surface sy is affected by surface infiltration and evapotranspiration which are unrelated to water table fluctuations a preliminary analysis for profile p1 showed that the results were relatively consistent if the upper limit of the calculation zone was set in the range from 1 m above the highest position of the water table in the profile to the bottom of the salo layer thus we set the upper limit of the zone for calculating sy 1 m above the highest position of the water table in each profile 3 6 water table fluctuation wtf analysis the wtf analysis was based on water level measurements in piezometers averaged for each day of the observation period the daily amount of recharge ri is calculated as 8 r i s y δ h i where sy is the specific yield and δhi greater than 0 is an increment in the groundwater table elevation caused by recharge occurring between day i 1 and i a range of sy values was obtained using the methods described in the previous section we applied two methods rise and mrc to calculate the increments δhi the rise method assumes that recharge only occurs if there is an increase in groundwater table elevation between two subsequent days so δhi hi hi 1 if hi hi 1 otherwise δhi 0 the mrc method assumes that in the absence of recharge the water table decreases daily by a specific amount δhmrci following the so called master recession curve mrc which represents in a simplified manner the discharge processes in the aquifer in particular the lateral outflow to nearby surface water bodies the groundwater table tends to decrease at a rate depending on its current position i e the higher the water table the faster the lowering rate heppner nimmo 2005 mrc provides a functional relationship between a daily decrement of the water table δhmrci and the water table elevation h i 1 in periods without recharge in this study we used the simplest linear mrc 9 δ h mrci a h i 1 b the coefficients a and b were fitted separately for each piezometer the fit was based on data from periods of continuous groundwater level decrease longer than two weeks more refined methods to estimate mrc are available heppner nimmo 2005 jie et al 2011 but we considered the approach described here as sufficiently accurate for the purposes of our study the daily increment of the water level due to recharge was then calculated as δhi hi hi 1 δhmrci if hi hi 1 δhmrci otherwise δhi 0 the decrement δhmrci taken as a positive number 4 results and discussion 4 1 weather data and measured groundwater levels figure 2 shows daily precipitation totals measured at the p2 observation point from april 15 2017 to april 15 2020 there is a significant difference between meteorological conditions during the three years of observation table 2 the one year period starting on april 15 2017 was exceptionally wet the amount of precipitation measured by a rain gauge at profile p2 open field reached 920 mm more than 150 of the long term average with a mean temperature equal to 8 2 c in contrast the one year period starting on april 15 2018 was unusually warm and dry with an average temperature of 10 2 c and precipitation of 462 mm the third year april 15 2019 april 14 2020 was warm 10 1 c but the rainfall total was slightly above average 670 4 mm y among the 36 months of the observation period 32 months had monthly temperatures higher than the long term average for the considered month based on long term 1951 2020 observation data from chojnice station ten months in the observation period were extremely warm within 5 of the warmest months in the years 1951 2020 yearly precipitation measured by the rain gauge in the forest p1 was 687 mm in the first year 321 mm in the second year and 501 mm in the third year indicating that average interception by the forest canopy was about 27 of yearly precipitation this is compatible with the range observed in pine woods in poland puchalski prusinkiewicz 1990 maximum and minimum daily values of pet calculated with the penman monteith equation are also presented in fig 2 the annual pet was the lowest in the first year starting on april 15 2017 between 521 3 and 610 1 mm while pet reached the highest values in the second year april 15 2018 april 14 2019 from 633 4 mm to 722 1 mm in the third year starting on april 15 2019 pet ranged between 591 4 mm and 676 5 mm the differences are caused mainly by different weather conditions during vegetative periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 in 2017 the vegetation period may october was relatively cold and rainy with an average temperature of 14 5 c and a precipitation amount of 682 mm in contrast in 2018 the vegetative period was extraordinarily warm and dry with an average temperature of about 16 5 c and a rainfall total of 234 mm more mild conditions were during the vegetation period in 2019 the mean temperature reached 15 5 c but the precipitation sum was 438 mm the measured values of volumetric soil water content are presented in figs 3 and 4 a distinct pattern of seasonal variability can be seen with wet periods apr 2017 apr 2018 oct 2018 apr 2019 oct 2019 apr 2020 and dry periods in apr oct 2018 and apr oct 2019 in the first year of observations there is an exceptionally long wet period with high water contents at all sensors which is not repeated in the subsequent drier years under the sandy loam layer water content fluctuations in the sa2 layer are generally much smaller than in the ts and sa1 layers in the salo layer the water content is significantly higher than in other layers due to finer soil texture the fluctuations in this layer are larger in forest profiles than in grassland profiles probably due to water uptake by deeper tree roots in dry periods a clear variability pattern can also be seen in water table elevations measured in four profiles fig 5 in the first wet year the groundwater table increased monotonically then it decreased reaching the lowest elevation in september 2019 and rose again in the last months of the observations during the long period of decline we can distinguish an interval with a relatively low decline rate in autumn winter 2018 19 corresponding to increased soil water contents in figs 3 and 4 in contrast during the vegetation periods in 2018 and 2019 apr oct we observe low soil water contents and a sharp groundwater table decline there are some breaks in water table measurements in p1 and p2 due to malfunctions of the sensors also the water table elevation in p2 is above the other three piezometers starting from mid 2018 which is probably caused by technical issues with the barodiver and the breaks in operation mentioned above different flow dynamics might have also played a role since p2 is the well farthest away from the lakes overall the soil moisture and groundwater table show strong seasonal and year to year variability related to large differences in annual precipitation and et 4 2 soil hydraulic characteristics and soil water contents parameters of the van genuchten model for all profiles and soil layers are summarized in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained from field measurements in the sa1 and sa2 layers does not differ substantially between the profiles with ks in sa2 consistently higher than in sa1 in p1 and p4 the topsoil is characterized by a lower hydraulic conductivity than the underlying sa1 sand layer in contrast ks in the salo layer obtained from inverse numerical solution shows significant differences between profiles with the lowest values in p1 and the highest in p2 different by a factor of about 500 in most cases the calibrated values of α and n were sensitive to the choice of lai which strongly influenced evapotranspiration however we obtained a similar fit quality in each of the eight scenarios reported as rmse in table 2 in terms of rmse the best fit was obtained for p2 and this is confirmed by a visual comparison of simulated and measured water contents in figs 3 and 4 on the other hand in p2 the pattern of water content evolution is different from other profiles since the water content is almost constant in the salo layer while in other locations it decreased significantly during the dry periods 4 3 recharge estimates from numerical simulations figure 6 shows annual and total 3 year recharge values obtained using the simulations with a constant water table position and the final calibrated sets of parameters in each scenario they differ significantly between the profiles and strongly depend on lai ranging from 263 mm in p4 with an lai of 5 47 to 839 mm in p2 with an lai of 1 71 in the three years for the lower lai estimates recharge can be even more than two times larger than for the upper lai estimate due to smaller interception and et there is a reasonable similarity in predictions for the two forest profiles p1 and p4 there is no overlap in the results for the two grass profiles with the lower estimate in p2 minimally exceeding the upper estimate in p3 in contrast the range calculated for p3 partly overlaps with the estimates for p1 and p4 there are also clear differences in the time distribution of the recharge flux arriving at the groundwater table four examples are shown in fig 7 in all cases recharge occurs mostly during the initial wet year of the observations however in p1 lai2 10 and p2 lai2 90 the flux increases and later decreases gradually over longer time periods while in p2 and p4 separate recharge events are clearly marked as peak flux values moreover in p2 relatively large fluxes occur in the second and third years of the observation period in p1 and p3 there is only small recharge in the second year and somewhat larger recharge in the last year finally in p4 there is practically no recharge in the second year and only a small flux in the last year these results are consistent with the differences in soil hydraulic parameters and lai between the simulations considering the whole 3 year period of observations the recharge precipitation ratio varies from 13 to 41 depending on the considered scenario note that despite such a wide variability the r p ratio falls within the range of values reported in table 1 since we obtained a reasonably good fit to the measured water content values in all cases additional information was required to reduce the uncertainty resulting from the variability of soil characteristics and the lack of precise data on evapotranspiration thus another series of simulations was carried out to reproduce the groundwater table s observed fluctuations and narrow the range of recharge predictions 4 4 water table fluctuations from numerical simulations the water table fluctuations obtained using numerical simulations with a lower boundary condition representing lateral outflow are shown in figs 8 and 9 in each case the best fit resulting from manual calibration of boundary condition parameters is presented the results were found to be quite sensitive to both hdr and c which facilitated their calibration hdr determined the average elevation of the water table while c influenced both the average elevation and amplitude of fluctuations fig 10 however the shape of the curve is determined by the distribution of recharge over time and it is not fundamentally affected by either hdr or ldr the agreement between the best fit and observations varied depending on the soil profile and lai the lowest ssq values 1 5 104 were obtained for p1 with an lai of 2 10 and p3 with an lai of 2 90 this is confirmed by a visual inspection of the plots which shows a relatively good agreement between observations and the model for most of the simulation period for p4 with an lai of 2 10 the ssq is only slightly larger 1 6 104 but the fit is clearly worse for the rising branch of the hydrogram corresponding to the initial wet period the largest ssq were obtained for p2 where the groundwater table measurements were probably inaccurate as discussed earlier while on the other hand the recharge estimates were higher than for other profiles for the forest profiles p1 and p4 the fit was better for the lower lai estimate 2 10 while for the grass profiles p2 and p3 it was better for the higher lai estimate 2 90 the results presented in figs 8 and 9 indicate that simulations for p1 and p4 with an lai of 2 10 and p3 with an lai of 2 90 provided recharge estimates which are most representative for our sites i e they are in the best agreement with the observed pattern of groundwater level fluctuations consequently total recharge in the observed period can be estimated to be between 501 and 573 mm a significantly narrower range than the one resulting from the first series of simulations the corresponding lai falls between 2 10 and 2 90 representing the upper estimates for grassland and lower estimates for pine forests the fitted values of conductance coefficient c fall in the range from 1 32 10 5 to 4 44 10 5 cm d 1 the corresponding theoretical distance between the observed profile and the lake half of the drain spacing can be calculated from eq 5 assuming the aquifer permeability kdr 3716 cm d an average value for the sa2 layer from table 2 the obtained distance is between 91 and 168 m this is in reasonable agreement with the real distances 30 m for p1 170 m for p2 70 m for p3 and 90 m for p4 note however that there is no clear relationship between the fitted c value and the real distance to the lake at a specific point 4 5 estimation of specific yield healy 2010 following johnson 1967 reports sy 0 21 for fine sands with the standard deviation 0 07 since ks estimates for sa2 are quite similar in each profile table 3 the empirical formula of bieciński eq 6 gives a narrow range of sy estimates 0 191 to 0 200 sy derived from the second series of numerical simulations with a fluctuating water table ranged from 0 229 p3 lai 1 71 to 0 300 p4 lai 2 10 with an average of 0 269 these results are consistent with the upper range of estimates given by healy 2010 which can be explained by the high uniformity of grain sizes in sa2 ultimately in the wtf analysis we used 0 200 and 0 280 as the lower and upper estimates of sy for our sites 4 6 recharge estimations using wtf the master recession curves for each profile are shown in fig 11 there is a considerable scatter between the points representing the relationship between the groundwater table elevation h and a daily decrement of the groundwater level δhmrc in each case it was possible to fit a linear trend showing an expected decrease of the absolute value of δhmrc with decreasing h but the results must be considered as highly approximate figure 12 presents groundwater table increments calculated using the rise and mrc methods for p3 both methods produce a similar pattern of recharge variability however in the mrc approach there are significantly more days with recharge and the estimated recharge rates are higher than in the rise method according to the mrc procedure recharge also occurs when there is a decline in the groundwater table but it is smaller than the decline resulting from the master recession curve this can be seen especially in the period from oct 2018 to apr 2019 characterized by a small decrease in the groundwater table as discharge to lakes is partly compensated for by recharge from infiltration recharge rates calculated for each profile using the rise and mrc methods and different estimates of sy are shown in fig 6 together with the results of numerical simulations discussed earlier several conclusions can be drawn from this comparison the estimates obtained using the mrc method are more than twice as large as those obtained using the rise method emphasizing the importance of including a recession curve in the analysis in most cases the results of numerical simulations are closer to mrc than to rise except for the second driest observation year where the opposite is true in this period recharge is low and thus sensitive to inaccuracies in the approximation of the recession curve considering the whole 3 year period we can notice a good agreement between the mrc method and the hydrus 1d simulations for the forest profiles p1 and p4 with the lower lai 2 10 and for the p3 profile grass with an lai of 2 90 the numerical results fall between the mrc estimates for low and high sy 410 mm to 606 mm in contrast the largest discrepancy between numerical modeling and the wtf analysis occurs for p2 in this case even for the highest value of specific yield the mrc estimate is significantly smaller than the lowest value obtained using the numerical model these observations further support the conclusions from section 4 4 that the simulations for p1 with a low lai and p3 with a high lai yield recharge patterns which are the most consistent with the observed groundwater level fluctuations while the largest incompatibility is observed for p2 the disagreement for p2 is probably caused by two overlapping effects increased local recharge due to the high permeability of the sandy loam layer and a possible malfunction of the water level sensor further cross validation of the wtf method and numerical modeling can be done following jie et al 2011 the sum of the water table increments calculated using the mrc approach for p1 is 2080 mm in the 3 year period while the corresponding recharge obtained using the hydrus 1d simulation with an lai of 2 10 is 571 mm this provides an estimate of sy 571 mm 2080 mm of 0 274 very close to the value calculated using the water balance in the numerical solution with lateral outflow 0 278 and within the range given by healy 2010 similarly for p3 the sum of increments is 2050 mm and the recharge estimate using hydrus lai 2 90 is 501 mm for sy 0 244 again this value is very close to the estimate derived directly from the numerical simulation with lateral outflow 0 233 this analysis increases the confidence in the recharge estimates provided by numerical simulations 4 7 time variability of recharge and a recharge precipitation ratio the presented results show that groundwater recharge is a time variable process and at least on a short time scale cannot be considered as steady state flow the time distribution of groundwater recharge is strongly determined by the intensity and distribution of precipitation abundant rainfalls in 2017 resulted in high inflow to the water table in autumn winter 2017 2018 on the contrary the drought in 2018 caused a drop in the water table and low percolation from the vadose zone to the aquifer in winter spring 2019 in the last year of the observations 2019 20 both precipitation and recharge were between the two earlier extreme years in table 4 we report annual and total recharge estimates based on three numerical simulations that were found to be the most representative for the study area p1 lai 2 10 p3 lai 2 90 p4 lai 2 10 the ratio of annual recharge between the first wet and second dry year of observations ranged from 3 1 p4 lai 2 10 to 7 5 p3 lai 2 90 the ratios obtained using wtf were smaller but still significant 2 3 to 3 6 in the rise method and 1 8 to 2 7 in the mrc method the time of the water table response to a single rain event depends on the thickness of the unsaturated zone soil type and vegetation since the magnitude of the water table rise is determined by the water content in the unsaturated zone the amount of precipitation during the preceding weeks plays a significant role dripps 2012 that is probably the reason why groundwater recharge following the storm at the end of june 2017 which occurred after wet months is so apparent on july 17 2018 even more abundant rainfalls 47 mm day took place however this event did not result in any response of the water table probably because of the dry preceding spring and summer some studies provide guidelines to estimate annual or multi year recharge in central europe as a specific fraction of precipitation depending on the soil type land cover and other factors dyck and chardebellas 1963 cited after hölting and coldewey 2019 duda et al 2011 hölting and coldewey 2019 provide an empirical formula for the annual recharge precipitation relationship based on an earlier study of dyck and chardabellas 1963 who summarized data from a large number of lysimeters 10 r 1 1 p δ p where p is annual precipitation and δp depends on soil and land cover for sandy soils with vegetation δp 433 mm and the corresponding results are shown in table 4 eq 10 provides recharge estimates significantly larger than the numerical simulations and wtf applied to our site except for the driest year for which the agreement is reasonable it should be noted that r in eq 10 corresponds to the drainage flux measured in lysimeters which can be significantly larger than recharge if there is a possibility of upward capillary flow or water uptake by plant roots from depths below the bottom of the lysimeter moreover eq 10 does not account for the presence of low permeability layers which was the case on our site another simple formula relating recharge to precipitation over annual or longer time scales is 11 r ω p where ω r p is the recharge precipitation ratio which depends on various factors pazdro kozerski 1990 suggested ω 0 25 to 0 3 for glacial and fluvioglacial sands such as those occurring on the brda outwash plain the r p ratio for the whole 3 year observation period obtained using numerical simulations 0 24 0 28 and from wtf mrc 0 20 0 30 is close to this estimate in the more recent study by duda et al 2011 ω was assumed to be a product of four partial coefficients ω αβ γδ representing the soil type α land cover β ground slope γ and depth to groundwater table δ the suggested α value for sandy deposits is 0 14 to 0 22 while β is 1 for grassland and 0 9 for forests in our case the factors γ and δ were equal to 1 because the terrain is relatively flat and the depth to the groundwater table is more than 2 m this gives a range of ω values from 0 14 to 0 22 for grassland and 0 13 to 0 20 for the forest the resulting recharge estimates are quite close to the numerical simulations and wtf mrc in the second dry and third average years while they are significantly lower in the first wet year and consequently also in terms of the total 3 year recharge the coefficients suggested by duda et al 2011 were inferred from the baseflow analysis for several polish rivers regional watershed scale recharge estimated from baseflow tends to be smaller than local scale estimations in areas with the groundwater table below the root zone because a part of recharged groundwater is lost to evapotranspiration in river valleys and wetlands before discharging to the river however recharge estimates for the region of our experimental site an upper brda river watershed hobot et al 2012 obtained from baseflow measurements are about 155 to 193 mm yr 26 to 33 of the average precipitation in chojnice which is in good agreement with the results of our numerical simulations an average of the 3 year period is 167 to 191 mm yr since the plant water demand does not change from one year to the other as much as precipitation the fraction of total precipitation reaching groundwater is smaller in dry years than in wet years kowalski 2007 this is consistent with the results of numerical simulations which indicate a much larger r p ratio for the wettest year 0 36 0 38 than the driest year 0 10 0 24 according to the wtf mrc method the variability of the r p ratio is smaller and the lowest r p ratio is in the third year representing average conditions between wet and dry years eq 10 predicts a very strong dependence of the r p ratio on precipitation which is not reflected in our results in contrast eq 11 provides a constant ratio ω r p i e the recharge is a fixed fraction of annual precipitation regardless of the actual amount of precipitation neither of these equations appeared adequate in our case however eq 11 seems to work reasonably well in dry or average years the increasing occurrence of extremely wet and dry periods along with temperature rise leading to higher evapotranspiration and shorter snow season are the main symptoms of climate change in central europe goudie 2006 ipcc 2021 which in turn affect groundwater recharge eg haidu and nistor 2019 jaworska szulc 2015 neukum and azzam 2012 our modeling approach seems to be a promising tool to evaluate recharge under different historical or future climate change scenarios gumuła kawęcka et al 2021 in particular it is possible to represent groundwater table fluctuations using a 1d variably saturated flow model if the parameters describing lateral outflow are known they can be obtained from limited time series of water table measurements and the model can be further enhanced by including time variable water level in the surface water body lake or stream 4 8 influence of plant cover it could be expected that recharge in a forest is smaller than in a grassland area due to higher interception by the tree canopy and the ability of tree roots to extract water from larger depths however there does not appear to be a universal relationship between recharge in forests and grasslands since it may depend on particular plant species according to dripps bradbury 2010 recharge under the coniferous forest was only slightly smaller than under grass cover grinevskii novoselova 2011 found that recharge under the forest was actually larger than under cropland in our simulations recharge depended strongly on lai on average recharge estimates for the grassland profiles were larger than for the forest profiles fig 6 because the assumed range of lai values was higher for the forest than for grassland despite a partial overlap however looking only at the three scenarios which showed the best agreement with the observed water table fluctuations we can see that recharge in the grassland profile p3 lai 2 9 was actually lower than in p1 or p4 with an lai of 2 1 this is a consequence of our choice of lai values for the simulations with the upper estimate for grass higher than the lower estimate for pine forest as explained in section 3 3 our results emphasize the need for accurate estimations of lai however identification of actual lai values in the study area and their possible evolution in time was outside the scope of the present work in contrast wtf did not show significant differences in recharge between grassland and forest profiles the results of the wtf method are affected by the land cover in a larger area not only in the close vicinity of the monitoring well forests are intermixed with open grasslands crop fields and small built up regions in our study area consequently water table fluctuations in both monitoring wells showed a similar pattern representing average recharge 5 conclusion this study highlights the need to use multiple methods and observation periods to increase confidence in recharge estimations especially given the increasing occurrence of extremely wet and dry periods in temperate climate zone in our approach numerical simulations of vertical flow in the vadose zone were combined with the analysis of water table fluctuations we showed how these two methods could inform and cross validate each other using a modified boundary condition in numerical simulations one can check if the vadose zone model is consistent with the observed groundwater table fluctuations an additional benefit is the calculation of specific yield from the simulation results the specific yield can be later used in the wtf mrc analysis to see if the recharge estimates are consistent with those obtained from simulations one can note a conceptual similarity between the numerical simulations with the modified bottom boundary condition and the master recession curve mrc approach in both cases the aim is to include lateral groundwater flow in the analysis of point scale observations in this way we can obtain a more accurate description of the vadose zone groundwater interactions without the need to solve more complex 2d or 3d models the incorporation of groundwater level observations in vadose zone models significantly reduces the uncertainty in recharge estimations our results showed that soil water measurements alone are insufficient to constrain the models especially if there is no detailed data on evapotranspiration in view of the significant year to year variability of precipitation and recharge numerical simulations and wtf should preferably be applied on longer time scales to achieve meaningful recharge estimations in numerical simulations it is important to use a warm up period with realistic weather data to accurately reproduce the initial state of soil water further research is warranted on the combined use of 1d numerical models and wtf in particular there is a need to investigate other analytical formulas describing the lateral outflow boundary condition and to develop tools for calibrating their parameters jointly with the calibration of soil hydraulic parameters and or et related parameters we believe that the approach presented here can be used to improve recharge estimates in unconfined aquifers over a wide range of geological and hydrological settings

3717,quantification of groundwater recharge is one of the most important issues in hydrogeology especially in view of the ongoing changes in climate and land use in this study we use numerical models of 1d vertical flow in the vadose zone and the water table fluctuation wtf analysis to investigate local scale recharge of a shallow sandy aquifer in the brda outwash plain in northern poland we show that these two methods can be jointly used to improve confidence in recharge estimation a set of preliminary numerical simulations based on soil water content measurements from 4 grassland and pine forest profiles provided a wide range of recharge estimates 263 mm to 839 mm for a 3 year period additional simulations were performed with the lower boundary condition specified as a functional relationship between the groundwater table elevation and the rate of groundwater outflow from the vertical profile horizontal drains boundary condition in this way we could reproduce the water table fluctuations resulting from recharge and lateral discharge to nearby lakes the agreement between simulated and observed groundwater levels differed depending on the specific set of parameters characterizing vadose zone flow which allowed us to find the most representative parameter sets and refine the range of plausible recharge estimates 501 mm to 573 mm per 3 years the recharge rates from wtf 410 mm to 606 mm per 3 years were in good agreement with numerical simulations providing that the effect of the natural recession of groundwater table due to lateral outflow was considered master recession curve method our results show that i the proposed approach combining 1d vadose zone modeling and wtf improves recharge estimation ii multiple types of observations including groundwater table positions are needed to calibrate and validate vadose zone flow models and iii extended periods of observations and simulations are necessary to capture year to year variability in the recharge rates keywords groundwater recharge hydrus 1d water table fluctuation vadose zone flow 1 introduction sustainable management of groundwater resources requires an accurate estimation of groundwater recharge flux this knowledge is essential to quantify the safe yield of an aquifer in the hydrological balance of catchment bouwer 1989 de vries simmers 2002 sophocleous 1991 the groundwater recharge flux also plays a significant role in the transport of contaminants because it determines the travel time through the unsaturated zone e g sousa et al 2013 szymkiewicz et al 2018b 2019 contaminant load reaching the aquifer e g szymkiewicz et al 2020 directions of groundwater flow in shallow aquifers e g scanlon et al 2002a and consequently vulnerability of aquifers and in particular groundwater intakes to health related hazards this is particularly true for shallow unconfined aquifers such as aquifers located on outwash plains an outwash plain also named sandur is mostly a sandy deposit formed by glacial ablation water it is a geomorphological form widely occurring in the glacial landscape of the north european plain fennoscandia northern siberia canada and the northern us a significant spatial extent and high hydraulic conductivity of the outwash deposits make sandurs abundant groundwater bodies commonly used to supply water several studies have been carried out in recent years to quantify groundwater recharge on outwash plains and other sandy deposits of similar character in temperate and cold climates their results are summarized in table 1 in terms of the average annual recharge and the recharge precipitation ratio ω in colder areas such as finland sweden and western canada where melting of snow and ice rapidly reaches groundwater şen 2015 recharge can reach almost 70 of the yearly precipitation in warmer and more humid regions recharge is usually lower because of less snow and longer vegetation period which increase evapotranspiration et groundwater recharge in the north european plain e g poland or western russia with a more continental climate precipitation 500 700 mm yr is about 9 24 of precipitation in forested or agricultural areas in the lowlands with more abundant rainfall greater than700 mm yr such as northern germany belgium or the eastern coast of north america recharge ranges between 13 and 34 of precipitation in agricultural areas 24 51 in coniferous forests and 28 53 in grasslands a variety of methods is used to estimate groundwater recharge they can be broadly categorized as physical techniques water budget methods numerical modeling and tracer methods healy 2010 scanlon et al 2002a within these groups we can distinguish methods based on measurements from different hydrological compartments i e the unsaturated zone the saturated zone and surface water using several methods is recommended to obtain reliable results healy 2010 lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002a simmers 1997 in the studies of callahan et al 2012 huet et al 2016 jie et al 2011 krogulec 2010 liu et al 2014 szilagyi et al 2011 and zomlot et al 2015 recharge estimations in temperate climate were conducted with at least two methods numerical models of vadose zone flow are increasingly applied to obtain recharge estimates including most of the studies reported in table 1 unsaturated zone models can be based on the solution of the richards equation e g hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 the kinematic wave equation e g modflow uzf niswonger et al 2006 or soil water balance equations e g wetspass batelaan de smedt 2001 and help schroeder et al 1994 the required computer programs are often freely available they can represent a number of factors influencing recharge in a physically based manner which makes them an ideal tool for capturing the variability of recharge in space and time and for investigating scenarios of land use or climate change however such models require a significant number of parameters that may be difficult to obtain consequently the resulting recharge estimates are prone to uncertainties resulting from a spatial variability of soil e g layering b uncertainty in the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions and c uncertainty in parameters determining root water uptake and et e g leaf area index lai and root depth in order to provide a meaningful prediction of recharge vadose zone models must be calibrated and validated against field measurements and other methods of recharge estimation jie et al 2011 this is not a simple task since data on vadose zone flow and et are difficult to obtain moreover including this data in the calibration process does not guarantee that a unique set of model parameters is derived brunner et al 2012 showed that at least in some scenarios using et data in calibration constrains the vadose zone model better than soil moisture measurements while the most valuable input for model calibration is represented by groundwater heads jie et al 2011 proposed an approach to cross validate recharge rates from the soil water balance model using observations of groundwater table fluctuations they calculated specific yield based on the recharge estimate from the soil model and the increment of groundwater table observed in the corresponding time period the obtained values of specific yield were compared to the expected values for the aquifer to check if the measured water table fluctuations are consistent with the simulated recharge episodes groundwater level measurements are simpler to perform and usually more available than vadose zone data or et measurements however including them in a state of the art 1d vertical model of vadose zone flow based on richards equation is not straightforward as it is related to the choice of the boundary condition bc at the bottom of the soil column in vadose zone flow simulations the bottom bc is often formulated in terms of the water pressure head corresponding to the measured position of the water table which can be constant or variable in time if the water table elevation varies rapidly in time using it as the bc can lead to unphysical water fluxes at the bottom of the unsaturated zone which causes errors in recharge estimations beegum et al 2018 moreover using a pressure head based bc does not allow reproducing the natural sequence of water table fluctuations resulting from infiltration and et processes occurring in the vadose zone alternatively the bottom of the soil column can be assumed impermeable brunner et al 2012 in this case one can represent water table fluctuations due to vadose zone processes but the influence of lateral groundwater flow is neglected which is unrealistic for many aquifers especially those discharging to nearby surface water bodies the third option is the free drainage boundary condition where the bottom of the soil column is above the groundwater table and outflow is driven by gravity with the vertical pressure head gradient equal to zero e g he et al 2021 healy 2010 ines mohanty 2008 šimůnek et al 2013 zendehboudi et al 2012 the bottom flux gives an estimate of recharge but the exact arrival time of recharge at the water table cannot be reproduced and information about water table elevation is not included in the model in this study we suggest using yet another option for the bottom bc in vadose zone simulations i e the pressure head dependent flux the bottom of the soil profile is below the groundwater table and the outflow rate from the saturated zone is calculated as a function of the current water table position the function contains two parameters which are calibrated using the observed water table levels the calibration procedure can be performed for different sets of vadose zone and et parameters to find which parameters allow for the best agreement between the observed and calculated water table fluctuations in this way uncertainty related to the estimation of vadose zone parameters and the resulting recharge rates is reduced besides their utility for the calibration and validation of vadose zone flow models groundwater level observations in shallow unconfined aquifers can be used to estimate recharge by the water table fluctuation method wtf healy 2010 scanlon et al 2002a this method requires only one parameter the specific yield sy unfortunately sy is difficult to determine as it depends on the type of soil the depth to the groundwater table and water dynamics in the vadose zone healy 2010 the simplest variant of wtf is the rise method rutledge unpublished manuscript after delin et al 2007 which assumes that recharge events only occur when there is an increase in the groundwater level the rise method tends to underestimate recharge in reality the changes in the groundwater level are driven by other processes besides recharge and et especially lateral flow towards streams lakes and other surface water bodies thus recharge also often occurs when the water table is stagnant or decreases but this is masked by lateral outflow in order to account for this factor the mrc method has been proposed heppner nimmo 2005 delin et al 2007 heppner et al 2007 jie et al 2011 in this approach a master recession curve mrc is identified for a specific observation well using observations from dry periods mrc represents a decrease in the groundwater level due to lateral outflow and other discharge processes in the absence of recharge the rate of the water table decline δh δt decreases with a decreasing water table elevation h and several approaches have been proposed to establish a functional relationship between these two quantities nimmo et al 2015 the water level increments are calculated with respect to the mrc leading to higher recharge estimates than using the rise method delin et al 2007 thus the results of the wtf analysis are affected by uncertainty related to the choice between the rise and mrc methods the estimation of mrc and specific yield the aim of our study was to combine vadose zone flow modeling based on the richards equation with pressure head dependent flux as the bottom bc and the wtf analysis in order to reduce the uncertainty in recharge estimation the two methods are applied to local scale recharge estimates on the experimental site on the brda outwash plain in northern poland another objective was to assess time variability of the recharge in a 3 year observation period which contained an extremely wet year followed by an extremely dry year the influence of land cover grassland vs pine forest and the related estimates of lai and root depth on groundwater recharge were also investigated 2 study area field measurements were carried out on a site near tuchola town in northern poland this area is a part of the brda sandur considered to be the largest outwash plain in poland the experimental site is almost completely surrounded by four lakes fig 1 the land is covered mainly by pine forests with some open grasslands crop fields and dispersed low buildings summer houses and farms according to the data from the weather station in chojnice 35 km from the experimental site for the period 1951 2019 the yearly average air temperature in the region is 7 4 c and the average annual precipitation is 581 mm figure 1 presents the soil profiles obtained from 4 observation boreholes p1 and p4 in pine forest p2 and p3 on grassland in each profile we can distinguish two sand layers sa1 and sa2 separated by a loamy sand sandy loam layer salo occurring about 1 5 m below the ground level and 1 5 to 2 m thick moreover in p1 and p4 we distinguished a layer of topsoil ts based on the observed differences in soil water dynamics with respect to sa1 below the vadose zone is a shallow aquifer with the water table at a depth of 6 to 7 m and the bottom at a depth of about 15 m the aquifer is composed of fine medium sand with gravel it is recharged by infiltrating precipitation and drained by surrounding lakes which are connected to brda river with a stream below the shallow aquifer is a layer of weakly permeable glacial till 15 to 24 m below ground level b g l not shown in the profiles which overlies a deeper confined aquifer the lower aquifer also composed of glaciofluvial sand with gravel is recharged by the upper aquifer which was confirmed by oficjalska and gregosiewicz 2000 and muter 2002 measurements performed in another borehole in october 2016 showed that the piezometric level in the deeper aquifer was about 0 6 m below the groundwater table in the shallow aquifer which corresponds to a vertical hydraulic gradient of 0 095 there is a regional tendency of lowering groundwater tables in shallow unconfined aquifers within the brda outwash plain jaworska szulc et al 2017 the analysis of groundwater levels in 10 monitoring wells for the period of 2003 2016 obtained from the monitoring network showed a long term trend of water table lowering since 1990 in most cases the groundwater table has been below the monthly average water level since 2006 the tendency is related to lower infiltration recharge likely caused by climate change less snow cover irregular and more intensive rainfall events in summer the lowering of the water table in the shallow aquifer may reduce or eliminate the recharge gradient between the shallow and deeper aquifers which could be a long term and potentially irreversible effect preliminary numerical simulations of vadose zone flow based on literature data gumuła kawęcka et al 2018 showed significant year to year variability of groundwater recharge following changes in annual precipitation in the period 2003 2016 regional scale estimations of average annual groundwater recharge in the brda river watershed from baseflow measurements were given by hobot et al 2012 they range from 155 mm yr for the upper part of the watershed above tuchola to 193 mm yr for the whole watershed which corresponds to 26 and 33 of the average precipitation in chojnice respectively 3 methods 3 1 field measurements of hydrological data continuous soil and groundwater data measurements were carried out from april 15 2017 to april 14

weather soil and groundwater data were recorded by automatic data loggers in 10 minute intervals 3 2 soil hydraulic characteristics several methods were applied to estimate hydraulic characteristics for soils at the site they included pedotransfer functions based on particle soil distribution single ring infiltrometer tests tension infiltrometer tests saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements with the aardvark permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp and measurements of soil water retention functions with sand kaolinite apparatus a detailed presentation of the results is outside the scope of this report and will be the subject of a separate study here we use data derived from field measurements to constrain calibration of vadose zone flow models we assumed that each soil layer is homogeneous and isotropic within each specific profile but parameters of the same layer may differ between profiles hydraulic characteristics of soils were described with the van genuchten mualem

weight of the soil and set θ s 0 35 which was the minimum value measured in the upper layer sa1 the residual water contents θ r were set to be slightly below the smallest values measured by soil moisture probes in the ts sa1 and sa2 layers while in salo we set it to 0 057 an average value for loamy sand according to carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated hydraulic conductivities ks for the ts and sa1 layers were obtained from single ring infiltrometer tests and measurements with the aardvark permeameter and from permeameter measurements and pumping tests for the sa2 layer pumping tests were conducted in piezometers to determine the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer wells were pumped with a constant rate of about 4 6 m3 h the water level was measured in 15 minute intervals until drawdown stabilized hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on the dupuit method with the forchheimer correction for partial penetration the radius of drawdown was estimated using the kusakin empirical formula pazdro kozerski 1990 due to these simplifying assumptions the calculated hydraulic conductivity must be considered as approximate nevertheless it is in good agreement with the measurements using the aardvark permeameter in the same sand layer sa2 about 1 5 2 m above the water table the pore connectivity parameter τ was set to the default value of 0 5 in all soil layers except sa2 in p1 where τ was calibrated to ensure better agreement between field measurements of water content and simulations the remaining parameters i e α and n for all layers and ks for salo were found by calibration of the numerical model described below permeameter measurements of ks for the salo layer were not included in the calibration due to the large variability of results and potential errors 3 3 numerical simulations with a constant water table numerical models of vadose zone flow were developed for each profile using the hydrus 1d computer program šimůnek et al 2013 hydrus 1d solves the richards equation describing vertical flow in a variably saturated soil profile 2 θ h t z k h h z k h z s h where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 t is time t h is the water pressure head negative in the unsaturated zone z is the spatial coordinate l k h is the hydraulic conductivity function of the unsaturated medium lt 1 and s h is a sink function representing water uptake by plant roots l3l 3t 1 for spatial discretization of eq 4 hydrus 1d uses galerkin type linear finite elements with mass lumping while a fully implicit first order scheme is used for time discretization further details about the numerical scheme can be found in the code documentation šimůnek et al 2013 the code has been validated in a large number of applications šimůnek et al 2008 2016 many of them related to the estimation of groundwater recharge e g batalha et al 2018 grinevskii novoselova 2011 leterme et al 2012 leterme mallants 2011 pozdniakov et al 2015 scanlon et al 2002b šimůnek et al 2016 szymkiewicz et al 2018a twarakavi et al 2008 two series of simulations were carried out in the first series the profile depth was set to the average depth to groundwater table measured in the observation period as shown in fig 1 and the bottom boundary condition was given as h 0 const these simulations were used to calibrate the models and estimate groundwater recharge we used uniform spatial discretization with 1 cm node spacing in order to avoid the influence of the initial condition on the results we applied a 3 year warm up period starting with the water pressure distribution close to field capacity and using weather data from the chojnice station an atmospheric boundary condition was specified on the soil surface using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fluxes no water ponding was assumed to occur at the soil surface instantaneous runoff and the minimum allowed pressure head on the soil surface in dry periods separating stage 1 from stage 2 of evaporation was set to 1000 m we used precipitation measured by rain gauge at p2 grassland in the main simulation period from april 15 2017 to april 14 2020 and measurements from the chojnice weather station in the warm up period april 15 2014 april 14 2017 interception was included according to the model implemented in hydrus 1d based on von hoyningen hüne 1983 braden 1985 and van dam et al 1997 3 i a l a i 1 1 1 p s c f a l a i where i is interception lt 1 a is the interception constant lt 1 lai is leaf area index p is precipitation lt 1 scf is the soil cover fraction estimated as scf 1 exp 0 463 lai the interception constant a was set to 0 25 mm for grassland a typical value for crops and 0 37 mm for the forest the latter value ensured the best agreement between the interception calculated in the hydrus model and the interception measured on site difference in precipitation recorded by gauges on the open field and in the forest potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as implemented in hydrus 1d using daily weather data measured at the site 2017 20 and in chojnice 2014 17 when calculating pet we used a typical range of lai based on scurlock et al 2001 the average lai in temperate evergreen needle leaf forests is 5 47 with a standard deviation of 3 37 since pine forests in poland tend to have sparse canopies jagodziński kałucka 2008 we took lai 2 10 and 5 47 as our site s lower and upper estimates respectively for grasslands scurlock et al 2001 reports average lai 1 71 1 19 as the area has a relatively dense grass cover we took lai 1 71 and 2 90 as the upper and lower estimates respectively lai was assumed constant throughout the year since both types of plant cover are perennial and winters in the simulated period were relatively mild see section 4 1 and table 2 for the same reason we did not consider soil freezing preliminary simulations showed that the difference in recharge estimates with and without soil freezing is negligible according to de beer s law pet was divided into the potential evaporation flux at the soil surface and potential transpiration in the root zone šimůnek et al 2013 we assumed nonlinear root distribution with depth according to jackson et al 1996 4 y 1 β d where y is the cumulative root fraction from 0 to 1 β 0 943 for grassland p2 and p3 or 0 976 for temperate coniferous forest p1 and p4 and d is a depth in cm the resulting root density sharply decreases with depth which is consistent with the fact that even in pine forests the majority of roots typically occur within the uppermost 20 cm of the soil and only very few roots can be found below 1 5 m rutkowski et al 2017 sainju good 1993 root water uptake of grass and pine forest was estimated with the feddes et al 1978 macroscopic model the plant specific stress response function parameters were taken from de silva et al 2008 for each observation profile we simulated two scenarios using the lower and upper estimates of lai in each scenario the soil parameters not derived from field measurements were found using inverse modeling by fitting the numerical solution to measured water contents in each profile time series of daily averaged water contents in 30 days intervals from all four depths p1 p2 p4 20 50 150 450 cm and p3 10 90 180 280 cm were used for that purpose the optimization of soil hydraulic parameters was carried out using the marquardt levenberg algorithm implemented in hydrus 1d the recharge estimate corresponding to the calibrated soil parameters was taken as the final result of the simulation in each scenario 3 4 numerical simulations with lateral groundwater outflow the second series of simulations aimed to validate the numerical models described in the previous section by reproducing observed variations in groundwater table elevations for each profile we used the set of calibrated parameters from the earlier simulations the only changes introduced in the second series of simulations were i extending each profile to a depth of 8 m keeping the same node spacing of 1 cm to include the upper part of the aquifer in the sa2 layer and ii setting the bottom boundary condition to a relationship between the hydraulic head and flux to represent lateral groundwater discharge to nearby lakes for this purpose we used the horizontal drains feature of hydrus 1d the simplest analytical formula describing flow to drain available in hydrus is a simplification of hooghoudt s equation 5 q dr 4 k dr l dr 2 h h dr 2 c h h dr 2 where qdr is the lateral outflow discharge to drains per unit area kdr is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ldr is the drain spacing h is the water table elevation in the soil profile hdr is the water table elevation in the drain and c 4kdr ldr 2 is a lumped parameter representing hydraulic conductance of the aquifer and aquifer lake interface unfortunately no detailed water level measurements in the lakes were performed and it likely changed during the observation period on the other hand groundwater flow was influenced by factors not represented in eq 5 e g vertical hydraulic gradients or low permeability of the lake bottom sediments in principle it is possible to use more complex models instead of eq 5 but then more parameters need to be estimated or calibrated for the sake of simplicity we used eq 5 and considered hdr and c as fitting parameters their values were estimated by manual calibration based on the difference between the observed and calculated positions of the water table in each profile calculated as the sum of square errors ssq σ hobs hsim 2 where hobs and hsim are the observed and simulated elevations of the groundwater table hydrus 1d allows two options to incorporate the calculated flux qdr in the discrete form of the richards equation it can be added to the bottom node as a boundary condition in the strict sense or it can be distributed over all nodes below the groundwater table as a sink term the latter option seemed more consistent physically with the assumption of horizontal groundwater flow and was used in our simulations 3 5 estimation of specific yield we combined several approaches to derive a plausible range of specific yield values for our site including literature data johnson 1967 healy 2010 and the empirical formula of bieciński pazdro kozerski 1990 commonly used in poland which links sy to the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ks 6 s y 0 117 k s 7 where ks is given in m d in the above formula we used the estimate of ks in the sa2 layer in each profile finally we also estimated sy from hydrus 1d simulations with a lateral outflow boundary condition for each day of the simulation we calculated the volume of water in the lower section of the profile which contained fluctuating water table the zone included in the calculations stretched from the bottom of the profile to some height above the water table as discussed later assuming that the soil profile represents a column of 1 m2 cross section we express the volume of water as the equivalent water height hw in meters the specific yield syi for a given day i was calculated as 7 s yi δ h wi δ h i where δhwi is the daily change in water volume and δhi is the daily change in groundwater table position both quantities can be either positive for increasing water table or negative for decreasing water table the final value of sy was obtained as an average of syi for all days of the simulation period due to transient effects one can obtain syi negative or larger than soil porosity for some days these values were excluded from the calculation of the average sy some consideration is needed to choose the upper limit of the zone affected by the water table fluctuations which is the basis for calculating hw if the upper limit is too close to the water table it is in the capillary zone and the resulting sy is very small if it is too close to the soil surface sy is affected by surface infiltration and evapotranspiration which are unrelated to water table fluctuations a preliminary analysis for profile p1 showed that the results were relatively consistent if the upper limit of the calculation zone was set in the range from 1 m above the highest position of the water table in the profile to the bottom of the salo layer thus we set the upper limit of the zone for calculating sy 1 m above the highest position of the water table in each profile 3 6 water table fluctuation wtf analysis the wtf analysis was based on water level measurements in piezometers averaged for each day of the observation period the daily amount of recharge ri is calculated as 8 r i s y δ h i where sy is the specific yield and δhi greater than 0 is an increment in the groundwater table elevation caused by recharge occurring between day i 1 and i a range of sy values was obtained using the methods described in the previous section we applied two methods rise and mrc to calculate the increments δhi the rise method assumes that recharge only occurs if there is an increase in groundwater table elevation between two subsequent days so δhi hi hi 1 if hi hi 1 otherwise δhi 0 the mrc method assumes that in the absence of recharge the water table decreases daily by a specific amount δhmrci following the so called master recession curve mrc which represents in a simplified manner the discharge processes in the aquifer in particular the lateral outflow to nearby surface water bodies the groundwater table tends to decrease at a rate depending on its current position i e the higher the water table the faster the lowering rate heppner nimmo 2005 mrc provides a functional relationship between a daily decrement of the water table δhmrci and the water table elevation h i 1 in periods without recharge in this study we used the simplest linear mrc 9 δ h mrci a h i 1 b the coefficients a and b were fitted separately for each piezometer the fit was based on data from periods of continuous groundwater level decrease longer than two weeks more refined methods to estimate mrc are available heppner nimmo 2005 jie et al 2011 but we considered the approach described here as sufficiently accurate for the purposes of our study the daily increment of the water level due to recharge was then calculated as δhi hi hi 1 δhmrci if hi hi 1 δhmrci otherwise δhi 0 the decrement δhmrci taken as a positive number 4 results and discussion 4 1 weather data and measured groundwater levels figure 2 shows daily precipitation totals measured at the p2 observation point from april 15 2017 to april 15 2020 there is a significant difference between meteorological conditions during the three years of observation table 2 the one year period starting on april 15 2017 was exceptionally wet the amount of precipitation measured by a rain gauge at profile p2 open field reached 920 mm more than 150 of the long term average with a mean temperature equal to 8 2 c in contrast the one year period starting on april 15 2018 was unusually warm and dry with an average temperature of 10 2 c and precipitation of 462 mm the third year april 15 2019 april 14 2020 was warm 10 1 c but the rainfall total was slightly above average 670 4 mm y among the 36 months of the observation period 32 months had monthly temperatures higher than the long term average for the considered month based on long term 1951 2020 observation data from chojnice station ten months in the observation period were extremely warm within 5 of the warmest months in the years 1951 2020 yearly precipitation measured by the rain gauge in the forest p1 was 687 mm in the first year 321 mm in the second year and 501 mm in the third year indicating that average interception by the forest canopy was about 27 of yearly precipitation this is compatible with the range observed in pine woods in poland puchalski prusinkiewicz 1990 maximum and minimum daily values of pet calculated with the penman monteith equation are also presented in fig 2 the annual pet was the lowest in the first year starting on april 15 2017 between 521 3 and 610 1 mm while pet reached the highest values in the second year april 15 2018 april 14 2019 from 633 4 mm to 722 1 mm in the third year starting on april 15 2019 pet ranged between 591 4 mm and 676 5 mm the differences are caused mainly by different weather conditions during vegetative periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 in 2017 the vegetation period may october was relatively cold and rainy with an average temperature of 14 5 c and a precipitation amount of 682 mm in contrast in 2018 the vegetative period was extraordinarily warm and dry with an average temperature of about 16 5 c and a rainfall total of 234 mm more mild conditions were during the vegetation period in 2019 the mean temperature reached 15 5 c but the precipitation sum was 438 mm the measured values of volumetric soil water content are presented in figs 3 and 4 a distinct pattern of seasonal variability can be seen with wet periods apr 2017 apr 2018 oct 2018 apr 2019 oct 2019 apr 2020 and dry periods in apr oct 2018 and apr oct 2019 in the first year of observations there is an exceptionally long wet period with high water contents at all sensors which is not repeated in the subsequent drier years under the sandy loam layer water content fluctuations in the sa2 layer are generally much smaller than in the ts and sa1 layers in the salo layer the water content is significantly higher than in other layers due to finer soil texture the fluctuations in this layer are larger in forest profiles than in grassland profiles probably due to water uptake by deeper tree roots in dry periods a clear variability pattern can also be seen in water table elevations measured in four profiles fig 5 in the first wet year the groundwater table increased monotonically then it decreased reaching the lowest elevation in september 2019 and rose again in the last months of the observations during the long period of decline we can distinguish an interval with a relatively low decline rate in autumn winter 2018 19 corresponding to increased soil water contents in figs 3 and 4 in contrast during the vegetation periods in 2018 and 2019 apr oct we observe low soil water contents and a sharp groundwater table decline there are some breaks in water table measurements in p1 and p2 due to malfunctions of the sensors also the water table elevation in p2 is above the other three piezometers starting from mid 2018 which is probably caused by technical issues with the barodiver and the breaks in operation mentioned above different flow dynamics might have also played a role since p2 is the well farthest away from the lakes overall the soil moisture and groundwater table show strong seasonal and year to year variability related to large differences in annual precipitation and et 4 2 soil hydraulic characteristics and soil water contents parameters of the van genuchten model for all profiles and soil layers are summarized in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained from field measurements in the sa1 and sa2 layers does not differ substantially between the profiles with ks in sa2 consistently higher than in sa1 in p1 and p4 the topsoil is characterized by a lower hydraulic conductivity than the underlying sa1 sand layer in contrast ks in the salo layer obtained from inverse numerical solution shows significant differences between profiles with the lowest values in p1 and the highest in p2 different by a factor of about 500 in most cases the calibrated values of α and n were sensitive to the choice of lai which strongly influenced evapotranspiration however we obtained a similar fit quality in each of the eight scenarios reported as rmse in table 2 in terms of rmse the best fit was obtained for p2 and this is confirmed by a visual comparison of simulated and measured water contents in figs 3 and 4 on the other hand in p2 the pattern of water content evolution is different from other profiles since the water content is almost constant in the salo layer while in other locations it decreased significantly during the dry periods 4 3 recharge estimates from numerical simulations figure 6 shows annual and total 3 year recharge values obtained using the simulations with a constant water table position and the final calibrated sets of parameters in each scenario they differ significantly between the profiles and strongly depend on lai ranging from 263 mm in p4 with an lai of 5 47 to 839 mm in p2 with an lai of 1 71 in the three years for the lower lai estimates recharge can be even more than two times larger than for the upper lai estimate due to smaller interception and et there is a reasonable similarity in predictions for the two forest profiles p1 and p4 there is no overlap in the results for the two grass profiles with the lower estimate in p2 minimally exceeding the upper estimate in p3 in contrast the range calculated for p3 partly overlaps with the estimates for p1 and p4 there are also clear differences in the time distribution of the recharge flux arriving at the groundwater table four examples are shown in fig 7 in all cases recharge occurs mostly during the initial wet year of the observations however in p1 lai2 10 and p2 lai2 90 the flux increases and later decreases gradually over longer time periods while in p2 and p4 separate recharge events are clearly marked as peak flux values moreover in p2 relatively large fluxes occur in the second and third years of the observation period in p1 and p3 there is only small recharge in the second year and somewhat larger recharge in the last year finally in p4 there is practically no recharge in the second year and only a small flux in the last year these results are consistent with the differences in soil hydraulic parameters and lai between the simulations considering the whole 3 year period of observations the recharge precipitation ratio varies from 13 to 41 depending on the considered scenario note that despite such a wide variability the r p ratio falls within the range of values reported in table 1 since we obtained a reasonably good fit to the measured water content values in all cases additional information was required to reduce the uncertainty resulting from the variability of soil characteristics and the lack of precise data on evapotranspiration thus another series of simulations was carried out to reproduce the groundwater table s observed fluctuations and narrow the range of recharge predictions 4 4 water table fluctuations from numerical simulations the water table fluctuations obtained using numerical simulations with a lower boundary condition representing lateral outflow are shown in figs 8 and 9 in each case the best fit resulting from manual calibration of boundary condition parameters is presented the results were found to be quite sensitive to both hdr and c which facilitated their calibration hdr determined the average elevation of the water table while c influenced both the average elevation and amplitude of fluctuations fig 10 however the shape of the curve is determined by the distribution of recharge over time and it is not fundamentally affected by either hdr or ldr the agreement between the best fit and observations varied depending on the soil profile and lai the lowest ssq values 1 5 104 were obtained for p1 with an lai of 2 10 and p3 with an lai of 2 90 this is confirmed by a visual inspection of the plots which shows a relatively good agreement between observations and the model for most of the simulation period for p4 with an lai of 2 10 the ssq is only slightly larger 1 6 104 but the fit is clearly worse for the rising branch of the hydrogram corresponding to the initial wet period the largest ssq were obtained for p2 where the groundwater table measurements were probably inaccurate as discussed earlier while on the other hand the recharge estimates were higher than for other profiles for the forest profiles p1 and p4 the fit was better for the lower lai estimate 2 10 while for the grass profiles p2 and p3 it was better for the higher lai estimate 2 90 the results presented in figs 8 and 9 indicate that simulations for p1 and p4 with an lai of 2 10 and p3 with an lai of 2 90 provided recharge estimates which are most representative for our sites i e they are in the best agreement with the observed pattern of groundwater level fluctuations consequently total recharge in the observed period can be estimated to be between 501 and 573 mm a significantly narrower range than the one resulting from the first series of simulations the corresponding lai falls between 2 10 and 2 90 representing the upper estimates for grassland and lower estimates for pine forests the fitted values of conductance coefficient c fall in the range from 1 32 10 5 to 4 44 10 5 cm d 1 the corresponding theoretical distance between the observed profile and the lake half of the drain spacing can be calculated from eq 5 assuming the aquifer permeability kdr 3716 cm d an average value for the sa2 layer from table 2 the obtained distance is between 91 and 168 m this is in reasonable agreement with the real distances 30 m for p1 170 m for p2 70 m for p3 and 90 m for p4 note however that there is no clear relationship between the fitted c value and the real distance to the lake at a specific point 4 5 estimation of specific yield healy 2010 following johnson 1967 reports sy 0 21 for fine sands with the standard deviation 0 07 since ks estimates for sa2 are quite similar in each profile table 3 the empirical formula of bieciński eq 6 gives a narrow range of sy estimates 0 191 to 0 200 sy derived from the second series of numerical simulations with a fluctuating water table ranged from 0 229 p3 lai 1 71 to 0 300 p4 lai 2 10 with an average of 0 269 these results are consistent with the upper range of estimates given by healy 2010 which can be explained by the high uniformity of grain sizes in sa2 ultimately in the wtf analysis we used 0 200 and 0 280 as the lower and upper estimates of sy for our sites 4 6 recharge estimations using wtf the master recession curves for each profile are shown in fig 11 there is a considerable scatter between the points representing the relationship between the groundwater table elevation h and a daily decrement of the groundwater level δhmrc in each case it was possible to fit a linear trend showing an expected decrease of the absolute value of δhmrc with decreasing h but the results must be considered as highly approximate figure 12 presents groundwater table increments calculated using the rise and mrc methods for p3 both methods produce a similar pattern of recharge variability however in the mrc approach there are significantly more days with recharge and the estimated recharge rates are higher than in the rise method according to the mrc procedure recharge also occurs when there is a decline in the groundwater table but it is smaller than the decline resulting from the master recession curve this can be seen especially in the period from oct 2018 to apr 2019 characterized by a small decrease in the groundwater table as discharge to lakes is partly compensated for by recharge from infiltration recharge rates calculated for each profile using the rise and mrc methods and different estimates of sy are shown in fig 6 together with the results of numerical simulations discussed earlier several conclusions can be drawn from this comparison the estimates obtained using the mrc method are more than twice as large as those obtained using the rise method emphasizing the importance of including a recession curve in the analysis in most cases the results of numerical simulations are closer to mrc than to rise except for the second driest observation year where the opposite is true in this period recharge is low and thus sensitive to inaccuracies in the approximation of the recession curve considering the whole 3 year period we can notice a good agreement between the mrc method and the hydrus 1d simulations for the forest profiles p1 and p4 with the lower lai 2 10 and for the p3 profile grass with an lai of 2 90 the numerical results fall between the mrc estimates for low and high sy 410 mm to 606 mm in contrast the largest discrepancy between numerical modeling and the wtf analysis occurs for p2 in this case even for the highest value of specific yield the mrc estimate is significantly smaller than the lowest value obtained using the numerical model these observations further support the conclusions from section 4 4 that the simulations for p1 with a low lai and p3 with a high lai yield recharge patterns which are the most consistent with the observed groundwater level fluctuations while the largest incompatibility is observed for p2 the disagreement for p2 is probably caused by two overlapping effects increased local recharge due to the high permeability of the sandy loam layer and a possible malfunction of the water level sensor further cross validation of the wtf method and numerical modeling can be done following jie et al 2011 the sum of the water table increments calculated using the mrc approach for p1 is 2080 mm in the 3 year period while the corresponding recharge obtained using the hydrus 1d simulation with an lai of 2 10 is 571 mm this provides an estimate of sy 571 mm 2080 mm of 0 274 very close to the value calculated using the water balance in the numerical solution with lateral outflow 0 278 and within the range given by healy 2010 similarly for p3 the sum of increments is 2050 mm and the recharge estimate using hydrus lai 2 90 is 501 mm for sy 0 244 again this value is very close to the estimate derived directly from the numerical simulation with lateral outflow 0 233 this analysis increases the confidence in the recharge estimates provided by numerical simulations 4 7 time variability of recharge and a recharge precipitation ratio the presented results show that groundwater recharge is a time variable process and at least on a short time scale cannot be considered as steady state flow the time distribution of groundwater recharge is strongly determined by the intensity and distribution of precipitation abundant rainfalls in 2017 resulted in high inflow to the water table in autumn winter 2017 2018 on the contrary the drought in 2018 caused a drop in the water table and low percolation from the vadose zone to the aquifer in winter spring 2019 in the last year of the observations 2019 20 both precipitation and recharge were between the two earlier extreme years in table 4 we report annual and total recharge estimates based on three numerical simulations that were found to be the most representative for the study area p1 lai 2 10 p3 lai 2 90 p4 lai 2 10 the ratio of annual recharge between the first wet and second dry year of observations ranged from 3 1 p4 lai 2 10 to 7 5 p3 lai 2 90 the ratios obtained using wtf were smaller but still significant 2 3 to 3 6 in the rise method and 1 8 to 2 7 in the mrc method the time of the water table response to a single rain event depends on the thickness of the unsaturated zone soil type and vegetation since the magnitude of the water table rise is determined by the water content in the unsaturated zone the amount of precipitation during the preceding weeks plays a significant role dripps 2012 that is probably the reason why groundwater recharge following the storm at the end of june 2017 which occurred after wet months is so apparent on july 17 2018 even more abundant rainfalls 47 mm day took place however this event did not result in any response of the water table probably because of the dry preceding spring and summer some studies provide guidelines to estimate annual or multi year recharge in central europe as a specific fraction of precipitation depending on the soil type land cover and other factors dyck and chardebellas 1963 cited after hölting and coldewey 2019 duda et al 2011 hölting and coldewey 2019 provide an empirical formula for the annual recharge precipitation relationship based on an earlier study of dyck and chardabellas 1963 who summarized data from a large number of lysimeters 10 r 1 1 p δ p where p is annual precipitation and δp depends on soil and land cover for sandy soils with vegetation δp 433 mm and the corresponding results are shown in table 4 eq 10 provides recharge estimates significantly larger than the numerical simulations and wtf applied to our site except for the driest year for which the agreement is reasonable it should be noted that r in eq 10 corresponds to the drainage flux measured in lysimeters which can be significantly larger than recharge if there is a possibility of upward capillary flow or water uptake by plant roots from depths below the bottom of the lysimeter moreover eq 10 does not account for the presence of low permeability layers which was the case on our site another simple formula relating recharge to precipitation over annual or longer time scales is 11 r ω p where ω r p is the recharge precipitation ratio which depends on various factors pazdro kozerski 1990 suggested ω 0 25 to 0 3 for glacial and fluvioglacial sands such as those occurring on the brda outwash plain the r p ratio for the whole 3 year observation period obtained using numerical simulations 0 24 0 28 and from wtf mrc 0 20 0 30 is close to this estimate in the more recent study by duda et al 2011 ω was assumed to be a product of four partial coefficients ω αβ γδ representing the soil type α land cover β ground slope γ and depth to groundwater table δ the suggested α value for sandy deposits is 0 14 to 0 22 while β is 1 for grassland and 0 9 for forests in our case the factors γ and δ were equal to 1 because the terrain is relatively flat and the depth to the groundwater table is more than 2 m this gives a range of ω values from 0 14 to 0 22 for grassland and 0 13 to 0 20 for the forest the resulting recharge estimates are quite close to the numerical simulations and wtf mrc in the second dry and third average years while they are significantly lower in the first wet year and consequently also in terms of the total 3 year recharge the coefficients suggested by duda et al 2011 were inferred from the baseflow analysis for several polish rivers regional watershed scale recharge estimated from baseflow tends to be smaller than local scale estimations in areas with the groundwater table below the root zone because a part of recharged groundwater is lost to evapotranspiration in river valleys and wetlands before discharging to the river however recharge estimates for the region of our experimental site an upper brda river watershed hobot et al 2012 obtained from baseflow measurements are about 155 to 193 mm yr 26 to 33 of the average precipitation in chojnice which is in good agreement with the results of our numerical simulations an average of the 3 year period is 167 to 191 mm yr since the plant water demand does not change from one year to the other as much as precipitation the fraction of total precipitation reaching groundwater is smaller in dry years than in wet years kowalski 2007 this is consistent with the results of numerical simulations which indicate a much larger r p ratio for the wettest year 0 36 0 38 than the driest year 0 10 0 24 according to the wtf mrc method the variability of the r p ratio is smaller and the lowest r p ratio is in the third year representing average conditions between wet and dry years eq 10 predicts a very strong dependence of the r p ratio on precipitation which is not reflected in our results in contrast eq 11 provides a constant ratio ω r p i e the recharge is a fixed fraction of annual precipitation regardless of the actual amount of precipitation neither of these equations appeared adequate in our case however eq 11 seems to work reasonably well in dry or average years the increasing occurrence of extremely wet and dry periods along with temperature rise leading to higher evapotranspiration and shorter snow season are the main symptoms of climate change in central europe goudie 2006 ipcc 2021 which in turn affect groundwater recharge eg haidu and nistor 2019 jaworska szulc 2015 neukum and azzam 2012 our modeling approach seems to be a promising tool to evaluate recharge under different historical or future climate change scenarios gumuła kawęcka et al 2021 in particular it is possible to represent groundwater table fluctuations using a 1d variably saturated flow model if the parameters describing lateral outflow are known they can be obtained from limited time series of water table measurements and the model can be further enhanced by including time variable water level in the surface water body lake or stream 4 8 influence of plant cover it could be expected that recharge in a forest is smaller than in a grassland area due to higher interception by the tree canopy and the ability of tree roots to extract water from larger depths however there does not appear to be a universal relationship between recharge in forests and grasslands since it may depend on particular plant species according to dripps bradbury 2010 recharge under the coniferous forest was only slightly smaller than under grass cover grinevskii novoselova 2011 found that recharge under the forest was actually larger than under cropland in our simulations recharge depended strongly on lai on average recharge estimates for the grassland profiles were larger than for the forest profiles fig 6 because the assumed range of lai values was higher for the forest than for grassland despite a partial overlap however looking only at the three scenarios which showed the best agreement with the observed water table fluctuations we can see that recharge in the grassland profile p3 lai 2 9 was actually lower than in p1 or p4 with an lai of 2 1 this is a consequence of our choice of lai values for the simulations with the upper estimate for grass higher than the lower estimate for pine forest as explained in section 3 3 our results emphasize the need for accurate estimations of lai however identification of actual lai values in the study area and their possible evolution in time was outside the scope of the present work in contrast wtf did not show significant differences in recharge between grassland and forest profiles the results of the wtf method are affected by the land cover in a larger area not only in the close vicinity of the monitoring well forests are intermixed with open grasslands crop fields and small built up regions in our study area consequently water table fluctuations in both monitoring wells showed a similar pattern representing average recharge 5 conclusion this study highlights the need to use multiple methods and observation periods to increase confidence in recharge estimations especially given the increasing occurrence of extremely wet and dry periods in temperate climate zone in our approach numerical simulations of vertical flow in the vadose zone were combined with the analysis of water table fluctuations we showed how these two methods could inform and cross validate each other using a modified boundary condition in numerical simulations one can check if the vadose zone model is consistent with the observed groundwater table fluctuations an additional benefit is the calculation of specific yield from the simulation results the specific yield can be later used in the wtf mrc analysis to see if the recharge estimates are consistent with those obtained from simulations one can note a conceptual similarity between the numerical simulations with the modified bottom boundary condition and the master recession curve mrc approach in both cases the aim is to include lateral groundwater flow in the analysis of point scale observations in this way we can obtain a more accurate description of the vadose zone groundwater interactions without the need to solve more complex 2d or 3d models the incorporation of groundwater level observations in vadose zone models significantly reduces the uncertainty in recharge estimations our results showed that soil water measurements alone are insufficient to constrain the models especially if there is no detailed data on evapotranspiration in view of the significant year to year variability of precipitation and recharge numerical simulations and wtf should preferably be applied on longer time scales to achieve meaningful recharge estimations in numerical simulations it is important to use a warm up period with realistic weather data to accurately reproduce the initial state of soil water further research is warranted on the combined use of 1d numerical models and wtf in particular there is a need to investigate other analytical formulas describing the lateral outflow boundary condition and to develop tools for calibrating their parameters jointly with the calibration of soil hydraulic parameters and or et related parameters we believe that the approach presented here can be used to improve recharge estimates in unconfined aquifers over a wide range of geological and hydrological settings

3718,groundwater level time series are of great value for a variety of groundwater studies particularly for those dealing with the impacts of anthropogenic and climate change quality control of groundwater level observations is an essential step prior to any further application e g trend analysis often the quality control of data is limited to the removal of outliers or elimination of entire time series from a dataset while such approaches drastically reduce the spatial coverage of initially huge datasets frequently studies tend to present already quality controlled data but neglect to demonstrate how the data were selected judged and modified we present a data rescue approach developed for correcting the latvian national groundwater level database containing 1 68 million groundwater level observations since 1959 including 0 69 million manual measurements a web based r shiny interface was developed and used for visual identification and manual correction of erroneous measurements in groundwater level time series all data manipulations were performed programmatically reproducibility and traceability were ensured by deploying separate data tables for raw observations data repair actions and the final dataset as a result of applied actions 34 3 of all automatic measurements were either deleted or corrected while only 6 5 of manual measurements were edited commonly found errors in groundwater level time series were grouped into errors in measurement and data recording technical problems at the observation site local anthropogenic impact and other unclassified problems the improvement from the rescue approach was assessed by comparing the akaike information criterion derived from fitted arma and arima models to both original and repaired time series the results showed that models fitted using repaired time series were better than those fitted on the original time series for the same time series sections the presented rescue approach and results can be of great value for all studies using groundwater level time series as an input keywords groundwater level time series visual inspection monitoring arima models 1 introduction groundwater globally ensures water supply ecosystem functioning and human well being and the overall importance is expected to grow as groundwater is more buffered from seasonal and multi year climate variability than surface water unesco 2015 2020 increasing groundwater demand to supply drinking water agriculture and industry in combination with climate change has highlighted the importance of groundwater protection eea 2018 naranjo fernández et al 2020 obergfell et al 2019 witte et al 2019 timely detection of negative groundwater level trends is crucial to make appropriate decisions and ensure sustainable groundwater management bakker and schaars 2019 lehr and lischeid 2020 while reliable information on groundwater levels is a prerequisite prior any groundwater resources assessment ritzema et al 2018 time series analysis can be of a great value for groundwater studies bikše and retike 2018 jarsjö et al 2020 marandi et al 2012 noorduijn et al 2019 however such analysis requires availability of measured heads sometimes also measured or estimated forcings e g rainfall evaporation water pumping for sufficiently long observation periods around the world groundwater levels are measured in observation wells for a variety of reasons for instance monitoring of long term changes assessment of seasonal variations or evaluation of response to a particular stress igrac 2020 thus the spatial coverage and density of monitoring networks is uneven bakker and schaars 2019 in addition observation periods and frequencies vary and time series may contain essential gaps asgharinia and petroselli 2020 various data pre selection criteria have been applied in previous studies depending on the research aim and scale zaadnoordijk et al 2019 proposed to use an 8 year long observation period with a minimum of 84 measurements for adequate time series models reflecting the dynamics of the current groundwater system similar results were obtained by heudorfer et al 2019 who tested sensitivity of various indexes to changes of observed period location and time series length in general a higher sensitivity was observed in indices calculated on weekly rather than daily time series while a coinciding drop in sensitivity for both daily and weekly indices could be observed when the length of time series reached 8 years while haaf and barthel 2018 applied 10 year observation length criteria with a minimum weekly measurement frequency to capture multi annual and decadal periodicities in groundwater signal for the assessment of the impact of groundwater use on groundwater droughts wendt et al 2020 used a dataset of 30 year time series from which they removed all series with more than 6 consecutive months of missing observations stoll et al 2011 used a criterion of at least a 30 year long time series with a monthly temporal resolution to detect groundwater response to climatic variations and chen et al 2004 used a 15 to nearly 40 years long time series to study the historic relationship between groundwater levels and climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation often groundwater levels have been monitored for decades resulting in an extensive number of time series berendrecht and van geer 2016 quality control of the data is an essential first step prior to any further application e g in time series analysis the presence of various errors such as outliers shift and drift require evaluation of each time series zaadnoordijk et al 2019 post and von asmuth 2013 point out that the most common sources of error due to the actual measurement processes are related to the measurement instruments the conversion from pressure to heads time lag effects and defects of observation wells also data processing errors e g typing errors duplicates generally account for a large proportion of errors in databases kandel et al 2011 liu et al 2018 post and von asmuth 2013 consequently groundwater level time series usually contain missing values including those which are a result of error and outlier removal there are several methods used to deal with missing data in groundwater level time series asgharinia and petroselli 2020 von asmuth et al 2002 wendt et al 2020 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 however analysis of series with a constant time step between subsequent measurements is easier and computationally less demanding e g post and von asmuth 2013 for this reason it may be beneficial to fill in missing values although filling large gaps remains a challenge oikonomou et al 2018 and using a mixture of measured and modeled values gives additional challenges in the assignment of an accuracy to the values therefore time series with gaps are often removed from further analysis leading to significant reduction of the dataset wendt et al 2020 data preprocessing is the most time consuming and at the same time the least documented phase in the data analysis pipeline which may strongly affect the quality of study results bernard et al 2019 kandel et al 2011 van den broeck et al 2005 temporal aggregation can level out some random errors while new errors might be introduced if such data are used in further calculations ritzema et al 2018 the application of fully automatic data quality control procedures is often limited by the uncertainty of errors and the need for an expert judgement to verify the results ali et al 2019 liu et al 2018 as concluded by haaf and barthel 2018 a visual inspection of groundwater level time series remains a valuable and necessary task in order to understand the data despite some shortcomings that should be taken into account visual inspection and manual correction based on the expert judgment might be time consuming subjective and hard to replicate naranjo fernández et al 2020 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 yet it is simple to apply and widely used asgharinia and petroselli 2020 avotniece et al 2017 haaf and barthel 2018 as human eye is very sensitive to spot differences in visual looks barthel et al 2021 differentiation between actual quality issues and unusual however valid data values requires human interaction gschwandtner and erhart 2018 for instance haaf and barthel 2018 categorize sudden or continuous changes in groundwater level time series that are hard to explain by natural factors as irregular using visual inspection suspicious cases can be checked using various accompanying data such as meteorological conditions or known local anthropogenic influences but the prerequisite for a good assessment is a sufficient understanding of the study area and evaluation results may vary among experts ritzema et al 2018 lehr and lischeid 2020 propose a method to identify potential measurement errors and anthropogenic influence using stable principal components pcs of all groundwater head series to calculate reference hydrograph that incorporates general patterns from pcs but any deviation from actual observations indicates potential errors however the method requires observations measured at the same time intervals thus limiting applicability to often irregularly obtained measurements in addition the authors also suggest that visual inspection should be included in the workflow of groundwater level time series assessment several interactive data quality control procedures integrating humans into the data treatment process are found to be useful to improve data quality however such approaches are task specific and difficult to apply for other types of data liu et al 2018 as pointed out by bernard et al 2019 there is no single definition of clean data and it depends on the application which risks are associated with including wrong or excluding right measurements likewise the assessment is not straightforward whether and how much the correction has improved the data models like autoregressive moving average arma and its integrated variant arima can be used as an approximation to describe the complex fluctuation patterns of groundwater levels using only one variable the groundwater level itself adamowski and chan 2011 arima models are frequently used to forecast time series in various disciplines including hydrogeology ahn 2000 shirmohammadi et al 2013 patle et al 2015 mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 gibrilla et al 2018 the performance of time series models can be evaluated by akaike s information criteria aic akaike 1974 which is a relative metric typically used to select the best model created from the same dataset for the assessment of data quality there are not models with different structures using the same data but models with the same structure using the same data the original and repaired time series so now the aic can be seen as a metric for the data quality and can be used to assess the improvement of the data due to the corrections an important purpose of the data cleaning is to improve or make possible analysis of long term structural changes in groundwater level time series given the data quality issues anthropogenic changes are more difficult or even impossible to detect barthel et al 2021 both anthropogenic changes and data errors deteriorate the performance of the ar i ma time series models the increased performance of the ar i ma models indicates that the dataset is adequate for example to calibrate a physically based distributed groundwater model for the entire country or a large region with the aim to forecast climate change impacts on groundwater tactic 2021 in such models it is neither feasible nor relevant to include historic short term groundwater abstractions and other anthropogenic influences on groundwater time series modelling can be used to select appropriate long term groundwater level series for such a calibration zaadnoordijk and bakker 2013 in this paper we present a data rescue approach and repair results for systematic groundwater level observations collected in the latvian national database from 1959 till 2019 a visual assessment procedure exploiting a web based interface was developed for identification and manual correction of erroneous measurements in groundwater level time series all data manipulations were performed programmatically ensuring reproducibility and traceability of the work we have identified a number of errors commonly present in groundwater level time series and proposed type specific data rescue actions finally the improvement of time series after applied corrections was quantified by derivation of the akaike information criterion from fitted arma and arima models to both the original and repaired groundwater level time series presented approach and results can be of great value for studies using groundwater level time series as an input 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area latvia is located in north eastern europe and lies in the central part of the baltic artesian basin the present topography is shaped mostly by multiple advances and retreats of pleistocene ice sheets and the action of baltic sea the elevation varies from few meters below the sea level up to 312 m above the sea level kalm and gorlach 2014 the thickness of the sedimentary cover varies from 500 m in the northern part increasing up to 2 km in the southwestern part lukševičs et al 2012 layering of the bedrock sequence is subhorizontal slightly inclining towards southwest direction brangulis and kaņevs 2002 therefore middle devonian sandstones siltstones dolomites and clays are exposed in the bedrock surface in the northern part of the territory while in the southern part the bedrock surface exposes carbonate and terrigenous sequences of upper devonian and mostly terrigenous mesozoic deposits lukševičs et al 2012 overlying quaternary deposits are composed of interlayers of glacial glacifluvial and glaciolimnic sediments with the thickness of a few meters in lowland areas increasing up to 200 m in uplands particularly in central and eastern part of latvia zelčs et al 2011 within latvia three hydrodynamically and hydrochemically distinct zones separated by regional aquitards or aquicludes are delineated stagnation zone ediacaran cambrian aquifer complex with brines passive water exchange zone lower and middle devonian aquifer complex with brackish groundwater and active water exchange zone freshwater aquifers jodkazis 1989 levins et al 1998 lukševičs et al 2012 have explicitly described geological setting of the study area while more details on hydrogeological conditions can be found in babre et al 2016 and retike et al 2016 studies this study puts an emphasis on the active water exchange zone of aquifers corresponding to the middle and upper devonian as well as quaternary which are mainly used for water supply in latvia only 6 of the 612 groundwater level time series belong to the passive water exchange zone and none to the stagnation zone climate in latvia is characterized by its location in the transition zone between continental and maritime conditions the country lies in the north western part of the eurasian continent but at the same time is strongly affected by maritime climate impacts associated with the proximity to the atlantic ocean prevailing westerlies and strong cyclonic activity determine a highly variable weather pattern with precipitation dominating over evaporation distinct seasonality is characteristic air temperature below zero c and snow accumulation are common in the cold season seasonality is also evident in groundwater level patterns in shallow aquifers two groundwater level maxima occur one in spring which is associated with snowmelt water infiltration and one in autumn early winter september december induced by increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration tolstovs et al 1986 usually groundwater level minima can be observed in late summer and winter kalvāns et al 2020 but a minimum can be absent in mild winters lauva et al 2012 2 2 evolution of groundwater level monitoring network in latvia the main objective of groundwater monitoring in latvia is to ensure good quality and sufficient quantity of groundwater resources which has not changed over the past hundred years however specific objectives of the groundwater monitoring have changed over time mainly due to the available funding existing regulations and political framework the first systematic groundwater observations can be dated back to the end of the 19th century but observation sites were few and the monitoring initiatives were short term the establishment of a systematic national groundwater monitoring network started in 1953 with the first regular observations performed since 1959 fig 1 the initial network in 1959 consisted of 15 observation wells organized into 4 monitoring stations wells were mostly installed in unconfined aquifers the number rapidly expanded to include new well fields around the largest cities and to carry out monitoring in vicinities around newly built hydroelectric power plants in the early 1970s around 130 new wells were installed to examine waterlogged soil conditions in agricultural lands in the end of 1975 the groundwater monitoring network had 227 wells grouped into 30 monitoring stations jankins et al 1993 levina and levins 1994 since 1976 the national groundwater monitoring network has had two principal branches regional and local monitoring regional networks consisted of transects of monitoring stations each with multiple wells following groundwater flow lines from recharge to discharge areas local monitoring networks addressed specific issues at large groundwater abstraction sites hydroelectric power plants open pit mains or heavily contaminated sites observation frequency ranged from a few times a year up to 10 times per month most groundwater level measurements were made manually jankins et al 1993 between 1992 and 1993 after the collapse of the soviet union and subsequent decrease in funding many wells were removed from the groundwater monitoring programs jankins et al 1993 some monitoring wells were excluded from the monitoring network due to observation well defects i e clogging of the well screen or leaks due to faulty joints also a lack of proper legislation resulted in landowners denying access or even demolishing monitoring wells installed on private lands meanwhile the first digital groundwater database was established and was continuously expanded in the following years by adding observations by the state geological survey and its successor latvian environment geology and meteorology centre legmc since 1999 the monitoring programme has been adapted in line with the eu water framework directive eu 2000 most recent and largest establishment of new wells and installation of automatic loggers recording water level twice a day happened from 2010 until 2012 until now the automatic level measurements are accompanied by 2 to 4 manual observations per year for verification purposes in 2019 groundwater monitoring was carried out in 301 wells grouped into 60 monitoring stations see fig 2 the database contains observations from altogether 612 wells from 74 stations it is important to note that observations periods for wells and stations differ therefore not all wells and stations have been exploited simultaneously 2 3 the dataset and its repair procedure a groundwater observation dataset was obtained upon a request from the latvian environment geology and meteorology centre legmc https videscentrs lvgmc lv it included raw groundwater level time series of 612 wells grouped into 74 monitoring stations from 1959 to 2019 as well as coordinates well depths screen intervals and represented aquifers the groundwater level was recorded in meters below soil surface in case of automatic measurements barometric pressure and temperature was available in total 1 68 million groundwater head records were gathered in the database from which 0 69 million 41 were manual observations and 0 99 million 59 were automatic measurements the frequency of manual observations ranged from several readings per week to few times a year whereas automatic recordings were performed twice a day automatic measurements were accompanied by occasional manual groundwater head observations for verification purposes as pointed out by post and von asmuth 2013 it is a standard practice to determine possible deviations and provide means to correct errors according to kandel et al 2011 datasets usually contain some proportion of errors and zaadnoordijk et al 2019 highlight that assessment of each time series is crucial before being used in further analysis the observations in the legmc database were recorded without any quality or consistency screening thus a workflow was set up for pre processing of groundwater level time series see fig 3 main steps of data processing and repair were defined first the data were imported and merged into an sql database then visual error screening was performed and any necessary data manipulations were coded into the sql data table lastly a final repaired dataset was generated automatically using the repair instructions corrected groundwater level time series together with the information about applied corrections were returned to the data maintainer legmc for further usage in groundwater management potential errors in groundwater level time series were identified by conventional methods i e visually the four eyes principle nihei et al 2002 was used thus each time series was reviewed by two experts having distinct roles corrector and controller the task of the corrector was visual inspection of the groundwater level time series via a custom made r shiny application in order to identify problems and determine necessary corrections fig 3 i and ii in case of doubts the corrector initiated team discussion in a dedicated online chat to reach an agreement by all members of a group how the case should be treated fig 3 iii if corrections were necessary the corrector introduced repair instructions in the designated sql table suggesting either to delete an observation or modify it by changing its value using basic mathematical operators next the controller examined the decisions made by the corrector fig 3 iv and double checked for errors in a designated shared spreadsheet the corrector received comments whether the controller has approved or declined corrections or any further action was suggested final decision whether to implement or reject the controller suggestions was made by the corrector as suggested by rau et al 2019 the original data raw groundwater level measurements were left intact and stored alongside the repaired data and all applied manipulations were coded in an sql table and carefully documented in a separate spreadsheet it was done to ensure the traceability and repeatability of the work a chat platform set up for team members to share and discuss problematic cases gradually built up and harmonized the collective expertise moreover the accumulated archive was especially useful to train new team members 2 4 iterative development of a web based r shiny application for visual data assessment an interactive web based interface was implemented in r the r statistical programming language version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 to assist the visual analysis of groundwater level time series an iterative programming approach was adapted and new features were added as soon as they were necessary open source shiny server version 1 5 12 chang et al 2020 was used to publish the application on a local server the application incorporated several tools to ease error identification and data repair table 1 plotly package version 4 9 2 sievert 2020 was used to create interactive figures wickham et al 2019 allowing the user to zoom in for more detailed analysis or to precisely identify an observation of interest using well number and observation timestamp the code of the developed application has been published on zenodo bikše et al 2021 the main window of a web based application contains inputs to select specific well or change plot parameters and outputs that show general information for the selected well fig 4 a all tools are described in table 1 and plotting options can be changed in the upper part of the application fig 4 a the interactive application is supplemented also by a data table showing original data as a table from database as well as simple statistics about the number of observations the station wells plot tool will typically be used when the abrupt change plot tool indicates a sudden change a sudden rise of the groundwater level can be due to extreme precipitation events vidon 2012 or anthropogenic recharge events while short extraction events will lower the level especially of confined groundwater such events will also affect nearby well in a similar manner berendrecht and van geer 2016 the sudden change usually is not found in other wells in case of a data error in such a case there often is a sudden change of the opposite sign later in the time series e g fig 4 b 2 5 the assessment through ar i ma models arma and arima models box and jenkins 1976 were made for the original and repaired time series in order to assess the improvement of applied data rescue actions the performance of each model was evaluated by akaike s information criteria aic akaike 1974 the structure of the arima model for each original series and the corresponding repaired time series were the same so the aic difference is a proxy for the improvement of the repaired time series the autoregressive ar part of the arima explains current value as a linear function of past observation s according to order p while the moving average ma part uses white noise random error in the past observations order q to linearly predict a current value the integrated i part in the order of d removes trends and seasonality to make time series stationary differencing box and jenkins 1976 the integrated part in arima is necessary to deal with non stationary time series whereas stationary time series with constant mean level and no trend can be modelled by arma models combined ar and ma parts a model can be represented as arima p d q where p d q are orders of the ar i and ma processes arma 1 1 and arima 1 1 1 models were fitted to both original and repaired time series and aic values were retrieved from each model time series combination for evaluation purposes the stats package version 3 6 3 from r r core team 2020 was used to fit the models and to calculate the aic calculation a time step of one day was used and larger time step were filled in with linear interpolation between observations however original time series were split in sections when observation gaps longer than 6 months were detected similar to the approach of the wendt et al 2020 and at least 8 years long sections as proposed by zaadnoordijk et al 2019 were retained for the assessment finally the aic values retrieved from original and repaired time series models were compared the model with the lowest aic value implies a better model fit to the data in this study we compared aic values derived from the same model type but performed on original and repaired time series thus for a given model type and time series section two derived aic values indicated whether a repaired time series resulted in a better fitting model or not we used a difference between aic derived from the original and repaired time series and used this δaic value for comparison needs as a result positive δaic values indicate a better model that has been fitted to the repaired time series section and vice versa we used three categories of δaic values no change absolute smaller than the threshold improvement δaic larger than the threshold and decrease δaic smaller than the negative value of the threshold the 25th percentile of all absolute δaic values was used as the threshold 3 results and discussion 3 1 data treatment according to the cause of errors the main problems identified in the groundwater level time series were grouped according to their potential cause errors in measurement and data recording table 2 technical problems at the observation site table 3 local anthropogenic impact and other unclassified problems table 4 the errors are supplemented by illustrative examples from visual analysis figs 5 7 the proposed data treatment for the identified problem categories was based on an extensive summary of the applied repair actions by correctors additionally confidence levels were added to indicate reliability of expert judgement and applied decisions distinct errors caused by data entry and actual measurements group 1 were relatively easy to identify with high confidence by visual inspection of the time series kandel et al 2011 in case of few errors the false data points were removed fig 5 a however if there were longer time periods with automatic measurements that deviated from previous and following data and manual measurements if available by a constant then these were shifted to fit into the whole time series fig 5 b and d these deviated time periods were likely bound to the misplaced level loggers after well sampling rau et al 2019 emphasize that frequent removal of loggers e g for data download or water sampling may cause the wire length to change due to kinks also the logger may not always be returned to the same position accompanying manual measurements were mostly assumed to be the correct ones thus serving as a reference point to shift the mismatching observations fig 5 b and d the typical pattern of the automatic measurements was considered when longer periods of manual and automatic measurements did not coincide fig 5 c then the automatic measurements were assumed as the correct ones and erroneous manual measurements were deleted in case of a constant offset between the manual and automatic measurements fig 5 e the level of the manual measurements was preferred and the automatic measurements were shifted when a time series of only manual measurements consisted of seemingly two separate sets of measurements either one set was selected based on expert judgement or data were left intact for cases when deviations were small fig 5 f however uncertainty prevails over the two previously described correction actions availability of both automatic and manual measurements in parallel usually accounted for high confidence of the applied corrections as it was clear which records and had to be moved according to post and von asmuth 2013 while rau et al 2019 suggest performing regular checkups of the performance and adjustment of automatic level loggers at least once in 3 months the frequency of verification in the latvian groundwater level database was not regular and ranged from 2 to 4 times a year the confidence level of decisions decreased when there was no reference indicating which of the observation group is the correct one fig 5 e and f the site visit with control measurement could resolve such issues if the time series are continued until present the second group of errors consists of technical problems with automatic data loggers and piezometers as stated by rau et al 2019 sensor drift is one of the most common errors in automatic level measurements a pattern of continuous drift of automatic logger data was identified fig 6 a in a few unrelated wells we concluded that this pattern illustrated malfunction of the automatic level loggers therefore these drifting measurements were removed errors due to the inadequately installed wells and misplaced measurement equipment also belong to this group for example seasonally elevated groundwater levels exceeding the top of the well heads or freezing of the water in the well head could prohibit taking correct measurement by the tape and resulted in a plateau like pattern of peak groundwater table fig 6 b groundwater level can rise above the top of the well head also due to the long term groundwater recovery from intensive aquifer exploitation which was the case presented in fig 6 c the well is located near the coastal city liepāja an area that historically has been affected by extensive groundwater pumping but currently the levels have recovered bikše and retike 2018 thus stressing the importance of regular field site maintenance in such cases automatic level loggers recorded plateau like measurements that did not indicate true water level rau et al 2019 similar negative plateau like groundwater level patterns fig 6 e can be a result of a shallow well screen during the dry season the groundwater level drops below the screen interval while the water leftovers below the screen is recorded usually the lowest recorded water level coincides with screen bottom when the water table dropped below the depth of the sensor installed in the well fig 6 d a plateau like pattern was identified such observation periods were excluded from groundwater level time series ha et al 2021 have observed a similar plateau like pattern caused by water abstraction induced groundwater level drawdown the zoom in functionality of the developed application allowed to spot even minor impacts of freezing and thawing of barometric loggers which later created bias in groundwater level measurements fig 6 f according to ritzema et al 2018 the difference between day and night temperatures can account for the level deviations of several centimeters while liu and higgins 2015 emphasized that sensors should be protected from temperatures below freezing point to avoid errors and logger breakdown ensure the pressure transducer is protected from temperatures below the freezing point in general identification of technical problems remained straightforward because of their specific patterns the third group consists of measurements which are not representative of the groundwater head for the purpose of monitoring natural groundwater head fluctuations influence of direct pumping from the monitoring well e g sampling for water quality was easy to spot fig 7 a and to eliminate as the starting timestamp of such an event matched the time of manual control observation usually manual control measurements download of level logger readings and water sampling were made at the same time due to the cost efficiency similar groundwater level fluctuations due to well pumping are presented in ha et al 2021 a group of other anthropogenic pressures responsible for misleading records were identified with the help of the developed application and its functionality to show nearby objects on a map pumping fig 7 b or recharge fig 7 c effects in the nearby wells or vicinity often had a particular pattern such as peaks on mondays or sundays or during certain seasons chen et al 2004 observed alike patterns caused by seasonal groundwater pumping in the study area similarly ha et al 2021 reported notable groundwater level drops in summer months because of intensive groundwater abstraction for irrigation while rau et al 2019 identified similar sharp groundwater level responses in the observation well caused by nearby pumping activities which are frequent but irregular and stressed that the typical twice a day measurement interval fails to capture such short term variations visual data assessment tools table 1 fig 4 eased the identification of anthropogenic influences and facilitated the decision making by fast and simple evaluation process of supplementary data and level changes in nearby wells likewise wendt et al 2020 removed unrealistic observations which after verification with metadata were not explained our aim for the data quality control and correction was to rescue groundwater level time series for further modeling of groundwater drought events however the decision whether to eliminate such data or apply corrections strongly depends on the future usage study of near natural conditions or human induced changes the fourth group contains other errors such as sudden changes in groundwater patterns fig 7 d e and f which most likely were associated with data processing errors such as mixed id numbers between wells or false measurements however extreme changes in groundwater level patterns have been also reported by barthel et al 2021 as a result of dam construction where the influence lessened in the observation wells further from reservoir to distinguish between errors or untypical still true groundwater patterns two tools in the developed application for visual data assessment were particularly useful first the map tool that allowed to see the location of well and nearby objects such as dams and second the station well plots that allowed to see if similar changes can be observed in nearby wells identification of such patterns was less straightforward and applied corrections involved more expert judgment the decision whether to delete suspicious records or apply repair action depended on the number of suspicious records and the importance of the time series spatial representativity of monitoring point and length of dataset in total the whole data correction process took approximately 325 man hours including 280 man hours for the correctors data correction and 45 man hours for the controllers fig 3 3 2 repair outcomes in total 612 groundwater level time series in the latvian national database were assessed according to the proposed procedure fig 3 and to 536 or 88 of the series corrections or deletions in line with the proposed repair actions table 2 4 were applied in 196 or 32 of all time series more than ten percent of the initial groundwater level observations were modified to compare using conventional approach exclusion of all time series with at least one identified error only 76 from initial 612 time series could be retained moreover the retained 76 time series would cover a time period of 9832 months while our approach retained 605 time series covering 150124 months for the automatic measurements repair actions modified the groundwater levels from 0 10 to 0 42 m first and third quartile while for the manual observations from 0 66 to 0 17 m first and third quartile in extreme cases introduced repair actions modified groundwater level for more than a few meters in total 5 3 of 0 99 million automatic measurements were deleted while 29 were corrected and 3 9 of the 0 69 million manual measurements were deleted whereas 2 6 were corrected fig 8 a larger proportion of the applied corrections and deletions was associated with the most recent observations and especially with automatic measurements the frequency of manual observations was much lower thus distinct outliers or data processing errors accounted for most errors automatic level measurements usually did not have isolated errors outliers if a problem occurred e g misplaced or broken logger the logger continued to record false observations until the next visit by the operator usually 2 4 times a year in case of a broken logger the problem was identified only after data screening at the office usually once a year it is assumed that errors in automatic level measurements observed soon after their installation are the result of misplaced loggers while in recent years the influence of equipment aging particularly malfunctioning of the automatic groundwater level loggers can be observed as a continuous increase of the applied corrections von asmuth 2010 points out that in several groundwater monitoring networks up to half of the sensors should be replaced because of malfunctioning over time and similarly this study highlights the need for replacement of most currently operational automatic level loggers in the latvian groundwater monitoring network in addition the repair procedure itself contributes to the increase because the historical or earlier measurements were frequently considered to be the correct ones thus the recent observations were adjusted to the historical measurements and resulted in more repairs in the recent observations the groundwater monitoring in latvia was strongly influenced from 2009 until 2013 by reduced funding and negative effects of the global economic crisis it is suspected that turn over of employees of the institutions responsible for groundwater monitoring insufficient funding for observation site maintenance poor training of new employees and lack of detailed monitoring guidelines have resulted in deterioration of data quality especially for the manual observations 3 3 quantification of data quality improvement out of the 612 groundwater level time series in the original dataset 605 time series had at least a single observation left after data was repaired and were used to fit ar i ma models time series were separated in sections if gaps larger than 6 months were detected this resulted in 1377 time series sections that were modelled individually only 590 individual time series sections from 494 unique wells were longer than 8 years while the rest of section were discarded from further modelling for these sections arma 1 1 and arima 1 1 1 models were fitted to both the original and repaired time series arima 1 1 1 and arma 1 1 models could be fitted to 523 and 483 sections respectively for the rest of the 590 sections the model failed to fit to either the original or the repaired series or both generally the models fitted using repaired time series were better models than those fitted on the original time series for the same time series sections fig 9 a majority of assessed time series shows significantly better aic if repaired time series are used to fit models instead of original ones while 22 8 and 22 4 time series shows insignificant changes in aic for the arima and arma models respectively fig 10 the aic was worse after the repair for 2 29 arima and 2 69 arma of the time series 4 conclusions long and continuous groundwater level time series are of great value but they usually contain errors which should be corrected prior to any further application we propose a data rescue approach which was applied to the latvian national groundwater level database containing 612 wells comprising 1 68 million groundwater level observations since 1959 we developed web based interactive tools for visual assessment of time series and manual correction of errors implementation of the four eye principle and documentation of all applied manipulations separately from the raw data ensured traceability and repeatability of the work errors were attributed to possible causes and the confidence level of the error repair actions was assigned high medium or low the identified errors were grouped into errors caused by data recordings and measurements technical problems at the observation site local anthropogenic impact and other unclassified problems the akaike information criterion derived from fitted arma and arima models to both original and repaired time series demonstrated substantial improvement of consistency of most time series after applying proposed data rescue approach the presented

3718,groundwater level time series are of great value for a variety of groundwater studies particularly for those dealing with the impacts of anthropogenic and climate change quality control of groundwater level observations is an essential step prior to any further application e g trend analysis often the quality control of data is limited to the removal of outliers or elimination of entire time series from a dataset while such approaches drastically reduce the spatial coverage of initially huge datasets frequently studies tend to present already quality controlled data but neglect to demonstrate how the data were selected judged and modified we present a data rescue approach developed for correcting the latvian national groundwater level database containing 1 68 million groundwater level observations since 1959 including 0 69 million manual measurements a web based r shiny interface was developed and used for visual identification and manual correction of erroneous measurements in groundwater level time series all data manipulations were performed programmatically reproducibility and traceability were ensured by deploying separate data tables for raw observations data repair actions and the final dataset as a result of applied actions 34 3 of all automatic measurements were either deleted or corrected while only 6 5 of manual measurements were edited commonly found errors in groundwater level time series were grouped into errors in measurement and data recording technical problems at the observation site local anthropogenic impact and other unclassified problems the improvement from the rescue approach was assessed by comparing the akaike information criterion derived from fitted arma and arima models to both original and repaired time series the results showed that models fitted using repaired time series were better than those fitted on the original time series for the same time series sections the presented rescue approach and results can be of great value for all studies using groundwater level time series as an input keywords groundwater level time series visual inspection monitoring arima models 1 introduction groundwater globally ensures water supply ecosystem functioning and human well being and the overall importance is expected to grow as groundwater is more buffered from seasonal and multi year climate variability than surface water unesco 2015 2020 increasing groundwater demand to supply drinking water agriculture and industry in combination with climate change has highlighted the importance of groundwater protection eea 2018 naranjo fernández et al 2020 obergfell et al 2019 witte et al 2019 timely detection of negative groundwater level trends is crucial to make appropriate decisions and ensure sustainable groundwater management bakker and schaars 2019 lehr and lischeid 2020 while reliable information on groundwater levels is a prerequisite prior any groundwater resources assessment ritzema et al 2018 time series analysis can be of a great value for groundwater studies bikše and retike 2018 jarsjö et al 2020 marandi et al 2012 noorduijn et al 2019 however such analysis requires availability of measured heads sometimes also measured or estimated forcings e g rainfall evaporation water pumping for sufficiently long observation periods around the world groundwater levels are measured in observation wells for a variety of reasons for instance monitoring of long term changes assessment of seasonal variations or evaluation of response to a particular stress igrac 2020 thus the spatial coverage and density of monitoring networks is uneven bakker and schaars 2019 in addition observation periods and frequencies vary and time series may contain essential gaps asgharinia and petroselli 2020 various data pre selection criteria have been applied in previous studies depending on the research aim and scale zaadnoordijk et al 2019 proposed to use an 8 year long observation period with a minimum of 84 measurements for adequate time series models reflecting the dynamics of the current groundwater system similar results were obtained by heudorfer et al 2019 who tested sensitivity of various indexes to changes of observed period location and time series length in general a higher sensitivity was observed in indices calculated on weekly rather than daily time series while a coinciding drop in sensitivity for both daily and weekly indices could be observed when the length of time series reached 8 years while haaf and barthel 2018 applied 10 year observation length criteria with a minimum weekly measurement frequency to capture multi annual and decadal periodicities in groundwater signal for the assessment of the impact of groundwater use on groundwater droughts wendt et al 2020 used a dataset of 30 year time series from which they removed all series with more than 6 consecutive months of missing observations stoll et al 2011 used a criterion of at least a 30 year long time series with a monthly temporal resolution to detect groundwater response to climatic variations and chen et al 2004 used a 15 to nearly 40 years long time series to study the historic relationship between groundwater levels and climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation often groundwater levels have been monitored for decades resulting in an extensive number of time series berendrecht and van geer 2016 quality control of the data is an essential first step prior to any further application e g in time series analysis the presence of various errors such as outliers shift and drift require evaluation of each time series zaadnoordijk et al 2019 post and von asmuth 2013 point out that the most common sources of error due to the actual measurement processes are related to the measurement instruments the conversion from pressure to heads time lag effects and defects of observation wells also data processing errors e g typing errors duplicates generally account for a large proportion of errors in databases kandel et al 2011 liu et al 2018 post and von asmuth 2013 consequently groundwater level time series usually contain missing values including those which are a result of error and outlier removal there are several methods used to deal with missing data in groundwater level time series asgharinia and petroselli 2020 von asmuth et al 2002 wendt et al 2020 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 however analysis of series with a constant time step between subsequent measurements is easier and computationally less demanding e g post and von asmuth 2013 for this reason it may be beneficial to fill in missing values although filling large gaps remains a challenge oikonomou et al 2018 and using a mixture of measured and modeled values gives additional challenges in the assignment of an accuracy to the values therefore time series with gaps are often removed from further analysis leading to significant reduction of the dataset wendt et al 2020 data preprocessing is the most time consuming and at the same time the least documented phase in the data analysis pipeline which may strongly affect the quality of study results bernard et al 2019 kandel et al 2011 van den broeck et al 2005 temporal aggregation can level out some random errors while new errors might be introduced if such data are used in further calculations ritzema et al 2018 the application of fully automatic data quality control procedures is often limited by the uncertainty of errors and the need for an expert judgement to verify the results ali et al 2019 liu et al 2018 as concluded by haaf and barthel 2018 a visual inspection of groundwater level time series remains a valuable and necessary task in order to understand the data despite some shortcomings that should be taken into account visual inspection and manual correction based on the expert judgment might be time consuming subjective and hard to replicate naranjo fernández et al 2020 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 yet it is simple to apply and widely used asgharinia and petroselli 2020 avotniece et al 2017 haaf and barthel 2018 as human eye is very sensitive to spot differences in visual looks barthel et al 2021 differentiation between actual quality issues and unusual however valid data values requires human interaction gschwandtner and erhart 2018 for instance haaf and barthel 2018 categorize sudden or continuous changes in groundwater level time series that are hard to explain by natural factors as irregular using visual inspection suspicious cases can be checked using various accompanying data such as meteorological conditions or known local anthropogenic influences but the prerequisite for a good assessment is a sufficient understanding of the study area and evaluation results may vary among experts ritzema et al 2018 lehr and lischeid 2020 propose a method to identify potential measurement errors and anthropogenic influence using stable principal components pcs of all groundwater head series to calculate reference hydrograph that incorporates general patterns from pcs but any deviation from actual observations indicates potential errors however the method requires observations measured at the same time intervals thus limiting applicability to often irregularly obtained measurements in addition the authors also suggest that visual inspection should be included in the workflow of groundwater level time series assessment several interactive data quality control procedures integrating humans into the data treatment process are found to be useful to improve data quality however such approaches are task specific and difficult to apply for other types of data liu et al 2018 as pointed out by bernard et al 2019 there is no single definition of clean data and it depends on the application which risks are associated with including wrong or excluding right measurements likewise the assessment is not straightforward whether and how much the correction has improved the data models like autoregressive moving average arma and its integrated variant arima can be used as an approximation to describe the complex fluctuation patterns of groundwater levels using only one variable the groundwater level itself adamowski and chan 2011 arima models are frequently used to forecast time series in various disciplines including hydrogeology ahn 2000 shirmohammadi et al 2013 patle et al 2015 mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 gibrilla et al 2018 the performance of time series models can be evaluated by akaike s information criteria aic akaike 1974 which is a relative metric typically used to select the best model created from the same dataset for the assessment of data quality there are not models with different structures using the same data but models with the same structure using the same data the original and repaired time series so now the aic can be seen as a metric for the data quality and can be used to assess the improvement of the data due to the corrections an important purpose of the data cleaning is to improve or make possible analysis of long term structural changes in groundwater level time series given the data quality issues anthropogenic changes are more difficult or even impossible to detect barthel et al 2021 both anthropogenic changes and data errors deteriorate the performance of the ar i ma time series models the increased performance of the ar i ma models indicates that the dataset is adequate for example to calibrate a physically based distributed groundwater model for the entire country or a large region with the aim to forecast climate change impacts on groundwater tactic 2021 in such models it is neither feasible nor relevant to include historic short term groundwater abstractions and other anthropogenic influences on groundwater time series modelling can be used to select appropriate long term groundwater level series for such a calibration zaadnoordijk and bakker 2013 in this paper we present a data rescue approach and repair results for systematic groundwater level observations collected in the latvian national database from 1959 till 2019 a visual assessment procedure exploiting a web based interface was developed for identification and manual correction of erroneous measurements in groundwater level time series all data manipulations were performed programmatically ensuring reproducibility and traceability of the work we have identified a number of errors commonly present in groundwater level time series and proposed type specific data rescue actions finally the improvement of time series after applied corrections was quantified by derivation of the akaike information criterion from fitted arma and arima models to both the original and repaired groundwater level time series presented approach and results can be of great value for studies using groundwater level time series as an input 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area latvia is located in north eastern europe and lies in the central part of the baltic artesian basin the present topography is shaped mostly by multiple advances and retreats of pleistocene ice sheets and the action of baltic sea the elevation varies from few meters below the sea level up to 312 m above the sea level kalm and gorlach 2014 the thickness of the sedimentary cover varies from 500 m in the northern part increasing up to 2 km in the southwestern part lukševičs et al 2012 layering of the bedrock sequence is subhorizontal slightly inclining towards southwest direction brangulis and kaņevs 2002 therefore middle devonian sandstones siltstones dolomites and clays are exposed in the bedrock surface in the northern part of the territory while in the southern part the bedrock surface exposes carbonate and terrigenous sequences of upper devonian and mostly terrigenous mesozoic deposits lukševičs et al 2012 overlying quaternary deposits are composed of interlayers of glacial glacifluvial and glaciolimnic sediments with the thickness of a few meters in lowland areas increasing up to 200 m in uplands particularly in central and eastern part of latvia zelčs et al 2011 within latvia three hydrodynamically and hydrochemically distinct zones separated by regional aquitards or aquicludes are delineated stagnation zone ediacaran cambrian aquifer complex with brines passive water exchange zone lower and middle devonian aquifer complex with brackish groundwater and active water exchange zone freshwater aquifers jodkazis 1989 levins et al 1998 lukševičs et al 2012 have explicitly described geological setting of the study area while more details on hydrogeological conditions can be found in babre et al 2016 and retike et al 2016 studies this study puts an emphasis on the active water exchange zone of aquifers corresponding to the middle and upper devonian as well as quaternary which are mainly used for water supply in latvia only 6 of the 612 groundwater level time series belong to the passive water exchange zone and none to the stagnation zone climate in latvia is characterized by its location in the transition zone between continental and maritime conditions the country lies in the north western part of the eurasian continent but at the same time is strongly affected by maritime climate impacts associated with the proximity to the atlantic ocean prevailing westerlies and strong cyclonic activity determine a highly variable weather pattern with precipitation dominating over evaporation distinct seasonality is characteristic air temperature below zero c and snow accumulation are common in the cold season seasonality is also evident in groundwater level patterns in shallow aquifers two groundwater level maxima occur one in spring which is associated with snowmelt water infiltration and one in autumn early winter september december induced by increased precipitation and low evapotranspiration tolstovs et al 1986 usually groundwater level minima can be observed in late summer and winter kalvāns et al 2020 but a minimum can be absent in mild winters lauva et al 2012 2 2 evolution of groundwater level monitoring network in latvia the main objective of groundwater monitoring in latvia is to ensure good quality and sufficient quantity of groundwater resources which has not changed over the past hundred years however specific objectives of the groundwater monitoring have changed over time mainly due to the available funding existing regulations and political framework the first systematic groundwater observations can be dated back to the end of the 19th century but observation sites were few and the monitoring initiatives were short term the establishment of a systematic national groundwater monitoring network started in 1953 with the first regular observations performed since 1959 fig 1 the initial network in 1959 consisted of 15 observation wells organized into 4 monitoring stations wells were mostly installed in unconfined aquifers the number rapidly expanded to include new well fields around the largest cities and to carry out monitoring in vicinities around newly built hydroelectric power plants in the early 1970s around 130 new wells were installed to examine waterlogged soil conditions in agricultural lands in the end of 1975 the groundwater monitoring network had 227 wells grouped into 30 monitoring stations jankins et al 1993 levina and levins 1994 since 1976 the national groundwater monitoring network has had two principal branches regional and local monitoring regional networks consisted of transects of monitoring stations each with multiple wells following groundwater flow lines from recharge to discharge areas local monitoring networks addressed specific issues at large groundwater abstraction sites hydroelectric power plants open pit mains or heavily contaminated sites observation frequency ranged from a few times a year up to 10 times per month most groundwater level measurements were made manually jankins et al 1993 between 1992 and 1993 after the collapse of the soviet union and subsequent decrease in funding many wells were removed from the groundwater monitoring programs jankins et al 1993 some monitoring wells were excluded from the monitoring network due to observation well defects i e clogging of the well screen or leaks due to faulty joints also a lack of proper legislation resulted in landowners denying access or even demolishing monitoring wells installed on private lands meanwhile the first digital groundwater database was established and was continuously expanded in the following years by adding observations by the state geological survey and its successor latvian environment geology and meteorology centre legmc since 1999 the monitoring programme has been adapted in line with the eu water framework directive eu 2000 most recent and largest establishment of new wells and installation of automatic loggers recording water level twice a day happened from 2010 until 2012 until now the automatic level measurements are accompanied by 2 to 4 manual observations per year for verification purposes in 2019 groundwater monitoring was carried out in 301 wells grouped into 60 monitoring stations see fig 2 the database contains observations from altogether 612 wells from 74 stations it is important to note that observations periods for wells and stations differ therefore not all wells and stations have been exploited simultaneously 2 3 the dataset and its repair procedure a groundwater observation dataset was obtained upon a request from the latvian environment geology and meteorology centre legmc https videscentrs lvgmc lv it included raw groundwater level time series of 612 wells grouped into 74 monitoring stations from 1959 to 2019 as well as coordinates well depths screen intervals and represented aquifers the groundwater level was recorded in meters below soil surface in case of automatic measurements barometric pressure and temperature was available in total 1 68 million groundwater head records were gathered in the database from which 0 69 million 41 were manual observations and 0 99 million 59 were automatic measurements the frequency of manual observations ranged from several readings per week to few times a year whereas automatic recordings were performed twice a day automatic measurements were accompanied by occasional manual groundwater head observations for verification purposes as pointed out by post and von asmuth 2013 it is a standard practice to determine possible deviations and provide means to correct errors according to kandel et al 2011 datasets usually contain some proportion of errors and zaadnoordijk et al 2019 highlight that assessment of each time series is crucial before being used in further analysis the observations in the legmc database were recorded without any quality or consistency screening thus a workflow was set up for pre processing of groundwater level time series see fig 3 main steps of data processing and repair were defined first the data were imported and merged into an sql database then visual error screening was performed and any necessary data manipulations were coded into the sql data table lastly a final repaired dataset was generated automatically using the repair instructions corrected groundwater level time series together with the information about applied corrections were returned to the data maintainer legmc for further usage in groundwater management potential errors in groundwater level time series were identified by conventional methods i e visually the four eyes principle nihei et al 2002 was used thus each time series was reviewed by two experts having distinct roles corrector and controller the task of the corrector was visual inspection of the groundwater level time series via a custom made r shiny application in order to identify problems and determine necessary corrections fig 3 i and ii in case of doubts the corrector initiated team discussion in a dedicated online chat to reach an agreement by all members of a group how the case should be treated fig 3 iii if corrections were necessary the corrector introduced repair instructions in the designated sql table suggesting either to delete an observation or modify it by changing its value using basic mathematical operators next the controller examined the decisions made by the corrector fig 3 iv and double checked for errors in a designated shared spreadsheet the corrector received comments whether the controller has approved or declined corrections or any further action was suggested final decision whether to implement or reject the controller suggestions was made by the corrector as suggested by rau et al 2019 the original data raw groundwater level measurements were left intact and stored alongside the repaired data and all applied manipulations were coded in an sql table and carefully documented in a separate spreadsheet it was done to ensure the traceability and repeatability of the work a chat platform set up for team members to share and discuss problematic cases gradually built up and harmonized the collective expertise moreover the accumulated archive was especially useful to train new team members 2 4 iterative development of a web based r shiny application for visual data assessment an interactive web based interface was implemented in r the r statistical programming language version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 to assist the visual analysis of groundwater level time series an iterative programming approach was adapted and new features were added as soon as they were necessary open source shiny server version 1 5 12 chang et al 2020 was used to publish the application on a local server the application incorporated several tools to ease error identification and data repair table 1 plotly package version 4 9 2 sievert 2020 was used to create interactive figures wickham et al 2019 allowing the user to zoom in for more detailed analysis or to precisely identify an observation of interest using well number and observation timestamp the code of the developed application has been published on zenodo bikše et al 2021 the main window of a web based application contains inputs to select specific well or change plot parameters and outputs that show general information for the selected well fig 4 a all tools are described in table 1 and plotting options can be changed in the upper part of the application fig 4 a the interactive application is supplemented also by a data table showing original data as a table from database as well as simple statistics about the number of observations the station wells plot tool will typically be used when the abrupt change plot tool indicates a sudden change a sudden rise of the groundwater level can be due to extreme precipitation events vidon 2012 or anthropogenic recharge events while short extraction events will lower the level especially of confined groundwater such events will also affect nearby well in a similar manner berendrecht and van geer 2016 the sudden change usually is not found in other wells in case of a data error in such a case there often is a sudden change of the opposite sign later in the time series e g fig 4 b 2 5 the assessment through ar i ma models arma and arima models box and jenkins 1976 were made for the original and repaired time series in order to assess the improvement of applied data rescue actions the performance of each model was evaluated by akaike s information criteria aic akaike 1974 the structure of the arima model for each original series and the corresponding repaired time series were the same so the aic difference is a proxy for the improvement of the repaired time series the autoregressive ar part of the arima explains current value as a linear function of past observation s according to order p while the moving average ma part uses white noise random error in the past observations order q to linearly predict a current value the integrated i part in the order of d removes trends and seasonality to make time series stationary differencing box and jenkins 1976 the integrated part in arima is necessary to deal with non stationary time series whereas stationary time series with constant mean level and no trend can be modelled by arma models combined ar and ma parts a model can be represented as arima p d q where p d q are orders of the ar i and ma processes arma 1 1 and arima 1 1 1 models were fitted to both original and repaired time series and aic values were retrieved from each model time series combination for evaluation purposes the stats package version 3 6 3 from r r core team 2020 was used to fit the models and to calculate the aic calculation a time step of one day was used and larger time step were filled in with linear interpolation between observations however original time series were split in sections when observation gaps longer than 6 months were detected similar to the approach of the wendt et al 2020 and at least 8 years long sections as proposed by zaadnoordijk et al 2019 were retained for the assessment finally the aic values retrieved from original and repaired time series models were compared the model with the lowest aic value implies a better model fit to the data in this study we compared aic values derived from the same model type but performed on original and repaired time series thus for a given model type and time series section two derived aic values indicated whether a repaired time series resulted in a better fitting model or not we used a difference between aic derived from the original and repaired time series and used this δaic value for comparison needs as a result positive δaic values indicate a better model that has been fitted to the repaired time series section and vice versa we used three categories of δaic values no change absolute smaller than the threshold improvement δaic larger than the threshold and decrease δaic smaller than the negative value of the threshold the 25th percentile of all absolute δaic values was used as the threshold 3 results and discussion 3 1 data treatment according to the cause of errors the main problems identified in the groundwater level time series were grouped according to their potential cause errors in measurement and data recording table 2 technical problems at the observation site table 3 local anthropogenic impact and other unclassified problems table 4 the errors are supplemented by illustrative examples from visual analysis figs 5 7 the proposed data treatment for the identified problem categories was based on an extensive summary of the applied repair actions by correctors additionally confidence levels were added to indicate reliability of expert judgement and applied decisions distinct errors caused by data entry and actual measurements group 1 were relatively easy to identify with high confidence by visual inspection of the time series kandel et al 2011 in case of few errors the false data points were removed fig 5 a however if there were longer time periods with automatic measurements that deviated from previous and following data and manual measurements if available by a constant then these were shifted to fit into the whole time series fig 5 b and d these deviated time periods were likely bound to the misplaced level loggers after well sampling rau et al 2019 emphasize that frequent removal of loggers e g for data download or water sampling may cause the wire length to change due to kinks also the logger may not always be returned to the same position accompanying manual measurements were mostly assumed to be the correct ones thus serving as a reference point to shift the mismatching observations fig 5 b and d the typical pattern of the automatic measurements was considered when longer periods of manual and automatic measurements did not coincide fig 5 c then the automatic measurements were assumed as the correct ones and erroneous manual measurements were deleted in case of a constant offset between the manual and automatic measurements fig 5 e the level of the manual measurements was preferred and the automatic measurements were shifted when a time series of only manual measurements consisted of seemingly two separate sets of measurements either one set was selected based on expert judgement or data were left intact for cases when deviations were small fig 5 f however uncertainty prevails over the two previously described correction actions availability of both automatic and manual measurements in parallel usually accounted for high confidence of the applied corrections as it was clear which records and had to be moved according to post and von asmuth 2013 while rau et al 2019 suggest performing regular checkups of the performance and adjustment of automatic level loggers at least once in 3 months the frequency of verification in the latvian groundwater level database was not regular and ranged from 2 to 4 times a year the confidence level of decisions decreased when there was no reference indicating which of the observation group is the correct one fig 5 e and f the site visit with control measurement could resolve such issues if the time series are continued until present the second group of errors consists of technical problems with automatic data loggers and piezometers as stated by rau et al 2019 sensor drift is one of the most common errors in automatic level measurements a pattern of continuous drift of automatic logger data was identified fig 6 a in a few unrelated wells we concluded that this pattern illustrated malfunction of the automatic level loggers therefore these drifting measurements were removed errors due to the inadequately installed wells and misplaced measurement equipment also belong to this group for example seasonally elevated groundwater levels exceeding the top of the well heads or freezing of the water in the well head could prohibit taking correct measurement by the tape and resulted in a plateau like pattern of peak groundwater table fig 6 b groundwater level can rise above the top of the well head also due to the long term groundwater recovery from intensive aquifer exploitation which was the case presented in fig 6 c the well is located near the coastal city liepāja an area that historically has been affected by extensive groundwater pumping but currently the levels have recovered bikše and retike 2018 thus stressing the importance of regular field site maintenance in such cases automatic level loggers recorded plateau like measurements that did not indicate true water level rau et al 2019 similar negative plateau like groundwater level patterns fig 6 e can be a result of a shallow well screen during the dry season the groundwater level drops below the screen interval while the water leftovers below the screen is recorded usually the lowest recorded water level coincides with screen bottom when the water table dropped below the depth of the sensor installed in the well fig 6 d a plateau like pattern was identified such observation periods were excluded from groundwater level time series ha et al 2021 have observed a similar plateau like pattern caused by water abstraction induced groundwater level drawdown the zoom in functionality of the developed application allowed to spot even minor impacts of freezing and thawing of barometric loggers which later created bias in groundwater level measurements fig 6 f according to ritzema et al 2018 the difference between day and night temperatures can account for the level deviations of several centimeters while liu and higgins 2015 emphasized that sensors should be protected from temperatures below freezing point to avoid errors and logger breakdown ensure the pressure transducer is protected from temperatures below the freezing point in general identification of technical problems remained straightforward because of their specific patterns the third group consists of measurements which are not representative of the groundwater head for the purpose of monitoring natural groundwater head fluctuations influence of direct pumping from the monitoring well e g sampling for water quality was easy to spot fig 7 a and to eliminate as the starting timestamp of such an event matched the time of manual control observation usually manual control measurements download of level logger readings and water sampling were made at the same time due to the cost efficiency similar groundwater level fluctuations due to well pumping are presented in ha et al 2021 a group of other anthropogenic pressures responsible for misleading records were identified with the help of the developed application and its functionality to show nearby objects on a map pumping fig 7 b or recharge fig 7 c effects in the nearby wells or vicinity often had a particular pattern such as peaks on mondays or sundays or during certain seasons chen et al 2004 observed alike patterns caused by seasonal groundwater pumping in the study area similarly ha et al 2021 reported notable groundwater level drops in summer months because of intensive groundwater abstraction for irrigation while rau et al 2019 identified similar sharp groundwater level responses in the observation well caused by nearby pumping activities which are frequent but irregular and stressed that the typical twice a day measurement interval fails to capture such short term variations visual data assessment tools table 1 fig 4 eased the identification of anthropogenic influences and facilitated the decision making by fast and simple evaluation process of supplementary data and level changes in nearby wells likewise wendt et al 2020 removed unrealistic observations which after verification with metadata were not explained our aim for the data quality control and correction was to rescue groundwater level time series for further modeling of groundwater drought events however the decision whether to eliminate such data or apply corrections strongly depends on the future usage study of near natural conditions or human induced changes the fourth group contains other errors such as sudden changes in groundwater patterns fig 7 d e and f which most likely were associated with data processing errors such as mixed id numbers between wells or false measurements however extreme changes in groundwater level patterns have been also reported by barthel et al 2021 as a result of dam construction where the influence lessened in the observation wells further from reservoir to distinguish between errors or untypical still true groundwater patterns two tools in the developed application for visual data assessment were particularly useful first the map tool that allowed to see the location of well and nearby objects such as dams and second the station well plots that allowed to see if similar changes can be observed in nearby wells identification of such patterns was less straightforward and applied corrections involved more expert judgment the decision whether to delete suspicious records or apply repair action depended on the number of suspicious records and the importance of the time series spatial representativity of monitoring point and length of dataset in total the whole data correction process took approximately 325 man hours including 280 man hours for the correctors data correction and 45 man hours for the controllers fig 3 3 2 repair outcomes in total 612 groundwater level time series in the latvian national database were assessed according to the proposed procedure fig 3 and to 536 or 88 of the series corrections or deletions in line with the proposed repair actions table 2 4 were applied in 196 or 32 of all time series more than ten percent of the initial groundwater level observations were modified to compare using conventional approach exclusion of all time series with at least one identified error only 76 from initial 612 time series could be retained moreover the retained 76 time series would cover a time period of 9832 months while our approach retained 605 time series covering 150124 months for the automatic measurements repair actions modified the groundwater levels from 0 10 to 0 42 m first and third quartile while for the manual observations from 0 66 to 0 17 m first and third quartile in extreme cases introduced repair actions modified groundwater level for more than a few meters in total 5 3 of 0 99 million automatic measurements were deleted while 29 were corrected and 3 9 of the 0 69 million manual measurements were deleted whereas 2 6 were corrected fig 8 a larger proportion of the applied corrections and deletions was associated with the most recent observations and especially with automatic measurements the frequency of manual observations was much lower thus distinct outliers or data processing errors accounted for most errors automatic level measurements usually did not have isolated errors outliers if a problem occurred e g misplaced or broken logger the logger continued to record false observations until the next visit by the operator usually 2 4 times a year in case of a broken logger the problem was identified only after data screening at the office usually once a year it is assumed that errors in automatic level measurements observed soon after their installation are the result of misplaced loggers while in recent years the influence of equipment aging particularly malfunctioning of the automatic groundwater level loggers can be observed as a continuous increase of the applied corrections von asmuth 2010 points out that in several groundwater monitoring networks up to half of the sensors should be replaced because of malfunctioning over time and similarly this study highlights the need for replacement of most currently operational automatic level loggers in the latvian groundwater monitoring network in addition the repair procedure itself contributes to the increase because the historical or earlier measurements were frequently considered to be the correct ones thus the recent observations were adjusted to the historical measurements and resulted in more repairs in the recent observations the groundwater monitoring in latvia was strongly influenced from 2009 until 2013 by reduced funding and negative effects of the global economic crisis it is suspected that turn over of employees of the institutions responsible for groundwater monitoring insufficient funding for observation site maintenance poor training of new employees and lack of detailed monitoring guidelines have resulted in deterioration of data quality especially for the manual observations 3 3 quantification of data quality improvement out of the 612 groundwater level time series in the original dataset 605 time series had at least a single observation left after data was repaired and were used to fit ar i ma models time series were separated in sections if gaps larger than 6 months were detected this resulted in 1377 time series sections that were modelled individually only 590 individual time series sections from 494 unique wells were longer than 8 years while the rest of section were discarded from further modelling for these sections arma 1 1 and arima 1 1 1 models were fitted to both the original and repaired time series arima 1 1 1 and arma 1 1 models could be fitted to 523 and 483 sections respectively for the rest of the 590 sections the model failed to fit to either the original or the repaired series or both generally the models fitted using repaired time series were better models than those fitted on the original time series for the same time series sections fig 9 a majority of assessed time series shows significantly better aic if repaired time series are used to fit models instead of original ones while 22 8 and 22 4 time series shows insignificant changes in aic for the arima and arma models respectively fig 10 the aic was worse after the repair for 2 29 arima and 2 69 arma of the time series 4 conclusions long and continuous groundwater level time series are of great value but they usually contain errors which should be corrected prior to any further application we propose a data rescue approach which was applied to the latvian national groundwater level database containing 612 wells comprising 1 68 million groundwater level observations since 1959 we developed web based interactive tools for visual assessment of time series and manual correction of errors implementation of the four eye principle and documentation of all applied manipulations separately from the raw data ensured traceability and repeatability of the work errors were attributed to possible causes and the confidence level of the error repair actions was assigned high medium or low the identified errors were grouped into errors caused by data recordings and measurements technical problems at the observation site local anthropogenic impact and other unclassified problems the akaike information criterion derived from fitted arma and arima models to both original and repaired time series demonstrated substantial improvement of consistency of most time series after applying proposed data rescue approach the presented

3719,many dammed rivers throughout the world have experienced frequent harmful algal blooms habs in the context of climate change and anthropogenic activities accurate forecasting of algal parameters i e algal cell density and microcystin concentration has great practical significance for taking precautions against habs risks long short term memory lstm networks have recently shown potential in predicting water quality parameters however there is still little known about the robustness of the lstm in forecasting highly time resolved measurement of algal parameters this study developed a hybrid deep learning architecture xg lstm composed of one xgboost module and two parallel lstm models to predict algal cell density and microcystin concentration in the three gorges reservoir tgr the proposed model was validated by in situ multi sensor system monitoring data at four bloom impacted tributaries in the tgr each modelling process utilized the antecedent information of the algal parameters and the corresponding environmental variables as inputs for forecasting the algal parameters for the coming hours and days as expected the presented model achieved better performance than those without special feature extraction procedures providing that the use of selected environmental parameters can improve lstm performance in addition the hybrid xg lstm model successfully captured the time series patterns of both algal cell density and microcystin concentration compared with other data driven models further suggesting the reliable utilization of this model in early warnings of bloom toxicity thus the results presented demonstrate the potential of deep learning technology for real time prediction of algal parameters in the tgr and possibly for rapid detection of developing habs in other aquatic ecosystems keywords harmful algal bloom real time monitoring long short term memory network microcystin three gorges reservoir 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs resulting from an excess of nutrients have become a severe environmental problem in rivers worldwide because of dam construction huisman et al 2018 maavara et al 2020 compared to eutrophication in relatively static water bodies algal blooms could cause more severe consequences at a larger scale along rivers reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 xia et al 2020 nevertheless accurate habs forecasting in large river systems presents great challenges because these areas have heterogeneous and complex hydrodynamic characteristics anthropogenic manipulation and climate related change huang et al 2020 yang et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on the causes and consequences of habs but no persuasive conclusions have been drawn based on traditional algae monitoring campaigns and statistical analysis asnaghi et al 2017 jochimsen et al 2013 therefore there remains a need for fast cost effective and online monitoring together with advanced modelling approaches to disentangle the underlying trends from the complicated pattern of river algal blooms events thomas et al 2018 thomson laing et al 2020 cell density or the number of phytoplankton cells per unit volume is an essential parameter characterizing a phytoplankton community but this analysis usually requires manual sampling and laboratory procedures by contrast the in situ chlorophyll a chla fluorescence approach can rapidly present all phytoplankton biomass and therefore has been widely applied to measure diagnostic pigments yang et al 2019 for instance several commercial fluorescence sensors can be integrated with other sensors e g measuring physicochemical variables and provide more massive datasets to train models and learn inherent habs patterns petchey et al 2015 nevertheless choosing appropriate parameters in forecasting the phytoplankton communities remains challenging under changing hydrological conditions page et al 2018 concomitantly projecting hab toxin may be of greater interest to drinking water authorities than biomass estimates hu et al 2016 singh et al 2015 shan et al 2019a recent research has tried to estimate toxins various congeners of microcystin by integrating different monitoring and prediction techniques including satellite remote sensing in situ observations and statistical modelling shan et al 2020 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2020 the concentrations of microcystin mc were linked to the measured chla concentrations based on simple statistical models yuan and pollard 2019 to the best of our knowledge there is currently no suitable model available for predicting the temporal dynamics of bloom toxicity the existing modelling frameworks of algal parameters forecasts have fallen into two categories mechanistic modelling and data driven approach the mechanistic approaches describe the phytoplankton growth and outbreak processes reynolds and irish 1997 wallace and hamilton 2000 mechanistic models are mainly used for predicting spatial movement rather than time series changes for instance the process based models give the present location and extent of habs from satellite imagery then predict short term dynamics using a hydrodynamic model and future meteorological conditions rowe et al 2016 wynne et al 2011 in practice these complicated models are always time consuming to calibrate parameters as an alternative the fast development in monitoring technologies has continuously expanded resources for ecological data collection xiao et al 2017 the data intensive methods have been rapidly developed and applied for short term forecasts of habs including artificial neural network ann chen et al 2015 evolutionary computation recknagel et al 2017 support vector machine svm shen et al 2019 and random forest tong et al 2019 unlike traditional physical models the absence of mechanical processes does not necessarily lead to the failure of these data driven methods however in situ monitoring data from multi sensor systems is characteristic of highly time resolved variations bai et al 2020 whereas most data driven models are not explicitly designed for time series tasks so they cannot effectively learn the hidden rules behind the monitoring data zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 with the advancement of artificial intelligence the long short term memory lstm a type of recurrent neural network rnn has recently shown great potential in predicting water quality sensor collected parameters for instance barzegar et al 2020 have developed lstm based on sensor collected data at 15 min intervals to predict dissolved oxygen do and the results of the model successfully captured both the low and high levels of the do concentrations qiu et al 2021 have demonstrated that lstm outperforms several data driven models for predicting mean daily water temperature wt in rivers moreover the lstm has also received increasing attention for predicting the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton shin et al 2019 used the lstm based on satellite surface temperature data and photosynthetically available radiation to predict margalefidinium polykrikoides bloom successfully yu et al 2020 combined wavelet analysis with lstm to predict chla concentration taking fifteen water quality parameters of dianchi lake as a research object and the results showed that the model has good prediction performance in the present study a vast amount of in situ multi sensor monitoring data was generated by on site buoys at four bloom impacted tributaries in the three gorges reservoir tgr online platforms provide high frequency monitoring information to employ data driven models profitably zamyadi et al 2016 nevertheless little is known about the robustness of the lstm in forecasting highly time resolved algal parameters it has been found that the combination of lstm and other machine learning algorithms can be helpful to develop accurate predictive models barzegar et al 2020 considering the trade off between the costs and benefits of sensor collected parameters we hypothesized that integrating special feature extraction procedures into lstm may enhance predictive performance the extreme gradient boosting xgboost as one of the decision tree learning techniques proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 has recently gained popularity as a winning solution in machine learning competitions therefore this study proposes a hybrid deep learning architecture xg lstm to test our hypothesis composed of one xgboost module and two parallel lstm the goals of this paper are threefold 1 identify the main environmental drivers of algal parameters at four studied tributaries 2 achieve accurate forecasting of algal parameters for the incoming hours and days and 3 provide a scientific basis for model selection and habs management in the tgr 2 research area and data 2 1 study sites the three gorges dam on the yangtze river one of the largest hydropower projects in china has brought enormous socio economic benefits including electricity generation flood control navigation and others gao et al 2018 xia et al 2018 the three gorges reservoir covers approximately 1084 km2 when the water level reaches 175 m fig 1 the average annual temperature precipitation and wind speed in the tgr region are 17 6 c 1122 5 mm and 1 3 m s respectively the water level regulation fluctuates markedly within one year with a minimum of 145 m during the flood period may to september and a maximum of 175 m during the impounding stage october to february of the following year drastic fluctuations of water level regulation in tgr affect the water quality variation in tributaries xiang et al 2021 since the initial impoundment in june 2003 the dam construction has resulted in substantial hydrological alterations in the tributary bays such as decreased flow velocity extended water retention time and stratified water temperature in addition the tributary has also shown symptoms of human induced nutrient enrichment driven by increasing urbanization and industrialization li et al 2019 consequently the most noticeable symptom is the increasing algal blooms found along the tributary backwaters chuo et al 2019 furthermore habs problems have tended to be particularly acute for water resources in tgr because of the dominance of toxic cyanobacteria species zhou et al 2017 forecasting habs and their associated toxins is increasingly becoming a requirement for water management authorities in the tgr however habs estimates are limited by discrete shipboard sampling and the effects of cloud cover in this area in this challenging environmental context the online monitoring network project was developed in tributary backwaters of tgr four tributaries were selected to build buoy mounted platforms because they have recently experienced eutrophication and increased occurrences of algal blooms therefore the predictive model has been built robustly using data from similar eutrophic status fig 1e h table s1 summarizes the limnological characteristics of the four studied tributaries 2 2 data source the buoy mounted platforms were developed to collect multi parameter monitoring data from four tributaries fig s1 the flowchart shown in fig s2 illustrates the online platform including multi parameter sensors for data collection a buoy mounted system for data transmission and a data centre for information storage

water level wl were measured by flowquest 600 usa chemical parameters including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured with online instruments of nutrients analyzer systea wiz italy and cod analyzer spectrolyser austria respectively the microscope and hplc were used to measure algal cell counting and microcystin concentrations at the frequency of once a day a low power and high reliability data collector was selected to connect the aquaread ap7000 with the sdi 12 interface and other sensors with the rs 232 interface the collected data was transferred back to the data centre via cdma2000 china telecom in addition the storage space of the data collector was equipped with 2 gb to store several weeks of monitoring data when the transmission system fails to transmit data in real time highly time resolved monitoring data are rarely perfect in reality with inevitable data gaps due to malfunction or bias in the sensors we mainly guarantee data quality from the following three aspects firstly the data comparisons between online monitoring and lab measurements were conducted once a month table s2 secondly sensors and measuring instruments were weekly calibrated to keep the quality of data thirdly the missing ratios reached 7 23 2 23 7 69 and 7 51 for the dataset from caotang river xiangxi river pengxi river and daning river respectively data interpolation based on the mice package in r was used to deal with this problem before building the predictive model 3 methodology 3 1 deep neural networks architecture the framework of the so called xg lstm was constructed in the following four steps fig 2 ① the xgboost was applied to reduce dimensions of environmental variables ② the selected main features were concatenated into an input tensor of the lstm to improve the predictive performance ③ the antecedent data of algal parameters were stacked to construct another input tensor for lstm layers parallel ④ the use of one fully connected layer representing the merged features was used to output the predictive results note that xg lstm contains an xgboost module two layers of lstm and one fully connected layer 3 2 extreme gradient boosting regression model this subsection describes the xgboost based regression model used to extract the inherent features needed for forecasting the time series patterns of algal parameters as a gradient tree boosting method xgboost is designed to use the second order taylor expansion on the objective function making it more effective in prediction and operation jia et al 2019 xgboost is trained in an additive strategy until the stopping criteria are met assuming that the model goes through t iterations and finally get t trees the model can be described by the following formula 1 y i t 1 t f t x i f t f where f is the function space containing all regression trees the optimization objectives of iteration t were described as follows 2 obj t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i ω f t c o n s t a n t 3 g i y t 1 l y i y t 1 4 h i y t 1 2 l y i y t 1 5 f t x w q x w r k q r d 1 2 k 6 ω f t γ k 1 2 λ k 1 k w k 2 among them objt is the objective function at the t th iteration l is a differentiable convex loss function measuring the difference between the predicted y and the target yi ft x defines a tree by a vector of scores in leaves and a leaf index mapping function that maps an instance to a leaf w is the leaf weight of the tree q is the structure of the tree and k represents the number of leaf nodes ω f t defines the model s complexity penalizing the model s complexity by adjusting the regularization coefficient λ the feature extraction of xgboost is based on the performance of a feature in the classification tree model the algorithm calculates feature importance by the gain zheng et al 2017 the high value of gain for a specific feature indicates its importance to the model during training gain is measured by the frequency of a feature as a splitting point in all construction trees which can be calculated using the following formula 7 gain 1 2 g l 2 h l λ g r 2 h r λ g l g r 2 h l h r λ γ where gl is the sum of g of all samples in the left node hl is the sum of h of all samples in the left node gr is the sum of g of all samples in the right node hr is the sum of h of all samples in the right node all variables were normalized by the min max scaling method before conducting the xgboost analysis the hyperparameters of the xgboost model should be tuned to optimize values by the grid search shown in table 1 to avoid the overfitting problem we controlled model complexity through the max depth parameter and added randomness to make training robust to noise through the eta parameter 3 3 long short term memory network the long short term memory network can learn the nonlinear characteristics of time series data with high efficiency thus this method was widely applied in solving sequence learning tasks hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in this study an lstm based network was built to simulate algal density and microcystin concentration variations each lstm block comprises a memory cell and three gates the input gate the forget gate and the output gate fig s3 the memory cell remembers the information over long range temporal context and the three gates with a sigmoid activation function control the changes of information written into and out of a cell the training process of the lstm can be mathematically formulated as follows 8 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 9 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 10 c t t a n h w c h t 1 x t b c 11 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 12 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 13 h t o t tanh c t 14 σ x 1 1 e x 15 t a n h x e x e x e x e x among them inputs of the block ht 1 xt and ct 1 represent the hidden state of the previous block the current input data and the cell state of the previous block respectively the block contains the hidden state ht and the cell state ct w and b are the weight matrix and bias vector ft ot and it represent the activation of the forget gate output gate and input gate respectively the input data format of lstm is given as x x1 x2 xn where each xi rt i 1 2 n n denotes the number of input variables t denotes the time lags in the time series prediction of habs the input gate was used to control the new observation s impact the output gate was designed to learn the impact of the past trend several hyperparameters in the lstm architecture should be preset including the number of lstm and fully connected layers the number of nodes in each lstm and fully connected layer and the time lags based on the contrast experiments results the model s basic structure was first built using one fully connected layer and two lstm layers the number of nodes and the time lags was set to an equivalent value of 30 50 70 and 1 2 3 4 5 respectively the present model s best parameters were determined by a random search method with 5 fold cross validation where the number of nodes in each layer is set to 50 and the length of time lags is 3 table 2 when the best network architecture was determined by hyperparameter setting the training set was utilized for training the present xg lstm model until convergence 3 4 model evaluation criteria two criteria were used to evaluate the developed model s performance the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae they were calculated as follows 16 rmse 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 17 mae 1 n t 1 n y t y t where n is the number of test samples y t is the simulated concentration of algal parameters and y t is the observed concentration of algal parameters 4 results in section 4 1 the hourly mean of multi parameter monitoring data at four studied tributaries from 1st september 2017 to 31st august 2018 was used including hydrometeorological water quality and chla to train and test the xg lstm model this study grouped the chla data within several time lags to compare the proposed method s multiscale predictions in section 4 2 the five year data 2014 2018 in the pengxi river were used to evaluate the predictive performance of xg lstm at a daily scale section 4 3 discussed the effectiveness of the selected parameters and compared the proposed model with three state of the art models 4 1 model performance for hourly chla forecasting at four tributaries as mentioned above the first 4344 hourly monitoring records were used as the training set in different tributaries and the rest remained for testing and tuning the hyperparameters two performance metrics were computed to obtain the optimal hyperparameters the time lags and the number of hidden neurons for hourly chla prediction shown in table 2 an insufficient number of neurons 30 may decrease the lstm s learning ability while too many neurons 70 may cause overfitting in addition the optimal time lag referring to the selected historical moments was determined by the comparative experiment therefore we set the nodes to 50 in each lstm s layer and time lag to 3 which showed the best performance when predicting chla one day in advance rmse 0 75 mae 0 40 similarly by performing grid searches the best architecture for the different prediction tasks is listed in table 3 note that models for different tributaries set the same hyperparameters the relative importance of each environmental variable in the xgboost process was clustered into three categories by k means analysis fig 3 showed that water temperature and water level were the most critical variables in the variations of chla concentrations at most tributaries in contrast ph and cod were also found to affect the variations of chla in the pengxi river through the xgboost process the auxiliary data were selected into lstm layers based on a parameter s average gain fig 4 displayed the measured and predicted chla from the xg lstm model in different tributaries in summary the xg lstm showed the most satisfactory accuracy for predicting chla one hour in advance for instance the prediction results of xg lstm in xiangxi river had the best performance with the smallest rmse 0 25 μg l 1 and mae 0 19 μg l 1 in comparison rmse and mae were 0 80 μg l 1 and 0 57 μg l 1 in pengxi river 0 82 μg l 1 and 0 64 μg l 1 in daning river and 1 78 μg l 1 and 0 91 μg l 1in caotang river respectively furthermore table 4 compared the prediction performance of the lstm model for the upcoming 1st to 48th hour at different tributaries the number of nodes in each lstm s layer was fixed in all tasks to minimize the experiment calculations and only a series of time lags were set with various tasks over the next 12 h we trained a separate model in each hour then we divided the next 13 48 h into two time windows 13 24 and 24 48 h and trained separate models to predict the mean chla concentration of each time interval fig s4 we calculated the mean value of each time point i e xt 13 xt 14 xt 15 xt 24 representing the prediction performance of the selected time window results showed that long term projections are more complicated thus requiring more historical input data ranging from 3 to 48 h time lags more specifically the predictive mean rmse values when predicting chla 12 h in advance were 2 01 μg l 1 in caotang river 0 35 μg l 1 in xiangxi river 1 29 μg l 1 in pengxi river and 1 21 μg l 1 in daning river respectively the mean rmse of 13 24 h prediction tasks in xiangxi river and pengxi river rmse 1 97 and 0 38 μg l 1 exhibited better performance than using a prediction interval of 12 h rmse 2 23 and 0 41 μg l 1 meaning xg lstm can capture the circadian rhythms of phytoplankton dynamics in these two tributaries 4 2 forecasting daily algal density and microcystin concentration according to the daily chla prediction the accuracy of the xg lstm model was rapidly decreased with increasing length of the prediction intervals as shown in table s3 the rmse values of the proposed model for 1 7 d chla predictions ranged from 5 96 to 13 61 μg l 1 in comparison the baseline of rmse was also calculated by assuming that chla for the next day t i is the same as the observation day t table s3 intuitively showed that the rmse of the xg lstm model was higher than that of the baseline rmse when the prediction time lag began to increase from 3 d in particular the r2 of the one day ahead prediction was considerably higher than that of the three day ahead and seven day ahead tasks fig 5 concerning the long term prediction of chla the proposed model showed little performance difference under the difference in one year left testing fig s5 the mean values of rmse ranged from 7 28 to 10 97 μg l 1 indicating the robustness of the xg lstm model to predict the fourth day s value of chla by the data from the first three days similar to the prediction of chla the optimal model structure predicting 4th day s series of algal counting and microcystin concentration in the pengxi river were constructed through a random search method table 3 it is reasonable to expect that the proposed model can work well in the daily predictive tasks of algal counting and microcystin after the xgboost process water level and cod were selected into the subsequent lstm model to predict algal densities and microcystin fig 3e f as shown in fig 6 a the xg lstm model performed well in predicting algal cell densities rmse 3 38 105 cells l 1 mae 2 72 105 cells l 1 in contrast one can see that although the xg lstm model might fail to fit the peak values in training data this model performed well in capturing variations of the microcystin concentrations in testing data rmse 0 013 μg l 1 mae 0 009 μg l 1 fig 6b hinting at its potential in managing bloom toxicity besides the relationship between algal fluorescence readings and cell counting or mc concentrations were also built according to fig 7 a a positive correlation r2 adj 0 40 p 0 001 between chla and cell counts was observed at relatively high chla concentrations 30 μg l demonstrating that cell counts observations were merely matched to the chla measurements at high concentrations in comparison fig 7b displayed that the linear regression for low chla concentrations 40 ug l cannot represent the relationship between microcystin and chla for high algal density 4 3 comparison of the proposed model with other approaches we conducted a comparative experiment using the lstm model without a feature selection process to evaluate the importance of auxiliary data two types of lstm models namely the single parameter lstm s lstm and multiple parameters lstm m lstm were compared with the proposed model in simulating hourly chla concentrations at four tributaries from table 4 compared with m lstm inputting all the variables the simulated results have a lower error when only the xgboost processed variables are used as model input data the data processed using xgboost reduced the mean values of rmse during 48 h periods by 25 10 56 49 59 13 and 59 20 for studied rivers of caotang xiangxi pengxi and daning respectively compared to that of the m lstm model for s lstm inputting only antecedent chla the mean rmse during 48 h periods was increased by 11 78 for caotang river 25 24 for xiangxi river 12 53 for pengxi river and 25 26 for daning river respectively compared to that of the xg lstm overall the predictive performance decreased in the order xg lstm s lstm m lstm on the other hand the lstm layer in xg lstm was replaced by three current state of the art methods support vector machine multilayer perceptron mlp and recurrent neural network comparison of the performances of the four models in forecasting the daily algal density and microcystin for training and testing periods indicates that xg lstm outperformed the other models for both periods fig 6 in particular one can see that although four models performed well for training periods mlp and svm models failed to fit data in the testing process from table 5 the xg lstm model lowered mean rmse and mae values compared to mlp by 52 28 and 58 87 in chla prediction by 44 04 and 48 78 in cell counting prediction by 19 88 and 28 46 in mc prediction respectively compared to svm by 50 52 and 45 28 in chla prediction by 34 24 and 38 32 in cell counting prediction by 63 43 and 72 24 in mc prediction respectively noticeably the mean rmse and mae of the rnn for different algal parameters were slightly higher than that of the xg lstm by 6 60 and 2 96 for chla prediction by 8 15 and 7 80 for cell counting prediction by 8 57 and 14 68 for mc prediction respectively these results suggested that deep learning architecture was found most suitable for predicting highly time resolved processes 5 discussion in this research the proposed xg lstm models produce good results in the short term predictions of algal parameters the predicted hourly and daily chla concentrations are consistent with the changing trend in the monitoring data from on site buoys the results revealed that the model s prediction accuracy declined as the number of prediction time steps increased thereby requiring the increase of optimum time lags table 4 this finding is consistent with prior study using the lstm network for predicting chla of the next 1 to 3 time steps zheng et al 2021 in addition the prediction results from march to may are less accurate than other months as indicated by the higher values of rmse in the subfigures of fig 4 the main reason for the seasonal accuracy variations is that phytoplankton growth is a nonlinear dynamic process affected by hydrometeorological and physiochemical conditions kim et al 2020 therefore the simultaneous use of algal and environmental parameters can effectively retain information in modelling complex habs patterns through comparative experiments our results reinforced the trade off between the costs and benefits of external environmental variables in forecasting algal parameters in the tgr table 4 the on site buoys provided a vast number of multi parameter data to train and test lstm models however following the xgboost process redundant information of environmental variables is simultaneously eliminated and valid variables are retained in the lstm layers likewise the lstm model with xgboost achieved lower rmse values in hourly chla prediction for each studied river than the single parameter lstm providing that accurate and stable prediction was achieved by integrating the selected parameters into subsequent layers of the lstm previous studies have shown that preprocessing input data via a feature selection algorithm is an effective method for ann li et al 2017 zhai and chen 2018 the water temperature and water level played essential roles in forecasting chla concentrations fig 3 reflecting the pronounced impacts of dam operation and temperature warming on the risks of habs in the tgr qiu et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 for example the xiangxi river is the closest tributary to the dam where the dynamics of algal density could be attributed to hydrodynamic changes rather than other factors fig 7c by contrast pengxi river is located in the middle reach of tgr where the ecosystem states experience two transitions between clear deep lake and turbid shallow water fig 7d in addition water temperature in pengxi river is increasing more rapidly than in the other three tributaries from may to september thereby promoting the increase of the frequency intensity and duration of blooms fig 1c d by satellite remote sensing and in situ observations a similar phenomenon has been observed in previous studies by xiao et al 2016 and zhou et al 2018 therefore physicochemical factors including ph and cod were also found to mainly affect the concentration of chla in the pengxi river confirming the significant role of algal blooms in the biogeochemical process amorim et al 2020 the highly time resolved monitoring data highlighted the linkages among algal fluorescence readings cell counts and microcystin concentrations fig 7a b algal cell counts were merely matched to chla readings at high concentration proving that some bloom forming species containing chla as diagnostic pigments i e cyanobacteria and chlorophyta began to dominate the phytoplankton community shan et al 2019b therefore chla fluorescence may be a reliable proxy for predicting a high concentration of cyanobacterial blooms in tgr moreover two challenges complicate the analysis of the association between cyanobacterial biomass and microcystin contents firstly mc are usually released after the lysis of cells dong et al 2016 so there might be a time lag between cell death and toxin release it can also be observed that deep learning architecture achieved more high precision mc forecasting than other data driven models table 5 contributing to its strong learning ability to predict time series data secondly mc production amongst taxa is triggered by different environmental factors beaver et al 2018 although valid environmental variables are retained to the lstm layers the complex interactions among different driving forces affected the precise estimation of mc peak concentrations fig 6b due to the significant alterations of the habitat and hydrological regime it is still challenging to predict the overarching dynamics of habs in dammed rivers xia et al 2020 artificial intelligence technologies can make better management decisions as they are well suited for short term projections based on high frequency data hence evaluating the future habs trends in tgr requires combining deep learning algorithms with online monitoring platforms to develop a more comprehensive understanding rousso et al 2020 our developed model can easily be extended to locations across tgr where very limited or no prior information is available because of regularly incorporating water temperature and water level interestingly the proposed model performed well for forecasting mc concentrations hinting at its potential to be a management tool of bloom toxicity however the mc model s development is limited because many field samples are associated with low mc concentrations yuan and pollard 2017 in the future a large amount of data with hazardous mc concentrations 1 μg l represented should be used to test the developed model s effectiveness real time remote monitoring of water quality has been recommended in some areas bertone et al 2018 it is still difficult to predict the hab and habs related toxins based on sensor collected data as such more emphasis should be taken on the trade off between the sophistication of model architecture and overall model performance cabaneros et al 2019 sometimes the modeller tends to consider more sophisticated models rather than testing the ability of much simpler models to reach real world forecasting tasks that in turn would increase the number of parameters as well as model input data environmental management depends on the meaningful interpretation of proposed models therefore further efforts should be made to examine the theoretical understanding of the ecological principles behind the paradigm of data driven models maier et al 2010 6 conclusion in this study a hybrid deep learning architecture composed of one xgboost module and two parallel lstm was proposed for predicting algal parameters to help decision makers manage the harmful algal blooms in the three gorges reservoir this model was applied and evaluated based on the highly time resolved data at four bloom impacted tributaries the ability of the xg lstm model to predict hourly and daily chlorophyll a fluorescence readings cell counts and microcystin concentrations were evaluated and discussed in addition the presented model was compared with two lstm models without special feature extraction procedures and other data driven models the main conclusions of the present study are as follows 1 the newly proposed model showed accurate and stable performance in the forecasting of chla for each multiscale prediction task 2 the presented model achieved better performance than that of two lstm models without the xgboost process providing that the use of selected environmental parameters improved the predictive performance of lstm 3 the current approach opens the way towards real time prediction of habs risks in tgr as evidenced by satisfactory performance when predicting algal density and microcystin concentrations credit authorship contribution statement kun shan

3719,many dammed rivers throughout the world have experienced frequent harmful algal blooms habs in the context of climate change and anthropogenic activities accurate forecasting of algal parameters i e algal cell density and microcystin concentration has great practical significance for taking precautions against habs risks long short term memory lstm networks have recently shown potential in predicting water quality parameters however there is still little known about the robustness of the lstm in forecasting highly time resolved measurement of algal parameters this study developed a hybrid deep learning architecture xg lstm composed of one xgboost module and two parallel lstm models to predict algal cell density and microcystin concentration in the three gorges reservoir tgr the proposed model was validated by in situ multi sensor system monitoring data at four bloom impacted tributaries in the tgr each modelling process utilized the antecedent information of the algal parameters and the corresponding environmental variables as inputs for forecasting the algal parameters for the coming hours and days as expected the presented model achieved better performance than those without special feature extraction procedures providing that the use of selected environmental parameters can improve lstm performance in addition the hybrid xg lstm model successfully captured the time series patterns of both algal cell density and microcystin concentration compared with other data driven models further suggesting the reliable utilization of this model in early warnings of bloom toxicity thus the results presented demonstrate the potential of deep learning technology for real time prediction of algal parameters in the tgr and possibly for rapid detection of developing habs in other aquatic ecosystems keywords harmful algal bloom real time monitoring long short term memory network microcystin three gorges reservoir 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs resulting from an excess of nutrients have become a severe environmental problem in rivers worldwide because of dam construction huisman et al 2018 maavara et al 2020 compared to eutrophication in relatively static water bodies algal blooms could cause more severe consequences at a larger scale along rivers reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 xia et al 2020 nevertheless accurate habs forecasting in large river systems presents great challenges because these areas have heterogeneous and complex hydrodynamic characteristics anthropogenic manipulation and climate related change huang et al 2020 yang et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on the causes and consequences of habs but no persuasive conclusions have been drawn based on traditional algae monitoring campaigns and statistical analysis asnaghi et al 2017 jochimsen et al 2013 therefore there remains a need for fast cost effective and online monitoring together with advanced modelling approaches to disentangle the underlying trends from the complicated pattern of river algal blooms events thomas et al 2018 thomson laing et al 2020 cell density or the number of phytoplankton cells per unit volume is an essential parameter characterizing a phytoplankton community but this analysis usually requires manual sampling and laboratory procedures by contrast the in situ chlorophyll a chla fluorescence approach can rapidly present all phytoplankton biomass and therefore has been widely applied to measure diagnostic pigments yang et al 2019 for instance several commercial fluorescence sensors can be integrated with other sensors e g measuring physicochemical variables and provide more massive datasets to train models and learn inherent habs patterns petchey et al 2015 nevertheless choosing appropriate parameters in forecasting the phytoplankton communities remains challenging under changing hydrological conditions page et al 2018 concomitantly projecting hab toxin may be of greater interest to drinking water authorities than biomass estimates hu et al 2016 singh et al 2015 shan et al 2019a recent research has tried to estimate toxins various congeners of microcystin by integrating different monitoring and prediction techniques including satellite remote sensing in situ observations and statistical modelling shan et al 2020 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2020 the concentrations of microcystin mc were linked to the measured chla concentrations based on simple statistical models yuan and pollard 2019 to the best of our knowledge there is currently no suitable model available for predicting the temporal dynamics of bloom toxicity the existing modelling frameworks of algal parameters forecasts have fallen into two categories mechanistic modelling and data driven approach the mechanistic approaches describe the phytoplankton growth and outbreak processes reynolds and irish 1997 wallace and hamilton 2000 mechanistic models are mainly used for predicting spatial movement rather than time series changes for instance the process based models give the present location and extent of habs from satellite imagery then predict short term dynamics using a hydrodynamic model and future meteorological conditions rowe et al 2016 wynne et al 2011 in practice these complicated models are always time consuming to calibrate parameters as an alternative the fast development in monitoring technologies has continuously expanded resources for ecological data collection xiao et al 2017 the data intensive methods have been rapidly developed and applied for short term forecasts of habs including artificial neural network ann chen et al 2015 evolutionary computation recknagel et al 2017 support vector machine svm shen et al 2019 and random forest tong et al 2019 unlike traditional physical models the absence of mechanical processes does not necessarily lead to the failure of these data driven methods however in situ monitoring data from multi sensor systems is characteristic of highly time resolved variations bai et al 2020 whereas most data driven models are not explicitly designed for time series tasks so they cannot effectively learn the hidden rules behind the monitoring data zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 with the advancement of artificial intelligence the long short term memory lstm a type of recurrent neural network rnn has recently shown great potential in predicting water quality sensor collected parameters for instance barzegar et al 2020 have developed lstm based on sensor collected data at 15 min intervals to predict dissolved oxygen do and the results of the model successfully captured both the low and high levels of the do concentrations qiu et al 2021 have demonstrated that lstm outperforms several data driven models for predicting mean daily water temperature wt in rivers moreover the lstm has also received increasing attention for predicting the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton shin et al 2019 used the lstm based on satellite surface temperature data and photosynthetically available radiation to predict margalefidinium polykrikoides bloom successfully yu et al 2020 combined wavelet analysis with lstm to predict chla concentration taking fifteen water quality parameters of dianchi lake as a research object and the results showed that the model has good prediction performance in the present study a vast amount of in situ multi sensor monitoring data was generated by on site buoys at four bloom impacted tributaries in the three gorges reservoir tgr online platforms provide high frequency monitoring information to employ data driven models profitably zamyadi et al 2016 nevertheless little is known about the robustness of the lstm in forecasting highly time resolved algal parameters it has been found that the combination of lstm and other machine learning algorithms can be helpful to develop accurate predictive models barzegar et al 2020 considering the trade off between the costs and benefits of sensor collected parameters we hypothesized that integrating special feature extraction procedures into lstm may enhance predictive performance the extreme gradient boosting xgboost as one of the decision tree learning techniques proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 has recently gained popularity as a winning solution in machine learning competitions therefore this study proposes a hybrid deep learning architecture xg lstm to test our hypothesis composed of one xgboost module and two parallel lstm the goals of this paper are threefold 1 identify the main environmental drivers of algal parameters at four studied tributaries 2 achieve accurate forecasting of algal parameters for the incoming hours and days and 3 provide a scientific basis for model selection and habs management in the tgr 2 research area and data 2 1 study sites the three gorges dam on the yangtze river one of the largest hydropower projects in china has brought enormous socio economic benefits including electricity generation flood control navigation and others gao et al 2018 xia et al 2018 the three gorges reservoir covers approximately 1084 km2 when the water level reaches 175 m fig 1 the average annual temperature precipitation and wind speed in the tgr region are 17 6 c 1122 5 mm and 1 3 m s respectively the water level regulation fluctuates markedly within one year with a minimum of 145 m during the flood period may to september and a maximum of 175 m during the impounding stage october to february of the following year drastic fluctuations of water level regulation in tgr affect the water quality variation in tributaries xiang et al 2021 since the initial impoundment in june 2003 the dam construction has resulted in substantial hydrological alterations in the tributary bays such as decreased flow velocity extended water retention time and stratified water temperature in addition the tributary has also shown symptoms of human induced nutrient enrichment driven by increasing urbanization and industrialization li et al 2019 consequently the most noticeable symptom is the increasing algal blooms found along the tributary backwaters chuo et al 2019 furthermore habs problems have tended to be particularly acute for water resources in tgr because of the dominance of toxic cyanobacteria species zhou et al 2017 forecasting habs and their associated toxins is increasingly becoming a requirement for water management authorities in the tgr however habs estimates are limited by discrete shipboard sampling and the effects of cloud cover in this area in this challenging environmental context the online monitoring network project was developed in tributary backwaters of tgr four tributaries were selected to build buoy mounted platforms because they have recently experienced eutrophication and increased occurrences of algal blooms therefore the predictive model has been built robustly using data from similar eutrophic status fig 1e h table s1 summarizes the limnological characteristics of the four studied tributaries 2 2 data source the buoy mounted platforms were developed to collect multi parameter monitoring data from four tributaries fig s1 the flowchart shown in fig s2 illustrates the online platform including multi parameter sensors for data collection a buoy mounted system for data transmission and a data centre for information storage and processing the water quality analyzer obtained the physicochemical data aquaread ap7000 uk for detecting chla concentration water temperature conductivity turbidity ph and do a meteorological instrument airmar 150 wx usa was set onto the buoy to document the wind speed ws wind direction wd air temperature at and atmospheric pressure ap hydrodynamic conditions including flow velocity fv and water level wl were measured by flowquest 600 usa chemical parameters including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured with online instruments of nutrients analyzer systea wiz italy and cod analyzer spectrolyser austria respectively the microscope and hplc were used to measure algal cell counting and microcystin concentrations at the frequency of once a day a low power and high reliability data collector was selected to connect the aquaread ap7000 with the sdi 12 interface and other sensors with the rs 232 interface the collected data was transferred back to the data centre via cdma2000 china telecom in addition the storage space of the data collector was equipped with 2 gb to store several weeks of monitoring data when the transmission system fails to transmit data in real time highly time resolved monitoring data are rarely perfect in reality with inevitable data gaps due to malfunction or bias in the sensors we mainly guarantee data quality from the following three aspects firstly the data comparisons between online monitoring and lab measurements were conducted once a month table s2 secondly sensors and measuring instruments were weekly calibrated to keep the quality of data thirdly the missing ratios reached 7 23 2 23 7 69 and 7 51 for the dataset from caotang river xiangxi river pengxi river and daning river respectively data interpolation based on the mice package in r was used to deal with this problem before building the predictive model 3 methodology 3 1 deep neural networks architecture the framework of the so called xg lstm was constructed in the following four steps fig 2 ① the xgboost was applied to reduce dimensions of environmental variables ② the selected main features were concatenated into an input tensor of the lstm to improve the predictive performance ③ the antecedent data of algal parameters were stacked to construct another input tensor for lstm layers parallel ④ the use of one fully connected layer representing the merged features was used to output the predictive results note that xg lstm contains an xgboost module two layers of lstm and one fully connected layer 3 2 extreme gradient boosting regression model this subsection describes the xgboost based regression model used to extract the inherent features needed for forecasting the time series patterns of algal parameters as a gradient tree boosting method xgboost is designed to use the second order taylor expansion on the objective function making it more effective in prediction and operation jia et al 2019 xgboost is trained in an additive strategy until the stopping criteria are met assuming that the model goes through t iterations and finally get t trees the model can be described by the following formula 1 y i t 1 t f t x i f t f where f is the function space containing all regression trees the optimization objectives of iteration t were described as follows 2 obj t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i ω f t c o n s t a n t 3 g i y t 1 l y i y t 1 4 h i y t 1 2 l y i y t 1 5 f t x w q x w r k q r d 1 2 k 6 ω f t γ k 1 2 λ k 1 k w k 2 among them objt is the objective function at the t th iteration l is a differentiable convex loss function measuring the difference between the predicted y and the target yi ft x defines a tree by a vector of scores in leaves and a leaf index mapping function that maps an instance to a leaf w is the leaf weight of the tree q is the structure of the tree and k represents the number of leaf nodes ω f t defines the model s complexity penalizing the model s complexity by adjusting the regularization coefficient λ the feature extraction of xgboost is based on the performance of a feature in the classification tree model the algorithm calculates feature importance by the gain zheng et al 2017 the high value of gain for a specific feature indicates its importance to the model during training gain is measured by the frequency of a feature as a splitting point in all construction trees which can be calculated using the following formula 7 gain 1 2 g l 2 h l λ g r 2 h r λ g l g r 2 h l h r λ γ where gl is the sum of g of all samples in the left node hl is the sum of h of all samples in the left node gr is the sum of g of all samples in the right node hr is the sum of h of all samples in the right node all variables were normalized by the min max scaling method before conducting the xgboost analysis the hyperparameters of the xgboost model should be tuned to optimize values by the grid search shown in table 1 to avoid the overfitting problem we controlled model complexity through the max depth parameter and added randomness to make training robust to noise through the eta parameter 3 3 long short term memory network the long short term memory network can learn the nonlinear characteristics of time series data with high efficiency thus this method was widely applied in solving sequence learning tasks hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 in this study an lstm based network was built to simulate algal density and microcystin concentration variations each lstm block comprises a memory cell and three gates the input gate the forget gate and the output gate fig s3 the memory cell remembers the information over long range temporal context and the three gates with a sigmoid activation function control the changes of information written into and out of a cell the training process of the lstm can be mathematically formulated as follows 8 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 9 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 10 c t t a n h w c h t 1 x t b c 11 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 12 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 13 h t o t tanh c t 14 σ x 1 1 e x 15 t a n h x e x e x e x e x among them inputs of the block ht 1 xt and ct 1 represent the hidden state of the previous block the current input data and the cell state of the previous block respectively the block contains the hidden state ht and the cell state ct w and b are the weight matrix and bias vector ft ot and it represent the activation of the forget gate output gate and input gate respectively the input data format of lstm is given as x x1 x2 xn where each xi rt i 1 2 n n denotes the number of input variables t denotes the time lags in the time series prediction of habs the input gate was used to control the new observation s impact the output gate was designed to learn the impact of the past trend several hyperparameters in the lstm architecture should be preset including the number of lstm and fully connected layers the number of nodes in each lstm and fully connected layer and the time lags based on the contrast experiments results the model s basic structure was first built using one fully connected layer and two lstm layers the number of nodes and the time lags was set to an equivalent value of 30 50 70 and 1 2 3 4 5 respectively the present model s best parameters were determined by a random search method with 5 fold cross validation where the number of nodes in each layer is set to 50 and the length of time lags is 3 table 2 when the best network architecture was determined by hyperparameter setting the training set was utilized for training the present xg lstm model until convergence 3 4 model evaluation criteria two criteria were used to evaluate the developed model s performance the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae they were calculated as follows 16 rmse 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 17 mae 1 n t 1 n y t y t where n is the number of test samples y t is the simulated concentration of algal parameters and y t is the observed concentration of algal parameters 4 results in section 4 1 the hourly mean of multi parameter monitoring data at four studied tributaries from 1st september 2017 to 31st august 2018 was used including hydrometeorological water quality and chla to train and test the xg lstm model this study grouped the chla data within several time lags to compare the proposed method s multiscale predictions in section 4 2 the five year data 2014 2018 in the pengxi river were used to evaluate the predictive performance of xg lstm at a daily scale section 4 3 discussed the effectiveness of the selected parameters and compared the proposed model with three state of the art models 4 1 model performance for hourly chla forecasting at four tributaries as mentioned above the first 4344 hourly monitoring records were used as the training set in different tributaries and the rest remained for testing and tuning the hyperparameters two performance metrics were computed to obtain the optimal hyperparameters the time lags and the number of hidden neurons for hourly chla prediction shown in table 2 an insufficient number of neurons 30 may decrease the lstm s learning ability while too many neurons 70 may cause overfitting in addition the optimal time lag referring to the selected historical moments was determined by the comparative experiment therefore we set the nodes to 50 in each lstm s layer and time lag to 3 which showed the best performance when predicting chla one day in advance rmse 0 75 mae 0 40 similarly by performing grid searches the best architecture for the different prediction tasks is listed in table 3 note that models for different tributaries set the same hyperparameters the relative importance of each environmental variable in the xgboost process was clustered into three categories by k means analysis fig 3 showed that water temperature and water level were the most critical variables in the variations of chla concentrations at most tributaries in contrast ph and cod were also found to affect the variations of chla in the pengxi river through the xgboost process the auxiliary data were selected into lstm layers based on a parameter s average gain fig 4 displayed the measured and predicted chla from the xg lstm model in different tributaries in summary the xg lstm showed the most satisfactory accuracy for predicting chla one hour in advance for instance the prediction results of xg lstm in xiangxi river had the best performance with the smallest rmse 0 25 μg l 1 and mae 0 19 μg l 1 in comparison rmse and mae were 0 80 μg l 1 and 0 57 μg l 1 in pengxi river 0 82 μg l 1 and 0 64 μg l 1 in daning river and 1 78 μg l 1 and 0 91 μg l 1in caotang river respectively furthermore table 4 compared the prediction performance of the lstm model for the upcoming 1st to 48th hour at different tributaries the number of nodes in each lstm s layer was fixed in all tasks to minimize the experiment calculations and only a series of time lags were set with various tasks over the next 12 h we trained a separate model in each hour then we divided the next 13 48 h into two time windows 13 24 and 24 48 h and trained separate models to predict the mean chla concentration of each time interval fig s4 we calculated the mean value of each time point i e xt 13 xt 14 xt 15 xt 24 representing the prediction performance of the selected time window results showed that long term projections are more complicated thus requiring more historical input data ranging from 3 to 48 h time lags more specifically the predictive mean rmse values when predicting chla 12 h in advance were 2 01 μg l 1 in caotang river 0 35 μg l 1 in xiangxi river 1 29 μg l 1 in pengxi river and 1 21 μg l 1 in daning river respectively the mean rmse of 13 24 h prediction tasks in xiangxi river and pengxi river rmse 1 97 and 0 38 μg l 1 exhibited better performance than using a prediction interval of 12 h rmse 2 23 and 0 41 μg l 1 meaning xg lstm can capture the circadian rhythms of phytoplankton dynamics in these two tributaries 4 2 forecasting daily algal density and microcystin concentration according to the daily chla prediction the accuracy of the xg lstm model was rapidly decreased with increasing length of the prediction intervals as shown in table s3 the rmse values of the proposed model for 1 7 d chla predictions ranged from 5 96 to 13 61 μg l 1 in comparison the baseline of rmse was also calculated by assuming that chla for the next day t i is the same as the observation day t table s3 intuitively showed that the rmse of the xg lstm model was higher than that of the baseline rmse when the prediction time lag began to increase from 3 d in particular the r2 of the one day ahead prediction was considerably higher than that of the three day ahead and seven day ahead tasks fig 5 concerning the long term prediction of chla the proposed model showed little performance difference under the difference in one year left testing fig s5 the mean values of rmse ranged from 7 28 to 10 97 μg l 1 indicating the robustness of the xg lstm model to predict the fourth day s value of chla by the data from the first three days similar to the prediction of chla the optimal model structure predicting 4th day s series of algal counting and microcystin concentration in the pengxi river were constructed through a random search method table 3 it is reasonable to expect that the proposed model can work well in the daily predictive tasks of algal counting and microcystin after the xgboost process water level and cod were selected into the subsequent lstm model to predict algal densities and microcystin fig 3e f as shown in fig 6 a the xg lstm model performed well in predicting algal cell densities rmse 3 38 105 cells l 1 mae 2 72 105 cells l 1 in contrast one can see that although the xg lstm model might fail to fit the peak values in training data this model performed well in capturing variations of the microcystin concentrations in testing data rmse 0 013 μg l 1 mae 0 009 μg l 1 fig 6b hinting at its potential in managing bloom toxicity besides the relationship between algal fluorescence readings and cell counting or mc concentrations were also built according to fig 7 a a positive correlation r2 adj 0 40 p 0 001 between chla and cell counts was observed at relatively high chla concentrations 30 μg l demonstrating that cell counts observations were merely matched to the chla measurements at high concentrations in comparison fig 7b displayed that the linear regression for low chla concentrations 40 ug l cannot represent the relationship between microcystin and chla for high algal density 4 3 comparison of the proposed model with other approaches we conducted a comparative experiment using the lstm model without a feature selection process to evaluate the importance of auxiliary data two types of lstm models namely the single parameter lstm s lstm and multiple parameters lstm m lstm were compared with the proposed model in simulating hourly chla concentrations at four tributaries from table 4 compared with m lstm inputting all the variables the simulated results have a lower error when only the xgboost processed variables are used as model input data the data processed using xgboost reduced the mean values of rmse during 48 h periods by 25 10 56 49 59 13 and 59 20 for studied rivers of caotang xiangxi pengxi and daning respectively compared to that of the m lstm model for s lstm inputting only antecedent chla the mean rmse during 48 h periods was increased by 11 78 for caotang river 25 24 for xiangxi river 12 53 for pengxi river and 25 26 for daning river respectively compared to that of the xg lstm overall the predictive performance decreased in the order xg lstm s lstm m lstm on the other hand the lstm layer in xg lstm was replaced by three current state of the art methods support vector machine multilayer perceptron mlp and recurrent neural network comparison of the performances of the four models in forecasting the daily algal density and microcystin for training and testing periods indicates that xg lstm outperformed the other models for both periods fig 6 in particular one can see that although four models performed well for training periods mlp and svm models failed to fit data in the testing process from table 5 the xg lstm model lowered mean rmse and mae values compared to mlp by 52 28 and 58 87 in chla prediction by 44 04 and 48 78 in cell counting prediction by 19 88 and 28 46 in mc prediction respectively compared to svm by 50 52 and 45 28 in chla prediction by 34 24 and 38 32 in cell counting prediction by 63 43 and 72 24 in mc prediction respectively noticeably the mean rmse and mae of the rnn for different algal parameters were slightly higher than that of the xg lstm by 6 60 and 2 96 for chla prediction by 8 15 and 7 80 for cell counting prediction by 8 57 and 14 68 for mc prediction respectively these results suggested that deep learning architecture was found most suitable for predicting highly time resolved processes 5 discussion in this research the proposed xg lstm models produce good results in the short term predictions of algal parameters the predicted hourly and daily chla concentrations are consistent with the changing trend in the monitoring data from on site buoys the results revealed that the model s prediction accuracy declined as the number of prediction time steps increased thereby requiring the increase of optimum time lags table 4 this finding is consistent with prior study using the lstm network for predicting chla of the next 1 to 3 time steps zheng et al 2021 in addition the prediction results from march to may are less accurate than other months as indicated by the higher values of rmse in the subfigures of fig 4 the main reason for the seasonal accuracy variations is that phytoplankton growth is a nonlinear dynamic process affected by hydrometeorological and physiochemical conditions kim et al 2020 therefore the simultaneous use of algal and environmental parameters can effectively retain information in modelling complex habs patterns through comparative experiments our results reinforced the trade off between the costs and benefits of external environmental variables in forecasting algal parameters in the tgr table 4 the on site buoys provided a vast number of multi parameter data to train and test lstm models however following the xgboost process redundant information of environmental variables is simultaneously eliminated and valid variables are retained in the lstm layers likewise the lstm model with xgboost achieved lower rmse values in hourly chla prediction for each studied river than the single parameter lstm providing that accurate and stable prediction was achieved by integrating the selected parameters into subsequent layers of the lstm previous studies have shown that preprocessing input data via a feature selection algorithm is an effective method for ann li et al 2017 zhai and chen 2018 the water temperature and water level played essential roles in forecasting chla concentrations fig 3 reflecting the pronounced impacts of dam operation and temperature warming on the risks of habs in the tgr qiu et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 for example the xiangxi river is the closest tributary to the dam where the dynamics of algal density could be attributed to hydrodynamic changes rather than other factors fig 7c by contrast pengxi river is located in the middle reach of tgr where the ecosystem states experience two transitions between clear deep lake and turbid shallow water fig 7d in addition water temperature in pengxi river is increasing more rapidly than in the other three tributaries from may to september thereby promoting the increase of the frequency intensity and duration of blooms fig 1c d by satellite remote sensing and in situ observations a similar phenomenon has been observed in previous studies by xiao et al 2016 and zhou et al 2018 therefore physicochemical factors including ph and cod were also found to mainly affect the concentration of chla in the pengxi river confirming the significant role of algal blooms in the biogeochemical process amorim et al 2020 the highly time resolved monitoring data highlighted the linkages among algal fluorescence readings cell counts and microcystin concentrations fig 7a b algal cell counts were merely matched to chla readings at high concentration proving that some bloom forming species containing chla as diagnostic pigments i e cyanobacteria and chlorophyta began to dominate the phytoplankton community shan et al 2019b therefore chla fluorescence may be a reliable proxy for predicting a high concentration of cyanobacterial blooms in tgr moreover two challenges complicate the analysis of the association between cyanobacterial biomass and microcystin contents firstly mc are usually released after the lysis of cells dong et al 2016 so there might be a time lag between cell death and toxin release it can also be observed that deep learning architecture achieved more high precision mc forecasting than other data driven models table 5 contributing to its strong learning ability to predict time series data secondly mc production amongst taxa is triggered by different environmental factors beaver et al 2018 although valid environmental variables are retained to the lstm layers the complex interactions among different driving forces affected the precise estimation of mc peak concentrations fig 6b due to the significant alterations of the habitat and hydrological regime it is still challenging to predict the overarching dynamics of habs in dammed rivers xia et al 2020 artificial intelligence technologies can make better management decisions as they are well suited for short term projections based on high frequency data hence evaluating the future habs trends in tgr requires combining deep learning algorithms with online monitoring platforms to develop a more comprehensive understanding rousso et al 2020 our developed model can easily be extended to locations across tgr where very limited or no prior information is available because of regularly incorporating water temperature and water level interestingly the proposed model performed well for forecasting mc concentrations hinting at its potential to be a management tool of bloom toxicity however the mc model s development is limited because many field samples are associated with low mc concentrations yuan and pollard 2017 in the future a large amount of data with hazardous mc concentrations 1 μg l represented should be used to test the developed model s effectiveness real time remote monitoring of water quality has been recommended in some areas bertone et al 2018 it is still difficult to predict the hab and habs related toxins based on sensor collected data as such more emphasis should be taken on the trade off between the sophistication of model architecture and overall model performance cabaneros et al 2019 sometimes the modeller tends to consider more sophisticated models rather than testing the ability of much simpler models to reach real world forecasting tasks that in turn would increase the number of parameters as well as model input data environmental management depends on the meaningful interpretation of proposed models therefore further efforts should be made to examine the theoretical understanding of the ecological principles behind the paradigm of data driven models maier et al 2010 6 conclusion in this study a hybrid deep learning architecture composed of one xgboost module and two parallel lstm was proposed for predicting algal parameters to help decision makers manage the harmful algal blooms in the three gorges reservoir this model was applied and evaluated based on the highly time resolved data at four bloom impacted tributaries the ability of the xg lstm model to predict hourly and daily chlorophyll a fluorescence readings cell counts and microcystin concentrations were evaluated and discussed in addition the presented model was compared with two lstm models without special feature extraction procedures and other data driven models the main conclusions of the present study are as follows 1 the newly proposed model showed accurate and stable performance in the forecasting of chla for each multiscale prediction task 2 the presented model achieved better performance than that of two lstm models without the xgboost process providing that the use of selected environmental parameters improved the predictive performance of lstm 3 the current approach opens the way towards real time prediction of habs risks in tgr as evidenced by satisfactory performance when predicting algal density and microcystin concentrations credit authorship contribution statement kun shan
