2905,in earth sciences the measurement of soil and rock moisture content is essential in improving our understanding of various hydrologic processes recently the electrical resistivity method has been frequently used to estimate the moisture content in the field the uncertainty associated with resistivity estimated moisture content is mainly from two sources regularized inversion and petrophysical interpretation in this study to reduce the uncertainty we propose 1 to use subsurface structural information from seismic refraction measurements to relax the smoothness based regularization at structural boundaries and 2 to use structural unit specific petrophysical relationships to translate resistivity into moisture content the proposed methods are tested on a synthetic subsurface model featuring three distinct layers of a granitic critical zone cz the results of the synthetic example show that both the spatial pattern and the moisture content values estimated with the new method are very close to the true model with low uncertainty compared to the traditional method the estimation is significantly improved particularly at the cz boundaries such as the regolith fractured bedrock interface we also apply the new method to a granitic hillslope to estimate the moisture content distribution from field resistivity measurements although no ground truth is available for validation the estimated moisture content distributions exhibit some typical hydrological features in hillslopes such as the perched water at the soil rock interface and preferential flow path in fractured rocks therefore it is concluded that incorporating structural information in resistivity inversion and using structural unit specific petrophysical models can improve moisture content estimation from field resistivity measurements keywords moisture content electrical resistivity monte carlo constrained inversion subsurface structure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the shallow subsurface weathering of bedrock results in a physically mobile granular surface mantle that lacks relict rock structure pope 2015 usually termed as soil or regolith the soil layer plays a critical role in the terrestrial water cycles by influencing the partitioning of precipitation between soil moisture evaporation evapotranspiration deep infiltration contributing to groundwater recharge and runoff brooks et al 2015 with advances in measurement techniques e g robinson et al 2008 soil moisture has become a regular state variable in many hydrologic ecologic and climate models dorigo et al 2011 recently it has been realized that the fractured bedrock beneath the soil or regolith layer also influences groundwater recharge evapotranspiration base flow and stream water chemistry e g rempe and dietrich 2018 thus many efforts have been made to incorporate rock moisture as a state variable into hydrologic ecological and climate models e g ackerer et al 2021 in this regard soil and rock moisture measurements are essential in improving our understanding of various hydrologic processes and our projections of earth s water resources soil moisture can be measured either with satellite remote sensing techniques mohanty et al 2017 or in situ for example using soil moisture probes sensors dobriyal et al 2012 remote sensing can cover a large region and thus the measured soil moisture data are valuable for the calibration and verification of large scale hydrologic modeling vischel et al 2008 sánchez et al 2010 the primary limitation of satellite based remote sensing is that the moisture data are only available for near surface soils 5 cm in contrast soil moisture probes sensors e g time domain reflectometry installed in soil pits can reach down to the bedrock and showed excellent vertical resolutions e g heimovaara and bouten 1990 if these moisture probes are distributed over large regions to form a soil moisture monitoring network e g benninga et al 2018 the spatial temporal soil moisture patterns can be revealed the monitored soil moisture data can also be used for the calibration and verification of distributed hydrologic models one limitation of this point based soil moisture measurement is the limited support volume cm3 which is inconsistent with the mesh volume used in most hydrologic models from m3 to km3 rock moisture measurement has been conducted in the field in many ecohydrological studies the current practice is to measure in boreholes using non destructive geophysical techniques such as the neutron probe rempe and dietrich 2018 hahm et al 2020 and nuclear magnetic resonance schmidt and rempe 2020 the typical support volume of these borehole based tools is m3 and the instrument can be lowered down to 10 s m with a vertical resolution of 25 cm e g hahm et al 2020 such rock moisture data are critical for understanding the role of fractured bedrock in regulating the ecohydrological partitioning at the land surface brooks et al 2015 however one primary drawback of the borehole based rock moisture measurement is the high cost which prohibits the establishment of a monitoring network for watershed or catchment scale applications given the limitations of existing soil and rock moisture measurement techniques there is a need to develop cost effective techniques that can measure soil and rock moisture content at an intermediate scale from hillslope to catchment scale with a high vertical resolution near surface geophysical methods have been frequently used in hydrological studies to provide spatio temporal information on the subsurface from sub meter pedon scales to km watershed scales binley et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 among them the electrical resistivity method received considerable attention e g garré et al 2011 coscia et al 2011 due to the strong influence of water content on the electrical resistivity of geological materials lesmes and friedman 2005 many models have been developed to describe the relationship between resistivity and water content friedman 2005 laloy et al 2011 romero ruiz et al 2022 in particular many physics based models are available including the differential effective medium models sen et al 1981 percolation theory based models ghanbarian et al 2014 and the bundle of capillary tubes models niu et al 2015 recently significant advances have been made in almost all aspects of resistivity method including instrumentation slater and binley 2021 inversion linde and doetsch 2016 and petrophysics day lewis et al 2017 these advances have led to increased use of the resistivity method in estimating moisture content and monitoring hydrologic processes in field applications e g slater and binley 2021 leopold et al 2021 it is also well known that the moisture content estimated from resistivity tomography may contain significant uncertainties mainly due to two factors linde et al 2017 first resistivity inversion is an ill posed problem roy 1962 and many equally good resistivity models exist to fit the measurements to have a unique solution regularizations are usually applied in the inversion zhdanov 2002 to force the optimal model to be close to some specified models or have a smooth variation e g vauhkonen et al 1998 however the applied regularizations may not be realistic for subsurfaces having contrasting properties or sharp boundaries zhou et al 2014 second the relationships between resistivity and moisture content of geological materials are influenced by many material properties such as texture mineralogy and pore water chemistry due to subsurface heterogeneity using one resistivity moisture content relationship to interpret the entire subsurface tends to create significant errors tso et al 2019 sometimes the interpreted moisture content could be erroneous and thus misleading for hydrological applications in the applied geophysics community a number of methods have been developed the address the aforementioned problems to resolve the problem related to regularization many efforts have been devoted to stochastic inversions e g tso et al 2021 and joint inversions linde and doetsch 2016 the most popular strategy in joint inversions is probably the use of the cross gradient constraint doetsch et al 2010 gallardo and meju 2004 which assumes different physical properties e g velocity and resistivity have similar spatial patterns i e structural similarity the second type of method uses the structural information from one data set e g travel time to guide the inversion of a second geophysical data set e g resistivity by manipulating the regularization term in the inversion relevant approaches include image guided inversion e g zhou et al 2014 and regularization relaxation at structural boundaries e g slater and binley 2006 johnson et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 using different resistivity models to estimate moisture content in heterogeneous subsurface is not very common e g gonzález et al 2021 pleasants et al 2022 partially due to the difficulty in determining the actual structural boundaries alternatively a number of studies account for spatial heterogeneity by quantifying the petrophysical uncertainty brunetti et al 2017 brunetti and linde 2018 tso et al 2019 recent advances in structure based resistivity inversions have not been commonly used in moisture estimations with field resistivity measurements therefore this study s objective is to test if the resistivity estimated moisture content can be improved by incorporating structural information into the resistivity inversion and applying structural unit specific resistivity models in the petrophysical interpretation this proposed new approach would be particularly useful for structurally heterogeneous subsurfaces such as critical zone in mountainous regions in this study the structural information will be used in resistivity inversion to relax the smoothness based regularization at structural boundaries in the subsurface doetsch et al 2010 by doing this we may keep the sharp resistivity contrasts across some structural boundaries zhou et al 2014 the structural information of the subsurface can be from geological mapping wellmann et al 2018 borehole logging data wisén et al 2005 or other geophysical results zhou et al 2014 we also use the structural information to perform zonation so that the structural unit specific resistivity model can be applied to reduce the petrophysical uncertainties related to moisture estimations in this study the structure information of the subsurface will be obtained from seismic refraction tomography which has been frequently used in practice to delineate the structural features of shallow subsurface flinchum et al 2018a the paper is organized as follows first we introduce the theories of incorporating structural information into traditional resistivity inversions and conducting the subsequent moisture estimation we then design a synthetic subsurface model for testing our proposed method to quantify the petrophysical uncertainties related to moisture estimation monte carlo simulations are carried out to consider the variability in model parameters of the resistivity moisture content relationships we also test our method using field data collected from a small catchment in western mountain regions of the us major conclusions are summarized at the end of the paper 2 theory this section briefly describes the theoretical background of the proposed strategy of incorporating the structure information extracted from seismic surveys into resistivity inversions we also introduce the new method for moisture estimation and uncertainty quantification using structural unit specific petrophysical models i e resistivity moisture content relationships the workflow of the proposed methods is shown in fig 1 and detailed explanations are described as follows 2 1 smoothness constrained resistivity inversion in electrical resistivity surveys a pair of electrodes are usually used to inject electric current into the subsurface and other electrodes are used to measure the induced electrical potential on the ground surface this process is repeated at different locations with different combinations of electrodes the measurements are usually presented as apparent resistivity data perrone et al 2014 forward modeling of electrical resistivity surveys involves solving the governing equation of electric current flow in heterogeneous materials under appropriate boundary conditions in matrix format the resistivity measurements apparent resistivity data d obtained from a resistivity survey can be expressed as e g pidlisecky and knight 2008 1 d a m where m is the model parameters defining the subsurface resistivity model and a is the relevant forward operator to obtain a unique resistivity model m from d regularized inversions are usually carried out for example the tikhonov regularization e g zhdanov 2002 is often used in resistivity inversion and the object function φ m can be expressed as the sum of two terms 2 φ m φ d m λ φ m m where φ d m quantifies the measurement or data misfit φ m m is the tikhonov regularization term and the parameter λ balances the data misfit and regularization in practice φ d m is usually calculated as the l2 norm of the difference between the observed resistivity data d o b s and theoretical responses d m expressed as 3 φ d m w d d m d o b s 2 where w d is a weighting matrix and its elements are usually related to resistivity measurement errors if the errors are assumed uncorrelated w d will be a diagonal matrix and each diagonal element can be chosen as the inverse of the associated measurement error the regularization term φ m m applies some constraints to the model m and can be written as e g jordi et al 2018 4 φ m m w m s m m r e f 2 where w m s is the constraint matrix for m and m r e f is a reference resistivity model which may contain prior information on the resistivity of the subsurface e g from borehole resistivity logging the constraint matrix w m s is usually chosen as the first or second order gradient operator matrix and thus it imposes a smoothness constraint to the resistivity model m the optimal resistivity model can be obtained by minimizing the objective function φ m in eq 2 this study uses the gauss newton method to determine the optimal resistivity model iteratively günther et al 2006 at step k the model update δ m k to the current resistivity model m k can be determined by solving the following equation e g jordi et al 2018 5 w d j k λ w m s δ m k w d d m k d o b s λ w m s m k m r e f where j k is the jacobian matrix associated with resistivity forward modeling at step k thus the new resistivity model at step k 1 can be updated as m k 1 m k α δ m k where α is a line search parameter that prevents overshooting e g günther et al 2006 this iterative process can be terminated if the model update is negligible or the parameter χ 2 φ d n d where n d is the data length is close to 1 günther et al 2006 2 2 extraction of structural information the structural information of the subsurface can be extracted from a variety of datasets such as seismic images and ground penetrating radar images e g zhou et al 2014 doetsch et al 2012 de pasquale and linde 2017 de pasquale et al 2019 in this study we use seismic refraction tomography to delineate the structural features of the subsurface and the results are then used to constrain the resistivity inversion the results of seismic refraction tomography i e seismic velocity are very sensitive to geological materials microstructure such as grain to grain arrangement e g falcon suarez et al 2020 and the presence of fractures e g han and showman 2008 other factors such as water saturation particularly close to the saturation may also affect the seismic velocity of geological materials e g pride 2005 pasquet et al 2016 nevertheless seismic velocity has been proven effective and is commonly used in earth sciences to characterize the subsurface s structural features and conduct zonation e g befus et al 2011 here we argue seismic surveys contain more structural information than resistivity methods and thus the extracted structures can be used to constrain the resistivity inversion from a mathematical point of view seismic methods refraction or reflection and ground penetrating radar are based on solving the wave equations as a result the vertical resolution is proportional to the inverse of the wavelength and the wave carries impedance information along its entire ray path e g constable 2010 in contrast the resistivity method is based on solving the laplace equation which is a reduced form of the diffusion equation considering a zero frequency the laplace equation describes the potential field problem and the intrinsic resolution becomes almost nonexistent constable 2010 thus structural information contained in seismic results could be used to guide the resistivity inversion to reconstruct the subsurface resistivity distribution to extract the structural information in this study we first invert the first arrival time data to construct the subsurface velocity model in the inversion theoretical travel times can be calculated using conventional ray tracing methods such as shooting e g white 1989 and bending wesson 1971 the velocity model can be updated using the gauss newton method iteratively similarly regularization is imposed to ensure a unique solution here we use an anisotropic smooth matrix which applies different weights to vertical and horizontal directions to improve the vertical resolution e g jiang et al 2020 wagner and uhlemann 2021 it should be addressed that in seismic inversion the regularization mainly influences the inverted velocity values and its influence on the structural features of the velocity model is minor e g zhang and toksöz 1998 jiang and zhang 2017 that said the structural information e g the boundary of structural units extracted from the inverted velocity model is not significantly affected by the selection of regularization schemes e g van avendonk et al 2004 the current practice of determining the subsurface structures from a velocity model is to pick up representative velocity values as the boundaries between different structural units e g st clair et al 2015 flinchum et al 2018b this method may introduce significant biases as the inverted velocity values may be influenced by the selected regularization scheme in this study we propose a new method and we demonstrate it using the velocity data collected from a typical critical zone cz site flinchum et al 2022 as shown in fig 2 we identify the three cz layers regolith fractured bedrock and fresh bedrock from the velocity depth profile by selecting segments featuring a relatively constant velocity gradient red dash lines in fig 2 using the gradient rather than the absolute value of the velocity to distinguish cz layers is supported by the distinct velocity porosity relationships observed in different cz materials see fig 3 in fractured bedrock it is the fracture density that controls the velocity e g boadu and long 1996 boadu 1998 in contrast the velocity of granular material e g in regolith is mainly controlled by the grain to grain contact i e fabric therefore the velocity porosity curve of fractured rocks is much steeper than that of granular materials see fig 3 or empirical equations in zhukov and kuzmin 2020 assuming a simple linear relationship between porosity and depth e g see experimental data in holbrook et al 2019 it is easy to understand that the velocity gradient should differ noticeably in regolith and fractured bedrocks e g see fig 2 2 3 structure constrained resistivity inversion once the structure information is extracted from the velocity image it will be used to constrain the resistivity inversion in this study we follow the method used by rücker 2010 and jiang et al 2020 to incorporate structural information in resistivity inversion the regularization imposed smoothness constraint at boundaries between different structural units can then be removed mathematically the structural information will be added to the constraint matrix w m s to affect the resistivity model m thus the matrix w m s is changed to a new matrix w m c having the following form jiang et al 2020 6 w m c w c w m s where the matrix w c is a diagonal matrix and its elements are 1 for locations within a structural unit but 0 at structural boundaries jiang et al 2020 compared to smoothness based regularization this relaxed regularization can improve geophysical inversion results particularly at the structural boundaries jiang et al 2020 skibbe et al 2021 2 4 estimation of moisture content and relevant uncertainty the reconstructed resistivity image can be translated into moisture content using resistivity moisture content models e g lesmes and friedman 2005 in this study it is proposed to take advantage of the existing petrophysical understanding of cz materials more specifically we will treat different cz layers as different materials and thus each cz layer i e structural unit will have its own resistivity moisture content relationship note that the traditional method usually applies a single resistivity moisture content relationship to the entire subsurface such a simple petrophysical interpretation could induce large uncertainty in the estimated moisture content due to subsurface heterogeneity tso et al 2019 in contrast we use structural unit specific resistivity moisture content relationships which can account for to a certain degree the difference in material texture and mineralogy in different structural units the uncertainty related to the estimated moisture content can be reduced if compared to the traditional method here we use the waxman and smits ws model waxman and smits 1968 doussan and ruy 2009 to link the electrical conductivity σ of geological materials to their volumetric moisture content θ expressed as 7 σ s n f σ w σ s s where σ w is the pore water conductivity s is the water saturation s θ ϕ where ϕ is porosity f is the formation factor f ϕ m where m is the porosity exponent or commonly known as cementation exponent n is the saturation exponent and σ s is the surface conductivity associated with counter ions of the electrical double layer revil and glover 1998 rearranging eq 7 yields an implicit expression for θ 8 σ σ sat p θ ϕ n σ sat s θ ϕ n 1 where σ s a t p σ w f is the conductivity of the soil at saturation contributed by the pore water and σ s a t s σ s f is the conductivity of the soil at saturation contributed from the counter ions of the electrical double layer the sum of σ s a t p and σ s a t s is the saturated soil conductivity σ sat in practice n σ s a t p and σ s a t s can be determined by fitting eq 8 to resistivity measurements of materials at variably saturated conditions the saturation exponent n is related to the pore water connectivity or connectedness e g glover 2017 for unconsolidated materials n ranges between 1 3 and 2 e g schön 2015 for fractured rocks n may be much smaller due to the well connected fractures even within a structural unit the parameters of eq 8 may still vary for materials at different locations using eq 8 with a fixed set of parameters can still induce uncertainty in moisture estimation to quantify this uncertainty we conduct an uncertainty propagation analysis e g aster et al 2005 using the monte carlo mc simulation in the mc analysis the parameters of the ws model in eq 8 will be given a range rather than a single value since in the field electrical resistivity is more often used than electrical conductivity in this study we will use the saturated resistivity ρ s a t 1 σ s a t 1 σ s a t p σ s a t s and saturated resistivity related to surface conduction ρ s a t s 1 σ s a t s to conduct the mc analysis thus for each structural unit we will have four petrophysical parameters i e n ϕ ρ sat and ρ s a t s to estimate the moisture content for a typical cz having three layers regolith fractured bedrock and fresh bedrock we then need 12 parameters among them ρ sat accounts for the combined influence of formation factor f and thus porosity and pore fluid conductivity and ρ s a t s accounts for the combined influence of f and surface conductivity the parameters are randomly drawn from their plausible ranges and are used to convert resistivity into moisture content with many realizations we then can evaluate the possible range for the moisture content it should be addressed that this mc based uncertainty analysis only accounts for the petrophysical uncertainty the uncertainty induced by resistivity inversion may also be quantified for example using the stochastic inversion method e g linde et al 2017 de pasquale et al 2017 de pasquale et al 2019 or the method used in tso et al 2019 3 synthetic example in this section we use a synthetic subsurface model to demonstrate the use of our proposed method for moisture content estimation and uncertainty analysis the estimated moisture content is compared to the true values and the results of the traditional method to show the effectiveness of the new method 3 1 synthetic subsurface model as shown in fig 4 a we design a cz model extending from the stream valley to the ridge with an average slope of 16 this cz model is typical for mountain regions with granitic bedrock e g olona et al 2010 and the subsurface under the hillslope consists of three layers regolith fractured rock and fresh bedrock the regolith layer is composed of unconsolidated materials weathered from the bedrock in the model fig 4a the thickness of regolith is 0 5 m in the valley and increases gradually to 4 0 m under the ridge fractures in the bedrock commonly form as a result of local regional tectonic stresses or frost cracking and in this model the depth of the fractured bedrock layer is 0 5 m in the valley and increases to 5 5 m under the ridge the ranges of the physical properties of the synthetic model are summarized in table 1 here we assume these properties ρ s a t ϕ ρ s a t s and n are different for each cz layer in each cz layer these properties are also depth dependent and spatially correlated e g western et al 2004 for example the regolith and fractured bedrock have a mean saturated resistivity of 170 ω m and 1100 ω m respectively to reflect the fact that the pore space in fractured rocks is generally smaller than that in the regolith regarding the spatial variability of ρ s a t and ϕ we treat them as stationary random functions with uniform probability densities and autocovariance functions e g zhang et al 2003 chen and niu 2021 which are modeled with an exponential covariance model with two correlation lengths vertical and horizontal directions in the synthetic model the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths are 20 m and 2 m respectively and the logarithmic variance of ρ s a t and ϕ are 0 2 and 0 1 respectively only the regolith layer considers the surface conductivity we assume the degree of saturation s in the model increases linearly with depth from s 50 at the ground surface to fully saturation s 100 at the fresh bedrock thus we can generate a heterogeneous moisture content map as shown in fig 4b similar to field conditions flinchum et al 2019 the moisture content in fig 4b is generally high near the ground surface and low in the bedrock using equation 9 and parameters in table 1 we also calculate the resistivity distribution for the synthetic model shown in fig 4c to generate the velocity model we follow the method used in flinchum et al 2018b for regolith we used a velocity model based on hertz mindlin contact theory and modified hashin shtrikman bounds mavko et al 2020 and the effective fluid model mavko et al 2020 and gassmann s fluid substitution equation mavko et al 2020 are used to calculate the velocity at various water saturations e g pasquet et al 2016 flinchum et al 2018b the differential effective medium model e g berryman 1992 for the fractured and fresh bedrock and the results are shown in fig 4d it is noted that these two theoretical models are used only for the purpose of generating realistic velocity values for different materials and other models may also be used synthetic seismic refraction and electrical resistivity tests are simulated on the subsurface model in the modeling 90 geophones and electrodes are collocated on the ground surface with a spacing of 1 m in the seismic refraction test 16 seismic sources are created on the ground surface with 5 m spacing and the travel time of the waves from the source to each geophone is calculated by solving the eikonal equation e g gallardo and meju 2004 in the resistivity survey the wenner array is used and the electrode spacing ranges between 1 m and 30 m we used the software package pygimli https www pygimli org developed by rücker et al 2017 to simulate both seismic and resistivity tests and in total we collected 1424 travel time and 1305 resistivity measurements the travel time and apparent resistivity data are corrupted with 1 normally distributed random noises to account for measurement errors 3 2 seismic results the travel time data are inverted to reconstruct the velocity distribution of the synthetic model during the inversion 1 of the observed travel times are used as the diagonal elements in the matrix w d and λ are 50 and 10 for the horizontal and vertical directions respectively in the inversion the model was discretized into 3200 cells and the reconstructed velocity distribution is shown in fig 5 a in general the reconstructed velocity is quite similar to the true velocity distribution fig 4d and the normalized root mean square deviation between the true and inverted velocity is only 10 in addition the boundary between fresh bedrock and fractured bedrock is clearly identified in fig 5a the regolith fractured bedrock interface may also be located fig 5a although it is less obvious than the fresh bedrock fractured bedrock interface a vertical transect is taken from the velocity model in fig 5a at a distance 68 m and the velocity elevation profile is plotted in fig 5b we use the approach proposed in section 2 2 to determine the structural boundary between regolith fractured rock and fresh bedrock as shown in fig 5b the velocity gradient in regions near the ground surface e g elevation z 35 m is very small and increases to large values in the middle part of the profile 30 m z 35 m we use linear lines to fit the velocity elevation curves in these two regions top two red dash lines in fig 5b and the regolith fractured rock interface can then be determined e g z 36 m in fig 5b similarly the boundary between the fractured and fresh bedrocks is determined as z 30 8 m as shown in fig 5b the associated velocity values for these two interfaces are 1500 m s 1 and 3600 m s 1 we then draw two contour lines with velocity v 1500 m s 1 and 3600 m s 1 in fig 5a to represent the cz structural boundaries for the synthetic model 3 3 resistivity inversion results the obtained structural information is then incorporated into the regularization term eq 6 to improve the resistivity inversion in the inversion the subsurface was discretized into 3200 cells and their resistivity values were optimized using the gauss newtown method the regularization parameter λ was chosen as 50 and 1 of the logarithms of the apparent resistivity values are used as the diagonal elements in the matrix w d günther et al 2006 the optimization process was stopped after 7 iterations the relative misfit between the observed and simulated apparent resistivity is 0 8 the reconstructed resistivity distribution is shown in fig 6 a for comparison we also conducted a traditional resistivity inversion with smoothness based regularization and the regularization term w m s was chosen as the first order gradient matrix the results of the traditional inversion are shown in fig 6b note that there are some other inversion methods that can also consider subsurface structural information in the resistivity inversion such as the image guided inversion zhou et al 2014 and the structure based priors introduced by de pasquale et al 2017 in fig 6a and 6b the true structural boundaries are indicated as solid lines to facilitate discussion in general both resistivity images show a similar pattern consistent with the true resistivity model fig 4c that is the resistivity near the ground surface is much lower than that in the deep regions fig 6 it is also found that the resistivity in the fractured bedrock was well reconstructed in fig 6a using our new method in contrast the traditional inversion gives a very heterogeneous resistivity distribution in each cz layer fig 6b for quantitative analysis we plot the resistivity elevation profiles at a distance 65 m for both traditional and structural constraint inversions fig 6a and 6b it is clear that the resistivity curve from the new method fig 6a agrees better with the true resistivity curve than the traditional method in particular the sharp resistivity contrast at structural boundaries e g at z 36 m and 31 m are well reproduced in fig 6a we use the coefficient of determination r2 value and lin s concordance correlation coefficient e g liao 2003 to quantify how well the reconstructed resistivity curve agrees with the true resistivity curve for fig 6a and 6b right panels the associated r2 values are 0 990 and 0 864 and lin s concordance correlation coefficients are 0 995 and 0 934 respectively this confirms that the structural constraint resistivity inversion improves the resistivity reconstruction 3 4 moisture estimation results we apply the ws model eq 8 to estimate the moisture content based on the reconstructed resistivity image in fig 6a as discussed in section 2 4 our interpretation is different from the traditional method in two aspects first we use different model parameters for different structural units second we do not treat each model parameter as a constant value instead an appropriate variation range is used the mc simulations are conducted to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the moisture content from the resistivity image with the ws model we treat n ρ s a t ρ s a t s and ϕ as random variables linearly distributed in a given range see table 1 that means the mc method here is based on a multivariate uniform distribution in each mc run these model parameters are randomly drawn from their given ranges and are then input into the ws model to convert the resistivity image into the moisture content image in total we conducted 10 000 mc runs and all the realizations are combined to produce the mean moisture content image left panel of fig 7 a and the standard deviation image left panel of fig 7b the standard deviation distribution quantifies the uncertainty of estimated moisture content associated to our incomplete knowledge of the petrophysical properties of geological materials the mean moisture content estimated using the new method left panel of fig 7a shows a similar pattern to the true moisture content distribution fig 4a that is the moisture content is relatively high in regolith and decreases to very low values in deep regions fractured and fresh bedrocks in addition the estimated moisture content is also very close to the true values for instance the average value of the mean moisture content of the entire regolith is 22 5 slightly higher than the true value of 19 5 the overall petrophysical uncertainty of the estimated moisture content is relatively small left panel of fig 7b for instance the variation range of the standard deviation in regolith is 0 02 0 08 and it decreases to 0 0 03 in the fresh bedrock layer the petrophysical uncertainty shown in fig 7a left panel is comparable to other borehole based moisture content measurements such as neutron probe and nuclear magnetic resonance e g schmidt and rempe 2020 this implies that the moisture content could be fairly estimated from resistivity measurements if the resistivity image is reliably reconstructed and structural unit specific petrophysical models are applied in the interpretation in addition we also plot the moisture content elevation profile for the vertical transect at 65 m left panel of fig 7c the sharp moisture content variations at the structural interfaces are clearly captured and the estimated and true moisture content curves are in good agreement with an r2 value of 0 945 and a lin s concordance coefficient of 0 977 for comparison we also estimate the moisture content based on the resistivity image in fig 6b using the traditional method which applies a single petrophysical model to the entire subsurface here we use the regolith s moisture content resistivity relationship to interpret the entire resistivity image similarly the model parameters are considered as random variables linearly distributed in a range the calculated mean and standard deviation of the moisture content is shown in the right panel of fig 7 it appears the traditional method still gives a similar moisture distribution pattern however the absolute values of the estimated moisture content deviate from the true values and have large uncertainty in the deep depth this discrepancy can be clearly seen in the moisture content elevation profile shown in fig 7b right panel and the related r2 value is only 0 804 lin s concordance coefficient is 0 890 in summary the results of the synthetic model show that the uncertainty of moisture content estimation can be significantly reduced if the structural information is incorporated in the resistivity inversion and structural unit specific petrophysical models are used in the resistivity interpretation we conducted a sensitivity analysis using the morris 1991 method which has been successfully applied in other geoelectrical studies e g tso et al 2020 in the analysis the root mean square error between true and estimated moisture content is used as the objective function based on the analysis it is found that porosity ϕ has the largest influence on the moisture content estimation other parameters such as ρ sat n and ρ s a t s have the same level of influence on the moisture content estimation but are less significant than the porosity 4 field example in this section we apply the proposed method to resistivity measurements collected near the ridge of a small catchment in the dry creek experimental watershed idaho us to estimate the moisture content distribution the details of the site condition and geophysical tests are presented we also explain how the structural unit specific petrophysical properties are determined the estimated moisture content is presented and discussed to evaluate the performance of the proposed new method 4 1 site condition and geophysical tests the field site is within a small catchment fig 8 of the dry creek experimental watershed mcnamara et al 2005 located within the boise front range in semiarid southwestern idaho us the bedrock of the watershed is granodiorite of cretaceous paleogene age this region was not glaciated during the pleistocene and soils in the region are mainly formed by in situ weathering of the underlying granite previous studies show that the regolith soil layer is thin ranging from 10 s cm to 2 m poulos 2016 the erosion rate in idaho batholith is about 0 005 mm per year over a 10 year time scale kirchner et al 2001 this indicates the residence time in the weathered profile is at the range of 200 ka allowing regolith to have long term exposure to weathering before being eroded both electrical resistivity and seismic refraction tests have been carried out along and across a ridge of the catchment in june 2020 fig 8 during this time of the year the soil regolith layer is relatively dry with an average volumetric moisture content of 10 mcnamara et al 2005 in geophysical tests we used 72 electrodes and geophones collocated on the ground surface with a spacing of 1 m the syscal pro 72 system iris instruments orléans france with the wenner array was used to collect resistivity data and the total number of apparent resistivity measurements are 936 we chose the wenner array for two reasons 1 compared to the dipole dipole array wenner array has a better resolution in identifying the vertical resistivity variations e g neyamadpour et al 2010 and 2 trial tests at this site show that the wenner array has a higher signal to noise ratio than the dipole dipole array in the seismic tests a sledgehammer was used to generate seismic waves at five locations along each survey line and the geode system geometrics inc ca usa was used to record the seismic responses the shot spacing ranges between 12 m and 30 m and is comparable to those used in near surface seismic refraction tests e g gallardo and meju 2004 flinchum et al 2018a we repeated the shot 10 times at each source location to enhance the signal to noise ratio the measured seismic signal of each geophone was then stacked to form a single trace and the first arrival time was then determined the total number of travel times is 357 4 2 structure identification and resistivity inversion the first arrival time data are inverted to reconstruct the velocity model for the two survey lines in the inversion the regularization parameter λ is chosen as 50 for the horizontal direction and 10 for the vertical direction the data weighting matrix w d is assumed as a diagonal matrix and its elements are the inverse of 3 of the measured travel time the inversion was stopped after 8 and 4 iterations respectively for the profiles across and along the ridge and the relative mean data misfits are 4 and 3 the reconstructed velocity images are shown in fig 9 a and 9b we then use the method proposed in section 2 2 to identify the boundaries of different cz layers fig 9c the regolith fractured bedrock interface is determined as the contour line with v 1000 m s 1 the fractured fresh bedrock interface as the contour line with v 1950 m s 1 note that the selection of these contour values may be subjective but a slight difference does not have a significant effect on the extracted subsurface structural interfaces for instance we compared contour lines with v 900 1000 and 1100 m s 1 for the regolith fractured bedrock and v 1750 1950 and 2150 m s 1 for the fractured fresh bedrock the induced variation in the vertical positions mean value of the regolith fractured bedrock and fractured fresh bedrock is only 0 6 and 1 0 m respectively the fractured bedrock layer shows a clear aspect influence for the survey line across the ridge fig 9a for the southeast facing slope left in the figure the total thickness of regolith and fractured bedrock layers is 15 m in contrast the thickness is only 10 m for the northwest facing slope right in the figure for the survey line along the ridge the total thickness of regolith and fractured bedrock varies along the ridge from 10 m on the right to 20 m on the left as shown in fig 9b the thickness of the regolith layer for both survey lines is between 2 m and 5 m slightly higher than the augur survey results in nearby hillslopes poulos 2016 the structural information is used in the resistivity inversion to relax the smoothness constraint at the boundaries of different cz layers in the inversion the smooth regularization parameter λ is 5 the data weighting matrix is assumed as diagonal and the element is the inverse of 4 6 of the measured apparent resistivity along across the ridge both inversions were stopped after 4 iterations and the related relative data misfits are respectively 10 and 3 for the survey lines across and along the ridge the resistivity inversion results are shown in fig 10 4 3 moisture content results and discussion to interpret the resistivity distribution we need to determine the variation ranges of the model parameters in eq 8 for the site in this study we use existing experimental data of samples collected at the site and published data of other similar materials to constrain these model parameters for porosity ϕ the material near the ground surface has been measured ranging between 30 and 50 geroy et al 2011 considering the decreasing trend of ϕ with depth in the regolith hayes et al 2019 we therefore assume the variation range is from 25 to 50 see table 2 the stream water conductivity σ w at the site is monitored year round and it generally varies between 0 01 and 0 025 s m 1 regolith samples were collected from a soil pit along the ridge at 14 m and their apparent formation factor f a ratio of saturated resistivity over pore water resistivity was found to vary between 1 3 and 2 8 bienvenue 2021 note that the low f a values are due to the presence of clay minerals up to 40 by weight bienvenue 2021 using σ w 0 02 s m 1 ϕ in the range of 25 50 and measured f a values we can determine that the range of the saturated resistivity ρ sat of the regolith varies between 50 and 250 ω m the saturated resistivity of the regolith related to surface conduction ρ s a t s was estimated from lab experimental data and it was in the range between 400 and 3200 ω m the saturation exponent n of regolith samples is assumed to vary between 1 3 and 2 2 a typical range for relatively coarse granular materials e g doussan and ruy 2009 for the porosity of fractured bedrock direct field measurement data are not available results from a site with similar geology rempe and dietrich 2018 indicate that although the pore volume in fractured granite is lower than the regolith developed on bedrock the porosity is still substantial averaging 25 thus we assume the porosity of the fractured bedrock in our site ranges between 15 and 30 assuming the cementation factor m ranges between 1 and 1 2 a typical value for fractured materials e g yue et al 2019 we estimate ρ sat of the fractured bedrock at our site is between 165 and 350 ωm table 2 surface conduction is not considered for both the fractured and fresh bedrock the porosity of intact granite is 1 e g llera et al 1990 considering the presence of microfractures we assume the porosity of the fresh bedrock at our site ranges between 5 and 15 similar to the observations of a granitic gneiss site in holbrook et al 2019 we estimate the cementation exponent m of the fresh bedrock using the experimental data in llera et al 1990 and it gives a value close to 1 based on m and ϕ we can estimate that the range of ρ sat for the fresh bedrock is between 325 and 1000 ω m table 2 for the saturation exponent n we simply assume n m 1 mualem and friedman 1991 all the parameters are summarized in table 2 using archie s law and the model parameters in table 2 we estimate the mean and standard deviation of the moisture content for the field site based on the resistivity image in fig 10 using the mc simulation the results are shown in fig 11 a and 11b respectively for survey lines across and along the ridge the two moisture content images in fig 11 show similar patterns first shallow regolith 1 m has a relatively low moisture content 16 this dry layer is the result of a combined effect of the high evaporation evapotranspiration rate and low precipitation at the site in the summer mcnamara et al 2018 second the perched water an important subsurface water component in runoff generation e g guo et al 2019 mcdonnell et al 2021 is clearly seen at the regolith fractured bedrock interfaces for instance the moisture content at the regolith fractured bedrock interface is considerably high in the right panel of fig 11a at 17 m exceeding 40 this perched water also coincides with the location of a conifer tree at 18 on the ridge in the fractured bedrock the moisture content is relatively high ranging between 15 and 30 this component of groundwater i e rock moisture was historically overlooked in hydrologic studies but recent studies have highlighted its importance in supporting vegetation evapotranspiration during dry seasons rempe and dietrich 2018 within the fractured bedrock small patches with relatively high moisture content can also be found for example at 45 in the left panel of fig 11a and 38 m and 55 m in the right panel of fig 11a these relatively wet regions connect the regolith soil water to fresh bedrock and thus may be the preferential flow path that facilitates the bedrock infiltration kormos et al 2015 the petrophysical uncertainties related to the moisture content estimation are shown in fig 11b in general the uncertainty varies within different cz layers decreasing from 10 in regolith to 2 in the bedrock this decreased uncertainty in deep depth is associated with the smaller variability of resistivity model parameters in bedrocks this result implies that if the petrophysical properties of a structural unit can be better understood the uncertainty related to resistivity estimated moisture content could be reduced 4 4 comparison with the traditional method we also estimate the moisture content of the field site from resistivity measurements using the traditional methods it is noted that in the traditional method no structural information was used to constrain the resistivity inversion and the petrophysical relationship of the regolith is used for the moisture interpretation of the entire subsurface we selected the moisture content elevation profiles of two representative transects x 45 m across the ridge and 17 along the ridge for a direct comparison of the traditional and new methods as shown in fig 12 the new method clearly reveals the sharp moisture contrasts at cz boundaries which have been observed in other granitic czs e g flinchum et al 2019 for example the sudden decrease in moisture content at z 1633 in fig 12 b was not captured with the traditional method thus the traditional method may not identify the perched water at the regolith fractured bedrock interface moreover using a single petrophysical relationship for all the three cz layers significantly overestimates the moisture content in fractured and fresh bedrocks for instance the traditional method gives a moisture content of 20 for rocks 20 m below the ridge in fig 12a in this deep depth the microfractures in the bedrock are less likely to open due to the high confining pressure supported by the large velocity value exceeding 3000 m s 1 thus the moisture stored in deep bedrocks should be limited consistent with the results of the new method direct rock moisture measurements at the site would help validate our interpretation unfortunately no boreholes are installed at the site further studies are recommended to drill boreholes and conduct borehole geophysical logging e g neutron probe or nuclear magnetic resonance such that direct observations of rock moisture can be realized lastly we comment on the field conditions where the proposed method should be used if the subsurface structure is known to be strongly heterogeneous such as at mountainous cz sites it is always preferred to use structural information to constrain the moisture content estimation however if the sites are only slightly heterogeneous such as at unconsolidated aquifers or agricultural fields it is expected that the structural boundaries are not clearly defined and may not be identified with seismic refraction tomography under these conditions using structural information may not improve the moisture content estimation of course the cost is also a concern because both seismic refraction tests in the field and structural based resistivity inversion are more costly than the traditional methods 5 conclusions in this study we proposed to use the subsurface structural information to reduce the uncertainty of moisture content estimation with field resistivity measurements the results of the synthetic subsurface example show that seismic refraction tomography contains enough structural information which can be extracted with the velocity gradient based method from the reconstructed velocity images incorporating the structural information into resistivity inversions can relax the regularization forced smoothing at structural boundaries thus improving the reconstruction of resistivity images in particular the sharp resistivity contrast near structural boundaries is better captured if compared to traditional inversion the synthetic example also shows that the moisture content estimated using structural unit specific petrophysical models gives a similar spatial pattern as the true model in addition to spatial patterns the estimated moisture content values with the new method agree very well with the true moisture content compared to the traditional method that applies a single petrophysical relationship to the entire subsurface the new method shows a better performance the new method has been applied to a granitic hillslope to estimate the moisture content distribution from field resistivity measurements the resistivity estimated moisture content distributions exhibit typical features commonly found in hillslopes such as perched water at the soil rock interface and preferential flow path contributing to groundwater recharge although no ground truth is available for validating the estimated moisture content a comparison with the traditional method results confirms our proposed methods superior performance therefore we conclude that incorporating structural information in resistivity inversion and using structural unit specific petrophysical models can improve the estimation of subsurface moisture content from field resistivity measurements therefore if the subsurface is strongly heterogeneous in structure for example at mountainous cz sites it is preferred to adopt this new method however if the sites are only slightly heterogeneous this new method may not be able to improve the moisture content estimation from resistivity tomography credit authorship contribution statement hang chen validation software

2905,in earth sciences the measurement of soil and rock moisture content is essential in improving our understanding of various hydrologic processes recently the electrical resistivity method has been frequently used to estimate the moisture content in the field the uncertainty associated with resistivity estimated moisture content is mainly from two sources regularized inversion and petrophysical interpretation in this study to reduce the uncertainty we propose 1 to use subsurface structural information from seismic refraction measurements to relax the smoothness based regularization at structural boundaries and 2 to use structural unit specific petrophysical relationships to translate resistivity into moisture content the proposed methods are tested on a synthetic subsurface model featuring three distinct layers of a granitic critical zone cz the results of the synthetic example show that both the spatial pattern and the moisture content values estimated with the new method are very close to the true model with low uncertainty compared to the traditional method the estimation is significantly improved particularly at the cz boundaries such as the regolith fractured bedrock interface we also apply the new method to a granitic hillslope to estimate the moisture content distribution from field resistivity measurements although no ground truth is available for validation the estimated moisture content distributions exhibit some typical hydrological features in hillslopes such as the perched water at the soil rock interface and preferential flow path in fractured rocks therefore it is concluded that incorporating structural information in resistivity inversion and using structural unit specific petrophysical models can improve moisture content estimation from field resistivity measurements keywords moisture content electrical resistivity monte carlo constrained inversion subsurface structure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the shallow subsurface weathering of bedrock results in a physically mobile granular surface mantle that lacks relict rock structure pope 2015 usually termed as soil or regolith the soil layer plays a critical role in the terrestrial water cycles by influencing the partitioning of precipitation between soil moisture evaporation evapotranspiration deep infiltration contributing to groundwater recharge and runoff brooks et al 2015 with advances in measurement techniques e g robinson et al 2008 soil moisture has become a regular state variable in many hydrologic ecologic and climate models dorigo et al 2011 recently it has been realized that the fractured bedrock beneath the soil or regolith layer also influences groundwater recharge evapotranspiration base flow and stream water chemistry e g rempe and dietrich 2018 thus many efforts have been made to incorporate rock moisture as a state variable into hydrologic ecological and climate models e g ackerer et al 2021 in this regard soil and rock moisture measurements are essential in improving our understanding of various hydrologic processes and our projections of earth s water resources soil moisture can be measured either with satellite remote sensing techniques mohanty et al 2017 or in situ for example using soil moisture probes sensors dobriyal et al 2012 remote sensing can cover a large region and thus the measured soil moisture data are valuable for the calibration and verification of large scale hydrologic modeling vischel et al 2008 sánchez et al 2010 the primary limitation of satellite based remote sensing is that the moisture data are only available for near surface soils 5 cm in contrast soil moisture probes sensors e g time domain reflectometry installed in soil pits can reach down to the bedrock and showed excellent vertical resolutions e g heimovaara and bouten 1990 if these moisture probes are distributed over large regions to form a soil moisture monitoring network e g benninga et al 2018 the spatial temporal soil moisture patterns can be revealed the monitored soil moisture data can also be used for the calibration and verification of distributed hydrologic models one limitation of this point based soil moisture measurement is the limited support volume cm3 which is inconsistent with the mesh volume used in most hydrologic models from m3 to km3 rock moisture measurement has been conducted in the field in many ecohydrological studies the current practice is to measure in boreholes using non destructive geophysical techniques such as the neutron probe rempe and dietrich 2018 hahm et al 2020 and nuclear magnetic resonance schmidt and rempe 2020 the typical support volume of these borehole based tools is m3 and the instrument can be lowered down to 10 s m with a vertical resolution of 25 cm e g hahm et al 2020 such rock moisture data are critical for understanding the role of fractured bedrock in regulating the ecohydrological partitioning at the land surface brooks et al 2015 however one primary drawback of the borehole based rock moisture measurement is the high cost which prohibits the establishment of a monitoring network for watershed or catchment scale applications given the limitations of existing soil and rock moisture measurement techniques there is a need to develop cost effective techniques that can measure soil and rock moisture content at an intermediate scale from hillslope to catchment scale with a high vertical resolution near surface geophysical methods have been frequently used in hydrological studies to provide spatio temporal information on the subsurface from sub meter pedon scales to km watershed scales binley et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 among them the electrical resistivity method received considerable attention e g garré et al 2011 coscia et al 2011 due to the strong influence of water content on the electrical resistivity of geological materials lesmes and friedman 2005 many models have been developed to describe the relationship between resistivity and water content friedman 2005 laloy et al 2011 romero ruiz et al 2022 in particular many physics based models are available including the differential effective medium models sen et al 1981 percolation theory based models ghanbarian et al 2014 and the bundle of capillary tubes models niu et al 2015 recently significant advances have been made in almost all aspects of resistivity method including instrumentation slater and binley 2021 inversion linde and doetsch 2016 and petrophysics day lewis et al 2017 these advances have led to increased use of the resistivity method in estimating moisture content and monitoring hydrologic processes in field applications e g slater and binley 2021 leopold et al 2021 it is also well known that the moisture content estimated from resistivity tomography may contain significant uncertainties mainly due to two factors linde et al 2017 first resistivity inversion is an ill posed problem roy 1962 and many equally good resistivity models exist to fit the measurements to have a unique solution regularizations are usually applied in the inversion zhdanov 2002 to force the optimal model to be close to some specified models or have a smooth variation e g vauhkonen et al 1998 however the applied regularizations may not be realistic for subsurfaces having contrasting properties or sharp boundaries zhou et al 2014 second the relationships between resistivity and moisture content of geological materials are influenced by many material properties such as texture mineralogy and pore water chemistry due to subsurface heterogeneity using one resistivity moisture content relationship to interpret the entire subsurface tends to create significant errors tso et al 2019 sometimes the interpreted moisture content could be erroneous and thus misleading for hydrological applications in the applied geophysics community a number of methods have been developed the address the aforementioned problems to resolve the problem related to regularization many efforts have been devoted to stochastic inversions e g tso et al 2021 and joint inversions linde and doetsch 2016 the most popular strategy in joint inversions is probably the use of the cross gradient constraint doetsch et al 2010 gallardo and meju 2004 which assumes different physical properties e g velocity and resistivity have similar spatial patterns i e structural similarity the second type of method uses the structural information from one data set e g travel time to guide the inversion of a second geophysical data set e g resistivity by manipulating the regularization term in the inversion relevant approaches include image guided inversion e g zhou et al 2014 and regularization relaxation at structural boundaries e g slater and binley 2006 johnson et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 using different resistivity models to estimate moisture content in heterogeneous subsurface is not very common e g gonzález et al 2021 pleasants et al 2022 partially due to the difficulty in determining the actual structural boundaries alternatively a number of studies account for spatial heterogeneity by quantifying the petrophysical uncertainty brunetti et al 2017 brunetti and linde 2018 tso et al 2019 recent advances in structure based resistivity inversions have not been commonly used in moisture estimations with field resistivity measurements therefore this study s objective is to test if the resistivity estimated moisture content can be improved by incorporating structural information into the resistivity inversion and applying structural unit specific resistivity models in the petrophysical interpretation this proposed new approach would be particularly useful for structurally heterogeneous subsurfaces such as critical zone in mountainous regions in this study the structural information will be used in resistivity inversion to relax the smoothness based regularization at structural boundaries in the subsurface doetsch et al 2010 by doing this we may keep the sharp resistivity contrasts across some structural boundaries zhou et al 2014 the structural information of the subsurface can be from geological mapping wellmann et al 2018 borehole logging data wisén et al 2005 or other geophysical results zhou et al 2014 we also use the structural information to perform zonation so that the structural unit specific resistivity model can be applied to reduce the petrophysical uncertainties related to moisture estimations in this study the structure information of the subsurface will be obtained from seismic refraction tomography which has been frequently used in practice to delineate the structural features of shallow subsurface flinchum et al 2018a the paper is organized as follows first we introduce the theories of incorporating structural information into traditional resistivity inversions and conducting the subsequent moisture estimation we then design a synthetic subsurface model for testing our proposed method to quantify the petrophysical uncertainties related to moisture estimation monte carlo simulations are carried out to consider the variability in model parameters of the resistivity moisture content relationships we also test our method using field data collected from a small catchment in western mountain regions of the us major conclusions are summarized at the end of the paper 2 theory this section briefly describes the theoretical background of the proposed strategy of incorporating the structure information extracted from seismic surveys into resistivity inversions we also introduce the new method for moisture estimation and uncertainty quantification using structural unit specific petrophysical models i e resistivity moisture content relationships the workflow of the proposed methods is shown in fig 1 and detailed explanations are described as follows 2 1 smoothness constrained resistivity inversion in electrical resistivity surveys a pair of electrodes are usually used to inject electric current into the subsurface and other electrodes are used to measure the induced electrical potential on the ground surface this process is repeated at different locations with different combinations of electrodes the measurements are usually presented as apparent resistivity data perrone et al 2014 forward modeling of electrical resistivity surveys involves solving the governing equation of electric current flow in heterogeneous materials under appropriate boundary conditions in matrix format the resistivity measurements apparent resistivity data d obtained from a resistivity survey can be expressed as e g pidlisecky and knight 2008 1 d a m where m is the model parameters defining the subsurface resistivity model and a is the relevant forward operator to obtain a unique resistivity model m from d regularized inversions are usually carried out for example the tikhonov regularization e g zhdanov 2002 is often used in resistivity inversion and the object function φ m can be expressed as the sum of two terms 2 φ m φ d m λ φ m m where φ d m quantifies the measurement or data misfit φ m m is the tikhonov regularization term and the parameter λ balances the data misfit and regularization in practice φ d m is usually calculated as the l2 norm of the difference between the observed resistivity data d o b s and theoretical responses d m expressed as 3 φ d m w d d m d o b s 2 where w d is a weighting matrix and its elements are usually related to resistivity measurement errors if the errors are assumed uncorrelated w d will be a diagonal matrix and each diagonal element can be chosen as the inverse of the associated measurement error the regularization term φ m m applies some constraints to the model m and can be written as e g jordi et al 2018 4 φ m m w m s m m r e f 2 where w m s is the constraint matrix for m and m r e f is a reference resistivity model which may contain prior information on the resistivity of the subsurface e g from borehole resistivity logging the constraint matrix w m s is usually chosen as the first or second order gradient operator matrix and thus it imposes a smoothness constraint to the resistivity model m the optimal resistivity model can be obtained by minimizing the objective function φ m in eq 2 this study uses the gauss newton method to determine the optimal resistivity model iteratively günther et al 2006 at step k the model update δ m k to the current resistivity model m k can be determined by solving the following equation e g jordi et al 2018 5 w d j k λ w m s δ m k w d d m k d o b s λ w m s m k m r e f where j k is the jacobian matrix associated with resistivity forward modeling at step k thus the new resistivity model at step k 1 can be updated as m k 1 m k α δ m k where α is a line search parameter that prevents overshooting e g günther et al 2006 this iterative process can be terminated if the model update is negligible or the parameter χ 2 φ d n d where n d is the data length is close to 1 günther et al 2006 2 2 extraction of structural information the structural information of the subsurface can be extracted from a variety of datasets such as seismic images and ground penetrating radar images e g zhou et al 2014 doetsch et al 2012 de pasquale and linde 2017 de pasquale et al 2019 in this study we use seismic refraction tomography to delineate the structural features of the subsurface and the results are then used to constrain the resistivity inversion the results of seismic refraction tomography i e seismic velocity are very sensitive to geological materials microstructure such as grain to grain arrangement e g falcon suarez et al 2020 and the presence of fractures e g han and showman 2008 other factors such as water saturation particularly close to the saturation may also affect the seismic velocity of geological materials e g pride 2005 pasquet et al 2016 nevertheless seismic velocity has been proven effective and is commonly used in earth sciences to characterize the subsurface s structural features and conduct zonation e g befus et al 2011 here we argue seismic surveys contain more structural information than resistivity methods and thus the extracted structures can be used to constrain the resistivity inversion from a mathematical point of view seismic methods refraction or reflection and ground penetrating radar are based on solving the wave equations as a result the vertical resolution is proportional to the inverse of the wavelength and the wave carries impedance information along its entire ray path e g constable 2010 in contrast the resistivity method is based on solving the laplace equation which is a reduced form of the diffusion equation considering a zero frequency the laplace equation describes the potential field problem and the intrinsic resolution becomes almost nonexistent constable 2010 thus structural information contained in seismic results could be used to guide the resistivity inversion to reconstruct the subsurface resistivity distribution to extract the structural information in this study we first invert the first arrival time data to construct the subsurface velocity model in the inversion theoretical travel times can be calculated using conventional ray tracing methods such as shooting e g white 1989 and bending wesson 1971 the velocity model can be updated using the gauss newton method iteratively similarly regularization is imposed to ensure a unique solution here we use an anisotropic smooth matrix which applies different weights to vertical and horizontal directions to improve the vertical resolution e g jiang et al 2020 wagner and uhlemann 2021 it should be addressed that in seismic inversion the regularization mainly influences the inverted velocity values and its influence on the structural features of the velocity model is minor e g zhang and toksöz 1998 jiang and zhang 2017 that said the structural information e g the boundary of structural units extracted from the inverted velocity model is not significantly affected by the selection of regularization schemes e g van avendonk et al 2004 the current practice of determining the subsurface structures from a velocity model is to pick up representative velocity values as the boundaries between different structural units e g st clair et al 2015 flinchum et al 2018b this method may introduce significant biases as the inverted velocity values may be influenced by the selected regularization scheme in this study we propose a new method and we demonstrate it using the velocity data collected from a typical critical zone cz site flinchum et al 2022 as shown in fig 2 we identify the three cz layers regolith fractured bedrock and fresh bedrock from the velocity depth profile by selecting segments featuring a relatively constant velocity gradient red dash lines in fig 2 using the gradient rather than the absolute value of the velocity to distinguish cz layers is supported by the distinct velocity porosity relationships observed in different cz materials see fig 3 in fractured bedrock it is the fracture density that controls the velocity e g boadu and long 1996 boadu 1998 in contrast the velocity of granular material e g in regolith is mainly controlled by the grain to grain contact i e fabric therefore the velocity porosity curve of fractured rocks is much steeper than that of granular materials see fig 3 or empirical equations in zhukov and kuzmin 2020 assuming a simple linear relationship between porosity and depth e g see experimental data in holbrook et al 2019 it is easy to understand that the velocity gradient should differ noticeably in regolith and fractured bedrocks e g see fig 2 2 3 structure constrained resistivity inversion once the structure information is extracted from the velocity image it will be used to constrain the resistivity inversion in this study we follow the method used by rücker 2010 and jiang et al 2020 to incorporate structural information in resistivity inversion the regularization imposed smoothness constraint at boundaries between different structural units can then be removed mathematically the structural information will be added to the constraint matrix w m s to affect the resistivity model m thus the matrix w m s is changed to a new matrix w m c having the following form jiang et al 2020 6 w m c w c w m s where the matrix w c is a diagonal matrix and its elements are 1 for locations within a structural unit but 0 at structural boundaries jiang et al 2020 compared to smoothness based regularization this relaxed regularization can improve geophysical inversion results particularly at the structural boundaries jiang et al 2020 skibbe et al 2021 2 4 estimation of moisture content and relevant uncertainty the reconstructed resistivity image can be translated into moisture content using resistivity moisture content models e g lesmes and friedman 2005 in this study it is proposed to take advantage of the existing petrophysical understanding of cz materials more specifically we will treat different cz layers as different materials and thus each cz layer i e structural unit will have its own resistivity moisture content relationship note that the traditional method usually applies a single resistivity moisture content relationship to the entire subsurface such a simple petrophysical interpretation could induce large uncertainty in the estimated moisture content due to subsurface heterogeneity tso et al 2019 in contrast we use structural unit specific resistivity moisture content relationships which can account for to a certain degree the difference in material texture and mineralogy in different structural units the uncertainty related to the estimated moisture content can be reduced if compared to the traditional method here we use the waxman and smits ws model waxman and smits 1968 doussan and ruy 2009 to link the electrical conductivity σ of geological materials to their volumetric moisture content θ expressed as 7 σ s n f σ w σ s s where σ w is the pore water conductivity s is the water saturation s θ ϕ where ϕ is porosity f is the formation factor f ϕ m where m is the porosity exponent or commonly known as cementation exponent n is the saturation exponent and σ s is the surface conductivity associated with counter ions of the electrical double layer revil and glover 1998 rearranging eq 7 yields an implicit expression for θ 8 σ σ sat p θ ϕ n σ sat s θ ϕ n 1 where σ s a t p σ w f is the conductivity of the soil at saturation contributed by the pore water and σ s a t s σ s f is the conductivity of the soil at saturation contributed from the counter ions of the electrical double layer the sum of σ s a t p and σ s a t s is the saturated soil conductivity σ sat in practice n σ s a t p and σ s a t s can be determined by fitting eq 8 to resistivity measurements of materials at variably saturated conditions the saturation exponent n is related to the pore water connectivity or connectedness e g glover 2017 for unconsolidated materials n ranges between 1 3 and 2 e g schön 2015 for fractured rocks n may be much smaller due to the well connected fractures even within a structural unit the parameters of eq 8 may still vary for materials at different locations using eq 8 with a fixed set of parameters can still induce uncertainty in moisture estimation to quantify this uncertainty we conduct an uncertainty propagation analysis e g aster et al 2005 using the monte carlo mc simulation in the mc analysis the parameters of the ws model in eq 8 will be given a range rather than a single value since in the field electrical resistivity is more often used than electrical conductivity in this study we will use the saturated resistivity ρ s a t 1 σ s a t 1 σ s a t p σ s a t s and saturated resistivity related to surface conduction ρ s a t s 1 σ s a t s to conduct the mc analysis thus for each structural unit we will have four petrophysical parameters i e n ϕ ρ sat and ρ s a t s to estimate the moisture content for a typical cz having three layers regolith fractured bedrock and fresh bedrock we then need 12 parameters among them ρ sat accounts for the combined influence of formation factor f and thus porosity and pore fluid conductivity and ρ s a t s accounts for the combined influence of f and surface conductivity the parameters are randomly drawn from their plausible ranges and are used to convert resistivity into moisture content with many realizations we then can evaluate the possible range for the moisture content it should be addressed that this mc based uncertainty analysis only accounts for the petrophysical uncertainty the uncertainty induced by resistivity inversion may also be quantified for example using the stochastic inversion method e g linde et al 2017 de pasquale et al 2017 de pasquale et al 2019 or the method used in tso et al 2019 3 synthetic example in this section we use a synthetic subsurface model to demonstrate the use of our proposed method for moisture content estimation and uncertainty analysis the estimated moisture content is compared to the true values and the results of the traditional method to show the effectiveness of the new method 3 1 synthetic subsurface model as shown in fig 4 a we design a cz model extending from the stream valley to the ridge with an average slope of 16 this cz model is typical for mountain regions with granitic bedrock e g olona et al 2010 and the subsurface under the hillslope consists of three layers regolith fractured rock and fresh bedrock the regolith layer is composed of unconsolidated materials weathered from the bedrock in the model fig 4a the thickness of regolith is 0 5 m in the valley and increases gradually to 4 0 m under the ridge fractures in the bedrock commonly form as a result of local regional tectonic stresses or frost cracking and in this model the depth of the fractured bedrock layer is 0 5 m in the valley and increases to 5 5 m under the ridge the ranges of the physical properties of the synthetic model are summarized in table 1 here we assume these properties ρ s a t ϕ ρ s a t s and n are different for each cz layer in each cz layer these properties are also depth dependent and spatially correlated e g western et al 2004 for example the regolith and fractured bedrock have a mean saturated resistivity of 170 ω m and 1100 ω m respectively to reflect the fact that the pore space in fractured rocks is generally smaller than that in the regolith regarding the spatial variability of ρ s a t and ϕ we treat them as stationary random functions with uniform probability densities and autocovariance functions e g zhang et al 2003 chen and niu 2021 which are modeled with an exponential covariance model with two correlation lengths vertical and horizontal directions in the synthetic model the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths are 20 m and 2 m respectively and the logarithmic variance of ρ s a t and ϕ are 0 2 and 0 1 respectively only the regolith layer considers the surface conductivity we assume the degree of saturation s in the model increases linearly with depth from s 50 at the ground surface to fully saturation s 100 at the fresh bedrock thus we can generate a heterogeneous moisture content map as shown in fig 4b similar to field conditions flinchum et al 2019 the moisture content in fig 4b is generally high near the ground surface and low in the bedrock using equation 9 and parameters in table 1 we also calculate the resistivity distribution for the synthetic model shown in fig 4c to generate the velocity model we follow the method used in flinchum et al 2018b for regolith we used a velocity model based on hertz mindlin contact theory and modified hashin shtrikman bounds mavko et al 2020 and the effective fluid model mavko et al 2020 and gassmann s fluid substitution equation mavko et al 2020 are used to calculate the velocity at various water saturations e g pasquet et al 2016 flinchum et al 2018b the differential effective medium model e g berryman 1992 for the fractured and fresh bedrock and the results are shown in fig 4d it is noted that these two theoretical models are used only for the purpose of generating realistic velocity values for different materials and other models may also be used synthetic seismic refraction and electrical resistivity tests are simulated on the subsurface model in the modeling 90 geophones and electrodes are collocated on the ground surface with a spacing of 1 m in the seismic refraction test 16 seismic sources are created on the ground surface with 5 m spacing and the travel time of the waves from the source to each geophone is calculated by solving the eikonal equation e g gallardo and meju 2004 in the resistivity survey the wenner array is used and the electrode spacing ranges between 1 m and 30 m we used the software package pygimli https www pygimli org developed by rücker et al 2017 to simulate both seismic and resistivity tests and in total we collected 1424 travel time and 1305 resistivity measurements the travel time and apparent resistivity data are corrupted with 1 normally distributed random noises to account for measurement errors 3 2 seismic results the travel time data are inverted to reconstruct the velocity distribution of the synthetic model during the inversion 1 of the observed travel times are used as the diagonal elements in the matrix w d and λ are 50 and 10 for the horizontal and vertical directions respectively in the inversion the model was discretized into 3200 cells and the reconstructed velocity distribution is shown in fig 5 a in general the reconstructed velocity is quite similar to the true velocity distribution fig 4d and the normalized root mean square deviation between the true and inverted velocity is only 10 in addition the boundary between fresh bedrock and fractured bedrock is clearly identified in fig 5a the regolith fractured bedrock interface may also be located fig 5a although it is less obvious than the fresh bedrock fractured bedrock interface a vertical transect is taken from the velocity model in fig 5a at a distance 68 m and the velocity elevation profile is plotted in fig 5b we use the approach proposed in section 2 2 to determine the structural boundary between regolith fractured rock and fresh bedrock as shown in fig 5b the velocity gradient in regions near the ground surface e g elevation z 35 m is very small and increases to large values in the middle part of the profile 30 m z 35 m we use linear lines to fit the velocity elevation curves in these two regions top two red dash lines in fig 5b and the regolith fractured rock interface can then be determined e g z 36 m in fig 5b similarly the boundary between the fractured and fresh bedrocks is determined as z 30 8 m as shown in fig 5b the associated velocity values for these two interfaces are 1500 m s 1 and 3600 m s 1 we then draw two contour lines with velocity v 1500 m s 1 and 3600 m s 1 in fig 5a to represent the cz structural boundaries for the synthetic model 3 3 resistivity inversion results the obtained structural information is then incorporated into the regularization term eq 6 to improve the resistivity inversion in the inversion the subsurface was discretized into 3200 cells and their resistivity values were optimized using the gauss newtown method the regularization parameter λ was chosen as 50 and 1 of the logarithms of the apparent resistivity values are used as the diagonal elements in the matrix w d günther et al 2006 the optimization process was stopped after 7 iterations the relative misfit between the observed and simulated apparent resistivity is 0 8 the reconstructed resistivity distribution is shown in fig 6 a for comparison we also conducted a traditional resistivity inversion with smoothness based regularization and the regularization term w m s was chosen as the first order gradient matrix the results of the traditional inversion are shown in fig 6b note that there are some other inversion methods that can also consider subsurface structural information in the resistivity inversion such as the image guided inversion zhou et al 2014 and the structure based priors introduced by de pasquale et al 2017 in fig 6a and 6b the true structural boundaries are indicated as solid lines to facilitate discussion in general both resistivity images show a similar pattern consistent with the true resistivity model fig 4c that is the resistivity near the ground surface is much lower than that in the deep regions fig 6 it is also found that the resistivity in the fractured bedrock was well reconstructed in fig 6a using our new method in contrast the traditional inversion gives a very heterogeneous resistivity distribution in each cz layer fig 6b for quantitative analysis we plot the resistivity elevation profiles at a distance 65 m for both traditional and structural constraint inversions fig 6a and 6b it is clear that the resistivity curve from the new method fig 6a agrees better with the true resistivity curve than the traditional method in particular the sharp resistivity contrast at structural boundaries e g at z 36 m and 31 m are well reproduced in fig 6a we use the coefficient of determination r2 value and lin s concordance correlation coefficient e g liao 2003 to quantify how well the reconstructed resistivity curve agrees with the true resistivity curve for fig 6a and 6b right panels the associated r2 values are 0 990 and 0 864 and lin s concordance correlation coefficients are 0 995 and 0 934 respectively this confirms that the structural constraint resistivity inversion improves the resistivity reconstruction 3 4 moisture estimation results we apply the ws model eq 8 to estimate the moisture content based on the reconstructed resistivity image in fig 6a as discussed in section 2 4 our interpretation is different from the traditional method in two aspects first we use different model parameters for different structural units second we do not treat each model parameter as a constant value instead an appropriate variation range is used the mc simulations are conducted to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the moisture content from the resistivity image with the ws model we treat n ρ s a t ρ s a t s and ϕ as random variables linearly distributed in a given range see table 1 that means the mc method here is based on a multivariate uniform distribution in each mc run these model parameters are randomly drawn from their given ranges and are then input into the ws model to convert the resistivity image into the moisture content image in total we conducted 10 000 mc runs and all the realizations are combined to produce the mean moisture content image left panel of fig 7 a and the standard deviation image left panel of fig 7b the standard deviation distribution quantifies the uncertainty of estimated moisture content associated to our incomplete knowledge of the petrophysical properties of geological materials the mean moisture content estimated using the new method left panel of fig 7a shows a similar pattern to the true moisture content distribution fig 4a that is the moisture content is relatively high in regolith and decreases to very low values in deep regions fractured and fresh bedrocks in addition the estimated moisture content is also very close to the true values for instance the average value of the mean moisture content of the entire regolith is 22 5 slightly higher than the true value of 19 5 the overall petrophysical uncertainty of the estimated moisture content is relatively small left panel of fig 7b for instance the variation range of the standard deviation in regolith is 0 02 0 08 and it decreases to 0 0 03 in the fresh bedrock layer the petrophysical uncertainty shown in fig 7a left panel is comparable to other borehole based moisture content measurements such as neutron probe and nuclear magnetic resonance e g schmidt and rempe 2020 this implies that the moisture content could be fairly estimated from resistivity measurements if the resistivity image is reliably reconstructed and structural unit specific petrophysical models are applied in the interpretation in addition we also plot the moisture content elevation profile for the vertical transect at 65 m left panel of fig 7c the sharp moisture content variations at the structural interfaces are clearly captured and the estimated and true moisture content curves are in good agreement with an r2 value of 0 945 and a lin s concordance coefficient of 0 977 for comparison we also estimate the moisture content based on the resistivity image in fig 6b using the traditional method which applies a single petrophysical model to the entire subsurface here we use the regolith s moisture content resistivity relationship to interpret the entire resistivity image similarly the model parameters are considered as random variables linearly distributed in a range the calculated mean and standard deviation of the moisture content is shown in the right panel of fig 7 it appears the traditional method still gives a similar moisture distribution pattern however the absolute values of the estimated moisture content deviate from the true values and have large uncertainty in the deep depth this discrepancy can be clearly seen in the moisture content elevation profile shown in fig 7b right panel and the related r2 value is only 0 804 lin s concordance coefficient is 0 890 in summary the results of the synthetic model show that the uncertainty of moisture content estimation can be significantly reduced if the structural information is incorporated in the resistivity inversion and structural unit specific petrophysical models are used in the resistivity interpretation we conducted a sensitivity analysis using the morris 1991 method which has been successfully applied in other geoelectrical studies e g tso et al 2020 in the analysis the root mean square error between true and estimated moisture content is used as the objective function based on the analysis it is found that porosity ϕ has the largest influence on the moisture content estimation other parameters such as ρ sat n and ρ s a t s have the same level of influence on the moisture content estimation but are less significant than the porosity 4 field example in this section we apply the proposed method to resistivity measurements collected near the ridge of a small catchment in the dry creek experimental watershed idaho us to estimate the moisture content distribution the details of the site condition and geophysical tests are presented we also explain how the structural unit specific petrophysical properties are determined the estimated moisture content is presented and discussed to evaluate the performance of the proposed new method 4 1 site condition and geophysical tests the field site is within a small catchment fig 8 of the dry creek experimental watershed mcnamara et al 2005 located within the boise front range in semiarid southwestern idaho us the bedrock of the watershed is granodiorite of cretaceous paleogene age this region was not glaciated during the pleistocene and soils in the region are mainly formed by in situ weathering of the underlying granite previous studies show that the regolith soil layer is thin ranging from 10 s cm to 2 m poulos 2016 the erosion rate in idaho batholith is about 0 005 mm per year over a 10 year time scale kirchner et al 2001 this indicates the residence time in the weathered profile is at the range of 200 ka allowing regolith to have long term exposure to weathering before being eroded both electrical resistivity and seismic refraction tests have been carried out along and across a ridge of the catchment in june 2020 fig 8 during this time of the year the soil regolith layer is relatively dry with an average volumetric moisture content of 10 mcnamara et al 2005 in geophysical tests we used 72 electrodes and geophones collocated on the ground surface with a spacing of 1 m the syscal pro 72 system iris instruments orléans france with the wenner array was used to collect resistivity data and the total number of apparent resistivity measurements are 936 we chose the wenner array for two reasons 1 compared to the dipole dipole array wenner array has a better resolution in identifying the vertical resistivity variations e g neyamadpour et al 2010 and 2 trial tests at this site show that the wenner array has a higher signal to noise ratio than the dipole dipole array in the seismic tests a sledgehammer was used to generate seismic waves at five locations along each survey line and the geode system geometrics inc ca usa was used to record the seismic responses the shot spacing ranges between 12 m and 30 m and is comparable to those used in near surface seismic refraction tests e g gallardo and meju 2004 flinchum et al 2018a we repeated the shot 10 times at each source location to enhance the signal to noise ratio the measured seismic signal of each geophone was then stacked to form a single trace and the first arrival time was then determined the total number of travel times is 357 4 2 structure identification and resistivity inversion the first arrival time data are inverted to reconstruct the velocity model for the two survey lines in the inversion the regularization parameter λ is chosen as 50 for the horizontal direction and 10 for the vertical direction the data weighting matrix w d is assumed as a diagonal matrix and its elements are the inverse of 3 of the measured travel time the inversion was stopped after 8 and 4 iterations respectively for the profiles across and along the ridge and the relative mean data misfits are 4 and 3 the reconstructed velocity images are shown in fig 9 a and 9b we then use the method proposed in section 2 2 to identify the boundaries of different cz layers fig 9c the regolith fractured bedrock interface is determined as the contour line with v 1000 m s 1 the fractured fresh bedrock interface as the contour line with v 1950 m s 1 note that the selection of these contour values may be subjective but a slight difference does not have a significant effect on the extracted subsurface structural interfaces for instance we compared contour lines with v 900 1000 and 1100 m s 1 for the regolith fractured bedrock and v 1750 1950 and 2150 m s 1 for the fractured fresh bedrock the induced variation in the vertical positions mean value of the regolith fractured bedrock and fractured fresh bedrock is only 0 6 and 1 0 m respectively the fractured bedrock layer shows a clear aspect influence for the survey line across the ridge fig 9a for the southeast facing slope left in the figure the total thickness of regolith and fractured bedrock layers is 15 m in contrast the thickness is only 10 m for the northwest facing slope right in the figure for the survey line along the ridge the total thickness of regolith and fractured bedrock varies along the ridge from 10 m on the right to 20 m on the left as shown in fig 9b the thickness of the regolith layer for both survey lines is between 2 m and 5 m slightly higher than the augur survey results in nearby hillslopes poulos 2016 the structural information is used in the resistivity inversion to relax the smoothness constraint at the boundaries of different cz layers in the inversion the smooth regularization parameter λ is 5 the data weighting matrix is assumed as diagonal and the element is the inverse of 4 6 of the measured apparent resistivity along across the ridge both inversions were stopped after 4 iterations and the related relative data misfits are respectively 10 and 3 for the survey lines across and along the ridge the resistivity inversion results are shown in fig 10 4 3 moisture content results and discussion to interpret the resistivity distribution we need to determine the variation ranges of the model parameters in eq 8 for the site in this study we use existing experimental data of samples collected at the site and published data of other similar materials to constrain these model parameters for porosity ϕ the material near the ground surface has been measured ranging between 30 and 50 geroy et al 2011 considering the decreasing trend of ϕ with depth in the regolith hayes et al 2019 we therefore assume the variation range is from 25 to 50 see table 2 the stream water conductivity σ w at the site is monitored year round and it generally varies between 0 01 and 0 025 s m 1 regolith samples were collected from a soil pit along the ridge at 14 m and their apparent formation factor f a ratio of saturated resistivity over pore water resistivity was found to vary between 1 3 and 2 8 bienvenue 2021 note that the low f a values are due to the presence of clay minerals up to 40 by weight bienvenue 2021 using σ w 0 02 s m 1 ϕ in the range of 25 50 and measured f a values we can determine that the range of the saturated resistivity ρ sat of the regolith varies between 50 and 250 ω m the saturated resistivity of the regolith related to surface conduction ρ s a t s was estimated from lab experimental data and it was in the range between 400 and 3200 ω m the saturation exponent n of regolith samples is assumed to vary between 1 3 and 2 2 a typical range for relatively coarse granular materials e g doussan and ruy 2009 for the porosity of fractured bedrock direct field measurement data are not available results from a site with similar geology rempe and dietrich 2018 indicate that although the pore volume in fractured granite is lower than the regolith developed on bedrock the porosity is still substantial averaging 25 thus we assume the porosity of the fractured bedrock in our site ranges between 15 and 30 assuming the cementation factor m ranges between 1 and 1 2 a typical value for fractured materials e g yue et al 2019 we estimate ρ sat of the fractured bedrock at our site is between 165 and 350 ωm table 2 surface conduction is not considered for both the fractured and fresh bedrock the porosity of intact granite is 1 e g llera et al 1990 considering the presence of microfractures we assume the porosity of the fresh bedrock at our site ranges between 5 and 15 similar to the observations of a granitic gneiss site in holbrook et al 2019 we estimate the cementation exponent m of the fresh bedrock using the experimental data in llera et al 1990 and it gives a value close to 1 based on m and ϕ we can estimate that the range of ρ sat for the fresh bedrock is between 325 and 1000 ω m table 2 for the saturation exponent n we simply assume n m 1 mualem and friedman 1991 all the parameters are summarized in table 2 using archie s law and the model parameters in table 2 we estimate the mean and standard deviation of the moisture content for the field site based on the resistivity image in fig 10 using the mc simulation the results are shown in fig 11 a and 11b respectively for survey lines across and along the ridge the two moisture content images in fig 11 show similar patterns first shallow regolith 1 m has a relatively low moisture content 16 this dry layer is the result of a combined effect of the high evaporation evapotranspiration rate and low precipitation at the site in the summer mcnamara et al 2018 second the perched water an important subsurface water component in runoff generation e g guo et al 2019 mcdonnell et al 2021 is clearly seen at the regolith fractured bedrock interfaces for instance the moisture content at the regolith fractured bedrock interface is considerably high in the right panel of fig 11a at 17 m exceeding 40 this perched water also coincides with the location of a conifer tree at 18 on the ridge in the fractured bedrock the moisture content is relatively high ranging between 15 and 30 this component of groundwater i e rock moisture was historically overlooked in hydrologic studies but recent studies have highlighted its importance in supporting vegetation evapotranspiration during dry seasons rempe and dietrich 2018 within the fractured bedrock small patches with relatively high moisture content can also be found for example at 45 in the left panel of fig 11a and 38 m and 55 m in the right panel of fig 11a these relatively wet regions connect the regolith soil water to fresh bedrock and thus may be the preferential flow path that facilitates the bedrock infiltration kormos et al 2015 the petrophysical uncertainties related to the moisture content estimation are shown in fig 11b in general the uncertainty varies within different cz layers decreasing from 10 in regolith to 2 in the bedrock this decreased uncertainty in deep depth is associated with the smaller variability of resistivity model parameters in bedrocks this result implies that if the petrophysical properties of a structural unit can be better understood the uncertainty related to resistivity estimated moisture content could be reduced 4 4 comparison with the traditional method we also estimate the moisture content of the field site from resistivity measurements using the traditional methods it is noted that in the traditional method no structural information was used to constrain the resistivity inversion and the petrophysical relationship of the regolith is used for the moisture interpretation of the entire subsurface we selected the moisture content elevation profiles of two representative transects x 45 m across the ridge and 17 along the ridge for a direct comparison of the traditional and new methods as shown in fig 12 the new method clearly reveals the sharp moisture contrasts at cz boundaries which have been observed in other granitic czs e g flinchum et al 2019 for example the sudden decrease in moisture content at z 1633 in fig 12 b was not captured with the traditional method thus the traditional method may not identify the perched water at the regolith fractured bedrock interface moreover using a single petrophysical relationship for all the three cz layers significantly overestimates the moisture content in fractured and fresh bedrocks for instance the traditional method gives a moisture content of 20 for rocks 20 m below the ridge in fig 12a in this deep depth the microfractures in the bedrock are less likely to open due to the high confining pressure supported by the large velocity value exceeding 3000 m s 1 thus the moisture stored in deep bedrocks should be limited consistent with the results of the new method direct rock moisture measurements at the site would help validate our interpretation unfortunately no boreholes are installed at the site further studies are recommended to drill boreholes and conduct borehole geophysical logging e g neutron probe or nuclear magnetic resonance such that direct observations of rock moisture can be realized lastly we comment on the field conditions where the proposed method should be used if the subsurface structure is known to be strongly heterogeneous such as at mountainous cz sites it is always preferred to use structural information to constrain the moisture content estimation however if the sites are only slightly heterogeneous such as at unconsolidated aquifers or agricultural fields it is expected that the structural boundaries are not clearly defined and may not be identified with seismic refraction tomography under these conditions using structural information may not improve the moisture content estimation of course the cost is also a concern because both seismic refraction tests in the field and structural based resistivity inversion are more costly than the traditional methods 5 conclusions in this study we proposed to use the subsurface structural information to reduce the uncertainty of moisture content estimation with field resistivity measurements the results of the synthetic subsurface example show that seismic refraction tomography contains enough structural information which can be extracted with the velocity gradient based method from the reconstructed velocity images incorporating the structural information into resistivity inversions can relax the regularization forced smoothing at structural boundaries thus improving the reconstruction of resistivity images in particular the sharp resistivity contrast near structural boundaries is better captured if compared to traditional inversion the synthetic example also shows that the moisture content estimated using structural unit specific petrophysical models gives a similar spatial pattern as the true model in addition to spatial patterns the estimated moisture content values with the new method agree very well with the true moisture content compared to the traditional method that applies a single petrophysical relationship to the entire subsurface the new method shows a better performance the new method has been applied to a granitic hillslope to estimate the moisture content distribution from field resistivity measurements the resistivity estimated moisture content distributions exhibit typical features commonly found in hillslopes such as perched water at the soil rock interface and preferential flow path contributing to groundwater recharge although no ground truth is available for validating the estimated moisture content a comparison with the traditional method results confirms our proposed methods superior performance therefore we conclude that incorporating structural information in resistivity inversion and using structural unit specific petrophysical models can improve the estimation of subsurface moisture content from field resistivity measurements therefore if the subsurface is strongly heterogeneous in structure for example at mountainous cz sites it is preferred to adopt this new method however if the sites are only slightly heterogeneous this new method may not be able to improve the moisture content estimation from resistivity tomography credit authorship contribution statement hang chen validation software

2906,regional flood frequency analysis rffa is one of the widely used approaches for estimating design floods in the ungauged basins we developed an extreme gradient boost xgb machine learning model for rffa and flood estimation our approach relies on developing a regression model between flood quantiles and the commonly available catchment descriptors we used camels data for 671 catchments from the usa to test the approach s efficacy the results were compared with the traditional multiple linear regression methods and artificial neural networks results revealed that the xgb based approach estimated design flood with the highest accuracy during training and validation with minor mean absolute error root mean square error values and percentage bias ranging from 10 to 10 the importance of each catchment feature is visualized by three different approaches gini impurity permutation and dropout loss feature ranking we observed that the most dominating variables are rainfall intensity slope snow fraction soil porosity and temperature it is observed that the importance of these variables is a function of the hydroclimatic regions and varies with space in contrast mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration mean annual rainfall fraction forest area and soil conductivity have low significance in estimating design flood for an ungauged catchment indeed the proposed xgb based approach has broader applicability and replicability keywords regional flood frequency analysis xgb ungauged catchments camels dataset data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are the most devastating natural disasters causing massive economic losses and societal disturbances around the globe floods have become more common and catastrophic due to global climate change and account for nearly 45 percent of all disasters fitzgerald et al 2010 in the last few decades almost 58 million people have been affected by floods and more than 20 000 people worldwide have been killed by severe floods yeditha et al 2020 accurately estimating design floods is one of the most critical aspects of reducing the risk of flooding loss of life and property loveridge and rahman 2018 reliable design flood estimate methods are essential for constructing hydraulic structures e g bridges dams retaining walls culverts for flood estimates discharge data for an extended period is required for the study region however in most developing and underdeveloped countries the density of streamflow gauging stations is low due to a shortage of funds and trained staff jingyi and hall 2004 regional flood frequency analysis rffa has been a blessing for such regions with little to no flow data available rffa is a practical method for providing flood information for flood control and design several studies have shown that rffa has greatly interested researchers and has explored different methods for rffa the typical steps in all the different methods include identifying homogeneous regions fitting appropriate probability distributions and estimating flood quantiles agarwal et al 2016 the strength of the rffa method depends on three factors the length of data availability the regionalization method used and the method for transferring the flood quantiles to unmeasured catchments some of the very prominent rffa methods include i a quantile regression method ouali et al 2016 ii an index flood estimation method thorvat and mujumdar 2011 and iii a parameter regression method ahn and palmer 2016 haddad and rahman 2012 the most widely used regional estimation techniques with no historical flood records are index flood and the regional regression methods dalrymple 1960 the index flood method is built on locating zones known as homogeneous regions the maximum peak flow pdf is invariant except for the scale coefficient representing the index flood the probability distribution of annual maximum peak flows is invariant except for a scale factor represented by the index flood using the two terms scale factor and the growth factor which captures the regional validity the flood peak discharge with an assigned return period t is estimated at the selected site burn and goel 2000 castellarin et al 2001 gottschalk 1999 models which estimate flood quantiles as a function of site physiographic and other catchment characteristics are frequently built using regression methods thomas and benson 1970 zrinji and burn 1994 parametric regression approaches are the most commonly used regression methods for estimating regional flood quantiles the functional relationship between the flood quantile and independent variables is estimated using these methods generally parametric form regression is commonly used to relate the flood quantile of interest to climatic catchment physiographic and geomorphologic features kasi et al 2020a shu and ouarda 2008 most often a linear relationship is assumed in these studies either in the raw or log data domain aziz et al 2013 srinivas et al 2008 though attempts to develop nonlinear rffa methods to estimate design floods have been made their implementation is minimal some nonlinear approaches such as an artificial neural network ann gene expression programming and fuzzy models have been developed and tested in recent years aziz et al 2013 srinivas et al 2008 table 1 is a comprehensive list of significant articles that successfully employed machine learning models for flood estimation applications these research studies have shown that a nonlinear approach produces better results than a linear method in recent years with the advancement of machine learning methods deep learning algorithms have become very popular and effective for solving various problems of the different methods extreme gradient boosting xgb has been shown by many studies fan et al 2018 ibrahem ahmed osman et al 2021 to outperform traditional studies ann and svm methods the xgb algorithm differs from conventional machine learning algorithms in various ways including portability no overfitting parallelized tree building and being accessible to all major programming languages the critical aspects of xgb are efficient handling of missing data and regularization to avoid overfitting even though there are studies on the application of xgb in hydrology venkatesan and mahindrakar 2019 there is still not much investigation of the application of xgb for flood estimation studies further estimating the hyperparameters in xgb is one of the critical steps for accurate modeling and the trial and error approach for estimating these hyperparameters is uncertain and cumbersome this study proposes the state of the art bayesian optimized xgb model for the rffa application extensive sample data such as

provided more information on the camels catchment characteristics the following possible ten characteristics influencing the floods in the catchments are considered from the set of different variables in the camels dataset these include i drainage area area ii rainfall intensity ri iii mean annual rainfall mar iv mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration mapet v slope vi temperature vii fraction forest viii soil porosity xi soil conductivity x fraction snow in the camels dataset the drainage area and slope of each catchment are taken from the n15 usgs united states geological survey online portal wherein gages ii falcone 2011 method is used to estimate the area and geospatial fabric viger and bock 2014 method was used to determine the contours of each catchment fraction forest

portal statsgo state soil geographical dataset miller and white 1998 table 2 provides the statistical summary of the variables from 671 catchments used in the present study the drainage area of catchments varies from 4 km2 to 25791 km2 3 methodology the schematic of the methodology adopted in the present study is shown in fig 2 the first part of the method includes preliminary data analysis and at site design flood estimation described in section 3 1 the second part describes the regression model development and estimation in ungauged basins this study used xgb models with bayesian optimization for flood estimation and multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks were developed for comparison 3 1 preliminary analysis this study performed a comprehensive preliminary analysis to filter the unsuitable stations undergone significant changes in hydro meteorological processes for model development for this purpose mann kendall test hamed 2008 and petit test were used for trend and change point analysis a brief description of these tests is given below 3 2 mann kendall test many researchers and practitioners have used the nonparametric mann kendall mk kendall 1975 mann 1945 statistical test to find trends in recorded hydrologic time series such as streamflow and water quality and precipitation time series since trend detection of hydrological variables gives valuable information on the likelihood of change tendency of the variables in the future trend analysis has proven to be a useful technique for successful water resources planning design and management consider a time series y 1 y 2 y 3 y n representing the observation of a natural process the s statistic for this time series can be estimated as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn y j y i where n is the number of samples and y j a n d y i are from i 1 2 3 n 1 and j 1 1 n 2 sgn y j y i 1 i f y j y i 0 0 i f y j y i 0 1 i f y j y i 0 if n is greater than 8 the statistic s approximates a normal distribution with zero mean and variance v 3 v n n 1 2 n 5 18 the mann kendall z statistic is written as 4 z s 1 v 0 5 s 0 0 v 0 5 s 0 s 1 v 0 5 s 0 if z less than 0 it indicates a decreasing trend and vice versa this study considers confidential levels of 95 α 0 05 3 3 petit test pettitt test is one of the homogeneity tests used to detect abrupt changes in time series data pettitt 1979 it is considered the most reliable method for finding break or change points in time series data costa and soares 2009 wijngaard et al 2003 the pettitt test like other tests is more sensitive to breaks in the middle of a time series wijngaard et al 2003 venkatesh et al 2022 the null hypothesis is that the data is independent uniformly distributed random variables while the alternative is a stepwise shift in the mean more details about the test can be read from costa and soares 2009 3 4 at site flood estimation the flood estimation for each station is done in two phases in the first phase based on the goodness of fit test the probability distribution function that best fits the given station is selected from the widely used probability distributions this study uses the anderson darling test to select the best fit distribution once the best distribution is selected in the second phase the parameters and design flood flood quantiles are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator 3 5 anderson darling test anderson and darling anderson and darling 1954 developed the anderson darling detecting deviations from normality in sample distributions the ad statistic is extensively utilized in flood frequency analysis because it performs well with small sample sets and distributions with many tails haddad and rahman 2011 the non directional ad test statistic a2 is calculated using the following formula 5 a 2 n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 lnf u i 2 n 1 2 i ln f 1 u i where u 1 u n denotes an ordered from smallest to largest element sample of size n and f u denotes the underlying theoretical cumulative distribution to which the sample is compared the null hypothesis that u 1 u n is derived from the underlying distribution is called the null hypothesis f u is rejected if a2 is greater than the critical value a2 at a given α 95 confidence level the critical values for the anderson darling test depend on the specific distribution being tested 3 6 parameter estimation in this study the parameters of the flood frequency curve were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle the maximum likelihood method is adopted as it gives better estimates than the method of moments approach in some studies nazmi et al 2020 the mle aims to make inferences about the population that would have most likely generated the sample assuming that we have n independent identically distributed samples x1 x2 x3 xn each xi has a pdf given by f x i μ where u u1 u2 ul is a set of unknown parameters to be estimated the log likelihood function is defined as 6 l μ j 1 n log f x i μ the ml estimate of μ is the one that maximizes the value of l μ for the given set of observations several optimization methods such as newton raphson gradient search methods can be used to estimate the value of μ we have used the newton raphson method for numerical optimization in this study 3 7 regression models this section briefly describes the different regression models applied in the study for the regional flood frequency analysis the regression models estimate the relationship between the different predictors and the flood estimates firstly the proposed method using extreme gradient boosting and bayesian optimization is described later the benchmark models such as ann and mlr are described 3 7 1 extreme gradient boosting the extreme gradient boosting is a ml model based on scalable boosting trees capable of capturing the complex nonlinear relationship between a set of predictor and output variables xgb is a cart classification and regression tree based algorithm similar to gradient boosting machines with specific model structural differences chen and guestrin 2016 xgb employs second order derivatives whereas regular gbm utilizes first order derivatives chen and guestrin 2016b compared to gbm xgb is more effective and less likely to result in model overfit as it uses the improved regularization functions chen and guestrin 2016 chen et al 2019a the parallel processing in xgb speeds up the gradient boosting techniques and provides better performance than regular gbm chen et al 2019b generally regression problems involving input variables xi ℝd where i 1 2 n and n are the number of input variables and target variable y i ℝ can be cast in cart an ensemble tree model using the generic form of cart in the following manner chen and guestrin 2016 7 y i φ x i k 1 k p k x i t k f here φ x i is a function that relates the model inputs to the model prediction y i r where f p x w q x q r m t w r t represents the entire space of the regression tree p k refers to the single tree structure the number of leaves in the tree p k is t and the leaf weights are w the goal function in xgb includes a loss function as well as a regularization term given as chen and guestrin 2016 8 l ϕ i l y i y i k ω p k where 9 ω p γ t 1 2 λ w 2 here l is the differentiable convex loss function that is used to calculate the difference between the target y i and prediction y i during training the period the second term ω denotes the regularization term which penalizes the objective function depending on model complexity since classical methods of model optimization are ineffective for the tree ensemble model xgbt which is represented by eq 2 an alternate method of additive approach is applied for model training chen and guestrin 2016 in this method a function pt is added to improve eq 2 for predicting the y i t at the ith instance after tth iteration as chen and guestrin 2016 10 l t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 p t x i ω p t taylor series second order expansion is used to quickly optimize the objective function by following steps friedman et al 2000 11 l t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 g i p t x i 1 2 h i p t 2 x i ω p t the gradient statistics of the loss function for the first order g i and second order h i are as follows 12 g i y t 1 l y i y i t 1 and 13 h i y t 1 2 l i y i t 1 by eliminating the constant term for step t the objective function can be reduced to 14 l t i 1 n g i p t x i 1 2 h i p t 2 x i ω p t by defining i j i q x i j and expanding ω the eq 8 can be rewritten as 15 l t i 1 n g i p t x i 1 2 h i p t 2 x i γ t 1 2 λ j 1 t w j 2 j 1 t i i j g i w j 1 2 i i j h i λ w j 2 γ t for a fixed structure q x the weight w j and consequent optimal value l t q of a leaf j may now be computed as 16 w j i i j g i i i j h i λ and 17 l t q 1 2 j 1 t i i j g i 2 i i j h i λ γ t eq 16 can assess the quality of a tree structure q the solution for this problem can be obtained through an algorithm that adds branches to a tree from a single leaf at each iteration however it is computationally intense to compute all the trees simultaneously and find the best one the problem is solved using an algorithm proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 in which every iteration adds a branch to the tree from a single leaf if the tree splitting for left and right nodes are il and ir respectively the loss reduction by summing them as i i l u i r can be calculated as chen and guestrin 2016 18 l split 1 2 i i l g i 2 i i l h i λ i i r g i 2 i i r h i λ i i g i 2 i i h i λ γ 3 8 bayesian optimization hyper parameters are significant for machine learning algorithms because they directly regulate the behaviors of training algorithms and have a major impact on machine learning model performance wu et al 2019 an efficient hyper parameter optimization technique can be devised for any machine learning method that will considerably enhance machine learning efficiency wu et al 2019 bayesian optimization is used here for optimizing the hyper parameters bayesian optimization is an excellent way to find the extrema of computationally expensive functions to solve brochu et al 2010 it creates a prior optimization function and gathers data from previous samples to update the optimization function s posterior wu et al 2019 the bayesian optimization involves two steps i choosing a surrogate model to incorporate prior beliefs about the objective function and ii acquisition function for proposing sampling points in the search space this study uses gaussian processes as the surrogate model in defining the prior over the objective function more details about the theory and background of bayesian optimization can be found in wu et al 2019a all the models for xgb and bayesian optimization were developed in python 3 8 1 artificial neural network several independent studies agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 amato et al 2013 baxt 1990 have shown that ann models have superior generalization capabilities to regression based models the ann model is better at detecting nonlinear correlations between observed and forecasted data sets kasi et al 2020b el shafie et al 2011 hsu et al 1995 fig 3 shows a schematic representation of an ann model concept the first column denotes numerous input variables xi while the second denotes the weight of input variables w i a provided vector is used to decide the output the neuron is introduced to a constant value 1 among the inputs by its unique weight known as bias b the ann can modify the activation function via bias it s vital to remember that bias isn t required for a network to function but it can dramatically improve its performance araghinejad 2013 an ann model with interlinking between the input and output data layers is shown in fig 3 a b it has three input neurons two hidden layers of three and two percepterons and an output layer in an ann model a neuron s input i and output y can be represented mathematically as 19 i x w b 20 y 1 i f i θ 0 i f i θ where x represents the input w represents the weight b represents the bias and θ represents the threshold value 3 8 2 multiple linear regression regression analysis is a modeling tool for examining the relationship between one or more independent variables x 1 x 2 x k and a continuous real valued dependent variable y amral et al 2007a the mlr model used in the present study can be written as follows 21 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β k x k ε where y denotes the design flood and x i denotes the affecting factors β i is regression parameters with respect to x i and ε denotes the error term the error term ε has a constant variance and a zero mean value parameters β i are estimates using the least squares method by minimizing the sum of squared residuals 3 9 k folds cross validation cross validation cv has been one of the most prominent strategies for model selection and validation arlot and celisse 2010 presents a thorough overview of the literature in this approach the data set is split into k splits each data split is called a fold and then the k 1 folds are used to build a model while the left out sample is utilized to validate each of the k folds is assigned as validation data during the iteration of this technique for k times burman 1989 claimed that folds less than 5 could be problematic to summarize the choice of k in k fold cross validation results in a bias variance trade off given these factors k fold cross validation with k 5 or k 10 is typically used as these values have been proved empirically to generate test error rate estimates with neither excessively high bias nor very high variation james et al 2013 3 10 model development and performance analysis based on previous studies aziz et al 2011 zaman et al 2012 a total of ten predictors were selected in this study most of the predictors nine of ten were obtained directly from the camels dataset the maximum rainfall intensity was derived by fitting the best distribution for extreme rainfall values similarly the dependent variable the flood quantiles was estimated using the best fit probability distribution function to the annual maximum flood discharge in this study individual regression models were developed for estimating flood quantiles of different return periods therefore a total of six regression models were developed for estimating floods with 2 yr q2 5 yr q5 10 yr q10 20 yr q20 50 yr q50 and 100 yr q100 return periods as described in the methodology section the regression models were developed using three methods in the xgb model bayesian optimization was used to optimize the parameters andk fold cross validation with k 10 was used to estimate the skill of the models table 3 show the hyperparameters optimized in this study and the corresponding ranges in this case for each return period different sets of parameters were obtained by the bayesian optimization method and those were used while training the xgb model a 2 layer feed forward neural network with two hidden layers is selected for the ann model and a levenberg marquardt algorithm is used for model training the activation function represented in the model was log normal we have used the ordinary least squares approach for the multiple linear regression model to estimate the regression coefficients a set of statistic metrics was evaluated listed in eq 22 25 to assess the model performance these include mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse normalized root mean squared error nrmse and percentage bias pbias mae mean absolute error is the average absolute value of the differences between the predicted and the relevant observation over the verification sample because the mae is a linear score all individual differences are weighted equally in the average mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse mae is calculated as 22 mae y i y i 1 n samples i 0 n samples y i y i the standard deviation of the residuals prediction errors is denoted by root mean squared error rmse residuals measure how far away the data points are from the regression line they measure how spread out these residuals are barnston 1992 rmse is calculated as 23 r m s e y i y i 1 n samples i 0 n samples y i y i 2 the rmse can be normalized to make comparisons between datasets or models with different scales easier the normalized rmse nrmse relates the rmse to the variable s observed range nrmse is calculated as 24 n r m s e rmse y i m a x y i m i n the average tendency of the simulated values to be bigger or lower than their observed values is measured by percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 pbias has an optimum value of 0 0 it is calculated as 25 b i a s i n p e r c e n t i 1 n y i y i i 1 n y i 100 where n is the number of stations y i and y i are the predicted and observed flood discharges 3 11 variable importance machine learning models interpretability in hydrology is as crucial as their prediction accuracy techniques that assign a score to input features depending on how important they predict a target variable are known as feature importance feature ranking is critical for expanding the use of machine learning approaches because they provide insight into the data the model and the foundation for dimensionality reduction and feature selection all of which can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a predictive model on the problem in this study to determine the critical input variables the gini impurity permutation and dropout loss feature ranking methods were applied to visualize the implicit feature selection by xgb models more details about these methods are provided in the appendix 4 results and discussion the preliminary analysis of the camels data and in site flood estimation was carried out in section 4 1 following three different regression models were compared for flood estimation of different return periods in section 4 2 finally the performance of the xgb model is tested for estimating the flood quantiles in ungauged basins moreover three methods such as the gini impurity permutation and dropout feature ranking methods are employed to investigate each feature s influence used as predictor variables on target variable design flow in section 4 3 4 1 preliminary and in site flood estimation firstly all the stations in the camels data set with no discrepancies and streamflow records of more than 30 years were selected then the mann kendall test homogeneity test was applied to these stations the results from the mk test as shown in table 4 reveal that the change in trend observed was in 46 stations 15 stations with an increasing trend and 31 stations with decreasing trend and there is no significant trend in 625 stations these 46 stations with evident trends or abrupt changes were not selected for further analysis as shown in fig 1 the extreme annual streamflow data for each station is used in the pettitt test to detect the change point the threshold of the test was derived based on the 95 quantile value of the test statistic the test outcomes are shown in fig 4 where a histogram has been drawn between the number of stations and their corresponding p values almost all stations have p values less than the critical value of 1 69 confirming no significant change point observed in the data the anderson darling test was conducted using the 35 year data for each station s annual maximum series of rainfall and streamflow separately fig 5 shows the ad test statistic and threshold based on the critical value at 95 confidence level of the a2 value for gev distribution gumbel distribution normal distribution and gpd distribution respectively the anderson darling statistic assesses how closely the data fit a particular distribution the smaller this statistic is for a given distribution the better the distribution fits the data fig 6 shows that the gev distribution has a low critical value of 0 63 compared to the other three distributions at 0 98 2 64 and 2 86 respectively around 640 out of 671 stations have a2 statistics below the critical value at a 95 confidence level in gev so gev distribution is selected for estimating the rainfall intensities values a similar analysis for streamflow value shows that log pearson type iii distribution fits the best for most of the stations which is in congruence with the results reported in another study by griffis and stedinger 2007 4 2 regression model development as elaborated in the methodology three regression models mlr ann and xgb were compared for flood estimation of different return periods the model inputs for all the models remain the same including the selected catchment descriptors and rainfall intensities for a given return period table 5 compares the median values of the k fold results from all three models for different return periods the xgb model optimized using the bayesian method provides accurate estimates for the different estimates in terms of percentage bias it was observed that eta learning rate and minimum child weight are the sensitive xgb hyperparameters and corresponding optimal values were equal to 0 01 and 0 1 respectively the percentage bias during the validation was well within the 5 for all the return periods ann model outperformed the mlr model on all evaluation metrics the results exhibit that rmse values follow a pattern in the two models for all quantiles with the least value of 24 460 m3 s for q2 a maximum value of 79 620 m3 s for q100 for ann and a minimum value of 23 916 m3 s for q2 and a limit of 87 63 m3 s for q100 for mlr model at the same time results show similar performances by both the models with little difference in percentage bias in all return periods as the pbias values are far from zero we can conclude that both models performed poorly on the other hand mae also has a pattern of rising inaccuracy with higher quantiles ann has a minimum and maximum value of 16 47 and 62 526 while mlr has a minimum and maximum value of 17 24 and 70 414 it is worth noting that compared to xgb models neither model is ideal for all six return periods table 6 shows the worst median and best values of all three models for the 100 year return period validated by the different folds in terms of rmse and pbias we found that all three models had over estimations and under estimations with xgb performing better than the other two models the selection of draw out samples had an average impact on the ann model and the mlr model with rmse performance ranged from 50 47 m3 s to 110 40 m3 s in ann and 54 73 m3 s to 102 70 m3 s in mlr both ann and mlr showed almost similar performances in pbias too on the other hand from the xgb model utilizing different folds yielded a better range of results in rmse from 38 20 m3 s to 69 56 m3 s the pbias values of 10 folds in the xgb model differ from 9 23 to 8 12 with the best fold value of 0 24 based on the worst and best values from table 5 we can say that the xgb model is performing well in all 10 folds further analyzing the 10 fold results only from xgb the best model based on fig 6 shows the accuracy of the xgb based models in terms of mae rmse nrmse and percentage bias in the flood estimation during 10 fold validation all models performed admirably well for all the quantiles with the minimum rmse value of 8 m3 s for q2 and for the remaining return periods rmse values range from 15 to 40 the findings show that all the models performed well for all six return periods we observe a pattern in results when the return periods gradually increase and model performance worsens among all the models model 1 performed admirably for all the quantiles with the minimum mae value of 5 2 m3 s for q2 and just above 30 5 m3 s for q100 the performance of the models in flood estimation was shown in fig 6c in terms of nrmse normalized root mean square error normalizing the rmse makes comparing datasets or models with different scales easier low nrmse values represent less residual variance therefore in fig 6c we can observe that the 2 year return period and 100 year return period have low nrmse values boxplot range compared to other return periods which implies that flood estimation of 2 yr and 100 yr return period has a less residual deviation from the observed values however compared to the 2 yr and 100 yr return period nrmse values there is no substantial variance for the other three return periods indicating that all the return periods performed well in flood estimation fig 6d shows the performance of the models in flood estimation in terms of percentage bias the average tendency of the simulated values to be bigger or lower than their observed values is measured by percent bias pbias pbias has an ideal value of 0 and low magnitude values indicate accurate model simulation model overestimation bias is indicated by positive values whereas negative values indicate model underestimation bias the findings show that all the models performed well for all six quantiles there is no discernible under prediction or over prediction pattern for both minor or large floods among all model 1 performed admirably for all the quantiles with a median of boxplot with minimum deviation from zero as q5 q10 q100 are just above and q2 q50 quantiles are just below zero to understand the performance of the model across different catchment sizes we compared see fig 7 the accuracy of flood prediction in different catchment sizes for 100 year period the boxplot range of pbias is almost similar across all catchment sizes with maximum range of 4 to 0 5 in the catchments more than 900 km2 this demonstrates that regardless of catchment size the model performs almost equally in terms of flood prediction if the catchment sizes are really large we may see some differences in the results but with the camels data we have where the catchment sizes range from 4 km2 to 25000 km2 all of the catchment sizes exhibit pretty much identical results 4 3 flood estimation in ungauged basins from the analysis of the results it was observed that the xgb models could better capture the flood quantile values than other models therefore the xgb model is used for estimating flood quantiles for this purpose we have trained the model using 600 stations selected randomly and used the model to predict the flood values in the remaining stations fig 8 depicts the scatter plot between observed discharge and simulated results from the xgb model during training and testing periods for each return period 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year fig 8 shows that xgb models performed accurately for different return periods without significant deviations from the x y line both observed and simulated streamflows perform admirably in the testing with slight deviations from the x y line and for all the return periods the model simulations are well with the 10 band around the x y line regarding the flood estimates uncertainties the percentage bias was reported in the order of 20 30 in some of the studies baldassarre and montanari 2009 zhao et al 2020 the pbias of 10 15 reported in the present study is highly impressive considering the results of other studies and difficulties in estimating the design flood also comparing the results with zhao et al 2020 and smith et al 2015 the present study improved the model accuracy and percentage bias unsurprisingly the prediction accuracy seems to reduce with larger flood magnitude and higher return periods this could be because the at site design flood estimated is not the truth and large return period floods are difficult to estimate reliably with limited observed data zhao et al 2020 we can see that when the frequency of the return period increases the deviations also increase 4 4 comparison of the ann and deep learning models multiple linear regression mlr was considered the benchmark model in this study the ann model was chosen as it represents the machine learning method without hyper parameter optimization xgb was considered for its buildable complexity and ability to capture nonlinear relationships it was observed that the nonlinear methods like ann and xgb outperformed the mlr models as expected among the ann and xgb models the xgb model showed promise in accuracy and other error metrics in the past several studies have shown the superior performance of the xgb over the ann model and have attributed it to the fact that the xgb models are derivative free and due to that there is some advantage when fitting problems with large degrees of freedom conversely ann models are based on derivatives and get over fitted or under fitted when under higher degrees of freedom several past studies liu et al 2021 wu and fan 2019 have shown that xgb performs better than the ann model the reason for inferior performance of the ann in the present study could be attributed to the absence of the optimization of the hyper parameters weights whereas bayesian optimization was employed for estimating hyper parameters in xgb the fine tuning of parameters could possibly be one reason for the superior performance of the xgb models however it is to be noted that the performance of these models could vary with the difference in input data data length and study region this study utilized camels data and 600 stations have been chosen for training and validation model training and validation with one set of split sample might be misleading and prone to sampling bias therefore to reduce the impact of sampling bias on the model performance the k fold cross validation test was used and the results have shown that the performance of these models was equally good in all the folds to investigate the influence of each feature used as predictor variables on target variable design flow we have employed three methods the gini impurity permutation and dropout feature ranking fig 9 shows the feature importance plots from the three methods all three approaches reveal that rainfall intensity slope fraction snow soil porosity and temperature are the watershed characteristics that strongly impact design flood compared to other catchment characteristics that show minimal impact as expected rainfall intensity is the most influential meteorological attribute with the highest score among the remaining attributes while soil conductivity area and fraction forest score low in all three approaches in dropout loss feature importance rainfall intensity has the highest dropout loss indicating that it is one most significant factors and soil conductivity area mar fraction forest and mapet are the variables having negative values which means these variables are negatively impacting in the prediction of streamflow in the order shown in fig 9c from soil conductivity to mapet in summary rainfall intensity slope soil porosity and a fraction of snow are the most impactful variables influencing design flood prediction in contrast soil conductivity area and fraction forest have a low impact in predicting design floods however these results provide the overall dominant controls of the design flood considering all the stations in the usa to make the analysis more insightful we have considered hydroclimatic regions and performed a similar analysis the national centres for environmental information ncei has identified nine climatically consistent regions within the contiguous united states using the climatic regions as the background all camels stations are divided into eight regions as the central region is merged into the southeast region due to a smaller number of stations in the central region as shown in fig 10 within each region each feature s influence was investigated to understand the variability of the dominant control of the design flood in that specific region fig 11 a c depict the scores of each variable in terms of percentages for eight different climate regions in the usa using the three different variable importance methods such as the gini impurity permutation and dropout feature ranking methods respectively we can observe from the plots that rainfall intensity was a dominant attribute in the northwest west southwest and northeast regions snow was the first dominant attribute in the west north central and east north central regions and the second dominant in the northeast and northwest soil properties are the dominant variable in southeast and south regions on the other hand as expected snow was the least impactful attribute in the west southwest and south regions temperature and slope are the least dominant feature in northwest and east north central regions in the southwest west north central south and northeast regions soil conductivity and forest land cover are the least impactful variable overall the results indicate that the variable importance scores calculated using three different methods are comparable and related to the climate scenarios in the united states 5 conclusions we developed an extreme gradient boost xgb machine learning model for rffa and flood estimation and tested the model over 600 observed discharge catchments the mann kendall and pettitt tests were employed to confirm the trend and homogeneity of discharge data the goodness of fit tests rainfall and streamflow extremes were fitted with a specific distribution for return periods of 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 years the at site floods were estimated using a log pearson type iii distribution three statistical error metrics were used to evaluate the model performance our analysis showed the effectiveness of the xgb based regional flood frequency model over the ann and mlr based regional flood frequency models gini impurity permutation and dropout loss feature ranking methods demonstrated that rainfall intensity slope soil porosity and fraction snow are the most important predictor variables in contrast mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration mean annual rainfall drainage area temperature fraction forest and soil conductivity have minimal value in predicting design floods for an ungauged catchment the findings are helpful as most predictor variables are widely available for most catchments the developed xgb approach has much promise for estimating extreme flood magnitudes in the united states with pbias ranging from 10 to 10 for all design floods this is anticipated to result in a significant improvement in the skill of worldwide flood inundation models 6 data availability the camels catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies data set was used to test the proposed

discriminative value was for the regression problem under investigation a2 permutation feature importance the permutation importance is a technique for correcting the gini importance s bias altmann et al 2010 in a general context this approach directly gauges feature relevance by evaluating how each predictor s performance is influenced by random re shuffling thus preserving the variable s distribution explaining feature importance by example of a random forest by eryk lewinson towards data science the approach can be broken down into the following steps 1 by passing the validation set train the baseline model and record the score accuracy r2 any metric of interest this can also be done on the training set albeit at the penalty of losing generalization information 2 reshuffle values from one feature in the selected dataset then re run the dataset through the model to get predictions and calculate the metric for this new dataset the difference between the benchmark score and the modified permuted dataset score is the feature significance 3 repeat the 2nd step for all of the dataset s features a3 dropout loss feature importance units that have dropped out are referred to as dropouts chang et al 2017 dropping a unit out refers to eliminating it from the model for the time being this technique is pretty intuitive as we compare a model with all features with a model with this feature removed during training to see how important it is due to the need to retrain the model for each variety of the dataset there may be a large computational cost after dropping a single feature column explaining feature importance by the example of a random forest by eryk lewinson towards data science the decrease in accuracy score indicates how much the model depends on the tested predictor i e higher dropout for more important variable because this technique breaks the link between covariate and classification target konapala et al 2020 
2906,regional flood frequency analysis rffa is one of the widely used approaches for estimating design floods in the ungauged basins we developed an extreme gradient boost xgb machine learning model for rffa and flood estimation our approach relies on developing a regression model between flood quantiles and the commonly available catchment descriptors we used camels data for 671 catchments from the usa to test the approach s efficacy the results were compared with the traditional multiple linear regression methods and artificial neural networks results revealed that the xgb based approach estimated design flood with the highest accuracy during training and validation with minor mean absolute error root mean square error values and percentage bias ranging from 10 to 10 the importance of each catchment feature is visualized by three different approaches gini impurity permutation and dropout loss feature ranking we observed that the most dominating variables are rainfall intensity slope snow fraction soil porosity and temperature it is observed that the importance of these variables is a function of the hydroclimatic regions and varies with space in contrast mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration mean annual rainfall fraction forest area and soil conductivity have low significance in estimating design flood for an ungauged catchment indeed the proposed xgb based approach has broader applicability and replicability keywords regional flood frequency analysis xgb ungauged catchments camels dataset data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are the most devastating natural disasters causing massive economic losses and societal disturbances around the globe floods have become more common and catastrophic due to global climate change and account for nearly 45 percent of all disasters fitzgerald et al 2010 in the last few decades almost 58 million people have been affected by floods and more than 20 000 people worldwide have been killed by severe floods yeditha et al 2020 accurately estimating design floods is one of the most critical aspects of reducing the risk of flooding loss of life and property loveridge and rahman 2018 reliable design flood estimate methods are essential for constructing hydraulic structures e g bridges dams retaining walls culverts for flood estimates discharge data for an extended period is required for the study region however in most developing and underdeveloped countries the density of streamflow gauging stations is low due to a shortage of funds and trained staff jingyi and hall 2004 regional flood frequency analysis rffa has been a blessing for such regions with little to no flow data available rffa is a practical method for providing flood information for flood control and design several studies have shown that rffa has greatly interested researchers and has explored different methods for rffa the typical steps in all the different methods include identifying homogeneous regions fitting appropriate probability distributions and estimating flood quantiles agarwal et al 2016 the strength of the rffa method depends on three factors the length of data availability the regionalization method used and the method for transferring the flood quantiles to unmeasured catchments some of the very prominent rffa methods include i a quantile regression method ouali et al 2016 ii an index flood estimation method thorvat and mujumdar 2011 and iii a parameter regression method ahn and palmer 2016 haddad and rahman 2012 the most widely used regional estimation techniques with no historical flood records are index flood and the regional regression methods dalrymple 1960 the index flood method is built on locating zones known as homogeneous regions the maximum peak flow pdf is invariant except for the scale coefficient representing the index flood the probability distribution of annual maximum peak flows is invariant except for a scale factor represented by the index flood using the two terms scale factor and the growth factor which captures the regional validity the flood peak discharge with an assigned return period t is estimated at the selected site burn and goel 2000 castellarin et al 2001 gottschalk 1999 models which estimate flood quantiles as a function of site physiographic and other catchment characteristics are frequently built using regression methods thomas and benson 1970 zrinji and burn 1994 parametric regression approaches are the most commonly used regression methods for estimating regional flood quantiles the functional relationship between the flood quantile and independent variables is estimated using these methods generally parametric form regression is commonly used to relate the flood quantile of interest to climatic catchment physiographic and geomorphologic features kasi et al 2020a shu and ouarda 2008 most often a linear relationship is assumed in these studies either in the raw or log data domain aziz et al 2013 srinivas et al 2008 though attempts to develop nonlinear rffa methods to estimate design floods have been made their implementation is minimal some nonlinear approaches such as an artificial neural network ann gene expression programming and fuzzy models have been developed and tested in recent years aziz et al 2013 srinivas et al 2008 table 1 is a comprehensive list of significant articles that successfully employed machine learning models for flood estimation applications these research studies have shown that a nonlinear approach produces better results than a linear method in recent years with the advancement of machine learning methods deep learning algorithms have become very popular and effective for solving various problems of the different methods extreme gradient boosting xgb has been shown by many studies fan et al 2018 ibrahem ahmed osman et al 2021 to outperform traditional studies ann and svm methods the xgb algorithm differs from conventional machine learning algorithms in various ways including portability no overfitting parallelized tree building and being accessible to all major programming languages the critical aspects of xgb are efficient handling of missing data and regularization to avoid overfitting even though there are studies on the application of xgb in hydrology venkatesan and mahindrakar 2019 there is still not much investigation of the application of xgb for flood estimation studies further estimating the hyperparameters in xgb is one of the critical steps for accurate modeling and the trial and error approach for estimating these hyperparameters is uncertain and cumbersome this study proposes the state of the art bayesian optimized xgb model for the rffa application extensive sample data such as camels is used to test the proposed framework camels is a group of 671 us catchments with long streamflow time series low human influence and a wide range of hydroclimatic conditions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the efficacy of the proposed approach is tested in 671 catchments across the united states of america usa listed in the camels dataset the locations of the selected and unselected gauging stations are shown in fig 1 between the gauging stations the drainage area ranged from 4 03 to 25791 04 km2 the drainage areas for the first second and third quartiles were 122 28 329 68 and 794 295 km2 the selected stream gauging stations streamflow data were taken from the camels dataset the period of streamflow records at these gauging stations varied from 1980 to 01 01 to 2014 12 13 i e 35 years 2 2 the camels data set the camels catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies data set was used to test the proposed approach camels is a group of 671 us catchments with long streamflow time series low human influence and a wide range of hydroclimatic conditions addor et al 2017 at each catchment two types of data are used 1 regular time series of observed precipitation and streamflow newman et al 2014a and 2 key catchment characteristics that may affect hydrological processes addor et al 2017a the 1 km resolution precipitation and temperature data were derived from each catchment scale from 1980 to 2014 newman et al 2014b catchment characteristics have been derived through different studies and analyses and compiled by addor et al 2017 a broad range of selected characteristics grouped into five groups was used to characterize the landscape in each catchment 1 climate 2 topography and soil 3 hydrology 4 geology and 5 vegetation addor et al 2017b provided more information on the camels catchment characteristics the following possible ten characteristics influencing the floods in the catchments are considered from the set of different variables in the camels dataset these include i drainage area area ii rainfall intensity ri iii mean annual rainfall mar iv mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration mapet v slope vi temperature vii fraction forest viii soil porosity xi soil conductivity x fraction snow in the camels dataset the drainage area and slope of each catchment are taken from the n15 usgs united states geological survey online portal wherein gages ii falcone 2011 method is used to estimate the area and geospatial fabric viger and bock 2014 method was used to determine the contours of each catchment fraction forest forested area of a catchment infraction in the camels dataset is also taken from usgs and measured using a planimeter rainfall intensity data was derived by fitting the best distribution for daily

portal statsgo state soil geographical dataset miller and white 1998 table 2 provides the statistical summary of the variables from 671 catchments used in the present study the drainage area of catchments varies from 4 km2 to 25791 km2 3 methodology the schematic of the methodology adopted in the present study is shown in fig 2 the first part of the method includes preliminary data analysis and at site design flood estimation described in section 3 1 the second part describes the regression model development and estimation in ungauged basins this study used xgb models with bayesian optimization for flood estimation and multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks were developed for comparison 3 1 preliminary analysis this study performed a comprehensive preliminary analysis to filter the unsuitable stations undergone significant changes in hydro meteorological processes for model development for this purpose mann kendall test hamed 2008 and petit test were used for trend and change point analysis a brief description of these tests is given below 3 2 mann kendall test many researchers and practitioners have used the nonparametric mann kendall mk kendall 1975 mann 1945 statistical test to find trends in recorded hydrologic time series such as streamflow and water quality and precipitation time series since trend detection of hydrological variables gives valuable information on the likelihood of change tendency of the variables in the future trend analysis has proven to be a useful technique for successful water resources planning design and management consider a time series y 1 y 2 y 3 y n representing the observation of a natural process the s statistic for this time series can be estimated as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn y j y i where n is the number of samples and y j a n d y i are from i 1 2 3 n 1 and j 1 1 n 2 sgn y j y i 1 i f y j y i 0 0 i f y j y i 0 1 i f y j y i 0 if n is greater than 8 the statistic s approximates a normal distribution with zero mean and variance v 3 v n n 1 2 n 5 18 the mann kendall z statistic is written as 4 z s 1 v 0 5 s 0 0 v 0 5 s 0 s 1 v 0 5 s 0 if z less than 0 it indicates a decreasing trend and vice versa this study considers confidential levels of 95 α 0 05 3 3 petit test pettitt test is one of the homogeneity tests used to detect abrupt changes in time series data pettitt 1979 it is considered the most reliable method for finding break or change points in time series data costa and soares 2009 wijngaard et al 2003 the pettitt test like other tests is more sensitive to breaks in the middle of a time series wijngaard et al 2003 venkatesh et al 2022 the null hypothesis is that the data is independent uniformly distributed random variables while the alternative is a stepwise shift in the mean more details about the test can be read from costa and soares 2009 3 4 at site flood estimation the flood estimation for each station is done in two phases in the first phase based on the goodness of fit test the probability distribution function that best fits the given station is selected from the widely used probability distributions this study uses the anderson darling test to select the best fit distribution once the best distribution is selected in the second phase the parameters and design flood flood quantiles are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator 3 5 anderson darling test anderson and darling anderson and darling 1954 developed the anderson darling detecting deviations from normality in sample distributions the ad statistic is extensively utilized in flood frequency analysis because it performs well with small sample sets and distributions with many tails haddad and rahman 2011 the non directional ad test statistic a2 is calculated using the following formula 5 a 2 n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 lnf u i 2 n 1 2 i ln f 1 u i where u 1 u n denotes an ordered from smallest to largest element sample of size n and f u denotes the underlying theoretical cumulative distribution to which the sample is compared the null hypothesis that u 1 u n is derived from the underlying distribution is called the null hypothesis f u is rejected if a2 is greater than the critical value a2 at a given α 95 confidence level the critical values for the anderson darling test depend on the specific distribution being tested 3 6 parameter estimation in this study the parameters of the flood frequency curve were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle the maximum likelihood method is adopted as it gives better estimates than the method of moments approach in some studies nazmi et al 2020 the mle aims to make inferences about the population that would have most likely generated the sample assuming that we have n independent identically distributed samples x1 x2 x3 xn each xi has a pdf given by f x i μ where u u1 u2 ul is a set of unknown parameters to be estimated the log likelihood function is defined as 6 l μ j 1 n log f x i μ the ml estimate of μ is the one that maximizes the value of l μ for the given set of observations several optimization methods such as newton raphson gradient search methods can be used to estimate the value of μ we have used the newton raphson method for numerical optimization in this study 3 7 regression models this section briefly describes the different regression models applied in the study for the regional flood frequency analysis the regression models estimate the relationship between the different predictors and the flood estimates firstly the proposed method using extreme gradient boosting and bayesian optimization is described later the benchmark models such as ann and mlr are described 3 7 1 extreme gradient boosting the extreme gradient boosting is a ml model based on scalable boosting trees capable of capturing the complex nonlinear relationship between a set of predictor and output variables xgb is a cart classification and regression tree based algorithm similar to gradient boosting machines with specific model structural differences chen and guestrin 2016 xgb employs second order derivatives whereas regular gbm utilizes first order derivatives chen and guestrin 2016b compared to gbm xgb is more effective and less likely to result in model overfit as it uses the improved regularization functions chen and guestrin 2016 chen et al 2019a the parallel processing in xgb speeds up the gradient boosting techniques and provides better performance than regular gbm chen et al 2019b generally regression problems involving input variables xi ℝd where i 1 2 n and n are the number of input variables and target variable y i ℝ can be cast in cart an ensemble tree model using the generic form of cart in the following manner chen and guestrin 2016 7 y i φ x i k 1 k p k x i t k f here φ x i is a function that relates the model inputs to the model prediction y i r where f p x w q x q r m t w r t represents the entire space of the regression tree p k refers to the single tree structure the number of leaves in the tree p k is t and the leaf weights are w the goal function in xgb includes a loss function as well as a regularization term given as chen and guestrin 2016 8 l ϕ i l y i y i k ω p k where 9 ω p γ t 1 2 λ w 2 here l is the differentiable convex loss function that is used to calculate the difference between the target y i and prediction y i during training the period the second term ω denotes the regularization term which penalizes the objective function depending on model complexity since classical methods of model optimization are ineffective for the tree ensemble model xgbt which is represented by eq 2 an alternate method of additive approach is applied for model training chen and guestrin 2016 in this method a function pt is added to improve eq 2 for predicting the y i t at the ith instance after tth iteration as chen and guestrin 2016 10 l t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 p t x i ω p t taylor series second order expansion is used to quickly optimize the objective function by following steps friedman et al 2000 11 l t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 g i p t x i 1 2 h i p t 2 x i ω p t the gradient statistics of the loss function for the first order g i and second order h i are as follows 12 g i y t 1 l y i y i t 1 and 13 h i y t 1 2 l i y i t 1 by eliminating the constant term for step t the objective function can be reduced to 14 l t i 1 n g i p t x i 1 2 h i p t 2 x i ω p t by defining i j i q x i j and expanding ω the eq 8 can be rewritten as 15 l t i 1 n g i p t x i 1 2 h i p t 2 x i γ t 1 2 λ j 1 t w j 2 j 1 t i i j g i w j 1 2 i i j h i λ w j 2 γ t for a fixed structure q x the weight w j and consequent optimal value l t q of a leaf j may now be computed as 16 w j i i j g i i i j h i λ and 17 l t q 1 2 j 1 t i i j g i 2 i i j h i λ γ t eq 16 can assess the quality of a tree structure q the solution for this problem can be obtained through an algorithm that adds branches to a tree from a single leaf at each iteration however it is computationally intense to compute all the trees simultaneously and find the best one the problem is solved using an algorithm proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 in which every iteration adds a branch to the tree from a single leaf if the tree splitting for left and right nodes are il and ir respectively the loss reduction by summing them as i i l u i r can be calculated as chen and guestrin 2016 18 l split 1 2 i i l g i 2 i i l h i λ i i r g i 2 i i r h i λ i i g i 2 i i h i λ γ 3 8 bayesian optimization hyper parameters are significant for machine learning algorithms because they directly regulate the behaviors of training algorithms and have a major impact on machine learning model performance wu et al 2019 an efficient hyper parameter optimization technique can be devised for any machine learning method that will considerably enhance machine learning efficiency wu et al 2019 bayesian optimization is used here for optimizing the hyper parameters bayesian optimization is an excellent way to find the extrema of computationally expensive functions to solve brochu et al 2010 it creates a prior optimization function and gathers data from previous samples to update the optimization function s posterior wu et al 2019 the bayesian optimization involves two steps i choosing a surrogate model to incorporate prior beliefs about the objective function and ii acquisition function for proposing sampling points in the search space this study uses gaussian processes as the surrogate model in defining the prior over the objective function more details about the theory and background of bayesian optimization can be found in wu et al 2019a all the models for xgb and bayesian optimization were developed in python 3 8 1 artificial neural network several independent studies agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 amato et al 2013 baxt 1990 have shown that ann models have superior generalization capabilities to regression based models the ann model is better at detecting nonlinear correlations between observed and forecasted data sets kasi et al 2020b el shafie et al 2011 hsu et al 1995 fig 3 shows a schematic representation of an ann model concept the first column denotes numerous input variables xi while the second denotes the weight of input variables w i a provided vector is used to decide the output the neuron is introduced to a constant value 1 among the inputs by its unique weight known as bias b the ann can modify the activation function via bias it s vital to remember that bias isn t required for a network to function but it can dramatically improve its performance araghinejad 2013 an ann model with interlinking between the input and output data layers is shown in fig 3 a b it has three input neurons two hidden layers of three and two percepterons and an output layer in an ann model a neuron s input i and output y can be represented mathematically as 19 i x w b 20 y 1 i f i θ 0 i f i θ where x represents the input w represents the weight b represents the bias and θ represents the threshold value 3 8 2 multiple linear regression regression analysis is a modeling tool for examining the relationship between one or more independent variables x 1 x 2 x k and a continuous real valued dependent variable y amral et al 2007a the mlr model used in the present study can be written as follows 21 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β k x k ε where y denotes the design flood and x i denotes the affecting factors β i is regression parameters with respect to x i and ε denotes the error term the error term ε has a constant variance and a zero mean value parameters β i are estimates using the least squares method by minimizing the sum of squared residuals 3 9 k folds cross validation cross validation cv has been one of the most prominent strategies for model selection and validation arlot and celisse 2010 presents a thorough overview of the literature in this approach the data set is split into k splits each data split is called a fold and then the k 1 folds are used to build a model while the left out sample is utilized to validate each of the k folds is assigned as validation data during the iteration of this technique for k times burman 1989 claimed that folds less than 5 could be problematic to summarize the choice of k in k fold cross validation results in a bias variance trade off given these factors k fold cross validation with k 5 or k 10 is typically used as these values have been proved empirically to generate test error rate estimates with neither excessively high bias nor very high variation james et al 2013 3 10 model development and performance analysis based on previous studies aziz et al 2011 zaman et al 2012 a total of ten predictors were selected in this study most of the predictors nine of ten were obtained directly from the camels dataset the maximum rainfall intensity was derived by fitting the best distribution for extreme rainfall values similarly the dependent variable the flood quantiles was estimated using the best fit probability distribution function to the annual maximum flood discharge in this study individual regression models were developed for estimating flood quantiles of different return periods therefore a total of six regression models were developed for estimating floods with 2 yr q2 5 yr q5 10 yr q10 20 yr q20 50 yr q50 and 100 yr q100 return periods as described in the methodology section the regression models were developed using three methods in the xgb model bayesian optimization was used to optimize the parameters andk fold cross validation with k 10 was used to estimate the skill of the models table 3 show the hyperparameters optimized in this study and the corresponding ranges in this case for each return period different sets of parameters were obtained by the bayesian optimization method and those were used while training the xgb model a 2 layer feed forward neural network with two hidden layers is selected for the ann model and a levenberg marquardt algorithm is used for model training the activation function represented in the model was log normal we have used the ordinary least squares approach for the multiple linear regression model to estimate the regression coefficients a set of statistic metrics was evaluated listed in eq 22 25 to assess the model performance these include mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse normalized root mean squared error nrmse and percentage bias pbias mae mean absolute error is the average absolute value of the differences between the predicted and the relevant observation over the verification sample because the mae is a linear score all individual differences are weighted equally in the average mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse mae is calculated as 22 mae y i y i 1 n samples i 0 n samples y i y i the standard deviation of the residuals prediction errors is denoted by root mean squared error rmse residuals measure how far away the data points are from the regression line they measure how spread out these residuals are barnston 1992 rmse is calculated as 23 r m s e y i y i 1 n samples i 0 n samples y i y i 2 the rmse can be normalized to make comparisons between datasets or models with different scales easier the normalized rmse nrmse relates the rmse to the variable s observed range nrmse is calculated as 24 n r m s e rmse y i m a x y i m i n the average tendency of the simulated values to be bigger or lower than their observed values is measured by percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 pbias has an optimum value of 0 0 it is calculated as 25 b i a s i n p e r c e n t i 1 n y i y i i 1 n y i 100 where n is the number of stations y i and y i are the predicted and observed flood discharges 3 11 variable importance machine learning models interpretability in hydrology is as crucial as their prediction accuracy techniques that assign a score to input features depending on how important they predict a target variable are known as feature importance feature ranking is critical for expanding the use of machine learning approaches because they provide insight into the data the model and the foundation for dimensionality reduction and feature selection all of which can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a predictive model on the problem in this study to determine the critical input variables the gini impurity permutation and dropout loss feature ranking methods were applied to visualize the implicit feature selection by xgb models more details about these methods are provided in the appendix 4 results and discussion the preliminary analysis of the camels data and in site flood estimation was carried out in section 4 1 following three different regression models were compared for flood estimation of different return periods in section 4 2 finally the performance of the xgb model is tested for estimating the flood quantiles in ungauged basins moreover three methods such as the gini impurity permutation and dropout feature ranking methods are employed to investigate each feature s influence used as predictor variables on target variable design flow in section 4 3 4 1 preliminary and in site flood estimation firstly all the stations in the camels data set with no discrepancies and streamflow records of more than 30 years were selected then the mann kendall test homogeneity test was applied to these stations the results from the mk test as shown in table 4 reveal that the change in trend observed was in 46 stations 15 stations with an increasing trend and 31 stations with decreasing trend and there is no significant trend in 625 stations these 46 stations with evident trends or abrupt changes were not selected for further analysis as shown in fig 1 the extreme annual streamflow data for each station is used in the pettitt test to detect the change point the threshold of the test was derived based on the 95 quantile value of the test statistic the test outcomes are shown in fig 4 where a histogram has been drawn between the number of stations and their corresponding p values almost all stations have p values less than the critical value of 1 69 confirming no significant change point observed in the data the anderson darling test was conducted using the 35 year data for each station s annual maximum series of rainfall and streamflow separately fig 5 shows the ad test statistic and threshold based on the critical value at 95 confidence level of the a2 value for gev distribution gumbel distribution normal distribution and gpd distribution respectively the anderson darling statistic assesses how closely the data fit a particular distribution the smaller this statistic is for a given distribution the better the distribution fits the data fig 6 shows that the gev distribution has a low critical value of 0 63 compared to the other three distributions at 0 98 2 64 and 2 86 respectively around 640 out of 671 stations have a2 statistics below the critical value at a 95 confidence level in gev so gev distribution is selected for estimating the rainfall intensities values a similar analysis for streamflow value shows that log pearson type iii distribution fits the best for most of the stations which is in congruence with the results reported in another study by griffis and stedinger 2007 4 2 regression model development as elaborated in the methodology three regression models mlr ann and xgb were compared for flood estimation of different return periods the model inputs for all the models remain the same including the selected catchment descriptors and rainfall intensities for a given return period table 5 compares the median values of the k fold results from all three models for different return periods the xgb model optimized using the bayesian method provides accurate estimates for the different estimates in terms of percentage bias it was observed that eta learning rate and minimum child weight are the sensitive xgb hyperparameters and corresponding optimal values were equal to 0 01 and 0 1 respectively the percentage bias during the validation was well within the 5 for all the return periods ann model outperformed the mlr model on all evaluation metrics the results exhibit that rmse values follow a pattern in the two models for all quantiles with the least value of 24 460 m3 s for q2 a maximum value of 79 620 m3 s for q100 for ann and a minimum value of 23 916 m3 s for q2 and a limit of 87 63 m3 s for q100 for mlr model at the same time results show similar performances by both the models with little difference in percentage bias in all return periods as the pbias values are far from zero we can conclude that both models performed poorly on the other hand mae also has a pattern of rising inaccuracy with higher quantiles ann has a minimum and maximum value of 16 47 and 62 526 while mlr has a minimum and maximum value of 17 24 and 70 414 it is worth noting that compared to xgb models neither model is ideal for all six return periods table 6 shows the worst median and best values of all three models for the 100 year return period validated by the different folds in terms of rmse and pbias we found that all three models had over estimations and under estimations with xgb performing better than the other two models the selection of draw out samples had an average impact on the ann model and the mlr model with rmse performance ranged from 50 47 m3 s to 110 40 m3 s in ann and 54 73 m3 s to 102 70 m3 s in mlr both ann and mlr showed almost similar performances in pbias too on the other hand from the xgb model utilizing different folds yielded a better range of results in rmse from 38 20 m3 s to 69 56 m3 s the pbias values of 10 folds in the xgb model differ from 9 23 to 8 12 with the best fold value of 0 24 based on the worst and best values from table 5 we can say that the xgb model is performing well in all 10 folds further analyzing the 10 fold results only from xgb the best model based on fig 6 shows the accuracy of the xgb based models in terms of mae rmse nrmse and percentage bias in the flood estimation during 10 fold validation all models performed admirably well for all the quantiles with the minimum rmse value of 8 m3 s for q2 and for the remaining return periods rmse values range from 15 to 40 the findings show that all the models performed well for all six return periods we observe a pattern in results when the return periods gradually increase and model performance worsens among all the models model 1 performed admirably for all the quantiles with the minimum mae value of 5 2 m3 s for q2 and just above 30 5 m3 s for q100 the performance of the models in flood estimation was shown in fig 6c in terms of nrmse normalized root mean square error normalizing the rmse makes comparing datasets or models with different scales easier low nrmse values represent less residual variance therefore in fig 6c we can observe that the 2 year return period and 100 year return period have low nrmse values boxplot range compared to other return periods which implies that flood estimation of 2 yr and 100 yr return period has a less residual deviation from the observed values however compared to the 2 yr and 100 yr return period nrmse values there is no substantial variance for the other three return periods indicating that all the return periods performed well in flood estimation fig 6d shows the performance of the models in flood estimation in terms of percentage bias the average tendency of the simulated values to be bigger or lower than their observed values is measured by percent bias pbias pbias has an ideal value of 0 and low magnitude values indicate accurate model simulation model overestimation bias is indicated by positive values whereas negative values indicate model underestimation bias the findings show that all the models performed well for all six quantiles there is no discernible under prediction or over prediction pattern for both minor or large floods among all model 1 performed admirably for all the quantiles with a median of boxplot with minimum deviation from zero as q5 q10 q100 are just above and q2 q50 quantiles are just below zero to understand the performance of the model across different catchment sizes we compared see fig 7 the accuracy of flood prediction in different catchment sizes for 100 year period the boxplot range of pbias is almost similar across all catchment sizes with maximum range of 4 to 0 5 in the catchments more than 900 km2 this demonstrates that regardless of catchment size the model performs almost equally in terms of flood prediction if the catchment sizes are really large we may see some differences in the results but with the camels data we have where the catchment sizes range from 4 km2 to 25000 km2 all of the catchment sizes exhibit pretty much identical results 4 3 flood estimation in ungauged basins from the analysis of the results it was observed that the xgb models could better capture the flood quantile values than other models therefore the xgb model is used for estimating flood quantiles for this purpose we have trained the model using 600 stations selected randomly and used the model to predict the flood values in the remaining stations fig 8 depicts the scatter plot between observed discharge and simulated results from the xgb model during training and testing periods for each return period 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year fig 8 shows that xgb models performed accurately for different return periods without significant deviations from the x y line both observed and simulated streamflows perform admirably in the testing with slight deviations from the x y line and for all the return periods the model simulations are well with the 10 band around the x y line regarding the flood estimates uncertainties the percentage bias was reported in the order of 20 30 in some of the studies baldassarre and montanari 2009 zhao et al 2020 the pbias of 10 15 reported in the present study is highly impressive considering the results of other studies and difficulties in estimating the design flood also comparing the results with zhao et al 2020 and smith et al 2015 the present study improved the model accuracy and percentage bias unsurprisingly the prediction accuracy seems to reduce with larger flood magnitude and higher return periods this could be because the at site design flood estimated is not the truth and large return period floods are difficult to estimate reliably with limited observed data zhao et al 2020 we can see that when the frequency of the return period increases the deviations also increase 4 4 comparison of the ann and deep learning models multiple linear regression mlr was considered the benchmark model in this study the ann model was chosen as it represents the machine learning method without hyper parameter optimization xgb was considered for its buildable complexity and ability to capture nonlinear relationships it was observed that the nonlinear methods like ann and xgb outperformed the mlr models as expected among the ann and xgb models the xgb model showed promise in accuracy and other error metrics in the past several studies have shown the superior performance of the xgb over the ann model and have attributed it to the fact that the xgb models are derivative free and due to that there is some advantage when fitting problems with large degrees of freedom conversely ann models are based on derivatives and get over fitted or under fitted when under higher degrees of freedom several past studies liu et al 2021 wu and fan 2019 have shown that xgb performs better than the ann model the reason for inferior performance of the ann in the present study could be attributed to the absence of the optimization of the hyper parameters weights whereas bayesian optimization was employed for estimating hyper parameters in xgb the fine tuning of parameters could possibly be one reason for the superior performance of the xgb models however it is to be noted that the performance of these models could vary with the difference in input data data length and study region this study utilized camels data and 600 stations have been chosen for training and validation model training and validation with one set of split sample might be misleading and prone to sampling bias therefore to reduce the impact of sampling bias on the model performance the k fold cross validation test was used and the results have shown that the performance of these models was equally good in all the folds to investigate the influence of each feature used as predictor variables on target variable design flow we have employed three methods the gini impurity permutation and dropout feature ranking fig 9 shows the feature importance plots from the three methods all three approaches reveal that rainfall intensity slope fraction snow soil porosity and temperature are the watershed characteristics that strongly impact design flood compared to other catchment characteristics that show minimal impact as expected rainfall intensity is the most influential meteorological attribute with the highest score among the remaining attributes while soil conductivity area and fraction forest score low in all three approaches in dropout loss feature importance rainfall intensity has the highest dropout loss indicating that it is one most significant factors and soil conductivity area mar fraction forest and mapet are the variables having negative values which means these variables are negatively impacting in the prediction of streamflow in the order shown in fig 9c from soil conductivity to mapet in summary rainfall intensity slope soil porosity and a fraction of snow are the most impactful variables influencing design flood prediction in contrast soil conductivity area and fraction forest have a low impact in predicting design floods however these results provide the overall dominant controls of the design flood considering all the stations in the usa to make the analysis more insightful we have considered hydroclimatic regions and performed a similar analysis the national centres for environmental information ncei has identified nine climatically consistent regions within the contiguous united states using the climatic regions as the background all camels stations are divided into eight regions as the central region is merged into the southeast region due to a smaller number of stations in the central region as shown in fig 10 within each region each feature s influence was investigated to understand the variability of the dominant control of the design flood in that specific region fig 11 a c depict the scores of each variable in terms of percentages for eight different climate regions in the usa using the three different variable importance methods such as the gini impurity permutation and dropout feature ranking methods respectively we can observe from the plots that rainfall intensity was a dominant attribute in the northwest west southwest and northeast regions snow was the first dominant attribute in the west north central and east north central regions and the second dominant in the northeast and northwest soil properties are the dominant variable in southeast and south regions on the other hand as expected snow was the least impactful attribute in the west southwest and south regions temperature and slope are the least dominant feature in northwest and east north central regions in the southwest west north central south and northeast regions soil conductivity and forest land cover are the least impactful variable overall the results indicate that the variable importance scores calculated using three different methods are comparable and related to the climate scenarios in the united states 5 conclusions we developed an extreme gradient boost xgb machine learning model for rffa and flood estimation and tested the model over 600 observed discharge catchments the mann kendall and pettitt tests were employed to confirm the trend and homogeneity of discharge data the goodness of fit tests rainfall and streamflow extremes were fitted with a specific distribution for return periods of 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 years the at site floods were estimated using a log pearson type iii distribution three statistical error metrics were used to evaluate the model performance our analysis showed the effectiveness of the xgb based regional flood frequency model over the ann and mlr based regional flood frequency models gini impurity permutation and dropout loss feature ranking methods demonstrated that rainfall intensity slope soil porosity and fraction snow are the most important predictor variables in contrast mean annual areal potential evapotranspiration mean annual rainfall drainage area temperature fraction forest and soil conductivity have minimal value in predicting design floods for an ungauged catchment the findings are helpful as most predictor variables are widely available for most catchments the developed xgb approach has much promise for estimating extreme flood magnitudes in the united states with pbias ranging from 10 to 10 for all design floods this is anticipated to result in a significant improvement in the skill of worldwide flood inundation models 6 data availability the camels catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies data set was used to test the proposed

discriminative value was for the regression problem under investigation a2 permutation feature importance the permutation importance is a technique for correcting the gini importance s bias altmann et al 2010 in a general context this approach directly gauges feature relevance by evaluating how each predictor s performance is influenced by random re shuffling thus preserving the variable s distribution explaining feature importance by example of a random forest by eryk lewinson towards data science the approach can be broken down into the following steps 1 by passing the validation set train the baseline model and record the score accuracy r2 any metric of interest this can also be done on the training set albeit at the penalty of losing generalization information 2 reshuffle values from one feature in the selected dataset then re run the dataset through the model to get predictions and calculate the metric for this new dataset the difference between the benchmark score and the modified permuted dataset score is the feature significance 3 repeat the 2nd step for all of the dataset s features a3 dropout loss feature importance units that have dropped out are referred to as dropouts chang et al 2017 dropping a unit out refers to eliminating it from the model for the time being this technique is pretty intuitive as we compare a model with all features with a model with this feature removed during training to see how important it is due to the need to retrain the model for each variety of the dataset there may be a large computational cost after dropping a single feature column explaining feature importance by the example of a random forest by eryk lewinson towards data science the decrease in accuracy score indicates how much the model depends on the tested predictor i e higher dropout for more important variable because this technique breaks the link between covariate and classification target konapala et al 2020 
2907,a set of quantitative precipitation estimates qpes from a dual polarisation x band radar observation campaign in a mountainous area of northern scotland is assessed with reference to observed river flows as well as being compared to estimates from the uk c band radar and raingauge networks employing estimation methods of varying complexity the x band qpes are trialled as alternative inputs to grid to grid g2g a distributed hydrological model to produce simulated river flows for comparison with observations this hydrological assessment complements and extends a previous meteorological assessment that used point raingauge data only precipitation estimates for two periods over the observation campaign in 2016 march to april and june to august are assessed during the second period increased incorporation of dual polarisation variables into the radar processing chain is found to be of considerable benefit whereas during the first period the low height of the melting layer often restricts their use as a result of the complex topography in northern scotland the lowest usable elevation lue of the x band radar observations is found to be a stronger indicator of the hydrological model performance than range from the radar for catchments with an lue of less than 3 km the best x band qpe typically performs better for modelling river flow than using an estimate from the uk c band radar network the hydrological assessment framework used here brings fresh insights into the performance of the different qpes as well as providing a stimulus for targeted improvements to dual polarisation radar based qpes that have wider relevance beyond the case study situation keywords weather radar dual polarisation x band precipitation river flow distributed hydrological model data availability the nxpol qpes are from the rains campaign reported by neely et al 2021 and the calibrated nxpol radar data are accessible via the ceda archive bennett 2019 the r c band qpe data used in this study are identical up to minor differences due to missing data to the 1 km resolution uk composite rainfall product available from the ceda archive met office 2003 the river flow and raingauge data were provided by sepa for potential evaporation 40 km gridded monthly values were used here taken as the monthly average of morecs pe hough and jones 1997 thompson et al 1981 over the period 1981 to 2010 available from the uk met office air temperature data were from the post processing of the uk met office weather prediction model ukpp moseley 2011 1 introduction observing in a quantitative and robust way the dynamic space time pattern of precipitation in hilly and mountainous terrain presents a major challenge of great practical importance across the world a common approach is to obtain quantitative precipitation estimates qpes using observations from networks of weather radars and or raingauges such gridded qpes have a wide range of applications from the images seen on weather forecasts through to their quantitative use in hydrological modelling river flow forecasting and water resource simulation however there are a number of issues to be considered when forming such qpes for high latitude mountainous regions networks of raingauges are typically sparse in mountainous areas due to difficulties of access so lack representativity in capturing the complex rainfall patterns found in these topographically varied domains further problems can be associated with wind induced under catch solid phase precipitation and instrument blockage wetting and evaporation loss sevruk 1982 price 1999 weather radar networks provide better spatial coverage and can be used in isolation or in combination with raingauges to make the best of these complementary sensors of areal and point rainfall however such radar networks often provide less than ideal observation coverage or quality in areas of high relief due to issues such as beam blockage range effects and variability in the vertical profile of precipitation including changes of water phase and low level orographic enhancement in addition to the impact of range on beam broadening and non uniform beam filling overshooting of precipitation becomes more likely in areas of orography koistinen and pohjola 2014 yu et al 2018 a particular issue affecting high latitude locations is the presence of a melting layer which can be close to the surface and appear as enhanced radar reflectivity via the bright band effect the robustness of radar rainfall estimates is also dependent on artefacts of the sensed environment and post processing operations the introduction of dual polarisation radar capabilities has brought benefits to precipitation estimation ryzhkov and zrnić 1995 2019 illingworth 2004 montopoli et al 2017 wijayarathne et al 2020 and river flow simulation in mountainous terrain anagnostou et al 2018 however a detailed assessment of the benefits to hydrological modelling of the different dual polarisation processing steps and retrievals has not been undertaken this is an important novelty of the paper presented here studies investigating the improvement for hydrological simulation of employing dual polarisation relative to single polarisation are few one example is the study by gourley et al 2010 for nine severe storm events from 2005 to 2008 over a 813 km2 catchment area in oklahoma usa with a hydrological focus on a 342 km2 gauged catchment they found that improved hydrological model performance was only achieved once long term biases in the qpes were identified and corrected for whilst the single polarisation qpe assessed against raingauges had a lower bias 9 compared to 31 the best dual polarisation qpe had a bias that was stationary whereas that of the single polarisation qpe fluctuated with event rain intensity attributed to varying drop size distributions and hail this provides evidence for dual polarisation stabilising the error structure across varying types of storm correction for bias resorted to use of the raingauge network seeking improvement through studies of radar qpe errors focussed on range effects across a range of environments was recommended for future work a more recent hydrological assessment employing dual polarisation radar by he et al 2018 focussed on a flat area of denmark with a complex hydrological regime influenced by groundwater there was little to choose between the use of raingauge single and dual polarisation qpes for these environmental conditions whilst the potential benefits of dual polarisation in complex terrain was recognised application of x band dual polarisation radars for qpe in mountainous environments has several advantages over more conventional network radars lim et al 2014 yu et al 2018 known limitations of x band radar such as their increased susceptibility to attenuation and typically lower azimuthal interval due to smaller antenna sizes are less relevant in mountainous environments where topographic blockage and low level precipitation formation typically impose severe constraints on the maximum useful radar range the reduced cost of x band radars when compared to c band or s band systems is particularly advantageous making them well suited for filling gaps within existing radar networks to rectify areas of poorer local coverage in addition dual polarisation has advantages in mountainous areas since phase shift based precipitation estimators using specific differential phase are immune to the effects of partial beam blockage which are prevalent in such locations this allows the use of radar observations from lower elevations than would be possible with a single polarisation system the benefit is greatest for x band radars as phase shift measurements from lower wavelength radars have a greater sensitivity to precipitation intensity sachidananda and zrnić 1986 anagnostou et al 2004 turning to hydrological use based on experience limited to using networks of single polarisation c band radars and raingauges in the uk precipitation estimates from raingauges have been preferred over radar based qpes for hydrological model development cole and moore 2008 2009 moore et al 2012 partly this is down to the more stable error structure of raingauge data associated with the simplicity of direct measurement and application of quality control checks e g howard et al 2012 which can be partially eliminated from modelled flows during the calibration of the hydrological model in contrast a range of artefacts can feature in the radar errors arising from the sensed environment or in the post processing with some not readily diagnosed or corrected radar based qpes can suffer from transient under or over estimation of the precipitation on sub daily and sub hourly timescales although radar rainfall performance can be improved through applying radar raingauge adjustment or merging methods the effect of transient errors can persist and affect estimator robustness it is in the context of increasing qpe robustness that dual polarisation methodologies show greatest promise for improving radar rainfall use in hydrological modelling this is an important motivator for the work reported on here further there are particular advantages in radar rainfall for hydrological applications at smaller spatial and temporal scales such as for modelling flash floods and in urban hydrology berne and krajewski 2013 thorndahl et al 2017 where convective storm cells may be missed completely by the relative sparsity of a raingauge network the work presented here employs a unique radar dataset from the rains radar applications in northern scotland campaign bennett 2019 neely et al 2021 this campaign deployed the ncas mobile x band dual polarisation doppler weather radar nxpol available for research studies neely et al 2018 in the scottish highlands near inverness over two periods in 2016 the aim of the present work is to assess the improvement to radar qpes particularly for use as input to a hydrological model for simulating river flow over an area where the existing national network of weather radars and raingauges has known shortcomings importantly it has been possible to exploit nxpol data to produce qpes using processing chains of varying complexity and differing extent of use of dual polarisation capability previously neely et al 2021 had shown that precipitation estimates from the second period of the rains campaign were able to outperform estimates from the uk c band radar network for certain parts of the study area when assessed against raingauge measurements the present investigation aims to assess whether these benefits to qpe pass through to hydrological model simulations of river flow in mountainous locations and ascertain any dependence on the characteristics of the catchments being modelled and the season of the year to undertake this nxpol derived qpes from both periods of the rains campaign along with estimates from the uk c band network and raingauge data are used as input to the g2g distributed hydrological model and assessed by comparing the model simulated river flows against observations at gauged locations importantly such a hydrological assessment essentially integrates qpes over space and time complementing the traditional point based meteorological comparison with raingauge data it can provide additional insights into the performance of the qpes helping to stimulate future improvements to radar based qpe methods the hydrological approach through its space time integration allows the radar estimated precipitation to be evaluated over entire catchment areas circumventing both potential raingauge issues and reducing sensitivity to localised artefacts in radar based qpes that may heavily influence such point based assessments the results of this investigation are likely to be of value to those interested in the use of dual polarisation capabilities in networks of c band radars as well as for x band radars deployed for network coverage infill purposes and for local high resolution applications relating to urban storm drainage management this paper is organised as follows first in section 2 details are given of the dual polarisation x band radar campaign over northern scotland including the methods of increasing complexity used in nxpol s qpe processing chain section 3 describes two alternative gridded qpes included in the assessment of methods one from the network c band radars and the other from interpolating raingauge data section 4 outlines the g2g distributed hydrological model and how it is used to obtain simulated river flows from each qpe method for comparison with observations across selected catchments detailed in section 5 the performance statistics used to assess each qpe method through comparison of modelled and observed river flow are described in section 6 section 7 describes the performance assessment of the qpe methods and examines the influence on performance of the lowest usable elevation lue the radar range and the study period a broader discussion and concluding remarks follow in section 8 2 the dual polarisation x band radar campaign over northern scotland 2 1 study area the location of the nxpol radar at kinloss barracks near inverness in the scottish highlands is shown as a red dot in fig 1 a this site was chosen for the radar to infill an area of reduced coverage in scotland within the c band weather radar network across the british isles comparison to raingauge measurements over this area have shown radar rainfall estimates to be less accurate worsfold et al 2014 particularly on account of the large distance to the nearest c band radar and also in relation to topography and beam blockage effects harrison et al 2012 the c band radar network includes four installations in scotland locations of two of them at druim a starraig 166 km to the northwest of nxpol and at hill of dudwick 95 km to the east are marked as blue dots in fig 1a the other two munduff hill and holehead at distances 161 and 187 km from nxpol respectively are off the map to the south also the locations of raingauges in sepa s hydrometric network over the study area are shown by green triangles in fig 1a the study area has several mountainous parts notably the cairngorms in the eastern highlands to the south of nxpol with the summit reaching 1309 m and those of the western highlands to the west reaching a height of 1150 m within 100 km of the radar site these lead to radar beam blockages and local orographic enhancements to the precipitation both of which provide additional challenges for radar qpe georgiou et al 2012 the spatial distribution of annual average rainfall in the region is variable from less than 700 mm for some areas of the eastern coast to greater than 3000 mm over some parts of the western highlands 1981 2010 average precipitation map met office 2018 an additional challenge is posed by the typically low altitude of the melting layer during winter which often leads to accumulations of solid precipitation particularly in upland areas the low melting layer limits the effectiveness of dual polarisation processing which is partly based on the electromagnetic scattering properties of liquid precipitation and is particularly pronounced when the surface topography requires that qpe uses higher altitude radar data on the other hand the study area is well suited for assessing precipitation using hydrological models as topography acts as a dominant control on runoff production the impermeable geology means there are no groundwater transfers between catchments and the baseflow fraction is low so antecedent condition effects do not persist for extended periods of time additionally the headwater catchments are typically rapidly responding which limits the possible temporal averaging of transient errors in the qpe 2 2 description of nxpol qpes assessed to deal with mountainous terrain in the vicinity of nxpol radar scans are taken at different angles relative to the ground observations from those scans considered to be at the lue are combined to create a two dimensional qpe full details of the nxpol radar and its rain retrieval methods are provided in neely et al 2021 briefly the system has a 75 kw peak power output split between the two transmit channels operates using simultaneous transmit and receive star for dual polarisation moment estimation has a 2 4 m antenna leading to a half power beam width of 0 98 narrower than most x band systems and operates without a radome in this campaign nxpol collected a volume of observations consisting of ten 360 plan position indicator ppi sweeps at increasing elevation angles including but not limited to 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 4 each ppi has an azimuthal interval of 1 and a 150 m range gate spacing to a maximum range of 150 km the full volume scan cycle took approximately 5 5 min and is labelled in this analysis by the start time of each volume using a static look up table based on the minimum detectable signal and the occurrence of clutter each volume of ppis was collapsed into a single lue product the lue method described in neely et al 2021 differs from the typical radar data gridding approach as it considers the impact of the blocked fraction on the minimum detectable signal with increasing range rather than using a fixed fraction to eliminate low elevations it also incorporates the impact of ground clutter on radar data quality substituting areas that have significantly elevated echo occurrence percentages with data from higher elevation angles to achieve this data for each range gate are taken from the lowest elevation that has both a minimum detectable signal of 10 dbz factoring in the impact of beam blockage based on a static partial beam blockage correction and an echo occurrence percentage of less than 75 based on a static clutter map from six non consecutive clear air days this approach is a necessary compromise between avoiding excessive beam blockage and ground clutter and the possibility of overshooting of low lying precipitation for scans with higher angles the overshooting of precipitation becomes especially problematic behind mountains and is expected to result in a considerable underestimation of the precipitation for catchments with lue greater than around 3 to 4 km a map of catchments used in this study shaded according to their mean lue is shown in fig 1b regions of high lue and anticipated poorer qpe performance are clearly visible to the south and west areas near the radar and also across the sea to the north and to a lesser extent along the great glen a geological fault line to the south west have lower lue even for catchments that are a long distance from the radar site ten different nxpol qpes summarised in table 1 were assessed using hydrological simulation in this study the first five of these methods r z to r zc in table 1 all make use of the marshall palmer relationship z 200r1 6 between reflectivity z and precipitation rate r harrison et al 2012 marshall and palmer 1948 but represent a progression of increasing data processing this starts with r z which simply applies the marshall palmer relationship to the calibrated horizontal reflectivity as measured by nxpol thus providing a baseline for the assessment of all other methods the second method r z dtm applies a partial beam blockage correction based on a digital terrain model dtm to the horizontal reflectivity before precipitation estimation this method is implemented using wradlib heistermann et al 2013 using 1 arc second srtm shuttle radar topography mission data for the surface topography r z dtm qc additionally applies dual polarisation quality control qc removing second trip echoes and non meteorological echoes using a fuzzy logic approach followed by removal of isolated pixels using connected component labelling dufton and collier 2015 dufton 2016 r z dtm qc at then applies attenuation correction through the implementation of the zphi method testud et al 2000 in this instance a minimum precipitable path length of 3 km 10 continuous range gates identified as meteorological by the fuzzy logic qc is required for data assumed to be below the melting layer based on extrapolation of surface temperature data using a fixed lapse rate of 6 c km differential phase shift is smoothed using a modification of the hubbert and bringi 1995 iterative method prior to identification of the phase limits for the calculations dufton 2016 the method assumes a constant factor of 0 27 db deg to estimate specific attenuation from specific differential phase also used in later methods for direct precipitation estimation r zc is identical to the previous method with the exception of the partial beam blockage correction being applied in this case the correction is derived from the consistency of polarimetric variables during the summer of the rains deployment as proposed by diederich et al 2015a this leads to higher estimates of the correction needed when compared to the dtm approach see neely et al 2021 for more details the next five methods make use of either specific attenuation specific differential phase or both to calculate the qpes with r zc being used as an infill when these methods are not possible above the melting layer in the case of specific attenuation for example r ah estimates precipitation intensity using specific attenuation ah assuming an atmospheric temperature of 10 c leading to a relationship of r 45 5ah 0 83 diederich et al 2015b where ah is estimated during attenuation correction by the zphi method r ah thr is identical to r ah when the total differential phase shift along the rain region path identified exceeds 5 but otherwise defaults to r zc considering this method allows an assessment of the impact of potentially spurious results during light rainfall conditions where noise in the differential phase shift measurements could have a significant impact r z ah uses the same 5 threshold on the total differential phase shift used with r ah thr but instead converts ah into a synthetic equivalent horizontal reflectivity zh syn for use in the marshall palmer relation this is the same approach taken to derive the dual polarisation beam blockage correction introduced in the r zc method this approach acts as a dynamic bias correction to reflectivity while still using the marshall palmer relation which is a good climatological fit for uk precipitation estimation r kdp z instead focuses on using specific differential phase kdp for the estimation of precipitation here the method uses the relationship from ryzhkov et al 2014 where the estimates are blended with those from r zc at all kdp estimated precipitation intensities between 10 and 20 mm h 1 using a linear weighted average below 10 mm h 1 r zc is used without kdp input the weighting accounts for the well known difficulties of estimating small values of kdp vulpiani et al 2012 the final method r dual pol is a combination of r z ah and r kdp z where specific attenuation based estimates are used as first preference followed by those utilising specific differential phase and finally reverting to reflectivity where these estimates are not available all qpe methods are applied to the published calibrated nxpol radar dataset where horizontal reflectivity is calibrated using polarimetric self consistency and differential reflectivity is calibrated using vertically pointing radar scans bennett 2019 neely et al 2021 since specific attenuation and specific differential phase are immune to radar miss calibration qpe methods involving them will be less sensitive to any temporal variations in radar calibration over the study period all nxpol radar data processing is coded in python taking advantage of the open source libraries py art helmus and collis 2016 for reading and writing cfradial files and wradlib heistermann et al 2013 for dtm estimation and gridding of the data no raingauge or climatological adjustments are applied to the nxpol derived qpes to avoid confounding the current analysis which is focussed on comparing qpes of increasing complexity in their use of radar variables the strategic aim is to develop an x band radar processing chain to which additional corrections can be applied and assessed as part of a staged evolutionary process this allows for consideration of raingauge data at a later stage perhaps as part of a wider multi sensor network qpe products were produced for two periods in 2016 period 1 from 1 march to 30 april and period 2 from 1 june to 17 august with an interval of down time for the radar in between the melting layer was typically much lower during period 1 with median heights of 1043 and 2243 m for the two periods respectively this results in much more frequent use of r zc as a fall back for the dual polarisation qpes over period 1 for use with the g2g distributed hydrological model the lue products created on the native polar coordinate system of the nxpol were regridded onto a 1 km cartesian rectilinear grid using the area weighted average of all 2d polar radar pixels intersecting with each cartesian grid cell missing and filtered radar pixels within a grid cell are excluded from the average provided they cover less than 30 of the area after which they are set to nan and counted as having zero precipitation by g2g the resulting rectilinear coordinate system is the same as used by the network c band qpe product to produce continuous qpes for use in the hydrological model any period of greater than 10 min without nxpol data was infilled using qpes from the c band network this included the entire month of may between period 1 and 2 which was subsequently excluded from the analysis of river flow apart from during may c band qpe data were only used 314 times for infilling of which 275 were used during a 23 hour period of downtime between 6 and 7 april c band data as opposed to raingauge data were chosen for infilling so as not to bias comparisons between nxpol and c band qpes the irregularly timed qpes approximately 5 5 min apart were accumulated using a simple trapezoidal rule without allowing for advection effects to produce 15 minute precipitation totals for input to g2g experience in a uk context has shown that accounting for the movement and development of storms between time steps see for example fabry et al 1994 normally has little impact on modelled river flows for the catchment scales considered here median catchment area 232 km2 3 alternative precipitation sources for comparison 3 1 r c band precipitation the uk met office operates four c band radars in scotland as part of a wider network of 18 weather radars across the british isles data from the radars are processed by the radarnet iv central processing system at exeter met office 2020 to produce an estimate of rainfall intensity at ground level the processing includes clutter removal beam blockage correction correcting for attenuation and the vertical profile of reflectivity vpr adjusting for orographic enhancement and correcting for residual bias using observations from the raingauge network harrison et al 2006 darlington et al 2016a b these corrected data are then composited into a uk wide gridded precipitation product the gridded c band rainfall intensity data used in this study were sourced from a live data feed supplied by the met office on a 1 km cartesian grid with a 5 min time step these data are identical up to minor differences in the occurrence of missing data to the 1 km resolution uk composite rainfall product available from the ceda archive met office 2003 these gridded time series were accumulated without accounting for advection as per nxpol qpe to form a c band qpe of 15 minute rainfall totals on a 1 km grid for input to the g2g hydrological model while there are several processing elements in common between nxpol and the operational c band processing the latter includes a greater use of external data sources including weather model fields for vpr correction and orographic enhancement adjustment and raingauges for bias correction harrison et al 2009 2012 georgiou et al 2012 3 2 raingauge precipitation raingauge data from sepa s hydrometric network were used to produce gridded 15 minute rainfall accumulation estimates for the whole of scotland including the study area on a 1 km grid this used a multiquadric interpolation technique hardy 1971 in an extended form cole and moore 2008 employing a euclidean measure of distance and zero offset which is equivalent to kriging with a linear variogram borga and vizzaccaro 1997 quality control of the raingauge data was performed as an initial step using the methods presented in howard et al 2012 this precipitation estimate provides a useful baseline one previously found to produce the best modelled river flow and subsequently chosen for calibration of the g2g model cole and moore 2009 for the study period the raingauge network consisted of approximately 290 tipping bucket raingauges over the whole of scotland and over the studied catchments a mean gauge density of approximately one raingauge per 290 km2 calculated using the arcmap point density tool with a 20 km neighbourhood raingauge locations within the study area are mapped in fig 1a 4 the g2g model the grid to grid g2g model is a distributed physical conceptual hydrological model bell et al 2009 environment agency 2007 2010 moore et al 2006 used for a range of research and operational applications including flood forecasting by both the scottish flood forecasting service cranston et al 2012 and the flood forecasting centre for england and wales price et al 2012 g2g is underpinned by spatial datasets on landscape properties elevation soil geology and land cover in support of its area wide application and also employs precipitation potential evaporation and air temperature as gridded time series inputs to account for sub grid heterogeneity the probability distributed model pdm moore 1985 2007 concept is employed within each grid cell to generate surface and subsurface runoff components these runoffs are routed along separate water pathways from grid cell to grid cell to produce hillslope river channel and groundwater flows return flows from the groundwater and soil water to the surface water pathway are also represented the g2g model is based on water conservation principles with its water balance updated at each time step the g2g setup used in this study follows the version used operationally by the scottish flood forecasting service it runs with a model time step of 15 min and includes use of the g2g snow hydrology module based on the pack snowmelt model moore et al 1999 although the use of spatial datasets of landscape properties reduces the importance of calibration compared to lumped conceptual hydrological models simulation mode calibration was used to improve g2g operational performance a number of parameters relating to runoff production and routing were calibrated across the whole model domain of scotland rather than just the study area using river flow observations from january to september 2016 additionally a further two parameters controlling channel roughness and return flow from soil water were adjusted separately for each gauged catchment calibration paid attention to performance over the full flow range as well at high flows relevant to its use for flood forecasting and employed a mix of visual and automated calibration tools gridded raingauge precipitation was used as input section 3 2 whilst data assimilation of river flow observations is used to enhance model performance for operational flow forecasting purposes it is not invoked here so as not to confound the comparative assessment of simulated river flow using the different qpes as input to g2g the pack formulation moore et al 1999 of the g2g snow hydrology module acts as pre processing step affecting the input precipitation air temperature is used as a threshold to differentiate between liquid and solid precipitation and also to control the melting process through a temperature excess formulation the storage and release of water in the snowpack is also represented the potential evaporation pe and air temperature inputs used here are those employed in g2g operationally for pe a standard annual profile grid of monthly averages was employed calculated as the monthly average morecs pe thompson et al 1981 hough and jones 1997 using the 40 km gridded monthly values over the 1981 to 2010 period air temperature was from the post processing of the uk met office weather prediction model ukpp for a height of 1 5 m and obtained at a 2 km and hourly space time resolution data were downscaled to a 1 km grid using a lapse rate of 5 9 c km to account for differences in mean elevations between the 2 and 1 km grid cells 5 catchment selection and river flow data fig 1 maps the 57 gauged catchments and sub catchments selected for inclusion in this study these were chosen from an original selection of 63 catchments having a mean distance of less than 100 km to the radar site and of interest to sepa of the original 63 catchments two were discounted due to missing river flow observations and two more through inspection of hydrographs revealing significant sub daily fluctuations that were attributed to measurement error a further two sites were discounted as g2g simulated flows were found to perform poorly regardless of precipitation input type the river flow data at 15 min intervals were obtained from sepa 6 performance statistics used for hydrological assessment of qpes to describe the performance of the modelled river flows and by extension that of the precipitation estimates used to produce them several statistics are employed each compare modelled flows to observations and each aim to capture a different aspect of performance one statistic the r 2 efficiency also known as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 is defined as 1 r 2 1 q t q t 2 q t q 2 here q t and q t are respectively the modelled and observed flow at time step t and q is the mean observed flow over the period this commonly used statistic places a higher weight on the larger absolute discrepancies that are typically found for high flows as such it is particularly useful in assessing the high flow regime and as an indicator of an input precipitation s suitability for use in flood modelling an r 2 efficiency of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between modelled and observed flows whilst a value of less than zero indicates that the performance as measured by mean square error is worse than would be obtained by using the observed mean flow value note that r 2 efficiency differs in its definition from the coefficient of determination r 2 where r is the correlation coefficient which does not account for bias effects on model efficiency and therefore has a larger or equal value the correlation coefficient r is also calculated this statistic is insensitive to overall absolute and relative linear biases in the modelled river flow as such it may also be less sensitive to bias corrections and other compensations applied to the qpes such as those featuring in the network c band but not the nxpol correlations have values between 1 for a perfect positive correlation and 1 for a perfect negative correlation with zero indicating no correlation the modified kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 is defined as 2 kg e 1 r 1 2 c v q c v q 1 2 q q 1 2 with c v q and c v q the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean for the modelled and observed flows respectively and q the mean modelled flow over the evaluation period this statistic obtains its maximum value of 1 for perfect agreement between model and observation in this study kge is applied to the square root of river flow denoted as kge sqrt in order to produce a general metric that places weight on low and medium flows as well as high flows it therefore may be sensitive to features in the river flow not adequately captured in the r 2 efficiency the percentage bias 100 q q q in the modelled flow compared to the observation is also calculated this statistic should approximate the relative bias in the input precipitation because of i the conservation of water within the g2g model ii the relatively low contribution of evaporation to the water balance for the humid temperate climate of northern scotland iii the small groundwater component of river flow and iv the relatively long time span of the study period compared to typical hydrological response times of the catchments unless stated otherwise all performance statistics are evaluated at the model time step of 15 min over the period 1 february to 17 august 2016 excluding the month of may for which all nxpol qpes were missing and infilled using r c band see section 2 the g2g simulations were started on 1 february 2016 with each selected precipitation input to avoid the uncertainty associated with a cold start and possibly poorly initialised water stores in the model model states that had been spun up using raingauge precipitation from a start on 10 october 2013 were used statistics are also used to quantify the influence of snow accumulation and melt on river flow this involves calculating the fraction of days for which modelled flows with gridded raingauge data as input differ by more than 20 when the g2g snow hydrology module is included as is standard or excluded all precipitation is treated as rainfall this statistic naturally captures the full impact of snow on flows including its accumulation melt rain on snow events the influence of different elevations within a catchment and how this translates into river flows 7 performance assessment the performance of the nxpol r dual pol qpe which makes full use of dual polarisation variables is assessed first each catchment in fig 2 is shaded according to the r 2 efficiency correlation and bias of g2g modelled flows using the nxpol r dual pol qpe as input except for a few catchments very close to the radar and with reference to the lue map in fig 1b the catchments with highest r 2 efficiency and highest correlation coefficient are typically those with lower lues in contrast those catchments with high lues exceeding 4 km have without exception a strong negative bias worse than 50 and a correspondingly poor r 2 efficiency below zero indicating that a large portion of the precipitation for these catchments is missed by the r dual pol qpe the correlation for these catchments is also often poor usually less than 0 5 modelled river flows calculated using either r dual pol qpe or raingauge qpe for the four example catchments delineated by bold lines in fig 2 and labelled on fig 1b are compared to observed flows in the hydrographs of fig 3 time series of catchment average precipitation and air temperature are also displayed in the figure while catchment details and analysis statistics are summarised in table 2 these catchments were chosen to represent the range of behaviours found in modelled river flows using nxpol derived qpes as input in all four cases the use of raingauge precipitation produces modelled river flows that compare at least reasonably well to the observations r 2 0 6 r 0 8 bias 20 in all cases see table 2 for nxpol qpes the range of behaviour may be summarised as follows strathy at strathy bridge fig 3a a catchment in the far north of scotland which is distant 92 km on average from nxpol but has a fairly low mean lue 2 1 km the r 2 efficiency 0 43 and correlation coefficient 0 68 of modelled flows using r dual pol qpe are reasonable for this catchment suggesting that lue has a greater influence on performance than range from the radar at least up to distances of around 100 km the total catchment average precipitation recorded in r dual pol 321 mm is 14 lower than that found using raingauge precipitation 373 mm which feeds through to a bias of 14 in modelled flows using r dual pol table 2 also note that throughout period 1 the catchment s mean air temperature at ground level is often no more than a few degrees above 0 c this has two consequences firstly the catchment s mean air temperature is frequently below the threshold of 0 75 c at which g2g treats precipitation inputs as snow and it will tend to be significantly colder than this at the catchment s higher elevations this translates into a reasonable impact of snow on the river flows determined as the percentage of days for which the modelled flows with and without the inclusion of snow processes differ by more than 20 see table 2 even for this relatively low elevation catchment the other example catchments are also affected by snowfall to a degree partially determined by their elevation see table 2 secondly above the catchment the low height of the melting layer almost totally prevents the calculation of the specific attenuation which is based on the properties of liquid water hence r dual pol will be identical to r kdp z for almost all of period 1 for this catchment any period for which the height of the melting layer prevents the calculation of specific attenuation over more than 50 of a catchment is shaded red on the hyetograph for r dual pol in fig 3 note that additional checks in the processing chain for radar signals associated with solid precipitation may also limit the calculation of specific attenuation so this measure provides only a maximum possible percentage the other example catchments are also affected by this to a degree mainly determined by their mean lue lossie at sheriffmills fig 3b a catchment very close to the radar 14 km and having a low lue 0 5 km modelled river flow using the r dual pol qpe displays a very large overall positive bias 94 which is far more pronounced in period 1 164 bias than period 2 30 bias and arises from catchment average r dual pol precipitation totals that are a very large compared to raingauge precipitation totals 40 larger for the full period or 120 larger for period 1 nevertheless even in period 1 modelled flows using r dual pol data agree reasonably well with the observed flows in terms of relative magnitude and timing of the flood peaks similar behaviour biases in excess of 90 is found for all three catchments closest to nxpol this was traced to a previously undiagnosed antenna elevation pointing error in period 1 leading to overcorrection of beam blockage for this period especially when using beam blockage corrections derived using data from period2 neely et al 2021 this effect was strongest close to the radar where the lue derivation incorporated a greater number of radar voxels from lower elevations which suffered more from the overcorrection deveron at avochie fig 3c a catchment fairly close 51 km to the radar and with a relatively low mean lue 2 3 km producing reasonable modelled river flows the highest peak in the observed flow data reaching 127 m3 s at 19 30 15 june is the most significant flood peak found during the study period at an example catchment it is the only peak that approaches the median annual flood 129 m3 s for this catchment see table 2 this peak is underestimated in both the modelled flow using the raingauge qpe as input peak of 53 m3 s and the r dual pol qpe as input peak 41 m3 s the difference appears to reflect the different catchment average total precipitation recorded over the preceding 48 h 51 mm for raingauge and 38 mm for r dual pol over the whole study period however the total precipitation recorded for this catchment is quite similar for the two qpes 424 mm for raingauge and 409 mm for r dual pol north esk tayside at inveriscandye fig 3d a catchment in the south of the radar area that is both a long distance 94 km from nxpol and on the far side of the cairngorm mountain range its mean lue of 6 7 km is the highest of all the catchments included in this study because of this the radar beam overshoots almost all precipitation in this catchment total catchment average r dual pol precipitation is just 55 mm resulting in a large negative bias in the modelled flow 84 similar behaviour is seen for all catchments with lue exceeding 4 km 7 1 influence of lue and range of the radar observations on performance fig 4a c show scatter plots of r 2 efficiency correlation coefficient and bias for modelled river flow using either r dual pol or raingauge qpe as input against each catchment s mean lue the plots for correlation coefficient and bias fig 4 b c also show the linear least squares regression line and associated coefficient of determination denoted by ρ in this context for r dual pol qpe the systematic reductions in correlation coefficient and bias is particularly striking and is reflected by strong coefficients of determination for the least squares regression lines 0 38 and 0 63 for the correlation coefficient and bias respectively similarly strong fits in the ranges 0 38 to 0 61 and 0 51 to 0 63 for the correlation coefficient and bias respectively are found for all nxpol qpes the lack of similar behaviour in modelled river flow using raingauge qpe hollow grey circles in fig 4b c shows that the trends with r dual pol are not associated with the characteristics of the hydrological catchments themselves the trend for r 2 efficiency is more complicated which instead tends to have largest values at lues of around 2 km for which biases of around zero are typical the existence of distant catchments that perform comparatively well with nxpol precipitation such as the lossie at sheriffmills fig 3b suggests that it is lue rather than range that is chiefly responsible for the deterioration of performance shown in fig 4a c nevertheless the lue is correlated with range having a value of r 0 68 catchments at closer range will benefit from lower minimum detectable signal a smaller areal resolution and suffer less from partial beam filling weaker values of the coefficient of determination for the regression lines 0 084 for r and 0 56 for bias using r dual pol obtained when mean range is used as the explanatory variable rather than mean lue suggest it is lue that has the strongest influence 7 2 comparing different qpes for period 1 and period 2 the boxplots of fig 5 a summarise the overall performance of all qpes as assessed by statistics calculated on the modelled river flows and using data from both period 1 and period 2 statistics are only shown for those 38 catchments with an lue of less than 3 km in altitude on average across the catchment similar trends are repeated if all 57 catchments are included not shown albeit with an overall reduction in r 2 efficiency correlation and bias for all nxpol qpes due to the inclusion of poorly performing catchments whose high mean lue would flag them as unsuitable the raingauge qpe tends to produce the best modelled river flows according to the r 2 efficiency metric some of this improvement could be due to the g2g hydrological model having been calibrated using raingauge qpe as input but this seems unlikely to account for a large proportion of the difference especially given the reduced role of calibration for an area wide distributed model like g2g compared to for example a lumped hydrological model with a catchment specific calibration the r 2 efficiency also indicates a general improvement in performance with either increased processing complexity for single polarisation qpes r z to r zc in table 1 or using the dual polarisation estimates r ah to r dual pol in table 1 albeit with the r zc qpe able to match the performance of some dual polarisation estimates correlation kge sqrt and bias generally repeat the same trends towards improvement found for r 2 efficiency but with some exceptions the strongest increase in performance is seen for the bias this suggests that the improved bias is the factor responsible for a larger part of the improvement seen in r 2 efficiency which can be viewed as a combination of correlation bias and the ratio of standard deviations gupta et al 2009 it also suggests that while the application of a bias correction to nxpol qpes should be expected to increase the overall r 2 efficiency for their associated modelled river flows it may reduce the further improvements gained by processing complexity or dual polarisation the boxplots of fig 5b c highlight the different trends in performance found using the radar qpes for period 1 march to april and period 2 june to august there is also a difference across the two periods in the performance of modelled river flow using raingauge or r c band qpe as input to g2g part of the difference for both radar and raingauge inputs may be due to the increased complexity of modelling snow accumulation and melt within the g2g model one way to quantify this is by comparing g2g modelled flows with raingauge qpe as input calculated either using the g2g snow hydrology module as is standard or excluding it when all precipitation is treated as rainfall on average across all catchments river flows calculated using these two model setups differ by more than 20 for 31 of days in period1 compared to almost no differences of this size 0 1 of days for period2 additionally the short time periods over which river flows have been modelled can make results sensitive to the observed weather conditions for the nxpol qpes the clearest difference between the two periods is the lack of improvement produced by the increasing use of dual polarisation in period 1 compared to the strong improvements found for period 2 this is attributed to the considerably lower height of the melting layer in period 1 which limits the occurrence of the liquid precipitation conditions assumed in the use of estimators based on specific attenuation variations of which are the main difference between the dual polarisation methodologies fig 6 shows the distribution of the highest altitude for which the specific attenuation is calculated which is 250 m below an estimated 0 c height in period 1 this averages a median of just 793 m compared to 1993 m in period 2 and leads to at least 35 of the radar domain never having estimates based on specific attenuation available in the first period compared to less than 10 in the second period the trend for improvement produced by increasing processing complexity and use of dual polarisation for period2 is consistent with that found by neely et al 2021 fig 5 therein where the same qpes were assessed against raingauge data however use of hydrological model simulations of river flow against observations for assessment of the different qpes when employed as alternative model inputs produces a much stronger contrast in performance between methods particularly when considering the correlation and bias this results from the greater spatial coverage of the hydrological catchments when compared to raingauges which can be subject to localised error structures this furnishes further evidence of the benefit of using catchment scale river flow data alongside direct raingauge data comparisons for assessing radar qpe the increased correlation of the r ah and r ah thr methods for multiple catchments when compared to r zc in period 2 is further evidence that estimators based on specific attenuation are impacted to a lesser extent by variability in the drop size distribution of the precipitation than conventional ones employing reflectivity diederich et al 2015b chen et al 2021 7 3 mapping best performing qpes fig 7 maps the best performing nxpol qpe as determined by either r 2 efficiency correlation or bias on modelled river flow for the full study period the lowest absolute values of bias are almost exclusively found for r kdp z or r dual pol for a number of catchments these two qpes give identical performances in general even when not exactly equal their performance is very similar 90 of catchments have an absolute difference in percentage bias between these qpes which is smaller than 2 their performances assessed by correlation or r 2 efficiency are also very similar the typically lower absolute bias in r kdp z and r dual pol feeds through into typically superior r 2 efficiency however when judged by correlation coefficient the picture is far more mixed various dual polarisation or non dual polarisation qpes are found to give the best performance especially for some of the catchments with lower lue when judged by median correlation coefficient for catchments with lue below 3 km fig 5a r z dtm qc at r ah r ah thr and r z ah qpes all perform better than r kdp z and r dual pol these results broadly reflect those shown in fig 7 of neely et al 2021 where the various nxpol qpes were assessed against raingauge measurements fig 8 maps in green the catchments for which the performance of r dual pol is better than r c band the r dual pol qpe has a higher r 2 efficiency than r c band for 23 catchments that tend to be either near the radar or towards the south east and north this is expected as lue for the nxpol radar is low for these locations while due the distance to the nearest c band radar and the intervening topography observations contributing to the c band qpes will be from higher altitudes the three catchments close to the radar and suffering high positive bias in r dual pol as a result of the antenna elevation pointing error in period 1 are an exception a similar pattern of best performing catchments is also seen for the bias this overall behaviour is the result of averaging the differing behaviours in periods 1 and 2 as shown in fig 5 in period 1 the benefit of using the dual polarisation variables in the nxpol qpe are limited and the r 2 efficiency of r dual pol is only better than that of r c band for 10 catchments in contrast during period 2 r dual pol has better r 2 efficiency than that of r c band for 30 catchments as the increased use of dual polarisation variables for r dual pol during this period improves its performance while for r c band many of the catchments suffer from strong positive bias which actually tends to become increasingly positive for those sites nearest nxpol and correspondingly furthest from the c band radars and consequently it suffers a poorer r 2 efficiency as assessed by correlation coefficient the performance of r dual pol is only better than that of r c band for 15 of the catchments in the study area however this number would be increased to 19 for either r ah or r ah thr also recall that nxpol qpes are experimental prototypes not benefitting from the full complexity of estimation measures featuring in the r c band processing chain these results are consistent with those presented in fig 7 of neely et al 2021 comparing r dual pol and r c band using the raingauge network data for assessment rather than river flow data 8 discussion and concluding remarks the performance of a set of x band qpes produced using data from the nxpol radar having increasingly complex processing chains and use of dual polarisation summarised in table 1 were assessed in a hydrological context over northern scotland here mountainous terrain and low melting layer heights make radar based qpe challenging this hydrological assessment used the qpes as input to a distributed hydrological model g2g and compared the resulting set of modelled river flows to observations the assessment strategy considers how qpes perform once integrated over space and time thereby providing additional insights to the meteorological assessment against point raingauge measurements reported by neely et al 2021 all nxpol qpes assessed showed a clear tendency to underestimate the precipitation for catchments with high mean lue the best performance as assessed by the r 2 efficiency of the modelled river flows was generally found for the r dual pol and r kdp z qpes while the flows modelled using r ah and r ah thr qpes often had the best correlation coefficient there were clear differences between the two study periods march to april and june to august 2016 which were caused by the lower melting layer and consequently reduced use of dual polarisation capability in the first period a longer study period would allow greater assessment of seasonal effects and reduce the impact of individual weather events the strong dependence on lue of the performance of river flow modelling using nxpol qpes as input highlights the difficulty of radar precipitation estimation in mountainous environments here the high elevation scans needed to circumvent blockages leads to significant overshooting of the falling precipitation resulting in low correlation and negative bias of modelled river flows this effect becomes most apparent when the mean lue results in utilising radar observations of altitude 3 km and above the assessment also highlights that the met office c band radar network suffers from similar issues in this region but with the results inverted compared to the nxpol radar as a result of the different radar locations this is despite the more complex processing used in the network radar to attempt to overcome this challenge clearly one solution is to incorporate additional radars into the observing network in these problematic locations sited such that observations for critical catchments may be made at altitudes less than 3 km where this is not feasible using heavily processed low elevation scans are likely to be more effective than processed higher elevation scans further improvements to the lue methodology used herein are required to allow a dynamic use of lower altitude scan data where possible comparing the assessment results obtained for period 1 march to april 2016 with those for period 2 july to august 2016 it is seen that the dual polarisation processing attenuation correction and specific attenuation based precipitation estimators has more impact on river flow modelling performance during period 2 this is a consequence of the requirement to have a continuous path within liquid precipitation to allow more accurate estimation of specific attenuation meeting this requirement is often not possible when the freezing height is low and particularly when higher elevation angle scans are needed additional processing is required to obtain further benefits beyond filtering capabilities from dual polarisation radars in lower temperature conditions the expectation is that using solid phase precipitation estimators based on specific differential phase and reflectivity would improve the results in cold conditions bukovčić et al 2020 additionally incorporation of vertical profile corrections and conventional reflectivity estimators better suited to ice phase hydrometeors may also lead to performance improvements in these conditions the hydrological simulation approach to assessment used here would be better placed to identify these benefits than a more conventional comparison to data from raingauges as these are less accurate when measuring solid precipitation savina et al 2012 this should be explored in future work nxpol qpes have also been compared to the rain rate estimates based on observations made by the c band radar network operated by the uk met office the network radars employ a variety of processing steps not included in the nxpol processing chain for example adding an adjustment for mean field bias using raingauge data could be trialled in nxpol even so most nxpol qpes tended to give higher r 2 efficiency in modelled river flows than using r c band qpe for catchments near the radar towards the south east and the far north of the study area the relationship between radar reflectivity and rain rate used in this study was the marshall palmer relationship harrison et al 2012 marshall and palmer 1948 however the exact physical relationship between reflectivity and precipitation intensity depends on the drop size distribution which in turn depends on type of precipitation location and season a preliminary investigation was carried out using data from the disdrometer verification network diven pickering et al 2019 to measure the drop size distribution at a location within the coverage of nxpol during the rains campaign cairngorm 2017 to 2019 this suggested that several events were dominated by a large number of smaller drops where the marshall palmer relationship would underestimate rainfall intensity an initial investigation considering these events using a bulk average relationship was tested it was found to result in large positive biases in modelled river flows for catchments with low lue without improving the trend towards negative biases for catchments with high lue the conclusion drawn was that a dynamic approach is required with the z r relationship chosen as a function of the observed microphysics either on a scan by scan or voxel by voxel basis implementation of such a scheme requires further investigation to understand the relationship between drop size distribution weather conditions and dual polarisation radar signatures under uk conditions cocks et al 2019 thurai et al 2017 further improvements should also consider how the lue concept introduced in neely et al 2021 can be improved upon to preferentially use lower elevation observations where available this could include using blockage corrected lower elevations where data exist and higher elevations where there are no echoes available to correct also introducing weighting into the cartesian gridding scheme to give a higher weight to lower elevation observations within the target grid box where there is a variation in elevations available assessing radar based qpes by their effect on modelled river flows using each qpe as an alternative input to a hydrological model has been found to be a very useful and independent addition to the assessment against point raingauge measurements performed by neely et al 2021 the approach facilitates assessment of precipitation over entire catchment areas thus circumventing the potential sensitivity to local radar artefacts that can affect raingauge based assessments the measurement limitations of raingauges during solid phase precipitation and also a possible lack of representativity for hard to service locations such as mountain tops this approach also allows direct assessment of whether the potential benefits of a qpe procedure is carried forward to its quantitative use in hydrological modelling and therefore to end users additionally the number of suitable catchments in the study area 57 was comparable to the number 64 of raingauges used by neely et al 2021 using a hydrological model to assess qpes does add complexity and an additional source of uncertainty in the assessment however the accuracy of the qpe appears to be a dominant factor affecting river flow modelling performance one way to investigate such sensitivity further would be to incorporate an additional hydrological model into the assessment framework such as a catchment calibrated lumped rainfall runoff model nevertheless the hydrological modelling assessment framework presented here has given additional insights into the space time performance of radar based qpes beyond the traditional point based comparison with raingauge data and can be easily reapplied to test future qpe developments such assessment frameworks have wide applicability and the insights gained on the performance of dual polarisation methods and on identifying priority areas for future development are of general relevance to those developing radar based qpes credit

2907,a set of quantitative precipitation estimates qpes from a dual polarisation x band radar observation campaign in a mountainous area of northern scotland is assessed with reference to observed river flows as well as being compared to estimates from the uk c band radar and raingauge networks employing estimation methods of varying complexity the x band qpes are trialled as alternative inputs to grid to grid g2g a distributed hydrological model to produce simulated river flows for comparison with observations this hydrological assessment complements and extends a previous meteorological assessment that used point raingauge data only precipitation estimates for two periods over the observation campaign in 2016 march to april and june to august are assessed during the second period increased incorporation of dual polarisation variables into the radar processing chain is found to be of considerable benefit whereas during the first period the low height of the melting layer often restricts their use as a result of the complex topography in northern scotland the lowest usable elevation lue of the x band radar observations is found to be a stronger indicator of the hydrological model performance than range from the radar for catchments with an lue of less than 3 km the best x band qpe typically performs better for modelling river flow than using an estimate from the uk c band radar network the hydrological assessment framework used here brings fresh insights into the performance of the different qpes as well as providing a stimulus for targeted improvements to dual polarisation radar based qpes that have wider relevance beyond the case study situation keywords weather radar dual polarisation x band precipitation river flow distributed hydrological model data availability the nxpol qpes are from the rains campaign reported by neely et al 2021 and the calibrated nxpol radar data are accessible via the ceda archive bennett 2019 the r c band qpe data used in this study are identical up to minor differences due to missing data to the 1 km resolution uk composite rainfall product available from the ceda archive met office 2003 the river flow and raingauge data were provided by sepa for potential evaporation 40 km gridded monthly values were used here taken as the monthly average of morecs pe hough and jones 1997 thompson et al 1981 over the period 1981 to 2010 available from the uk met office air temperature data were from the post processing of the uk met office weather prediction model ukpp moseley 2011 1 introduction observing in a quantitative and robust way the dynamic space time pattern of precipitation in hilly and mountainous terrain presents a major challenge of great practical importance across the world a common approach is to obtain quantitative precipitation estimates qpes using observations from networks of weather radars and or raingauges such gridded qpes have a wide range of applications from the images seen on weather forecasts through to their quantitative use in hydrological modelling river flow forecasting and water resource simulation however there are a number of issues to be considered when forming such qpes for high latitude mountainous regions networks of raingauges are typically sparse in mountainous areas due to difficulties of access so lack representativity in capturing the complex rainfall patterns found in these topographically varied domains further problems can be associated with wind induced under catch solid phase precipitation and instrument blockage wetting and evaporation loss sevruk 1982 price 1999 weather radar networks provide better spatial coverage and can be used in isolation or in combination with raingauges to make the best of these complementary sensors of areal and point rainfall however such radar networks often provide less than ideal observation coverage or quality in areas of high relief due to issues such as beam blockage range effects and variability in the vertical profile of precipitation including changes of water phase and low level orographic enhancement in addition to the impact of range on beam broadening and non uniform beam filling overshooting of precipitation becomes more likely in areas of orography koistinen and pohjola 2014 yu et al 2018 a particular issue affecting high latitude locations is the presence of a melting layer which can be close to the surface and appear as enhanced radar reflectivity via the bright band effect the robustness of radar rainfall estimates is also dependent on artefacts of the sensed environment and post processing operations the introduction of dual polarisation radar capabilities has brought benefits to precipitation estimation ryzhkov and zrnić 1995 2019 illingworth 2004 montopoli et al 2017 wijayarathne et al 2020 and river flow simulation in mountainous terrain anagnostou et al 2018 however a detailed assessment of the benefits to hydrological modelling of the different dual polarisation processing steps and retrievals has not been undertaken this is an important novelty of the paper presented here studies investigating the improvement for hydrological simulation of employing dual polarisation relative to single polarisation are few one example is the study by gourley et al 2010 for nine severe storm events from 2005 to 2008 over a 813 km2 catchment area in oklahoma usa with a hydrological focus on a 342 km2 gauged catchment they found that improved hydrological model performance was only achieved once long term biases in the qpes were identified and corrected for whilst the single polarisation qpe assessed against raingauges had a lower bias 9 compared to 31 the best dual polarisation qpe had a bias that was stationary whereas that of the single polarisation qpe fluctuated with event rain intensity attributed to varying drop size distributions and hail this provides evidence for dual polarisation stabilising the error structure across varying types of storm correction for bias resorted to use of the raingauge network seeking improvement through studies of radar qpe errors focussed on range effects across a range of environments was recommended for future work a more recent hydrological assessment employing dual polarisation radar by he et al 2018 focussed on a flat area of denmark with a complex hydrological regime influenced by groundwater there was little to choose between the use of raingauge single and dual polarisation qpes for these environmental conditions whilst the potential benefits of dual polarisation in complex terrain was recognised application of x band dual polarisation radars for qpe in mountainous environments has several advantages over more conventional network radars lim et al 2014 yu et al 2018 known limitations of x band radar such as their increased susceptibility to attenuation and typically lower azimuthal interval due to smaller antenna sizes are less relevant in mountainous environments where topographic blockage and low level precipitation formation typically impose severe constraints on the maximum useful radar range the reduced cost of x band radars when compared to c band or s band systems is particularly advantageous making them well suited for filling gaps within existing radar networks to rectify areas of poorer local coverage in addition dual polarisation has advantages in mountainous areas since phase shift based precipitation estimators using specific differential phase are immune to the effects of partial beam blockage which are prevalent in such locations this allows the use of radar observations from lower elevations than would be possible with a single polarisation system the benefit is greatest for x band radars as phase shift measurements from lower wavelength radars have a greater sensitivity to precipitation intensity sachidananda and zrnić 1986 anagnostou et al 2004 turning to hydrological use based on experience limited to using networks of single polarisation c band radars and raingauges in the uk precipitation estimates from raingauges have been preferred over radar based qpes for hydrological model development cole and moore 2008 2009 moore et al 2012 partly this is down to the more stable error structure of raingauge data associated with the simplicity of direct measurement and application of quality control checks e g howard et al 2012 which can be partially eliminated from modelled flows during the calibration of the hydrological model in contrast a range of artefacts can feature in the radar errors arising from the sensed environment or in the post processing with some not readily diagnosed or corrected radar based qpes can suffer from transient under or over estimation of the precipitation on sub daily and sub hourly timescales although radar rainfall performance can be improved through applying radar raingauge adjustment or merging methods the effect of transient errors can persist and affect estimator robustness it is in the context of increasing qpe robustness that dual polarisation methodologies show greatest promise for improving radar rainfall use in hydrological modelling this is an important motivator for the work reported on here further there are particular advantages in radar rainfall for hydrological applications at smaller spatial and temporal scales such as for modelling flash floods and in urban hydrology berne and krajewski 2013 thorndahl et al 2017 where convective storm cells may be missed completely by the relative sparsity of a raingauge network the work presented here employs a unique radar dataset from the rains radar applications in northern scotland campaign bennett 2019 neely et al 2021 this campaign deployed the ncas mobile x band dual polarisation doppler weather radar nxpol available for research studies neely et al 2018 in the scottish highlands near inverness over two periods in 2016 the aim of the present work is to assess the improvement to radar qpes particularly for use as input to a hydrological model for simulating river flow over an area where the existing national network of weather radars and raingauges has known shortcomings importantly it has been possible to exploit nxpol data to produce qpes using processing chains of varying complexity and differing extent of use of dual polarisation capability previously neely et al 2021 had shown that precipitation estimates from the second period of the rains campaign were able to outperform estimates from the uk c band radar network for certain parts of the study area when assessed against raingauge measurements the present investigation aims to assess whether these benefits to qpe pass through to hydrological model simulations of river flow in mountainous locations and ascertain any dependence on the characteristics of the catchments being modelled and the season of the year to undertake this nxpol derived qpes from both periods of the rains campaign along with estimates from the uk c band network and raingauge data are used as input to the g2g distributed hydrological model and assessed by comparing the model simulated river flows against observations at gauged locations importantly such a hydrological assessment essentially integrates qpes over space and time complementing the traditional point based meteorological comparison with raingauge data it can provide additional insights into the performance of the qpes helping to stimulate future improvements to radar based qpe methods the hydrological approach through its space time integration allows the radar estimated precipitation to be evaluated over entire catchment areas circumventing both potential raingauge issues and reducing sensitivity to localised artefacts in radar based qpes that may heavily influence such point based assessments the results of this investigation are likely to be of value to those interested in the use of dual polarisation capabilities in networks of c band radars as well as for x band radars deployed for network coverage infill purposes and for local high resolution applications relating to urban storm drainage management this paper is organised as follows first in section 2 details are given of the dual polarisation x band radar campaign over northern scotland including the methods of increasing complexity used in nxpol s qpe processing chain section 3 describes two alternative gridded qpes included in the assessment of methods one from the network c band radars and the other from interpolating raingauge data section 4 outlines the g2g distributed hydrological model and how it is used to obtain simulated river flows from each qpe method for comparison with observations across selected catchments detailed in section 5 the performance statistics used to assess each qpe method through comparison of modelled and observed river flow are described in section 6 section 7 describes the performance assessment of the qpe methods and examines the influence on performance of the lowest usable elevation lue the radar range and the study period a broader discussion and concluding remarks follow in section 8 2 the dual polarisation x band radar campaign over northern scotland 2 1 study area the location of the nxpol radar at kinloss barracks near inverness in the scottish highlands is shown as a red dot in fig 1 a this site was chosen for the radar to infill an area of reduced coverage in scotland within the c band weather radar network across the british isles comparison to raingauge measurements over this area have shown radar rainfall estimates to be less accurate worsfold et al 2014 particularly on account of the large distance to the nearest c band radar and also in relation to topography and beam blockage effects harrison et al 2012 the c band radar network includes four installations in scotland locations of two of them at druim a starraig 166 km to the northwest of nxpol and at hill of dudwick 95 km to the east are marked as blue dots in fig 1a the other two munduff hill and holehead at distances 161 and 187 km from nxpol respectively are off the map to the south also the locations of raingauges in sepa s hydrometric network over the study area are shown by green triangles in fig 1a the study area has several mountainous parts notably the cairngorms in the eastern highlands to the south of nxpol with the summit reaching 1309 m and those of the western highlands to the west reaching a height of 1150 m within 100 km of the radar site these lead to radar beam blockages and local orographic enhancements to the precipitation both of which provide additional challenges for radar qpe georgiou et al 2012 the spatial distribution of annual average rainfall in the region is variable from less than 700 mm for some areas of the eastern coast to greater than 3000 mm over some parts of the western highlands 1981 2010 average precipitation map met office 2018 an additional challenge is posed by the typically low altitude of the melting layer during winter which often leads to accumulations of solid precipitation particularly in upland areas the low melting layer limits the effectiveness of dual polarisation processing which is partly based on the electromagnetic scattering properties of liquid precipitation and is particularly pronounced when the surface topography requires that qpe uses higher altitude radar data on the other hand the study area is well suited for assessing precipitation using hydrological models as topography acts as a dominant control on runoff production the impermeable geology means there are no groundwater transfers between catchments and the baseflow fraction is low so antecedent condition effects do not persist for extended periods of time additionally the headwater catchments are typically rapidly responding which limits the possible temporal averaging of transient errors in the qpe 2 2 description of nxpol qpes assessed to deal with mountainous terrain in the vicinity of nxpol radar scans are taken at different angles relative to the ground observations from those scans considered to be at the lue are combined to create a two dimensional qpe full details of the nxpol radar and its rain retrieval methods are provided in neely et al 2021 briefly the system has a 75 kw peak power output split between the two transmit channels operates using simultaneous transmit and receive star for dual polarisation moment estimation has a 2 4 m antenna leading to a half power beam width of 0 98 narrower than most x band systems and operates without a radome in this campaign nxpol collected a volume of observations consisting of ten 360 plan position indicator ppi sweeps at increasing elevation angles including but not limited to 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 4 each ppi has an azimuthal interval of 1 and a 150 m range gate spacing to a maximum range of 150 km the full volume scan cycle took approximately 5 5 min and is labelled in this analysis by the start time of each volume using a static look up table based on the minimum detectable signal and the occurrence of clutter each volume of ppis was collapsed into a single lue product the lue method described in neely et al 2021 differs from the typical radar data gridding approach as it considers the impact of the blocked fraction on the minimum detectable signal with increasing range rather than using a fixed fraction to eliminate low elevations it also incorporates the impact of ground clutter on radar data quality substituting areas that have significantly elevated echo occurrence percentages with data from higher elevation angles to achieve this data for each range gate are taken from the lowest elevation that has both a minimum detectable signal of 10 dbz factoring in the impact of beam blockage based on a static partial beam blockage correction and an echo occurrence percentage of less than 75 based on a static clutter map from six non consecutive clear air days this approach is a necessary compromise between avoiding excessive beam blockage and ground clutter and the possibility of overshooting of low lying precipitation for scans with higher angles the overshooting of precipitation becomes especially problematic behind mountains and is expected to result in a considerable underestimation of the precipitation for catchments with lue greater than around 3 to 4 km a map of catchments used in this study shaded according to their mean lue is shown in fig 1b regions of high lue and anticipated poorer qpe performance are clearly visible to the south and west areas near the radar and also across the sea to the north and to a lesser extent along the great glen a geological fault line to the south west have lower lue even for catchments that are a long distance from the radar site ten different nxpol qpes summarised in table 1 were assessed using hydrological simulation in this study the first five of these methods r z to r zc in table 1 all make use of the marshall palmer relationship z 200r1 6 between reflectivity z and precipitation rate r harrison et al 2012 marshall and palmer 1948 but represent a progression of increasing data processing this starts with r z which simply applies the marshall palmer relationship to the calibrated horizontal reflectivity as measured by nxpol thus providing a baseline for the assessment of all other methods the second method r z dtm applies a partial beam blockage correction based on a digital terrain model dtm to the horizontal reflectivity before precipitation estimation this method is implemented using wradlib heistermann et al 2013 using 1 arc second srtm shuttle radar topography mission data for the surface topography r z dtm qc additionally applies dual polarisation quality control qc removing second trip echoes and non meteorological echoes using a fuzzy logic approach followed by removal of isolated pixels using connected component labelling dufton and collier 2015 dufton 2016 r z dtm qc at then applies attenuation correction through the implementation of the zphi method testud et al 2000 in this instance a minimum precipitable path length of 3 km 10 continuous range gates identified as meteorological by the fuzzy logic qc is required for data assumed to be below the melting layer based on extrapolation of surface temperature data using a fixed lapse rate of 6 c km differential phase shift is smoothed using a modification of the hubbert and bringi 1995 iterative method prior to identification of the phase limits for the calculations dufton 2016 the method assumes a constant factor of 0 27 db deg to estimate specific attenuation from specific differential phase also used in later methods for direct precipitation estimation r zc is identical to the previous method with the exception of the partial beam blockage correction being applied in this case the correction is derived from the consistency of polarimetric variables during the summer of the rains deployment as proposed by diederich et al 2015a this leads to higher estimates of the correction needed when compared to the dtm approach see neely et al 2021 for more details the next five methods make use of either specific attenuation specific differential phase or both to calculate the qpes with r zc being used as an infill when these methods are not possible above the melting layer in the case of specific attenuation for example r ah estimates precipitation intensity using specific attenuation ah assuming an atmospheric temperature of 10 c leading to a relationship of r 45 5ah 0 83 diederich et al 2015b where ah is estimated during attenuation correction by the zphi method r ah thr is identical to r ah when the total differential phase shift along the rain region path identified exceeds 5 but otherwise defaults to r zc considering this method allows an assessment of the impact of potentially spurious results during light rainfall conditions where noise in the differential phase shift measurements could have a significant impact r z ah uses the same 5 threshold on the total differential phase shift used with r ah thr but instead converts ah into a synthetic equivalent horizontal reflectivity zh syn for use in the marshall palmer relation this is the same approach taken to derive the dual polarisation beam blockage correction introduced in the r zc method this approach acts as a dynamic bias correction to reflectivity while still using the marshall palmer relation which is a good climatological fit for uk precipitation estimation r kdp z instead focuses on using specific differential phase kdp for the estimation of precipitation here the method uses the relationship from ryzhkov et al 2014 where the estimates are blended with those from r zc at all kdp estimated precipitation intensities between 10 and 20 mm h 1 using a linear weighted average below 10 mm h 1 r zc is used without kdp input the weighting accounts for the well known difficulties of estimating small values of kdp vulpiani et al 2012 the final method r dual pol is a combination of r z ah and r kdp z where specific attenuation based estimates are used as first preference followed by those utilising specific differential phase and finally reverting to reflectivity where these estimates are not available all qpe methods are applied to the published calibrated nxpol radar dataset where horizontal reflectivity is calibrated using polarimetric self consistency and differential reflectivity is calibrated using vertically pointing radar scans bennett 2019 neely et al 2021 since specific attenuation and specific differential phase are immune to radar miss calibration qpe methods involving them will be less sensitive to any temporal variations in radar calibration over the study period all nxpol radar data processing is coded in python taking advantage of the open source libraries py art helmus and collis 2016 for reading and writing cfradial files and wradlib heistermann et al 2013 for dtm estimation and gridding of the data no raingauge or climatological adjustments are applied to the nxpol derived qpes to avoid confounding the current analysis which is focussed on comparing qpes of increasing complexity in their use of radar variables the strategic aim is to develop an x band radar processing chain to which additional corrections can be applied and assessed as part of a staged evolutionary process this allows for consideration of raingauge data at a later stage perhaps as part of a wider multi sensor network qpe products were produced for two periods in 2016 period 1 from 1 march to 30 april and period 2 from 1 june to 17 august with an interval of down time for the radar in between the melting layer was typically much lower during period 1 with median heights of 1043 and 2243 m for the two periods respectively this results in much more frequent use of r zc as a fall back for the dual polarisation qpes over period 1 for use with the g2g distributed hydrological model the lue products created on the native polar coordinate system of the nxpol were regridded onto a 1 km cartesian rectilinear grid using the area weighted average of all 2d polar radar pixels intersecting with each cartesian grid cell missing and filtered radar pixels within a grid cell are excluded from the average provided they cover less than 30 of the area after which they are set to nan and counted as having zero precipitation by g2g the resulting rectilinear coordinate system is the same as used by the network c band qpe product to produce continuous qpes for use in the hydrological model any period of greater than 10 min without nxpol data was infilled using qpes from the c band network this included the entire month of may between period 1 and 2 which was subsequently excluded from the analysis of river flow apart from during may c band qpe data were only used 314 times for infilling of which 275 were used during a 23 hour period of downtime between 6 and 7 april c band data as opposed to raingauge data were chosen for infilling so as not to bias comparisons between nxpol and c band qpes the irregularly timed qpes approximately 5 5 min apart were accumulated using a simple trapezoidal rule without allowing for advection effects to produce 15 minute precipitation totals for input to g2g experience in a uk context has shown that accounting for the movement and development of storms between time steps see for example fabry et al 1994 normally has little impact on modelled river flows for the catchment scales considered here median catchment area 232 km2 3 alternative precipitation sources for comparison 3 1 r c band precipitation the uk met office operates four c band radars in scotland as part of a wider network of 18 weather radars across the british isles data from the radars are processed by the radarnet iv central processing system at exeter met office 2020 to produce an estimate of rainfall intensity at ground level the processing includes clutter removal beam blockage correction correcting for attenuation and the vertical profile of reflectivity vpr adjusting for orographic enhancement and correcting for residual bias using observations from the raingauge network harrison et al 2006 darlington et al 2016a b these corrected data are then composited into a uk wide gridded precipitation product the gridded c band rainfall intensity data used in this study were sourced from a live data feed supplied by the met office on a 1 km cartesian grid with a 5 min time step these data are identical up to minor differences in the occurrence of missing data to the 1 km resolution uk composite rainfall product available from the ceda archive met office 2003 these gridded time series were accumulated without accounting for advection as per nxpol qpe to form a c band qpe of 15 minute rainfall totals on a 1 km grid for input to the g2g hydrological model while there are several processing elements in common between nxpol and the operational c band processing the latter includes a greater use of external data sources including weather model fields for vpr correction and orographic enhancement adjustment and raingauges for bias correction harrison et al 2009 2012 georgiou et al 2012 3 2 raingauge precipitation raingauge data from sepa s hydrometric network were used to produce gridded 15 minute rainfall accumulation estimates for the whole of scotland including the study area on a 1 km grid this used a multiquadric interpolation technique hardy 1971 in an extended form cole and moore 2008 employing a euclidean measure of distance and zero offset which is equivalent to kriging with a linear variogram borga and vizzaccaro 1997 quality control of the raingauge data was performed as an initial step using the methods presented in howard et al 2012 this precipitation estimate provides a useful baseline one previously found to produce the best modelled river flow and subsequently chosen for calibration of the g2g model cole and moore 2009 for the study period the raingauge network consisted of approximately 290 tipping bucket raingauges over the whole of scotland and over the studied catchments a mean gauge density of approximately one raingauge per 290 km2 calculated using the arcmap point density tool with a 20 km neighbourhood raingauge locations within the study area are mapped in fig 1a 4 the g2g model the grid to grid g2g model is a distributed physical conceptual hydrological model bell et al 2009 environment agency 2007 2010 moore et al 2006 used for a range of research and operational applications including flood forecasting by both the scottish flood forecasting service cranston et al 2012 and the flood forecasting centre for england and wales price et al 2012 g2g is underpinned by spatial datasets on landscape properties elevation soil geology and land cover in support of its area wide application and also employs precipitation potential evaporation and air temperature as gridded time series inputs to account for sub grid heterogeneity the probability distributed model pdm moore 1985 2007 concept is employed within each grid cell to generate surface and subsurface runoff components these runoffs are routed along separate water pathways from grid cell to grid cell to produce hillslope river channel and groundwater flows return flows from the groundwater and soil water to the surface water pathway are also represented the g2g model is based on water conservation principles with its water balance updated at each time step the g2g setup used in this study follows the version used operationally by the scottish flood forecasting service it runs with a model time step of 15 min and includes use of the g2g snow hydrology module based on the pack snowmelt model moore et al 1999 although the use of spatial datasets of landscape properties reduces the importance of calibration compared to lumped conceptual hydrological models simulation mode calibration was used to improve g2g operational performance a number of parameters relating to runoff production and routing were calibrated across the whole model domain of scotland rather than just the study area using river flow observations from january to september 2016 additionally a further two parameters controlling channel roughness and return flow from soil water were adjusted separately for each gauged catchment calibration paid attention to performance over the full flow range as well at high flows relevant to its use for flood forecasting and employed a mix of visual and automated calibration tools gridded raingauge precipitation was used as input section 3 2 whilst data assimilation of river flow observations is used to enhance model performance for operational flow forecasting purposes it is not invoked here so as not to confound the comparative assessment of simulated river flow using the different qpes as input to g2g the pack formulation moore et al 1999 of the g2g snow hydrology module acts as pre processing step affecting the input precipitation air temperature is used as a threshold to differentiate between liquid and solid precipitation and also to control the melting process through a temperature excess formulation the storage and release of water in the snowpack is also represented the potential evaporation pe and air temperature inputs used here are those employed in g2g operationally for pe a standard annual profile grid of monthly averages was employed calculated as the monthly average morecs pe thompson et al 1981 hough and jones 1997 using the 40 km gridded monthly values over the 1981 to 2010 period air temperature was from the post processing of the uk met office weather prediction model ukpp for a height of 1 5 m and obtained at a 2 km and hourly space time resolution data were downscaled to a 1 km grid using a lapse rate of 5 9 c km to account for differences in mean elevations between the 2 and 1 km grid cells 5 catchment selection and river flow data fig 1 maps the 57 gauged catchments and sub catchments selected for inclusion in this study these were chosen from an original selection of 63 catchments having a mean distance of less than 100 km to the radar site and of interest to sepa of the original 63 catchments two were discounted due to missing river flow observations and two more through inspection of hydrographs revealing significant sub daily fluctuations that were attributed to measurement error a further two sites were discounted as g2g simulated flows were found to perform poorly regardless of precipitation input type the river flow data at 15 min intervals were obtained from sepa 6 performance statistics used for hydrological assessment of qpes to describe the performance of the modelled river flows and by extension that of the precipitation estimates used to produce them several statistics are employed each compare modelled flows to observations and each aim to capture a different aspect of performance one statistic the r 2 efficiency also known as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 is defined as 1 r 2 1 q t q t 2 q t q 2 here q t and q t are respectively the modelled and observed flow at time step t and q is the mean observed flow over the period this commonly used statistic places a higher weight on the larger absolute discrepancies that are typically found for high flows as such it is particularly useful in assessing the high flow regime and as an indicator of an input precipitation s suitability for use in flood modelling an r 2 efficiency of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between modelled and observed flows whilst a value of less than zero indicates that the performance as measured by mean square error is worse than would be obtained by using the observed mean flow value note that r 2 efficiency differs in its definition from the coefficient of determination r 2 where r is the correlation coefficient which does not account for bias effects on model efficiency and therefore has a larger or equal value the correlation coefficient r is also calculated this statistic is insensitive to overall absolute and relative linear biases in the modelled river flow as such it may also be less sensitive to bias corrections and other compensations applied to the qpes such as those featuring in the network c band but not the nxpol correlations have values between 1 for a perfect positive correlation and 1 for a perfect negative correlation with zero indicating no correlation the modified kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 is defined as 2 kg e 1 r 1 2 c v q c v q 1 2 q q 1 2 with c v q and c v q the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean for the modelled and observed flows respectively and q the mean modelled flow over the evaluation period this statistic obtains its maximum value of 1 for perfect agreement between model and observation in this study kge is applied to the square root of river flow denoted as kge sqrt in order to produce a general metric that places weight on low and medium flows as well as high flows it therefore may be sensitive to features in the river flow not adequately captured in the r 2 efficiency the percentage bias 100 q q q in the modelled flow compared to the observation is also calculated this statistic should approximate the relative bias in the input precipitation because of i the conservation of water within the g2g model ii the relatively low contribution of evaporation to the water balance for the humid temperate climate of northern scotland iii the small groundwater component of river flow and iv the relatively long time span of the study period compared to typical hydrological response times of the catchments unless stated otherwise all performance statistics are evaluated at the model time step of 15 min over the period 1 february to 17 august 2016 excluding the month of may for which all nxpol qpes were missing and infilled using r c band see section 2 the g2g simulations were started on 1 february 2016 with each selected precipitation input to avoid the uncertainty associated with a cold start and possibly poorly initialised water stores in the model model states that had been spun up using raingauge precipitation from a start on 10 october 2013 were used statistics are also used to quantify the influence of snow accumulation and melt on river flow this involves calculating the fraction of days for which modelled flows with gridded raingauge data as input differ by more than 20 when the g2g snow hydrology module is included as is standard or excluded all precipitation is treated as rainfall this statistic naturally captures the full impact of snow on flows including its accumulation melt rain on snow events the influence of different elevations within a catchment and how this translates into river flows 7 performance assessment the performance of the nxpol r dual pol qpe which makes full use of dual polarisation variables is assessed first each catchment in fig 2 is shaded according to the r 2 efficiency correlation and bias of g2g modelled flows using the nxpol r dual pol qpe as input except for a few catchments very close to the radar and with reference to the lue map in fig 1b the catchments with highest r 2 efficiency and highest correlation coefficient are typically those with lower lues in contrast those catchments with high lues exceeding 4 km have without exception a strong negative bias worse than 50 and a correspondingly poor r 2 efficiency below zero indicating that a large portion of the precipitation for these catchments is missed by the r dual pol qpe the correlation for these catchments is also often poor usually less than 0 5 modelled river flows calculated using either r dual pol qpe or raingauge qpe for the four example catchments delineated by bold lines in fig 2 and labelled on fig 1b are compared to observed flows in the hydrographs of fig 3 time series of catchment average precipitation and air temperature are also displayed in the figure while catchment details and analysis statistics are summarised in table 2 these catchments were chosen to represent the range of behaviours found in modelled river flows using nxpol derived qpes as input in all four cases the use of raingauge precipitation produces modelled river flows that compare at least reasonably well to the observations r 2 0 6 r 0 8 bias 20 in all cases see table 2 for nxpol qpes the range of behaviour may be summarised as follows strathy at strathy bridge fig 3a a catchment in the far north of scotland which is distant 92 km on average from nxpol but has a fairly low mean lue 2 1 km the r 2 efficiency 0 43 and correlation coefficient 0 68 of modelled flows using r dual pol qpe are reasonable for this catchment suggesting that lue has a greater influence on performance than range from the radar at least up to distances of around 100 km the total catchment average precipitation recorded in r dual pol 321 mm is 14 lower than that found using raingauge precipitation 373 mm which feeds through to a bias of 14 in modelled flows using r dual pol table 2 also note that throughout period 1 the catchment s mean air temperature at ground level is often no more than a few degrees above 0 c this has two consequences firstly the catchment s mean air temperature is frequently below the threshold of 0 75 c at which g2g treats precipitation inputs as snow and it will tend to be significantly colder than this at the catchment s higher elevations this translates into a reasonable impact of snow on the river flows determined as the percentage of days for which the modelled flows with and without the inclusion of snow processes differ by more than 20 see table 2 even for this relatively low elevation catchment the other example catchments are also affected by snowfall to a degree partially determined by their elevation see table 2 secondly above the catchment the low height of the melting layer almost totally prevents the calculation of the specific attenuation which is based on the properties of liquid water hence r dual pol will be identical to r kdp z for almost all of period 1 for this catchment any period for which the height of the melting layer prevents the calculation of specific attenuation over more than 50 of a catchment is shaded red on the hyetograph for r dual pol in fig 3 note that additional checks in the processing chain for radar signals associated with solid precipitation may also limit the calculation of specific attenuation so this measure provides only a maximum possible percentage the other example catchments are also affected by this to a degree mainly determined by their mean lue lossie at sheriffmills fig 3b a catchment very close to the radar 14 km and having a low lue 0 5 km modelled river flow using the r dual pol qpe displays a very large overall positive bias 94 which is far more pronounced in period 1 164 bias than period 2 30 bias and arises from catchment average r dual pol precipitation totals that are a very large compared to raingauge precipitation totals 40 larger for the full period or 120 larger for period 1 nevertheless even in period 1 modelled flows using r dual pol data agree reasonably well with the observed flows in terms of relative magnitude and timing of the flood peaks similar behaviour biases in excess of 90 is found for all three catchments closest to nxpol this was traced to a previously undiagnosed antenna elevation pointing error in period 1 leading to overcorrection of beam blockage for this period especially when using beam blockage corrections derived using data from period2 neely et al 2021 this effect was strongest close to the radar where the lue derivation incorporated a greater number of radar voxels from lower elevations which suffered more from the overcorrection deveron at avochie fig 3c a catchment fairly close 51 km to the radar and with a relatively low mean lue 2 3 km producing reasonable modelled river flows the highest peak in the observed flow data reaching 127 m3 s at 19 30 15 june is the most significant flood peak found during the study period at an example catchment it is the only peak that approaches the median annual flood 129 m3 s for this catchment see table 2 this peak is underestimated in both the modelled flow using the raingauge qpe as input peak of 53 m3 s and the r dual pol qpe as input peak 41 m3 s the difference appears to reflect the different catchment average total precipitation recorded over the preceding 48 h 51 mm for raingauge and 38 mm for r dual pol over the whole study period however the total precipitation recorded for this catchment is quite similar for the two qpes 424 mm for raingauge and 409 mm for r dual pol north esk tayside at inveriscandye fig 3d a catchment in the south of the radar area that is both a long distance 94 km from nxpol and on the far side of the cairngorm mountain range its mean lue of 6 7 km is the highest of all the catchments included in this study because of this the radar beam overshoots almost all precipitation in this catchment total catchment average r dual pol precipitation is just 55 mm resulting in a large negative bias in the modelled flow 84 similar behaviour is seen for all catchments with lue exceeding 4 km 7 1 influence of lue and range of the radar observations on performance fig 4a c show scatter plots of r 2 efficiency correlation coefficient and bias for modelled river flow using either r dual pol or raingauge qpe as input against each catchment s mean lue the plots for correlation coefficient and bias fig 4 b c also show the linear least squares regression line and associated coefficient of determination denoted by ρ in this context for r dual pol qpe the systematic reductions in correlation coefficient and bias is particularly striking and is reflected by strong coefficients of determination for the least squares regression lines 0 38 and 0 63 for the correlation coefficient and bias respectively similarly strong fits in the ranges 0 38 to 0 61 and 0 51 to 0 63 for the correlation coefficient and bias respectively are found for all nxpol qpes the lack of similar behaviour in modelled river flow using raingauge qpe hollow grey circles in fig 4b c shows that the trends with r dual pol are not associated with the characteristics of the hydrological catchments themselves the trend for r 2 efficiency is more complicated which instead tends to have largest values at lues of around 2 km for which biases of around zero are typical the existence of distant catchments that perform comparatively well with nxpol precipitation such as the lossie at sheriffmills fig 3b suggests that it is lue rather than range that is chiefly responsible for the deterioration of performance shown in fig 4a c nevertheless the lue is correlated with range having a value of r 0 68 catchments at closer range will benefit from lower minimum detectable signal a smaller areal resolution and suffer less from partial beam filling weaker values of the coefficient of determination for the regression lines 0 084 for r and 0 56 for bias using r dual pol obtained when mean range is used as the explanatory variable rather than mean lue suggest it is lue that has the strongest influence 7 2 comparing different qpes for period 1 and period 2 the boxplots of fig 5 a summarise the overall performance of all qpes as assessed by statistics calculated on the modelled river flows and using data from both period 1 and period 2 statistics are only shown for those 38 catchments with an lue of less than 3 km in altitude on average across the catchment similar trends are repeated if all 57 catchments are included not shown albeit with an overall reduction in r 2 efficiency correlation and bias for all nxpol qpes due to the inclusion of poorly performing catchments whose high mean lue would flag them as unsuitable the raingauge qpe tends to produce the best modelled river flows according to the r 2 efficiency metric some of this improvement could be due to the g2g hydrological model having been calibrated using raingauge qpe as input but this seems unlikely to account for a large proportion of the difference especially given the reduced role of calibration for an area wide distributed model like g2g compared to for example a lumped hydrological model with a catchment specific calibration the r 2 efficiency also indicates a general improvement in performance with either increased processing complexity for single polarisation qpes r z to r zc in table 1 or using the dual polarisation estimates r ah to r dual pol in table 1 albeit with the r zc qpe able to match the performance of some dual polarisation estimates correlation kge sqrt and bias generally repeat the same trends towards improvement found for r 2 efficiency but with some exceptions the strongest increase in performance is seen for the bias this suggests that the improved bias is the factor responsible for a larger part of the improvement seen in r 2 efficiency which can be viewed as a combination of correlation bias and the ratio of standard deviations gupta et al 2009 it also suggests that while the application of a bias correction to nxpol qpes should be expected to increase the overall r 2 efficiency for their associated modelled river flows it may reduce the further improvements gained by processing complexity or dual polarisation the boxplots of fig 5b c highlight the different trends in performance found using the radar qpes for period 1 march to april and period 2 june to august there is also a difference across the two periods in the performance of modelled river flow using raingauge or r c band qpe as input to g2g part of the difference for both radar and raingauge inputs may be due to the increased complexity of modelling snow accumulation and melt within the g2g model one way to quantify this is by comparing g2g modelled flows with raingauge qpe as input calculated either using the g2g snow hydrology module as is standard or excluding it when all precipitation is treated as rainfall on average across all catchments river flows calculated using these two model setups differ by more than 20 for 31 of days in period1 compared to almost no differences of this size 0 1 of days for period2 additionally the short time periods over which river flows have been modelled can make results sensitive to the observed weather conditions for the nxpol qpes the clearest difference between the two periods is the lack of improvement produced by the increasing use of dual polarisation in period 1 compared to the strong improvements found for period 2 this is attributed to the considerably lower height of the melting layer in period 1 which limits the occurrence of the liquid precipitation conditions assumed in the use of estimators based on specific attenuation variations of which are the main difference between the dual polarisation methodologies fig 6 shows the distribution of the highest altitude for which the specific attenuation is calculated which is 250 m below an estimated 0 c height in period 1 this averages a median of just 793 m compared to 1993 m in period 2 and leads to at least 35 of the radar domain never having estimates based on specific attenuation available in the first period compared to less than 10 in the second period the trend for improvement produced by increasing processing complexity and use of dual polarisation for period2 is consistent with that found by neely et al 2021 fig 5 therein where the same qpes were assessed against raingauge data however use of hydrological model simulations of river flow against observations for assessment of the different qpes when employed as alternative model inputs produces a much stronger contrast in performance between methods particularly when considering the correlation and bias this results from the greater spatial coverage of the hydrological catchments when compared to raingauges which can be subject to localised error structures this furnishes further evidence of the benefit of using catchment scale river flow data alongside direct raingauge data comparisons for assessing radar qpe the increased correlation of the r ah and r ah thr methods for multiple catchments when compared to r zc in period 2 is further evidence that estimators based on specific attenuation are impacted to a lesser extent by variability in the drop size distribution of the precipitation than conventional ones employing reflectivity diederich et al 2015b chen et al 2021 7 3 mapping best performing qpes fig 7 maps the best performing nxpol qpe as determined by either r 2 efficiency correlation or bias on modelled river flow for the full study period the lowest absolute values of bias are almost exclusively found for r kdp z or r dual pol for a number of catchments these two qpes give identical performances in general even when not exactly equal their performance is very similar 90 of catchments have an absolute difference in percentage bias between these qpes which is smaller than 2 their performances assessed by correlation or r 2 efficiency are also very similar the typically lower absolute bias in r kdp z and r dual pol feeds through into typically superior r 2 efficiency however when judged by correlation coefficient the picture is far more mixed various dual polarisation or non dual polarisation qpes are found to give the best performance especially for some of the catchments with lower lue when judged by median correlation coefficient for catchments with lue below 3 km fig 5a r z dtm qc at r ah r ah thr and r z ah qpes all perform better than r kdp z and r dual pol these results broadly reflect those shown in fig 7 of neely et al 2021 where the various nxpol qpes were assessed against raingauge measurements fig 8 maps in green the catchments for which the performance of r dual pol is better than r c band the r dual pol qpe has a higher r 2 efficiency than r c band for 23 catchments that tend to be either near the radar or towards the south east and north this is expected as lue for the nxpol radar is low for these locations while due the distance to the nearest c band radar and the intervening topography observations contributing to the c band qpes will be from higher altitudes the three catchments close to the radar and suffering high positive bias in r dual pol as a result of the antenna elevation pointing error in period 1 are an exception a similar pattern of best performing catchments is also seen for the bias this overall behaviour is the result of averaging the differing behaviours in periods 1 and 2 as shown in fig 5 in period 1 the benefit of using the dual polarisation variables in the nxpol qpe are limited and the r 2 efficiency of r dual pol is only better than that of r c band for 10 catchments in contrast during period 2 r dual pol has better r 2 efficiency than that of r c band for 30 catchments as the increased use of dual polarisation variables for r dual pol during this period improves its performance while for r c band many of the catchments suffer from strong positive bias which actually tends to become increasingly positive for those sites nearest nxpol and correspondingly furthest from the c band radars and consequently it suffers a poorer r 2 efficiency as assessed by correlation coefficient the performance of r dual pol is only better than that of r c band for 15 of the catchments in the study area however this number would be increased to 19 for either r ah or r ah thr also recall that nxpol qpes are experimental prototypes not benefitting from the full complexity of estimation measures featuring in the r c band processing chain these results are consistent with those presented in fig 7 of neely et al 2021 comparing r dual pol and r c band using the raingauge network data for assessment rather than river flow data 8 discussion and concluding remarks the performance of a set of x band qpes produced using data from the nxpol radar having increasingly complex processing chains and use of dual polarisation summarised in table 1 were assessed in a hydrological context over northern scotland here mountainous terrain and low melting layer heights make radar based qpe challenging this hydrological assessment used the qpes as input to a distributed hydrological model g2g and compared the resulting set of modelled river flows to observations the assessment strategy considers how qpes perform once integrated over space and time thereby providing additional insights to the meteorological assessment against point raingauge measurements reported by neely et al 2021 all nxpol qpes assessed showed a clear tendency to underestimate the precipitation for catchments with high mean lue the best performance as assessed by the r 2 efficiency of the modelled river flows was generally found for the r dual pol and r kdp z qpes while the flows modelled using r ah and r ah thr qpes often had the best correlation coefficient there were clear differences between the two study periods march to april and june to august 2016 which were caused by the lower melting layer and consequently reduced use of dual polarisation capability in the first period a longer study period would allow greater assessment of seasonal effects and reduce the impact of individual weather events the strong dependence on lue of the performance of river flow modelling using nxpol qpes as input highlights the difficulty of radar precipitation estimation in mountainous environments here the high elevation scans needed to circumvent blockages leads to significant overshooting of the falling precipitation resulting in low correlation and negative bias of modelled river flows this effect becomes most apparent when the mean lue results in utilising radar observations of altitude 3 km and above the assessment also highlights that the met office c band radar network suffers from similar issues in this region but with the results inverted compared to the nxpol radar as a result of the different radar locations this is despite the more complex processing used in the network radar to attempt to overcome this challenge clearly one solution is to incorporate additional radars into the observing network in these problematic locations sited such that observations for critical catchments may be made at altitudes less than 3 km where this is not feasible using heavily processed low elevation scans are likely to be more effective than processed higher elevation scans further improvements to the lue methodology used herein are required to allow a dynamic use of lower altitude scan data where possible comparing the assessment results obtained for period 1 march to april 2016 with those for period 2 july to august 2016 it is seen that the dual polarisation processing attenuation correction and specific attenuation based precipitation estimators has more impact on river flow modelling performance during period 2 this is a consequence of the requirement to have a continuous path within liquid precipitation to allow more accurate estimation of specific attenuation meeting this requirement is often not possible when the freezing height is low and particularly when higher elevation angle scans are needed additional processing is required to obtain further benefits beyond filtering capabilities from dual polarisation radars in lower temperature conditions the expectation is that using solid phase precipitation estimators based on specific differential phase and reflectivity would improve the results in cold conditions bukovčić et al 2020 additionally incorporation of vertical profile corrections and conventional reflectivity estimators better suited to ice phase hydrometeors may also lead to performance improvements in these conditions the hydrological simulation approach to assessment used here would be better placed to identify these benefits than a more conventional comparison to data from raingauges as these are less accurate when measuring solid precipitation savina et al 2012 this should be explored in future work nxpol qpes have also been compared to the rain rate estimates based on observations made by the c band radar network operated by the uk met office the network radars employ a variety of processing steps not included in the nxpol processing chain for example adding an adjustment for mean field bias using raingauge data could be trialled in nxpol even so most nxpol qpes tended to give higher r 2 efficiency in modelled river flows than using r c band qpe for catchments near the radar towards the south east and the far north of the study area the relationship between radar reflectivity and rain rate used in this study was the marshall palmer relationship harrison et al 2012 marshall and palmer 1948 however the exact physical relationship between reflectivity and precipitation intensity depends on the drop size distribution which in turn depends on type of precipitation location and season a preliminary investigation was carried out using data from the disdrometer verification network diven pickering et al 2019 to measure the drop size distribution at a location within the coverage of nxpol during the rains campaign cairngorm 2017 to 2019 this suggested that several events were dominated by a large number of smaller drops where the marshall palmer relationship would underestimate rainfall intensity an initial investigation considering these events using a bulk average relationship was tested it was found to result in large positive biases in modelled river flows for catchments with low lue without improving the trend towards negative biases for catchments with high lue the conclusion drawn was that a dynamic approach is required with the z r relationship chosen as a function of the observed microphysics either on a scan by scan or voxel by voxel basis implementation of such a scheme requires further investigation to understand the relationship between drop size distribution weather conditions and dual polarisation radar signatures under uk conditions cocks et al 2019 thurai et al 2017 further improvements should also consider how the lue concept introduced in neely et al 2021 can be improved upon to preferentially use lower elevation observations where available this could include using blockage corrected lower elevations where data exist and higher elevations where there are no echoes available to correct also introducing weighting into the cartesian gridding scheme to give a higher weight to lower elevation observations within the target grid box where there is a variation in elevations available assessing radar based qpes by their effect on modelled river flows using each qpe as an alternative input to a hydrological model has been found to be a very useful and independent addition to the assessment against point raingauge measurements performed by neely et al 2021 the approach facilitates assessment of precipitation over entire catchment areas thus circumventing the potential sensitivity to local radar artefacts that can affect raingauge based assessments the measurement limitations of raingauges during solid phase precipitation and also a possible lack of representativity for hard to service locations such as mountain tops this approach also allows direct assessment of whether the potential benefits of a qpe procedure is carried forward to its quantitative use in hydrological modelling and therefore to end users additionally the number of suitable catchments in the study area 57 was comparable to the number 64 of raingauges used by neely et al 2021 using a hydrological model to assess qpes does add complexity and an additional source of uncertainty in the assessment however the accuracy of the qpe appears to be a dominant factor affecting river flow modelling performance one way to investigate such sensitivity further would be to incorporate an additional hydrological model into the assessment framework such as a catchment calibrated lumped rainfall runoff model nevertheless the hydrological modelling assessment framework presented here has given additional insights into the space time performance of radar based qpes beyond the traditional point based comparison with raingauge data and can be easily reapplied to test future qpe developments such assessment frameworks have wide applicability and the insights gained on the performance of dual polarisation methods and on identifying priority areas for future development are of general relevance to those developing radar based qpes credit

2908,leaf area index lai is essential for modelling the land surface temperature lst and related energy budget in the land surface models lsms due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite lai data it is unclear whether satellite lai data can improve the performance of noah with multi parameterization noah mp lsm to model lst in china land data assimilation system cldas here by using satellite lai data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method we established a new vegetation scheme based on satellite data for the noah mp lsm in the cldas we quantitatively evaluated simulation effects of different vegetation schemes including the parameter table scheme tab the dynamic vegetation scheme dveg and the satellite lai data scheme obs on modelling lai lst and their related energy budget in china from 2016 to 2018 we found that except for the cropland the lai of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the noah mp lsm validations based on the automatic weather stations in the vegetation covered area showed that compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme improved the negative bias and high unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of simulated lst compared with the tab and dveg scheme the optimal improvements of the obs scheme for annual mean bias and annual mean ubrmse were 0 32 c and 0 17 c respectively we further revealed the mechanism of lai on lst simulation in the noah mp lsm by decomposed temperature metric method with the adoption of the new satellite lai based scheme the absorbed radiation sw sensible heat flux h latent heat flux le and ground heat flux g simulated by the noah mp lsm tend to change in different directions leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface which is consistent with the lst changes the lai changes of dense vegetation affect the lst simulation mainly through the competition of the absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes due to the influence of exposed soil the lai changes of sparse vegetation mainly affect the lst simulation mainly through the interaction of the absorbed shortwave radiation and

model leaf area index land surface temperature surface energy budget cldas noah mp data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface temperature lst is an important variable in the processes of energy and water exchange between the surface and the atmosphere which is one of the important parameters for studying global climate change bright et al 2017 long et al 2020 satellite remote sensing provides long term lst from regional to global scales but satellite lst data are often limited by cloud contamination lacking spatiotemporal continuity zeng et al 2018 land surface models lsms serving as advanced tools for modelling the exchange processes of water energy and carbon fluxes between the land and atmosphere dickinson et al 2006 fisher and koven 2020 can provide an effective way to predict spatiotemporally continuous lst under all weather conditions in the past few decades the lsms have evolved from simple bucket model manabe 1969 to the third generation lsms considering the carbon cycle dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 which aimed to achieve more comprehensive and effective simulations of feedback mechanisms between climate water and terrestrial ecosystems ma et al 2017 with more complex process interactions included in lsms lsms tend to need a large number of parameters to modelling more accurate land surface processes depending on the reliability of the parameterize schemes gan et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 and the quality of input data such as atmospheric forcing vegetation and soil data yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 it is necessary to optimize the simulation process by combining multi source satellite observation data making the simulation process closer to the real situation between land and atmosphere to ensure the performance of lst simulation in the lsms orth et al 2017 leaf area index lai is defined as the total one sided green leaf area per unit of land surface which is one of the critical vegetation parameters in lsms fang et al 2019 since the 21st century the lai of more than one third of the terrestrial vegetation in the world shows a significant increasing trend due to climate warming co2 fertilization and human activities chen et al 2019 piao et al 2020 lai controls many biophysical processes of vegetation regulating local surface energy budget which can be divided into radiative process and non radiative process bright et al 2017 chen et al 2020a the radiative process refers to that lai influences the surface albedo thereby changing the amount of radiation absorbed by the land surface meanwhile lai changes turbulent heat loss including sensible heat and latent heat fluxes through controlling aerodynamic resistance and stomatal resistance which is considered as the non radiative process ge et al 2019 in mid and low latitudes due to sufficient water and heat conditions the non radiative effects of vegetation dominate the cooling effect on surface while in high latitude due to lack of water and snow albedo feedback the radiative effects of vegetation dominates the warming effect on surface alkama et al 2022 skinner et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 lai controls the biophysical process of vegetation directly affecting the surface energy balance thereby changing the local lst most modern third generation lsms usually use lai as a key parameter to parameterize the above mentioned biophysical processes and modelling lst dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 therefore high quality lai information is essential for accurately modelling the lst and related energy budget in the lsms currently remote sensing has been an effective means to obtain large scale lai and the lai data retrieved from remote sensing has been widely used in lsms many prior studies were devoted to assessing the importance of satellite lai data in lsms for simulating lst and related energy budget yuan et al used modis lai data to modify vegetation coverage and surface roughness schemes of the

variational data assimilation system to improve the simulation effect of sensible heat and latent heat fluxes he et al 2021 therefore the applications of satellite lai data to lsms have the potential to improve simulation effects however satellite lai data are usually contaminated by noises such as clouds snow and aerosols resulting in the discontinuities thereby impacting robust applications in lsms which is currently rarely considered in studies of applying satellite lai data to lsms kong et al 2019 yuan et al 2011 it is crucial to realize efficient spatiotemporal reconstruction of satellite lai data before applying them to the lsms noah with multi parameterization noah mp lsm is one of the most widely used third generation lsms niu et al 2011 currently china land data assimilation system version 2 0 cldas v2 0 developed by the china national meteorological information center cma adopts the noah mp lsm as the main lsm in the system liu et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the parameterization schemes of lai in the noah mp lsm adopted by the cldas cldas noah mp lsm include 1 using the parameter table to specify the climate lai i e the specific vegetation has the same lai value per month with intra annual changes but no inter annual changes which is a common modeling scheme in many lsms and 2 using dynamic vegetation model i e lai is predicted by a dynamic leaf model with ball berry type stomatal resistance wu et al 2021 due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite lai in the noah mp lsm it is unclear how satellite lai data impacts the performances of the noah mp lsm to model lst and related energy budget in china here by using satellite lai data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method and establishing a parameterization scheme of lai based on satellite data we aimed to quantitatively evaluate 1 whether the current parameterization schemes of lai in the noah mp lsm have a good ability to describe vegetation characteristics in china compared to reconstructed satellite lai data 2 whether the parameterization scheme based on reconstructed satellite lai data can improve the simulation effect of lst in china and 3 how the lai data affect modelling the surface energy budget in the noah mp lsm which explains the lst change in the noah mp lsm through biophysical process 2 materials and methods 2 1 noah mp lsm the noah mp lsm is the currently widely used third generation lsm which is consists of 12 biophysical biochemical and hydrological processes such as dynamic vegetation stomatal resistance radiation transfer and turbulent heat exchange each process includes multi parameterization schemes used in different land surface processes niu et al 2011 wu et al 2021 here we used noah mp lsm in cldas v2 0 developed by cma which was built on the officially released offline 2d noah mp lsm version 3 6 by the national center for atmospheric research ncar the noah mp lsm introduced a semi tile scheme to represent land surface heterogeneity in the semi tile scheme the surface energy budget is computed over two semi tiles i e vegetated area and bared area the surface temperature of each semi tile can be solved iteratively through the surface energy balance equation niu et al 2011 lai can determine the simulations of biophysical parameters such as surface roughness stomatal resistance and surface emissivity regulating the surface energy balance thereby affecting the lst calculation in the vegetated area finally the lst of each grid cell is calculated by the weighted average of vegetation and bare soil surface temperature and is given as 1 t s 1 f veg t s b f veg t s v where ts is the lst of a grid cell fveg is the vegetation fraction ts b is the surface temperature in the bared semi tile and ts v is the surface temperature in the vegetated semi tile 2 2 dynamic vegetation schemes the parameterization schemes of lai in cldas noah mp include 1 using the parameter table to specify the climate lai i e the specific vegetation has the same lai value per month with intra annual changes but no inter annual changes which is a common modeling scheme in many lsms and 2 using dynamic vegetation model i e lai is predicted by a dynamic leaf model with ball berry type stomatal resistance wu et al 2021 this dynamic leaf model considers the processes such as carbon assimilation by vegetation through photosynthesis the allocation of assimilated carbon to various carbon pools leaves stems wood roots and soil and the respiration of each carbon pool dickinson et al 1998 niu et al 2011 by using the dynamic vegetation scheme the lai can be dynamically output after each simulation step the process can be simplified to the following formula 2 nppleaf f l e a f a r l e a f g l e a f 3 m l e a f p m l e a f p 1 n p p l e a f t l e a f d l e a f δ t 4 lai m l e a f p l a p m where nppleaf is the net primary productivity of leaves gm 2s 1 fleaf is the fraction of assimilated carbon of leaves a is the total carbon assimilation or photosynthesis rate of sunlit and shaded leaves g m 2 s 1 and rleaf is the rate of carbon consumed by leaf respiration g m 2 s 1 and gleaf is the rate of carbon consumed by leaf growth g m 2 s 1 after calculating the npp at each time step the model calculates the leaf mass using eq 2 mleaf p is the leaf mass per unit area gm 2 at time p mleaf p 1 is the leaf mass per unit area g m 2 at time p 1 tleaf is leaf turnover g m 2 s 1 caused by senescence or mechanical loss dleaf is mortality g m 2 s 1 due to cold and drought stress and δt is the time step of the simulation finally multiply leaf area per unit mass lapm m2 g 1 by mleaf p to get the lai of the leaf in the above process all parameters are determined based on the parameterized equation of lai and the parameter table based on vegetation type we updated the relevant parameter table based on previous study gan et al 2019 here we added a new parameterization scheme based on the satellite lai data in each day s simulations we replaced the model simulated lai with satellite lai data the new parameterization scheme based on satellite lai data considers both seasonal cycles and inter annual variability of observed lai for better representing vegetation change compared with table lai the new scheme prescribed lai varies spatiotemporally and is not affected by vegetation classification in lsm 2 3 model input and setup 2 3 1 satellite lai data we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai dataset mod15a2h version 6 of 500 m spatial resolution and 8 d temporal resolution in china as input data for the new parameterization scheme based on the satellite lai data modis lai algorithm consists of a main look up table lut generated using 3d radiation transfer equation and the back up algorithm that uses empirical relationships between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and canopy lai yan et al 2016 modis lai datasets have been widely used in various studies on climate and land surface processes modelling however the satellite lai data are usually contaminated by noises such as clouds snow and aerosols resulting in the spatiotemporal discontinuities thereby impacting robust applications in lsms kong et al 2019 yuan et al 2011 although some simple reconstruction methods such as maximum value composite mvc method and savitzky golay s g filter method have been applied to the preprocessing of satellite lai data before model launch which usually comes at the expense of satellite lai data accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution we reconstructed the satellite lai data by a comprehensive reconstruction method gansg based on advanced unsupervised deep learning proposed by huang et al which consists of three steps including 1 using generative adversarial network gan to interpolate low quality lai pixels 2 using improved s g filter to realize the smoothing of the lai time series interpolated by step1and 3 using median absolute deviation mad filter to eliminate the spatial noise of lai smoothed in step2 huang et al 2021 quantitative analysis based on station observation shows that the gansg method is superior to the three other existing well known methods i e adaptive s g filter asg double logistic dl and asymmetric gaussian ag and two recent time series reconstruction methods i e the modified temporal spatial filter mtsf and spatial temporal savitzky golay stsg we reconstructed the modis lai data from 2016 to 2018 and interpolated them linearly to the daily scale according to the method of xu et al 2020 2 3 2 forcing data the atmospheric forcing datasets used in this study were obtained from the cldas v2 0 the spatial coverage of cldas v2 0 atmospheric forcing datasets is bounded by 60 e to 160 e longitude and 0 n to 65 n latitude with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 and a temporal resolution of one hour from 2008 to 2018 the cldas v2 0 atmospheric forcing datasets was developed based on the observations of more than 2400 national level automatic stations and nearly 40 000 regional automatic weather stations after quality control national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global forecast system gfs numerical analysis products and fengyun 2 fy 2 satellite data the cldas v2 0 atmospheric forcing datasets provides high quality gridded hourly surface pressure near surface air temperature at 2 m relative humidity at 2 m wind speed at 10 m precipitation and shortwave radiation liu et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the maximum vegetation fraction used for the noah mp lsm was calculated from the modis land cover data product according to the method of li et al 2022 soil texture data is the hybrid statsgo fao soil texture recommended by the ncar official website the land cover data used in this study were derived from modis land cover dataset mcd12q1 which have been converted to the united states geological survey usgs land cover classification system according to the method of huang et al 2022b land cover data were up scaled to convert their spatial resolution to 0 0625 by the method of majority sampling of pixels i e we took the pixel type with the largest proportion in the 0 0625 grid as the pixel type after resampling 2 3 3 experimental design we designed three groups of experiments with different dynamic vegetation schemes the three groups of experiments are 1 using the parameter table to calculate the lai according to the land cover type denoted as tab 2 using the dynamic leaf model with ball berry type stomatal resistance to calculate the lai denoted as dveg and 3 using the satellite lai data which is not affected by vegetation classification denoted as obs other parameterization options are shown in table 1 in this study model spin up runs were applied to obtain initial equilibrium conditions as the modeled states we carried out the spin up runs for the noah mp lsm in cldas v2 0 by cycling the 8 year 2008 to 2015 forcing data eight times i e 64 years of model spin up time then we simulated the lst and energy flux latent heat sensible heat ground heat flux and absorbed shortwave radiation in china with a time step of one hour during 2016 2018 using the noah mp lsm which outputs the simulation results every six hours 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 universal time with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 by calculating the mean of the results for the four time periods we obtained the daily simulation results 2 4 validation and analysis 2 4 1 validation data and evaluation indicators the surface temperature validation data used in this study were from the daily datasets of basic meteorological elements of china s national surface meteorological stations v3 0 from the cma since there is no lai value in the non vegetated area we selected 2037 stations in the vegetation covered area with continuous observations from 2016 to 2018 these stations are usually located in the open and flat area with the natural vegetation which could represent the mean meteorology characteristics of a relative large area around this station we used bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse as two evaluation indicators to validate the simulation results and the formula is as follows 5 b i a s i 1 n s i o i n 6 ub r m s e i 1 n s i s o i o 2 n where n is the number of samples oi is the observation data si is the simulation result s and o are the average values of simulations and observations respectively 2 4 2 surface energy budget analysis lai impacts the surface energy balance by controlling the biophysical properties of vegetation such as evapotranspiration and aerodynamic resistance thereby regulating local lst chen et al 2019 here we used the decomposed temperature metric dtm to quantify the changes in lst caused by lai induced surface energy changes huang et al 2022a luyssaert et al 2014 the surface energy balance can be expressed as sw l w l w h l e g where sw 1 α sw is the net shortwave radiation absorbed by land surface and α is surface albedo sw lw lw are downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and upward longwave radiation respectively le h and g are latent sensible and ground heat fluxes respectively lw is the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the surface and can be calculated with the surface temperature ts and surface emissivity ε using the stefan boltzmann law lw ε σ t s 4 where σ is the stefan boltzman constant 5 67 108 w m 2 k 4 we combined eqs 7 and 8 and rearrange the terms as ε σ t s 4 s w l w h l e the emissivity is negligible because the emissivity of the same vegetation varies slightly jin and liang 2006 and vegetation changes have little biophysical effect on lst through emissivity chen et al 2020a duveiller et al 2018 we took the first order derivative of eq 1 and neglected changes in emissivity as following δ t s λ 0 δ s w δ l w δ h δ l e δ g λ 0 4 σ t s 3 1 where λ0 is temperature sensitivity parameter which can be regarded as constant and δsw δsw δα sw in this study all the simulations are driven with the same climate and atmospheric conditions therefore both δsw and δlw can be ignored i e δsw 0 and δlw 0 the land surface heterogeneity induced by lai changes modifies δsw δh δle and δg that finally determines the δlst 3 results 3 1 lai obtained by different dynamic vegetation schemes here we compared spatial distributions of annual mean lai obtained by three dynamic vegetation schemes including tab dveg and obs scheme fig 1 since the tab scheme only relies on the vegetation type to assign a fixed lai value the lai obtained by tab scheme lacked heterogeneity in spatial distribution fig 1a the lai obtained by dveg scheme and obs scheme had similar spatial distribution with an increasing trend from northwest to southeast fig 1b and 1c compared with lai obtained by tab scheme lai obtained by dveg and obs scheme had higher values in the south and lower values in the north fig 1d and 1e lai obtained by dveg scheme was generally higher than that obtained by obs scheme fig 1f we randomly selected grids of different vegetation types including crop grass and forest to compare the lai time series we found that the time series curves of the tab scheme lacked inter annual variation compared to that of dveg and obs scheme compare with dveg and tab scheme satellite observation can correctly capture bimodal characteristics of double crop fig 1g compared with the satellite observation both dveg and tab had higher simulations for lai of grassland fig 1h the dveg scheme had phenology errors on randomly selected forest grid fig 1i we further compared the lai of different land cover types table 2 we reclassified all vegetation types in the lsm into four types including cropland grassland forest and other woody vegetation according to the method of chen et al 2019 in general the three schemes can simulate the trend that lai first increases and then decreases however due to possible phenology errors in the simulation of the forest by the dveg scheme the lai of the forest in autumn 3 6 m2 m2 was higher than that in summer 2 62 m2 m2 compared with the lai obtained by dveg and tab scheme the lai of the cropland obtained by the obs scheme was the highest in the growing season from april to october of 1 86 m2 m2 which was mainly determined by high lai in summer the lai of the cropland obtained by the dveg scheme was the highest throughout the year of 1 49 m2 m2 compared with the lai obtained by dveg and obs scheme the lai of the grassland forest and other woody vegetation obtained by the tab scheme was the highest in the growing season of 1 59 m2 m2 3 23 m2 m2 and 1 47 m2 m2 respectively which was mainly determined by high lai in spring and summer in general except for the cropland the lai of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by model 3 2 effects of different dynamic vegetation schemes on lst simulation here we compared spatial distributions of annual mean lst simulated by three dynamic vegetation schemes including tab dveg and obs scheme fig 2 three schemes can simulate the spatial variation trend of annual mean lst increasing from north to south which was basically consistent with the spatial distribution of station observations fig 2a c g compared with lst simulated by tab scheme lst simulated by dveg and obs scheme had lower values in the south and higher values in the north fig 2d and e lst simulated by dveg scheme was generally lower than that simulated by obs scheme fig 2f we further compared the time series of the three schemes and station observations from 2016 to 2018 we found that the simulated lst time series was basically consistent with the observations and the time series simulated by the obs scheme was the closest to the observation based on site observations we compared the accuracy of lst simulated by different schemes figs 3 and 4 show the spatiotemporal patterns of the monthly mean evaluation indicators bias and ubrmse the bias of the three schemes had the similar spatiotemporal patterns fig 3a c the negative bias of three schemes was particularly pronounced in winter in the region north of 40 n which was lower than 8 c the dveg and obs scheme significantly improved the negative bias of tab scheme throughout the year in the region north of 35 n as well as summer in the region south of 35 n fig 3d and e the obs scheme generally improved the negative bias of dveg in the spatiotemporal pattern fig 3f in general the noah mp lsm had an overall underestimation of lst on an annual scale the obs scheme had the minimal negative bias 1 76 c while the tab scheme had the largest negative bias 2 08 c the differences in bias of the three schemes mainly occurred in the growing season especially in summer fig 3g and table3 the obs scheme had the minimal bias in the growing season 1 69 c and summer 2 13 c compared with the dveg and tab scheme significantly improving the underestimation of lst in the original vegetation scheme of the noah mp lsm the ubrmse of the three schemes had the similar spatiotemporal patterns fig 4a c the high ubrmse of three schemes was particularly pronounced in winter in the region north of 40 n which was higher than 3 c the obs scheme significantly reduced the ubrmse of tab scheme throughout the year especially in summer fig 4d compared with the tab scheme the dveg scheme mainly reduced the ubrmse of tab scheme in the growing season in the region between 35 n and 50 n as well as summer in the region south of 35 n fig 4e the obs scheme generally reduced the ubrmse of dveg throughout the year fig 3f in general the obs scheme based on satellite lai data had lower ubrmse across the entire spatiotemporal pattern on an annual scale the obs scheme had the minimal ubrmse 1 91 c while the dveg scheme has the largest ubrmse 2 08 c in the growing season the tab scheme had the largest ubrmse while in the non growing season the dveg scheme had the largest ubrmse fig 4g and table3 the obs scheme had the minimal ubrmse throughout the year 1 64 c which was particularly pronounced in the growing season 1 51 c and summer 1 72 c compared with the dveg and tab scheme significantly reducing the simulation errors of lst in the original vegetation scheme of the noah mp lsm we further analyzed the accuracy of the simulated lst of the three schemes for different land cover type fig 5 in general compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme improved the negative bias of simulated lst of the four vegetation types in the growing season the obs scheme had the most obvious improvement in the negative bias of grassland in the growing season and the negative bias was improved by 0 75 c compared with the tab scheme moreover compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme also reduced the ubrmse of simulated lst of the four vegetation types in the growing season the obs scheme had the most obvious reduction in the ubrmse of grassland in the growing season and the ubrmse was reduced by 0 24 c compared with the tab scheme overall after using the satellite lai based scheme the simulation effect of the noah mp lsm for the four vegetation types was cropland grassland other woody vegetation forest 3 3 effects of different dynamic vegetation schemes on the energy flux simulation 3 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of the surface energy differences lai impacts the surface energy balance by controlling the biophysical properties of vegetation thereby regulating local lst here we investigated the effects of the lai in the noah mp lsm on the energy fluxes including the absorbed radiation sw sensible heat flux h latent heat flux le and ground heat flux g and how these energy fluxes changes affect the lst simulation in the noah mp lsm which can be explain by their net flux difference δsw δh δle δg spatiotemporal patterns of the surface energy differences show that compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly reduced the sw throughout the year in the region north of 50 n as well as summer in the region south of 50 n fig 6 a and 6f dveg and obs scheme reduced the absorbed shortwave radiation with a cooling effect by an average of 1 01 w m2 and 0 84 w m2 relative to the tab scheme respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly increased the le throughout the year except summer fig 6b and g dveg and obs scheme increased the le with a cooling effect by an average of 1 36 w m2 and 2 05 w m2 relative to the tab scheme respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly reduced the h throughout the year fig 6c and h dveg and obs scheme reduced the h with a warming effect by an average of 3 14 w m2 and 3 66 w m2 relative to the tab scheme respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly reduced the g throughout the year in the region between 30 n and 35 n which has seasonal variation in other regions fig 6d and 6i the dveg and obs scheme had little difference in the g relative to tab scheme with differences of 0 33 w m2 and 0 36 w m2 respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly increased the net flux throughout the year in the region between 30 n and 45 n as well as growing season in the region north of 45 n fig 6a and f dveg and obs scheme increased the net flux with a warming effect by an average of 2 27 w m2 and 2 83 w m2 in the region north of 35 n relative to the tab scheme respectively while dveg and obs scheme reduced the net flux with a cooling effect by an average of 2 17 w m2 and 1 37 w m2 in the region north of 35 n relative to the tab scheme respectively the new scheme based on satellite lai generally increased the net flux with a warming effect by an average of 0 34 w m2 relative to the dveg scheme fig 6k o overall with the adoption of the new satellite lai based scheme sw h le and g simulated by the noah mp lsm tended to change in different directions leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface thereby increasing the lst which is consistent with the changes in lst in section 3 2 3 3 2 biophysical control of δlst by surface energy differences here we used the dtm method to further quantify how different schemes control the energy budget to affect the simulated lst of different land cover in the noah mp lsm during the growing season fig 7 in the noah mp lsm as the lai of the cropland increases in growing season the warming effect due to increased sw exceeded the cooling effect due to decreased turbulent heat flux h and le ultimately resulting in a net warming effect fig 7a c the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of cropland simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 0 10 c by reducing the lai of the cropland relative to the tab scheme with δsw and turbulent heat flux changes contributing 52 0 and 44 0 of the δlst respectively as the lai of the grassland decreases in growing season the warming effect due to increased sw and decreased g dominated a net warming effect fig 7d f the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of grassland simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 1 58 c by increasing the lai of the grassland relative to the tab scheme with δsw and δg contributing 67 3 and 20 7 of the δ lst respectively as the lai of the forest decreases in growing season the warming effect due to decreased h exceeded the cooling effect due to decreased sw and increased le ultimately resulting in a net warming effect fig 7g i the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of the forest simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 0 33 c by reducing the lai of the forest relative to the tab scheme with δsw δle and δh contributing 14 1 28 1 and 55 6 of the δ lst respectively as the lai of the other woody vegetation decreases in growing season the warming effect due to decreased h exceeds the cooling effect due to decreased sw ultimately resulting in a net warming effect fig 7j l the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of the other woody vegetation simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 0 57 c by reducing the lai of the other woody vegetation relative to the tab scheme with δsw and δh contributing 32 3 and 60 9 of the δ lst respectively overall the new vegetation scheme based on satellite lai data modulated the lst mainly through the lai induced change of surface energy including δsw δle and δh it is worth noting that in addition to sparse vegetation such as grassland we found that the lai of vegetation with dense leaves including the cropland forest and other woody vegetation had a negligible impact on lst through the pathway of ground heat flux in the noah mp lsm 4 discussion 4 1 effects of satellite lai data on lai and lst simulation in the noah mp lsm lai is a key surface parameter in lsms to control the surface energy budget through biophysical processes thereby determining the simulations of lst chen et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 here we compared the reconstructed satellite lai data with the lai simulated by two original dynamic vegetation schemes in the cldas noah mp lsm we found that except for the cropland the lai of vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the lsm the dynamic vegetation scheme based on the parameter table needs to assign the same lai value to the same vegetation globally therefore high quality parameter table can guarantee the quality of the lai time series simulation to some extent however the lai simulation results cannot describe the spatial heterogeneity distribution of the lai of the same vegetation type wu et al 2021 we found that the lai obtained by dveg and obs scheme had better spatial heterogeneity however the dveg scheme tended to have a failure in the simulation of vegetation phenology for example the phenology of trees cannot be simulated correctly in some forest areas fig 1i a previous study by li et al obtained similar conclusions to ours i e the simulated lai tended to rapidly decreases to zero with incorrect phenology in the case of the ncar version of the noah mp lsm with dveg li et al 2022 a possible solution to this problem is to modify parameters in the dynamic vegetation model such as leaf turnover and mortality chen et al 2020b montané et al 2017 considering these parameters need to be obtained through a large number of high cost field measurements lemaire et al 2009 and it is difficult to ensure the universality of the measurement results under different climate and soil conditions the calibrations of dynamic vegetation models still face difficulties satellite observations provide a fast and low cost means to obtain lai for the lsms compared with tab and dveg scheme obs scheme can provide a spatiotemporally continuous lai that approximates the ground truth for the noah mp lsm therefore developing high quality satellite lai data and applying them to models are crucial for development of the noah mp lsm currently multiple satellite data have been used to improve the simulation performances of land surface processes in cldas developed by cma to provide more accurate weather forecasting and climate projection services to the public huang et al 2022b sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 here we improved the simulation performances of lst by lai satellite data in the noah mp lsm which is the main lsm in cldas we found that the cldas noah mp lsm underestimates the lst in china which is consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2021 compared with the original parameterization scheme dveg and tab in the noah mp lsm the new vegetation scheme obs based on satellite lai data improved negative bias in model simulations and reduces ubrmse relative to station observation although the improvement of the simulated lst for the dveg scheme by the obs scheme was not as pronounced as that for the tab scheme we emphasized that obs scheme can provide vegetation information including growth status and phenology closer to the ground truth conditions than the dveg scheme high quality lai information can provide accurate parameters for modelling surface hydrology and carbon cycle processes such as canopy interception and gross primary productivity niu et al 2011 xu et al 2021 therefore in addition to improving the lst simulation the vegetation scheme based on satellite lai data has the potential to improve the simulation of hydrological and carbon cycle processes in the noah mp lsm 4 2 biophysical mechanisms of lai on lst simulation in the noah mp lsm generally lai modulates local surface energy budget by affecting biophysical processes such as evapotranspiration albedo and roughness thereby regulating local lst forzieri et al 2020 here we quantified how the lai data affect modelling the surface energy budget in the noah mp lsm which explains the changes in lst the results suggest that lai affects lst mainly through modification of the albedo induced adsorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat le and h in the noah mp lsm which varies among the seasons and latitudes previous satellite observations have shown that the dense vegetation with higher lai tend to intercept and absorb more incoming radiation resulting in a lowered land surface albedo tian et al 2018 similarly we found that the decreased lai of dense vegetation such as forest and other woody vegetation can lead to higher albedo on the surface which absorbs less solar shortwave radiation thereby decreasing the lst in the noah mp lsm meanwhile the decreased lai of tall vegetation leads to higher aerodynamic resistance thereby weakening the turbulent heat transfer mainly sensible heat from the land surface to the atmosphere and increasing the lst in the noah mp lsm chen et al 2019 huang et al 2022a therefore for dense and tall vegetation the lai variation causes a competition between absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat flux which determines the direction of the lst variation in the noah mp lsm the decreased lai of sparse vegetation such as grassland leads to more soil being exposed in the noah mp lsm soil albedo is usually determined by soil factors such as soil color and moisture for a case lack of high quality soil color data the medium dark color index tends to be choose as default color index in the noah mp lsm corresponding to an albedo range of 0 09 0 18 which is significantly lower than that of grassland zheng et al 2019 the grassland with lower lai leads to more soil with lower albedo being exposed on the surface which absorbs more solar shortwave radiation thereby increasing the lst some studies have shown that changes in the lai of vegetation tend to change le flux significantly by affecting vegetation transpiration and soil moisture evaporation he et al 2021 zeng et al 2017 however we found that changes in lai of grassland had little effect on le flux in the noah mp lsm the grassland in china is mainly located in the arid semi arid regions where water supply limitation restricts vegetation evapotranspiration xiao et al 2013 therefore compared with the forest under more water supply conditions changes in lai of grassland have less effect on le flux in the noah mp lsm since the grassland vegetation is low with small leaves turbulent heat fluxes of grasslands are less affected by changes in lai moreover decreased ground heat flux due to decreased lai also leads to an increase in lst therefore the lai affects the lst simulation of low vegetation mainly through absorbed shortwave radiation change and ground heat flux change in the noah mp lsm 5 study limitations our study also has some limitations here we used advanced deep learning methods to reconstruct modis lai data to ensure the high quality of the input data however some studies have shown that there are some certain differences in the lai products retrieved by different sensors jiang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to further evaluate the impact of different satellite lai products and their fusion products on the noah mp lsm in this study we used the lst data from automatic weather stations for verification these stations are usually located in the open area with the natural vegetation which could represent the mean meteorology characteristics of a relative large area around this station however these stations may lack the ability to accurately characterize local microclimate zellweger et al 2020 thereby bringing uncertainty to the validation of the simulation results we further quantified how lai modulates local surface energy budget thereby regulating local lst simulation in the noah mp lsm however due to the lack of continuous and dense energy flux station observations the accuracy of our simulated energy flux for different vegetation schemes is currently unclear which requires further evaluation in addition we found that the combined effects of each energy component on the lst calculated by the dtm method are slightly different from the lst differences directly simulated by the lsm fig 7 the dtm method treats the h and le as two independent variables however during the parameterization of the model the h and le tend to have some correlation because they are calculated by the same biophysical parameters such as surface roughness in the lsm chen et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 therefore future work needs to introduce more sophisticated and comprehensive diagnostic methods to quantify the effects of each biophysical process on lst in the lsms 6 conclusion lai is essential for accurately modelling the lst and related energy budget in the lsms due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite lai in the cldas noah mp lsm it is unclear whether satellite lai data can improve the performances of the noah mp lsm to model lst here by using satellite lai data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method we established a vegetation scheme of lai based on satellite data for the noah mp lsm we quantitatively evaluated simulation effects of different vegetation schemes on lai lst and their related energy budget in china from 2016 to 2018 we further revealed the mechanism of lai on lst simulation in the noah mp lsm by dtm method the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 compared with the satellite lai the lai obtained by original tab scheme lacked heterogeneity in spatial distribution and the original dveg scheme overestimated lai value and fails to model vegetation phenology at certain moments in general except for the cropland the lai of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the noah mp lsm 2 validations based on 2304 automatic weather station in the vegetation covered area showed that the obs scheme improved underestimation of the lst simulated by the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme had the greatest improvement on the annual mean bias of the tab scheme and the annual mean bias was reduced by 0 32 c the obs scheme had lower ubrmse relative to observations across the entire spatiotemporal pattern than the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme had the greatest improvement on the annual mean ubrmse of the dveg scheme and the annual mean ubrmse was reduced by 0 17 c furthermore compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme improved the negative bias and high ubrmse of simulated lst of the four vegetation types including cropland grassland forest and other woody vegetation in the growing season 3 with the adoption of the new satellite lai based scheme sw h le and g simulated by the noah mp lsm tended to change in different directions leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface which is consistent with the changes in lst the results suggest that the lai changes of dense vegetation affect the lst simulation mainly through the competition of the absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes due to the comprehensive influence of exposed soil leaf features and water supply conditions the lai changes of sparse vegetation mainly affect the lst simulation mainly through the interaction of the absorbed shortwave

2908,leaf area index lai is essential for modelling the land surface temperature lst and related energy budget in the land surface models lsms due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite lai data it is unclear whether satellite lai data can improve the performance of noah with multi parameterization noah mp lsm to model lst in china land data assimilation system cldas here by using satellite lai data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method we established a new vegetation scheme based on satellite data for the noah mp lsm in the cldas we quantitatively evaluated simulation effects of different vegetation schemes including the parameter table scheme tab the dynamic vegetation scheme dveg and the satellite lai data scheme obs on modelling lai lst and their related energy budget in china from 2016 to 2018 we found that except for the cropland the lai of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the noah mp lsm validations based on the automatic weather stations in the vegetation covered area showed that compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme improved the negative bias and high unbiased root mean square error ubrmse of simulated lst compared with the tab and dveg scheme the optimal improvements of the obs scheme for annual mean bias and annual mean ubrmse were 0 32 c and 0 17 c respectively we further revealed the mechanism of lai on lst simulation in the noah mp lsm by decomposed temperature metric method with the adoption of the new satellite lai based scheme the absorbed radiation sw sensible heat flux h latent heat flux le and ground heat flux g simulated by the noah mp lsm tend to change in different directions leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface which is consistent with the lst changes the lai changes of dense vegetation affect the lst simulation mainly through the competition of the absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes due to the influence of exposed soil the lai changes of sparse vegetation mainly affect the lst simulation mainly through the interaction of the absorbed shortwave radiation and

model leaf area index land surface temperature surface energy budget cldas noah mp data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface temperature lst is an important variable in the processes of energy and water exchange between the surface and the atmosphere which is one of the important parameters for studying global climate change bright et al 2017 long et al 2020 satellite remote sensing provides long term lst from regional to global scales but satellite lst data are often limited by cloud contamination lacking spatiotemporal continuity zeng et al 2018 land surface models lsms serving as advanced tools for modelling the exchange processes of water energy and carbon fluxes between the land and atmosphere dickinson et al 2006 fisher and koven 2020 can provide an effective way to predict spatiotemporally continuous lst under all weather conditions in the past few decades the lsms have evolved from simple bucket model manabe 1969 to the third generation lsms considering the carbon cycle dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 which aimed to achieve more comprehensive and effective simulations of feedback mechanisms between climate water and terrestrial ecosystems ma et al 2017 with more complex process interactions included in lsms lsms tend to need a large number of parameters to modelling more accurate land surface processes depending on the reliability of the parameterize schemes gan et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 and the quality of input data such as atmospheric forcing vegetation and soil data yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 it is necessary to optimize the simulation process by combining multi source satellite observation data making the simulation process closer to the real situation between land and atmosphere to ensure the performance of lst simulation in the lsms orth et al 2017 leaf area index lai is defined as the total one sided green leaf area per unit of land surface which is one of the critical vegetation parameters in lsms fang et al 2019 since the 21st century the lai of more than one third of the terrestrial vegetation in the world shows a significant increasing trend due to climate warming co2 fertilization and human activities chen et al 2019 piao et al 2020 lai controls many biophysical processes of vegetation regulating local surface energy budget which can be divided into radiative process and non radiative process bright et al 2017 chen et al 2020a the radiative process refers to that lai influences the surface albedo thereby changing the amount of radiation absorbed by the land surface meanwhile lai changes turbulent heat loss including sensible heat and latent heat fluxes through controlling aerodynamic resistance and stomatal resistance which is considered as the non radiative process ge et al 2019 in mid and low latitudes due to sufficient water and heat conditions the non radiative effects of vegetation dominate the cooling effect on surface while in high latitude due to lack of water and snow albedo feedback the radiative effects of vegetation dominates the warming effect on surface alkama et al 2022 skinner et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 lai controls the biophysical process of vegetation directly affecting the surface energy balance thereby changing the local lst most modern third generation lsms usually use lai as a key parameter to parameterize the above mentioned biophysical processes and modelling lst dai et al 2003 niu et al 2011 therefore high quality lai information is essential for accurately modelling the lst and related energy budget in the lsms currently remote sensing has been an effective means to obtain large scale lai and the lai data retrieved from remote sensing has been widely used in lsms many prior studies were devoted to assessing the importance of satellite lai data in lsms for simulating lst and related energy budget yuan et al used modis lai data to modify vegetation coverage and surface roughness schemes of the common land model colm reducing overestimation of lst in colm yuan et al 2021 nogueira et al improved the representation of vegetation over iberia in carbon hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land model chtessel by combining information from the esa cci land cover dataset with the copernicus global land service cgls lai data improving simulation accuracy of lst nogueira et al 2020 moreover satellite lai can also be assimilated into the lsms he et al combined satellite lai data with a coupled two source surface energy budget vegetation dynamic model tseb vdm via a variational data assimilation system to improve the simulation effect of sensible heat and latent heat fluxes he et al 2021 therefore the applications of satellite lai data to lsms have the potential to improve simulation effects however satellite lai data are usually contaminated by noises such as clouds snow and aerosols resulting in the discontinuities thereby impacting robust applications in lsms which is currently rarely considered in studies of applying satellite lai data to lsms kong et al 2019 yuan et al 2011 it is crucial to realize efficient spatiotemporal reconstruction of satellite lai data before applying them to the lsms noah with multi parameterization noah mp lsm is one of the most widely used third generation lsms niu et al 2011 currently china land data assimilation system version 2 0 cldas v2 0 developed by the china national meteorological information center cma adopts the noah mp lsm as the main lsm in the system liu et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the parameterization schemes of lai in the noah mp lsm adopted by the cldas cldas noah mp lsm include 1 using the parameter table to specify the climate lai i e the specific vegetation has the same lai value per month with intra annual changes but no inter annual changes which is a common modeling scheme in many lsms and 2 using dynamic vegetation model i e lai is predicted by a dynamic leaf model with ball berry type stomatal resistance wu et al 2021 due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite lai in the noah mp lsm it is unclear how satellite lai data impacts the performances of the noah mp lsm to model lst and related energy budget in china here by using satellite lai data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method and establishing a parameterization scheme of lai based on satellite data we aimed to quantitatively evaluate 1 whether the current parameterization schemes of lai in the noah mp lsm have a good ability to describe vegetation characteristics in china compared to reconstructed satellite lai data 2 whether the parameterization scheme based on reconstructed satellite lai data can improve the simulation effect of lst in china and 3 how the lai data affect modelling the surface energy budget in the noah mp lsm which explains the lst change in the noah mp lsm through biophysical process 2 materials and methods 2 1 noah mp lsm the noah mp lsm is the currently widely used third generation lsm which is consists of 12 biophysical biochemical and hydrological processes such as dynamic vegetation stomatal resistance radiation transfer and turbulent heat exchange each process includes multi parameterization schemes used in different land surface processes niu et al 2011 wu et al 2021 here we used noah mp lsm in cldas v2 0 developed by cma which was built on the officially released offline 2d noah mp lsm version 3 6 by the national center for atmospheric research ncar the noah mp lsm introduced a semi tile scheme to represent land surface heterogeneity in the semi tile scheme the surface energy budget is computed over two semi tiles i e vegetated area and bared area the surface temperature of each semi tile can be solved iteratively through the surface energy balance equation niu et al 2011 lai can determine the simulations of biophysical parameters such as surface roughness stomatal resistance and surface emissivity regulating the surface energy balance thereby affecting the lst calculation in the vegetated area finally the lst of each grid cell is calculated by the weighted average of vegetation and bare soil surface temperature and is given as 1 t s 1 f veg t s b f veg t s v where ts is the lst of a grid cell fveg is the vegetation fraction ts b is the surface temperature in the bared semi tile and ts v is the surface temperature in the vegetated semi tile 2 2 dynamic vegetation schemes the parameterization schemes of lai in cldas noah mp include 1 using the parameter table to specify the climate lai i e the specific vegetation has the same lai value per month with intra annual changes but no inter annual changes which is a common modeling scheme in many lsms and 2 using dynamic vegetation model i e lai is predicted by a dynamic leaf model with ball berry type stomatal resistance wu et al 2021 this dynamic leaf model considers the processes such as carbon assimilation by vegetation through photosynthesis the allocation of assimilated carbon to various carbon pools leaves stems wood roots and soil and the respiration of each carbon pool dickinson et al 1998 niu et al 2011 by using the dynamic vegetation scheme the lai can be dynamically output after each simulation step the process can be simplified to the following formula 2 nppleaf f l e a f a r l e a f g l e a f 3 m l e a f p m l e a f p 1 n p p l e a f t l e a f d l e a f δ t 4 lai m l e a f p l a p m where nppleaf is the net primary productivity of leaves gm 2s 1 fleaf is the fraction of assimilated carbon of leaves a is the total carbon assimilation or photosynthesis rate of sunlit and shaded leaves g m 2 s 1 and rleaf is the rate of carbon consumed by leaf respiration g m 2 s 1 and gleaf is the rate of carbon consumed by leaf growth g m 2 s 1 after calculating the npp at each time step the model calculates the leaf mass using eq 2 mleaf p is the leaf mass per unit area gm 2 at time p mleaf p 1 is the leaf mass per unit area g m 2 at time p 1 tleaf is leaf turnover g m 2 s 1 caused by senescence or mechanical loss dleaf is mortality g m 2 s 1 due to cold and drought stress and δt is the time step of the simulation finally multiply leaf area per unit mass lapm m2 g 1 by mleaf p to get the lai of the leaf in the above process all parameters are determined based on the parameterized equation of lai and the parameter table based on vegetation type we updated the relevant parameter table based on previous study gan et al 2019 here we added a new parameterization scheme based on the satellite lai data in each day s simulations we replaced the model simulated lai with satellite lai data the new parameterization scheme based on satellite lai data considers both seasonal cycles and inter annual variability of observed lai for better representing vegetation change compared with table lai the new scheme prescribed lai varies spatiotemporally and is not affected by vegetation classification in lsm 2 3 model input and setup 2 3 1 satellite lai data we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai dataset mod15a2h version 6 of 500 m spatial resolution and 8 d temporal resolution in china as input data for the new parameterization scheme based on the satellite lai data modis lai algorithm consists of a main look up table lut generated using 3d radiation transfer equation and the back up algorithm that uses empirical relationships between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and canopy lai yan et al 2016 modis lai datasets have been widely used in various studies on climate and land surface processes modelling however the satellite lai data are usually contaminated by noises such as clouds snow and aerosols resulting in the spatiotemporal discontinuities thereby impacting robust applications in lsms kong et al 2019 yuan et al 2011 although some simple reconstruction methods such as maximum value composite mvc method and savitzky golay s g filter method have been applied to the preprocessing of satellite lai data before model launch which usually comes at the expense of satellite lai data accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution we reconstructed the satellite lai data by a comprehensive reconstruction method gansg based on advanced unsupervised deep learning proposed by huang et al which consists of three steps including 1 using generative adversarial network gan to interpolate low quality lai pixels 2 using improved s g filter to realize the smoothing of the lai time series interpolated by step1and 3 using median absolute deviation mad filter to eliminate the spatial noise of lai smoothed in step2 huang et al 2021 quantitative analysis based on station observation shows that the gansg method is superior to the three other existing well known methods i e adaptive s g filter asg double logistic dl and asymmetric gaussian ag and two recent time series reconstruction methods i e the modified temporal spatial filter mtsf and spatial temporal savitzky golay stsg we reconstructed the modis lai data from 2016 to 2018 and interpolated them linearly to the daily scale according to the method of xu et al 2020 2 3 2 forcing data the atmospheric forcing datasets used in this study were obtained from the cldas v2 0 the spatial coverage of cldas v2 0 atmospheric forcing datasets is bounded by 60 e to 160 e longitude and 0 n to 65 n latitude with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 and a temporal resolution of one hour from 2008 to 2018 the cldas v2 0 atmospheric forcing datasets was developed based on the observations of more than 2400 national level automatic stations and nearly 40 000 regional automatic weather stations after quality control national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global forecast system gfs numerical analysis products and fengyun 2 fy 2 satellite data the cldas v2 0 atmospheric forcing datasets provides high quality gridded hourly surface pressure near surface air temperature at 2 m relative humidity at 2 m wind speed at 10 m precipitation and shortwave radiation liu et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the maximum vegetation fraction used for the noah mp lsm was calculated from the modis land cover data product according to the method of li et al 2022 soil texture data is the hybrid statsgo fao soil texture recommended by the ncar official website the land cover data used in this study were derived from modis land cover dataset mcd12q1 which have been converted to the united states geological survey usgs land cover classification system according to the method of huang et al 2022b land cover data were up scaled to convert their spatial resolution to 0 0625 by the method of majority sampling of pixels i e we took the pixel type with the largest proportion in the 0 0625 grid as the pixel type after resampling 2 3 3 experimental design we designed three groups of experiments with different dynamic vegetation schemes the three groups of experiments are 1 using the parameter table to calculate the lai according to the land cover type denoted as tab 2 using the dynamic leaf model with ball berry type stomatal resistance to calculate the lai denoted as dveg and 3 using the satellite lai data which is not affected by vegetation classification denoted as obs other parameterization options are shown in table 1 in this study model spin up runs were applied to obtain initial equilibrium conditions as the modeled states we carried out the spin up runs for the noah mp lsm in cldas v2 0 by cycling the 8 year 2008 to 2015 forcing data eight times i e 64 years of model spin up time then we simulated the lst and energy flux latent heat sensible heat ground heat flux and absorbed shortwave radiation in china with a time step of one hour during 2016 2018 using the noah mp lsm which outputs the simulation results every six hours 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 universal time with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 by calculating the mean of the results for the four time periods we obtained the daily simulation results 2 4 validation and analysis 2 4 1 validation data and evaluation indicators the surface temperature validation data used in this study were from the daily datasets of basic meteorological elements of china s national surface meteorological stations v3 0 from the cma since there is no lai value in the non vegetated area we selected 2037 stations in the vegetation covered area with continuous observations from 2016 to 2018 these stations are usually located in the open and flat area with the natural vegetation which could represent the mean meteorology characteristics of a relative large area around this station we used bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse as two evaluation indicators to validate the simulation results and the formula is as follows 5 b i a s i 1 n s i o i n 6 ub r m s e i 1 n s i s o i o 2 n where n is the number of samples oi is the observation data si is the simulation result s and o are the average values of simulations and observations respectively 2 4 2 surface energy budget analysis lai impacts the surface energy balance by controlling the biophysical properties of vegetation such as evapotranspiration and aerodynamic resistance thereby regulating local lst chen et al 2019 here we used the decomposed temperature metric dtm to quantify the changes in lst caused by lai induced surface energy changes huang et al 2022a luyssaert et al 2014 the surface energy balance can be expressed as sw l w l w h l e g where sw 1 α sw is the net shortwave radiation absorbed by land surface and α is surface albedo sw lw lw are downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and upward longwave radiation respectively le h and g are latent sensible and ground heat fluxes respectively lw is the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the surface and can be calculated with the surface temperature ts and surface emissivity ε using the stefan boltzmann law lw ε σ t s 4 where σ is the stefan boltzman constant 5 67 108 w m 2 k 4 we combined eqs 7 and 8 and rearrange the terms as ε σ t s 4 s w l w h l e the emissivity is negligible because the emissivity of the same vegetation varies slightly jin and liang 2006 and vegetation changes have little biophysical effect on lst through emissivity chen et al 2020a duveiller et al 2018 we took the first order derivative of eq 1 and neglected changes in emissivity as following δ t s λ 0 δ s w δ l w δ h δ l e δ g λ 0 4 σ t s 3 1 where λ0 is temperature sensitivity parameter which can be regarded as constant and δsw δsw δα sw in this study all the simulations are driven with the same climate and atmospheric conditions therefore both δsw and δlw can be ignored i e δsw 0 and δlw 0 the land surface heterogeneity induced by lai changes modifies δsw δh δle and δg that finally determines the δlst 3 results 3 1 lai obtained by different dynamic vegetation schemes here we compared spatial distributions of annual mean lai obtained by three dynamic vegetation schemes including tab dveg and obs scheme fig 1 since the tab scheme only relies on the vegetation type to assign a fixed lai value the lai obtained by tab scheme lacked heterogeneity in spatial distribution fig 1a the lai obtained by dveg scheme and obs scheme had similar spatial distribution with an increasing trend from northwest to southeast fig 1b and 1c compared with lai obtained by tab scheme lai obtained by dveg and obs scheme had higher values in the south and lower values in the north fig 1d and 1e lai obtained by dveg scheme was generally higher than that obtained by obs scheme fig 1f we randomly selected grids of different vegetation types including crop grass and forest to compare the lai time series we found that the time series curves of the tab scheme lacked inter annual variation compared to that of dveg and obs scheme compare with dveg and tab scheme satellite observation can correctly capture bimodal characteristics of double crop fig 1g compared with the satellite observation both dveg and tab had higher simulations for lai of grassland fig 1h the dveg scheme had phenology errors on randomly selected forest grid fig 1i we further compared the lai of different land cover types table 2 we reclassified all vegetation types in the lsm into four types including cropland grassland forest and other woody vegetation according to the method of chen et al 2019 in general the three schemes can simulate the trend that lai first increases and then decreases however due to possible phenology errors in the simulation of the forest by the dveg scheme the lai of the forest in autumn 3 6 m2 m2 was higher than that in summer 2 62 m2 m2 compared with the lai obtained by dveg and tab scheme the lai of the cropland obtained by the obs scheme was the highest in the growing season from april to october of 1 86 m2 m2 which was mainly determined by high lai in summer the lai of the cropland obtained by the dveg scheme was the highest throughout the year of 1 49 m2 m2 compared with the lai obtained by dveg and obs scheme the lai of the grassland forest and other woody vegetation obtained by the tab scheme was the highest in the growing season of 1 59 m2 m2 3 23 m2 m2 and 1 47 m2 m2 respectively which was mainly determined by high lai in spring and summer in general except for the cropland the lai of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by model 3 2 effects of different dynamic vegetation schemes on lst simulation here we compared spatial distributions of annual mean lst simulated by three dynamic vegetation schemes including tab dveg and obs scheme fig 2 three schemes can simulate the spatial variation trend of annual mean lst increasing from north to south which was basically consistent with the spatial distribution of station observations fig 2a c g compared with lst simulated by tab scheme lst simulated by dveg and obs scheme had lower values in the south and higher values in the north fig 2d and e lst simulated by dveg scheme was generally lower than that simulated by obs scheme fig 2f we further compared the time series of the three schemes and station observations from 2016 to 2018 we found that the simulated lst time series was basically consistent with the observations and the time series simulated by the obs scheme was the closest to the observation based on site observations we compared the accuracy of lst simulated by different schemes figs 3 and 4 show the spatiotemporal patterns of the monthly mean evaluation indicators bias and ubrmse the bias of the three schemes had the similar spatiotemporal patterns fig 3a c the negative bias of three schemes was particularly pronounced in winter in the region north of 40 n which was lower than 8 c the dveg and obs scheme significantly improved the negative bias of tab scheme throughout the year in the region north of 35 n as well as summer in the region south of 35 n fig 3d and e the obs scheme generally improved the negative bias of dveg in the spatiotemporal pattern fig 3f in general the noah mp lsm had an overall underestimation of lst on an annual scale the obs scheme had the minimal negative bias 1 76 c while the tab scheme had the largest negative bias 2 08 c the differences in bias of the three schemes mainly occurred in the growing season especially in summer fig 3g and table3 the obs scheme had the minimal bias in the growing season 1 69 c and summer 2 13 c compared with the dveg and tab scheme significantly improving the underestimation of lst in the original vegetation scheme of the noah mp lsm the ubrmse of the three schemes had the similar spatiotemporal patterns fig 4a c the high ubrmse of three schemes was particularly pronounced in winter in the region north of 40 n which was higher than 3 c the obs scheme significantly reduced the ubrmse of tab scheme throughout the year especially in summer fig 4d compared with the tab scheme the dveg scheme mainly reduced the ubrmse of tab scheme in the growing season in the region between 35 n and 50 n as well as summer in the region south of 35 n fig 4e the obs scheme generally reduced the ubrmse of dveg throughout the year fig 3f in general the obs scheme based on satellite lai data had lower ubrmse across the entire spatiotemporal pattern on an annual scale the obs scheme had the minimal ubrmse 1 91 c while the dveg scheme has the largest ubrmse 2 08 c in the growing season the tab scheme had the largest ubrmse while in the non growing season the dveg scheme had the largest ubrmse fig 4g and table3 the obs scheme had the minimal ubrmse throughout the year 1 64 c which was particularly pronounced in the growing season 1 51 c and summer 1 72 c compared with the dveg and tab scheme significantly reducing the simulation errors of lst in the original vegetation scheme of the noah mp lsm we further analyzed the accuracy of the simulated lst of the three schemes for different land cover type fig 5 in general compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme improved the negative bias of simulated lst of the four vegetation types in the growing season the obs scheme had the most obvious improvement in the negative bias of grassland in the growing season and the negative bias was improved by 0 75 c compared with the tab scheme moreover compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme also reduced the ubrmse of simulated lst of the four vegetation types in the growing season the obs scheme had the most obvious reduction in the ubrmse of grassland in the growing season and the ubrmse was reduced by 0 24 c compared with the tab scheme overall after using the satellite lai based scheme the simulation effect of the noah mp lsm for the four vegetation types was cropland grassland other woody vegetation forest 3 3 effects of different dynamic vegetation schemes on the energy flux simulation 3 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of the surface energy differences lai impacts the surface energy balance by controlling the biophysical properties of vegetation thereby regulating local lst here we investigated the effects of the lai in the noah mp lsm on the energy fluxes including the absorbed radiation sw sensible heat flux h latent heat flux le and ground heat flux g and how these energy fluxes changes affect the lst simulation in the noah mp lsm which can be explain by their net flux difference δsw δh δle δg spatiotemporal patterns of the surface energy differences show that compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly reduced the sw throughout the year in the region north of 50 n as well as summer in the region south of 50 n fig 6 a and 6f dveg and obs scheme reduced the absorbed shortwave radiation with a cooling effect by an average of 1 01 w m2 and 0 84 w m2 relative to the tab scheme respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly increased the le throughout the year except summer fig 6b and g dveg and obs scheme increased the le with a cooling effect by an average of 1 36 w m2 and 2 05 w m2 relative to the tab scheme respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly reduced the h throughout the year fig 6c and h dveg and obs scheme reduced the h with a warming effect by an average of 3 14 w m2 and 3 66 w m2 relative to the tab scheme respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly reduced the g throughout the year in the region between 30 n and 35 n which has seasonal variation in other regions fig 6d and 6i the dveg and obs scheme had little difference in the g relative to tab scheme with differences of 0 33 w m2 and 0 36 w m2 respectively compared with the tab scheme the dveg and obs scheme mainly increased the net flux throughout the year in the region between 30 n and 45 n as well as growing season in the region north of 45 n fig 6a and f dveg and obs scheme increased the net flux with a warming effect by an average of 2 27 w m2 and 2 83 w m2 in the region north of 35 n relative to the tab scheme respectively while dveg and obs scheme reduced the net flux with a cooling effect by an average of 2 17 w m2 and 1 37 w m2 in the region north of 35 n relative to the tab scheme respectively the new scheme based on satellite lai generally increased the net flux with a warming effect by an average of 0 34 w m2 relative to the dveg scheme fig 6k o overall with the adoption of the new satellite lai based scheme sw h le and g simulated by the noah mp lsm tended to change in different directions leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface thereby increasing the lst which is consistent with the changes in lst in section 3 2 3 3 2 biophysical control of δlst by surface energy differences here we used the dtm method to further quantify how different schemes control the energy budget to affect the simulated lst of different land cover in the noah mp lsm during the growing season fig 7 in the noah mp lsm as the lai of the cropland increases in growing season the warming effect due to increased sw exceeded the cooling effect due to decreased turbulent heat flux h and le ultimately resulting in a net warming effect fig 7a c the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of cropland simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 0 10 c by reducing the lai of the cropland relative to the tab scheme with δsw and turbulent heat flux changes contributing 52 0 and 44 0 of the δlst respectively as the lai of the grassland decreases in growing season the warming effect due to increased sw and decreased g dominated a net warming effect fig 7d f the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of grassland simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 1 58 c by increasing the lai of the grassland relative to the tab scheme with δsw and δg contributing 67 3 and 20 7 of the δ lst respectively as the lai of the forest decreases in growing season the warming effect due to decreased h exceeded the cooling effect due to decreased sw and increased le ultimately resulting in a net warming effect fig 7g i the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of the forest simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 0 33 c by reducing the lai of the forest relative to the tab scheme with δsw δle and δh contributing 14 1 28 1 and 55 6 of the δ lst respectively as the lai of the other woody vegetation decreases in growing season the warming effect due to decreased h exceeds the cooling effect due to decreased sw ultimately resulting in a net warming effect fig 7j l the obs scheme had the most significant impact on the lst of the other woody vegetation simulated by the tab scheme the obs scheme resulted in a net increase in lst of 0 57 c by reducing the lai of the other woody vegetation relative to the tab scheme with δsw and δh contributing 32 3 and 60 9 of the δ lst respectively overall the new vegetation scheme based on satellite lai data modulated the lst mainly through the lai induced change of surface energy including δsw δle and δh it is worth noting that in addition to sparse vegetation such as grassland we found that the lai of vegetation with dense leaves including the cropland forest and other woody vegetation had a negligible impact on lst through the pathway of ground heat flux in the noah mp lsm 4 discussion 4 1 effects of satellite lai data on lai and lst simulation in the noah mp lsm lai is a key surface parameter in lsms to control the surface energy budget through biophysical processes thereby determining the simulations of lst chen et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 here we compared the reconstructed satellite lai data with the lai simulated by two original dynamic vegetation schemes in the cldas noah mp lsm we found that except for the cropland the lai of vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the lsm the dynamic vegetation scheme based on the parameter table needs to assign the same lai value to the same vegetation globally therefore high quality parameter table can guarantee the quality of the lai time series simulation to some extent however the lai simulation results cannot describe the spatial heterogeneity distribution of the lai of the same vegetation type wu et al 2021 we found that the lai obtained by dveg and obs scheme had better spatial heterogeneity however the dveg scheme tended to have a failure in the simulation of vegetation phenology for example the phenology of trees cannot be simulated correctly in some forest areas fig 1i a previous study by li et al obtained similar conclusions to ours i e the simulated lai tended to rapidly decreases to zero with incorrect phenology in the case of the ncar version of the noah mp lsm with dveg li et al 2022 a possible solution to this problem is to modify parameters in the dynamic vegetation model such as leaf turnover and mortality chen et al 2020b montané et al 2017 considering these parameters need to be obtained through a large number of high cost field measurements lemaire et al 2009 and it is difficult to ensure the universality of the measurement results under different climate and soil conditions the calibrations of dynamic vegetation models still face difficulties satellite observations provide a fast and low cost means to obtain lai for the lsms compared with tab and dveg scheme obs scheme can provide a spatiotemporally continuous lai that approximates the ground truth for the noah mp lsm therefore developing high quality satellite lai data and applying them to models are crucial for development of the noah mp lsm currently multiple satellite data have been used to improve the simulation performances of land surface processes in cldas developed by cma to provide more accurate weather forecasting and climate projection services to the public huang et al 2022b sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 here we improved the simulation performances of lst by lai satellite data in the noah mp lsm which is the main lsm in cldas we found that the cldas noah mp lsm underestimates the lst in china which is consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2021 compared with the original parameterization scheme dveg and tab in the noah mp lsm the new vegetation scheme obs based on satellite lai data improved negative bias in model simulations and reduces ubrmse relative to station observation although the improvement of the simulated lst for the dveg scheme by the obs scheme was not as pronounced as that for the tab scheme we emphasized that obs scheme can provide vegetation information including growth status and phenology closer to the ground truth conditions than the dveg scheme high quality lai information can provide accurate parameters for modelling surface hydrology and carbon cycle processes such as canopy interception and gross primary productivity niu et al 2011 xu et al 2021 therefore in addition to improving the lst simulation the vegetation scheme based on satellite lai data has the potential to improve the simulation of hydrological and carbon cycle processes in the noah mp lsm 4 2 biophysical mechanisms of lai on lst simulation in the noah mp lsm generally lai modulates local surface energy budget by affecting biophysical processes such as evapotranspiration albedo and roughness thereby regulating local lst forzieri et al 2020 here we quantified how the lai data affect modelling the surface energy budget in the noah mp lsm which explains the changes in lst the results suggest that lai affects lst mainly through modification of the albedo induced adsorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat le and h in the noah mp lsm which varies among the seasons and latitudes previous satellite observations have shown that the dense vegetation with higher lai tend to intercept and absorb more incoming radiation resulting in a lowered land surface albedo tian et al 2018 similarly we found that the decreased lai of dense vegetation such as forest and other woody vegetation can lead to higher albedo on the surface which absorbs less solar shortwave radiation thereby decreasing the lst in the noah mp lsm meanwhile the decreased lai of tall vegetation leads to higher aerodynamic resistance thereby weakening the turbulent heat transfer mainly sensible heat from the land surface to the atmosphere and increasing the lst in the noah mp lsm chen et al 2019 huang et al 2022a therefore for dense and tall vegetation the lai variation causes a competition between absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat flux which determines the direction of the lst variation in the noah mp lsm the decreased lai of sparse vegetation such as grassland leads to more soil being exposed in the noah mp lsm soil albedo is usually determined by soil factors such as soil color and moisture for a case lack of high quality soil color data the medium dark color index tends to be choose as default color index in the noah mp lsm corresponding to an albedo range of 0 09 0 18 which is significantly lower than that of grassland zheng et al 2019 the grassland with lower lai leads to more soil with lower albedo being exposed on the surface which absorbs more solar shortwave radiation thereby increasing the lst some studies have shown that changes in the lai of vegetation tend to change le flux significantly by affecting vegetation transpiration and soil moisture evaporation he et al 2021 zeng et al 2017 however we found that changes in lai of grassland had little effect on le flux in the noah mp lsm the grassland in china is mainly located in the arid semi arid regions where water supply limitation restricts vegetation evapotranspiration xiao et al 2013 therefore compared with the forest under more water supply conditions changes in lai of grassland have less effect on le flux in the noah mp lsm since the grassland vegetation is low with small leaves turbulent heat fluxes of grasslands are less affected by changes in lai moreover decreased ground heat flux due to decreased lai also leads to an increase in lst therefore the lai affects the lst simulation of low vegetation mainly through absorbed shortwave radiation change and ground heat flux change in the noah mp lsm 5 study limitations our study also has some limitations here we used advanced deep learning methods to reconstruct modis lai data to ensure the high quality of the input data however some studies have shown that there are some certain differences in the lai products retrieved by different sensors jiang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to further evaluate the impact of different satellite lai products and their fusion products on the noah mp lsm in this study we used the lst data from automatic weather stations for verification these stations are usually located in the open area with the natural vegetation which could represent the mean meteorology characteristics of a relative large area around this station however these stations may lack the ability to accurately characterize local microclimate zellweger et al 2020 thereby bringing uncertainty to the validation of the simulation results we further quantified how lai modulates local surface energy budget thereby regulating local lst simulation in the noah mp lsm however due to the lack of continuous and dense energy flux station observations the accuracy of our simulated energy flux for different vegetation schemes is currently unclear which requires further evaluation in addition we found that the combined effects of each energy component on the lst calculated by the dtm method are slightly different from the lst differences directly simulated by the lsm fig 7 the dtm method treats the h and le as two independent variables however during the parameterization of the model the h and le tend to have some correlation because they are calculated by the same biophysical parameters such as surface roughness in the lsm chen et al 2019 zeng et al 2017 therefore future work needs to introduce more sophisticated and comprehensive diagnostic methods to quantify the effects of each biophysical process on lst in the lsms 6 conclusion lai is essential for accurately modelling the lst and related energy budget in the lsms due to the lack of a parameterization scheme based on satellite lai in the cldas noah mp lsm it is unclear whether satellite lai data can improve the performances of the noah mp lsm to model lst here by using satellite lai data reconstructed by the advanced deep learning method we established a vegetation scheme of lai based on satellite data for the noah mp lsm we quantitatively evaluated simulation effects of different vegetation schemes on lai lst and their related energy budget in china from 2016 to 2018 we further revealed the mechanism of lai on lst simulation in the noah mp lsm by dtm method the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 compared with the satellite lai the lai obtained by original tab scheme lacked heterogeneity in spatial distribution and the original dveg scheme overestimated lai value and fails to model vegetation phenology at certain moments in general except for the cropland the lai of the vegetation in growing season observed by satellite was lower than that simulated by the noah mp lsm 2 validations based on 2304 automatic weather station in the vegetation covered area showed that the obs scheme improved underestimation of the lst simulated by the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme had the greatest improvement on the annual mean bias of the tab scheme and the annual mean bias was reduced by 0 32 c the obs scheme had lower ubrmse relative to observations across the entire spatiotemporal pattern than the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme had the greatest improvement on the annual mean ubrmse of the dveg scheme and the annual mean ubrmse was reduced by 0 17 c furthermore compared with the tab and dveg scheme the obs scheme improved the negative bias and high ubrmse of simulated lst of the four vegetation types including cropland grassland forest and other woody vegetation in the growing season 3 with the adoption of the new satellite lai based scheme sw h le and g simulated by the noah mp lsm tended to change in different directions leading to an overall increase in the net energy absorbed by the surface which is consistent with the changes in lst the results suggest that the lai changes of dense vegetation affect the lst simulation mainly through the competition of the absorbed shortwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes due to the comprehensive influence of exposed soil leaf features and water supply conditions the lai changes of sparse vegetation mainly affect the lst simulation mainly through the interaction of the absorbed shortwave radiation and ground heat flux credit authorship contribution statement anqi huang conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing runping shen

jiao et al 2016 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2021a however in recent years there has been a growing demand to meet the environmental sustainability standards for crop production in the context of food security and climate change the loess plateau of china is the cradle of dryland agriculture it is one of the most vulnerable agricultural areas with severe water and soil loss due to the less rainfall

al 2006 wang et al 2018b less rainfall requires plants to use stored soil water to survive and production resulting in a reduction in soil moisture in the soil profile the lack of soil water recharge

al 2020a wang et al 2020 the water consumption of maize is high compared to other crops such as spring wheat pea and faba bean therefore continuous production of maize in the semiarid northwest of china could lead to water depletion shangguan and zhang 2016 because maize roots rarely grow beyond 200 cm depth ren et al 2017 2018 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 most of the previous studies only

different crop management modes is beneficial to the sustainable utilization of farmland soil water which is very important for the sustainable production of crop in semi arid areas therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the long term effect of most common land use practices in the semiarid farmland on the loess plateau on soil desiccation in deep soil profile the extent of dsl formation was assessed by measuring the soil moisture and water balance in the soil profile and the outcomes of this study enhanced our understanding of soil desiccation intensity under different

maize was planted with drfm in late april and harvested in early october xie et al 2020 pea was sown in late april and harvested in mid july local farming techniques were practiced for the management of the crops crop growth relies on rainfall and no irrigation was applied monthly total precipitation from 2009 to 2020 for the different land use types of the study is given in fig 2 the depth of groundwater was below the depth of 38 40 m which limits any upward absorption of water by the root system peng et al 2020 wang et al 2021b xie et al 2020 the distances between the cultivation plots were kept as short as possible 1000 m for similar topographical conditions 2 3 sampling and measurements soil samples were collected with a soil auger 4 cm diameter to calculate soil water content swc from 0 cm to 1200 cm soil depth three random points were selected at 20 cm intervals from the middle of each plot or field the weight of the soil samples was determined immediately after sampling and the dry weight was determined after drying in a forced air oven at 105 until constant mass soil bulk density and field capacity soil water content at 0 03 mpa along soil profiles were not directly assessed in this study due to the practical difficulty of obtaining a large number of undisturbed sample cores from deep soil profiles wang et al 2015a b the average soil bulk density 1 20 g cm 3

results 3 1 precipitation and crop evapotranspiration there was a large variation in precipitation during 12 years fig 2 almost half of the total annual precipitation from october to september fell between july and september on average accumulated effective precipitation from march to september during 2009 2020 was 329 mm for all treatments while average crop evapotranspiration for long term

varied among different land use fig 4 swc under all land use types first decreased with the soil depth up to 600 cm depth and then increased under long term multi crop rotations continuous wheat and pea wheat rotation the swc of all soil layers was significantly higher than the stable soil water content fig 4a however under continuous high yield maize cultivation swc in the 500 600 cm soil layers were lower than the stable soil water content swc was also measured for continuous maize production under four n levels producing different yield fig 4b the average biomass yield was 8 9 14 8 20 1 and

rotation continuous wheat and continuous high yield maize was compared with pea wheat rotation fig 6a soil water was replenished in 0 280 cm soil layers under continuous multi crop rotations and in 0 180 cm soil layers under continuous wheat when compared with pea wheat rotation however high yielding maize production resulted in severe soil water depletion except in the 0 40 and 100 140 cm soil layers under continuous maize the relative soil water deficit increased with increasing the n rate fig 6b water deficit was observed in 600 760 and 860 1200 cm soil layers under n0 in 300 1200 cm soil profiles except for 800 840 cm under n100 and in 240 1200 soil layers under n200 and n300 fig 6b in continuous multi crop rotation continuous wheat and continuous high yielding maize the relative soil water deficit in the 0 1200 cm soil depth was 334 184 and 652 mm respectively compared to pea wheat rotation fig 7a the relative soil water deficit in the 0 1200 cm soil profile was 27 215 570 and 769 mm for maize under n0 n100 n200 and n300 respectively when compared to pea wheat rotation fig 7b the relative quantity of soil water deficit under all land uses was increased with the increase of soil depth fig 7c and d 3 4 soil desiccation indices soil desiccation index sdi varied among the land use types fig 8 under the multi crop rotations pea wheat rotation and continuous wheat types there was no dsl in the soil profile however continuous maize production for 12 years with high yield formed dsl in the 500 600 cm depth fig 8a the soil desiccation indices of continuous maize production under different n rates showed that the dsl formation was affected by the n rates dsl was observed in 680 700 and 980 1000 cm soil layers under n200 and in the 360 960 and 1000 1040 cm soil layers under n300 while no dsl was formed under no and low n rate n0 and n100 fig 8b in continuous high yielding maize the dried soil layer forming depth dslfd and dsl thickness was 500 cm and 100 cm respectively table 1 soil water deficit in dsl of continuous high yielding maize was 6 8 mm while the mean soil water content in the dsl was 12 5 for 12 year continuous high yielding maize the average formation rate of the dsl was 6 cm per year under 9 year continuous maize dslfd was 680 and 360 cm and the thickness of dsl was 40 and 640 cm under n200 and n300 respectively table 2 under n200 and n300 soil water deficit in the dsl was 0 92 and 31 5 mm the mean swc in the dsl was 13 1 and 12 3 and the average dsl formation rate was 4 4 and 57 8 cm year 1 respectively 4 discussion on the loess plateau maize has been widely planted in the past 30 years after the introduction of film mulching technology in the semiarid northwest of china but most observations of soil water balance dynamics were based on short term studies researchers paid a little attention to the formation of dry soil layer in deep soil layers 300 cm under long term continuous high yielding maize cultivation with high rate n fertilization our results showed that the different land use types had a considerable effect on the soil water content of the western loess plateau some earlier research also showed that land use type differentially affected the soil water content fan et al 2010 shangguan and zhang 2016 wang et al 2015b zhang and wang 2018 soil water content in multi crop rotations field was better in the top 280 cm layer than in other treatments fig 4a possibly due to surface soil moisture replenished during the rainy season i e july to september the rainfall might infiltrate into 200 cm of the soil layer in wet years in this region similarly ge et al 2020 showed that after transitioning from alfalfa to soybean glycine max soil water storage improved at an average rate of 35 8 mm per year m 1 in soil profiles from 0 500 cm and the highest soil water regeneration depth reached 660 cm soil layers in the northern part of the loess plateau continuous multi crop rotations continuous wheat cultivation and continuous wheat pea rotations have better soil water conditions in all soil layers than continuous maize cultivation with high yield in this study which is similar with other studies shangguan and zhang 2016 zhang and wang 2018 this is expected because maize has a high biomass yield compared to other crops i e wheat potato and pea particularly the high biomass yield under high n rate is accompanied by greater crop root growth in deeper soil layer and higher leaf area wang et al 2018b which increased soil water uptake in deep soil layers and subsequently enhances crop transpiration and water consumption wang et al 2018b wang et al 2017 the soil moisture under film mulched maize cultivation with no fertilizer and 100 and 200 kg n ha 1 was higher in the top 220 cm layer than in pea wheat rotation field fig 6b the possible mechanisms for greater soil water in the upper layer might be because the double ridges and furrows mulched with the plastic film system boosted the amount of rain collected during the rainy season and timely replenish topsoil water but it failed to fill soil water in deeper soil water these results suggest that continuous maize cultivation under plastic film mulching can maintain soil water balance in the 0 220 cm soil layers consistent with other studies on maize li et al 2020b xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b the soil water depletion under long term continuous maize cultivation with high yield was greater in deep soil layers than in topsoil figs 6 and 7 soil drying is not found in 40 60 cm soil layer under long term continuous high yielding maize cultivation the possible mechanisms might be because the rainfall is scarce in the early stage of maize growth april to june and thus maize s growth during the dry season i e the early growth stage of maize mainly depended on stored soil water which subsequently forced the plants to extract more water from deep soil to meet the water demand zhao et al 2020 meanwhile rainfall during the rainy season july to september could timely replenish topsoil water but it failed to fill soil water in deeper soil water wang et al 2021b 2022b therefore the soil water content on the surface was much higher than that of deep soil layers under long term continuous high yielding maize cultivation at harvest in the long run long term continuous maize cultivation with high yield produced severe soil dryness and formed a dried soil layer in deeper soil 400 900 cm depth fig 8 a similar response has been reported for spring maize in the southeast of the loess plateau with annual rainfall close to 550 mm their study demonstrated that soil water has declined due to 12 years of maize production especially in the 120 420 cm layer mainly because the insufficient rainfall cannot meet the needs of maize production and caused the problem of deep soil desiccation zhang et al 2021a because maize roots mainly grow in 0 200 cm soil layer ren et al 2017 2018 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2021a the possible mechanism for the greater water absorption in deep soil layers 200 cm might be due to the hydraulic lift effect of the root system which can drive the passive transport of soil water from the deep soil layers to the upper soil layers shen et al 2011 this phenomenon may be difficult to observe in short term experiments or simulation studies however the long term in situ experiments can magnify these phenomena by accumulating time scales while others have also observed similar results under different land use pattern wang et al 2015b for example under a mix of shrubland and orchard and a mix of shrubland and grassland root depths was 560 and 600 cm respectively but the dried soil layers reached 1800 and 880 cm soil depth wang et al 2015b however other studies found that maize production with plastic mulching increases soil moisture in the 0 300 cm soil layer therefore the authors proposed that the continuous maize production with plastic mulch has been proposed as a sustainable farming system that could maintain water balance in the semiarid northwest of china li et al 2020a li et al 2020b ren et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 this discrepancy in findings is due to the difference in the studied depth of soil because most of the previous studies reported the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water storage in the topsoil layer 300 cm between plastic film mulching and non mulching control the changes of soil water in deep soil moisture 300 cm was not accessed under these conditions depletion of soil water and the occurrence of dried soil layer could not be clearly observed overall from the analysis of long term experimental results our study suggests that long term maize monoculture with high fertilizer application did not appear to be a sustainable management practice on the loess plateau shangguan and zhang 2016 wang et al 2022b to maintain soil water balance farmers are encouraged to rotate maize with low water demanding crops such as spring wheat and pea especially in areas with rainfall less than 400 mm 5 conclusions due to the continuous and intensive cultivation of high water demanding crops such as maize the depletion of soil water and soil drying has become a concern in semiarid regions of china the present study demonstrated that long term continuous maize cultivation with high yield 20 mg ha 1 biomass under a high n rate i e 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 resulted in significant soil water depletion and formed a dried soil layer in deep soil profile 400 cm which was not found in other land use methods and continuous maize cultivation under lower n supply thus continuous intensification of maize production with high yield and high n rate under plastic film mulching system should not be viewed as a sustainable farming strategy for maintaining high yield in the long term therefore rotation of maize with low water demanding crops such as wheat and pea is recommended to maintain soil water balance and land productivity for high yielding maize production in the semiarid farmland on the loess plateau declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

al 2006 wang et al 2018b less rainfall requires plants to use stored soil water to survive and production resulting in a reduction in soil moisture in the soil profile the lack of soil water recharge leads to soil desiccation and formation of a dry soil layer dsl in the long run wang et al 2015a b dried soil layer forms due to negative water balance between low inputs and high outputs which causes soil degradation regional vegetation extinction and aridity wang et al 2008 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2011 in farmland ecosystem it alters water cycle processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum reducing grain yield and land productivity numerous studies have been conducted at various geographic and temporal scales showing a considerable impact of dsl on the plant growth soil water dynamics and deep soil water recharge liu et al 2010 wang et al 2015a b wang et al 2011 zhang and wang 2018 the extent and severity of soil desiccation vary with the farming system vegetation type root distribution pattern and stage of plant growth chen et al 2008 the dryland farming in the northwest of china is dominated by sole cropping of wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l and potato solanum tuberosum l as the main crops and lentil lens culinaris medik flax linum usitatissimum l faba bean vicia faba l pea pisum sativum l and millet setaria italica as the minor crops li et al 2020a niu et al 2020 peng et al 2020 maize plantations have been significantly increased in the western semiarid farmlands on the loess plateau after adopting double ridges and furrows mulching with plastic film drfm technique in the past decade gan et al 2013 li et al 2020a xie et al 2020 drfm has increased maize grain production and water use efficiency wue by 800 compared to non plastic mulching li et al 2020a wang et al 2020 the water consumption of maize is high compared to other crops such as spring wheat pea and faba bean therefore continuous production of maize in the semiarid northwest of china could lead to water depletion shangguan and zhang 2016 because maize roots rarely grow beyond 200 cm depth ren et al 2017 2018 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 most of the previous studies only assessed the dynamics of soil water in the 0 300 cm soil profile proposing that long term maize with drfm maintain high yield and water balance li et al 2020b ren et al 2021 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 however few studies have focused on the depletion of soil water in deeper soil layers 300 cm under long term maize cultivation understanding the soil water characteristics under different crop management modes is beneficial to the sustainable utilization of farmland soil water which is very important for the sustainable production of crop in semi arid areas therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the long term effect of most common land use practices in the semiarid farmland on the loess plateau on soil desiccation in deep soil profile the extent of dsl formation was assessed by measuring the soil moisture and water balance in the soil profile and the outcomes of this study enhanced our understanding of soil desiccation intensity under different cultivation practices in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this research was carried out at rainfed agricultural experiment station 35 28 n 104 44 e in gansu province of china at

maize was planted with drfm in late april and harvested in early october xie et al 2020 pea was sown in late april and harvested in mid july local farming techniques were practiced for the management of the crops crop growth relies on rainfall and no irrigation was applied monthly total precipitation from 2009 to 2020 for the different land use types of the study is given in fig 2 the depth of groundwater was below the depth of 38 40 m which limits any upward absorption of water by the root system peng et al 2020 wang et al 2021b xie et al 2020 the distances between the cultivation plots were kept as short as possible 1000 m for similar topographical conditions 2 3 sampling and measurements soil samples were collected with a soil auger 4 cm diameter to calculate soil water content swc from 0 cm to 1200 cm soil depth three random points were selected at 20 cm intervals from the middle of each plot or field the weight of the soil samples was determined immediately after sampling and the dry weight was determined after drying in a forced air oven at 105 until constant mass soil bulk density and field capacity soil water content at 0 03 mpa along soil profiles were not directly assessed in this study due to the practical difficulty of obtaining a large number of undisturbed sample cores from deep soil profiles wang et al 2015a b the average soil bulk density 1 20 g cm 3

results 3 1 precipitation and crop evapotranspiration there was a large variation in precipitation during 12 years fig 2 almost half of the total annual precipitation from october to september fell between july and september on average accumulated effective precipitation from march to september during 2009 2020 was 329 mm for all treatments while average crop evapotranspiration for long term wheat pea wheat rotation high yielding maize and multi crop rotations was 222 201 277 and 393 mm respectively fig 3 3 2 soil water content and water storage in soil profiles soil water content swc varied among different land use fig 4 swc under all land use types first decreased with the soil depth up to 600 cm depth and then increased under long term multi crop rotations continuous wheat and pea wheat rotation the swc of all soil layers was significantly higher than the stable soil water content fig 4a however under continuous high yield maize cultivation swc in the 500 600 cm soil layers were lower than the stable soil water content swc was also measured for continuous maize production under four n levels producing different yield fig 4b the average biomass yield was 8 9 14 8 20 1 and

rotation continuous wheat and continuous high yield maize was compared with pea wheat rotation fig 6a soil water was replenished in 0 280 cm soil layers under continuous multi crop rotations and in 0 180 cm soil layers under continuous wheat when compared with pea wheat rotation however high yielding maize production resulted in severe soil water depletion except in the 0 40 and 100 140 cm soil layers under continuous maize the relative soil water deficit increased with increasing the n rate fig 6b water deficit was observed in 600 760 and 860 1200 cm soil layers under n0 in 300 1200 cm soil profiles except for 800 840 cm under n100 and in 240 1200 soil layers under n200 and n300 fig 6b in continuous multi crop rotation continuous wheat and continuous high yielding maize the relative soil

mm for maize under n0 n100 n200 and n300 respectively when compared to pea wheat rotation fig 7b the relative quantity of soil water deficit under all land uses was increased with the increase of soil depth fig 7c and d 3 4 soil desiccation indices soil desiccation index sdi varied among the land use types fig 8 under the multi crop rotations pea wheat rotation and continuous wheat types there was no dsl in the soil profile however continuous maize production for 12 years with high yield formed dsl in the 500 600 cm depth fig 8a the soil desiccation indices of continuous maize production under different n rates showed that the dsl formation was affected by the n rates dsl was observed in 680 700 and 980 1000 cm soil layers under n200 and in the 360 960 and 1000 1040 cm soil layers under n300 while no dsl was formed under no and low n rate n0 and n100 fig 8b in continuous high yielding maize the dried soil layer forming depth dslfd and dsl thickness was 500 cm and 100 cm respectively table 1 soil water deficit in dsl of continuous high yielding maize was 6 8 mm while the mean soil water content in the dsl was 12 5 for 12 year continuous high yielding maize the average formation

water deficit in the dsl was 0 92 and 31 5 mm the mean swc in the dsl was 13 1 and 12 3 and the average dsl formation rate was 4 4 and 57 8 cm year 1 respectively 4 discussion on the loess plateau maize has been widely planted in the past 30 years after the introduction of film mulching technology in the semiarid northwest of china but most observations of soil water balance dynamics were based on short term studies researchers paid a little attention to the formation of dry soil layer in deep soil layers 300 cm under long term continuous high yielding maize cultivation with high rate n fertilization our results showed that the different land use types had a considerable effect on the soil water content of the western loess plateau some earlier research also showed that land use type differentially affected the soil water content fan et al 2010 shangguan and zhang 2016 wang et al 2015b zhang and wang 2018 soil water content in multi crop rotations field was better in the top 280 cm layer than in other treatments fig 4a possibly due to surface soil moisture replenished during the rainy season i e july to september the rainfall might infiltrate into 200 cm of the soil layer in wet years in this region similarly ge et al 2020 showed that after transitioning from alfalfa to soybean glycine max soil water storage improved at an average rate of 35 8 mm per year m 1 in soil profiles from 0 500 cm and the highest soil water regeneration depth reached 660 cm soil layers in the northern part of the loess plateau continuous multi crop rotations continuous wheat cultivation and continuous wheat pea rotations have better soil water conditions in all soil layers than continuous maize cultivation with high yield in this study which is similar with other studies shangguan and zhang 2016 zhang and wang 2018 this is expected because maize has a high biomass yield compared to other crops i e wheat potato and pea particularly the high biomass yield under high n rate is accompanied by greater crop root growth in deeper soil layer and higher leaf area wang et al 2018b which increased soil water uptake in deep soil layers and subsequently enhances crop transpiration and water consumption wang et al 2018b wang et al 2017 the soil moisture under film mulched maize cultivation with no fertilizer and 100 and 200 kg n ha 1 was higher in the top 220 cm layer than in pea wheat rotation field fig 6b the possible mechanisms for greater soil water in the upper layer might be because the double ridges and furrows mulched with the plastic film system boosted the amount of rain collected during the rainy season and timely replenish topsoil water but it failed to fill soil water in deeper soil water these results suggest that continuous maize cultivation under plastic film mulching can maintain soil water balance in the 0 220 cm soil layers consistent with other studies on maize li et al 2020b xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b the soil water depletion under long term continuous maize cultivation with high yield was greater in deep soil layers than in topsoil figs 6 and 7 soil drying is not found in 40 60 cm soil layer under long term continuous high yielding maize cultivation the possible mechanisms might be because the rainfall is scarce in the early stage of maize growth april to june and thus maize s growth during the dry season i e the early growth stage of maize mainly depended on stored soil water which subsequently forced the plants to extract more water from deep soil to meet the water demand zhao et al 2020 meanwhile rainfall during the rainy season july to september could timely replenish topsoil water but it failed to fill soil water in deeper soil water wang et al 2021b 2022b therefore the soil water content on the surface was much higher than that of deep soil layers under long term continuous high yielding maize cultivation at harvest in the long run long term continuous maize cultivation with high yield produced severe soil dryness and formed a dried soil layer in deeper soil 400 900 cm depth fig 8 a similar response has been reported for spring maize in the southeast of the loess plateau with annual rainfall close to 550 mm their study demonstrated that soil water has declined due to 12 years of maize production especially in the 120 420 cm layer mainly because the insufficient rainfall cannot meet the needs of maize production and caused the problem of deep soil desiccation zhang et al 2021a because maize roots mainly grow in 0 200 cm soil layer ren et al 2017 2018 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2021a the possible mechanism for the greater water absorption in deep soil layers 200 cm might be due to the hydraulic lift effect of the root system which can drive the passive transport of soil water from the deep soil layers to the upper soil layers shen et al 2011 this phenomenon may be difficult to observe in short term experiments or simulation studies however the long term in situ experiments can magnify these phenomena by accumulating time scales while others have also observed similar results under different land use pattern wang et al 2015b for example under a mix of shrubland and orchard and a mix of shrubland and grassland root depths was 560 and 600 cm respectively but the dried soil layers reached 1800 and 880 cm soil depth wang et al 2015b however other studies found that maize production with plastic mulching increases soil moisture in the 0 300 cm soil layer therefore the authors proposed that the continuous maize production with plastic mulch has been proposed as a sustainable farming system that could maintain water balance in the semiarid northwest of china li et al 2020a li et al 2020b ren et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 this discrepancy in findings is due to the difference in the studied depth of soil because most of the previous studies reported the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water storage in the topsoil layer 300 cm between plastic film mulching and non mulching control the changes of soil water in deep soil moisture 300 cm was not accessed under these conditions depletion of soil water and the occurrence of dried soil layer could not be clearly observed overall from the analysis of long term experimental results our study suggests that long term maize monoculture with high fertilizer application did not appear to be a sustainable management practice on the loess plateau shangguan and zhang 2016 wang et al 2022b to maintain soil water balance farmers are encouraged to rotate maize with low water demanding crops such as spring wheat and pea especially in areas with rainfall less than 400 mm 5 conclusions due to the continuous and intensive cultivation of high water demanding crops such as maize the depletion of soil water and soil drying has become a concern in semiarid regions of china the present study demonstrated that long term continuous maize cultivation with high yield 20 mg ha 1 biomass under a high n rate i e 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 resulted in significant soil water depletion and formed a dried soil layer in deep soil profile 400 cm which was not found in other land use methods and continuous maize cultivation under lower n supply thus continuous intensification of maize production with high yield and high n rate under plastic film mulching system should not be viewed as a sustainable farming strategy for maintaining high yield in the long term therefore rotation of maize with low water demanding crops such as wheat and pea is recommended to maintain soil water balance and land productivity for high yielding maize production in the semiarid farmland on the loess plateau declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
