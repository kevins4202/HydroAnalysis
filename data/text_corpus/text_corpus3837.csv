19185,due to the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species and discrepancy in the binding sites of humic acid ha the mechanisms involved in ha removal were significantly different in inorganic particle removal based on the background the coagulation behavior of in situ and performed hydrolyzed aluminum species for the removal of ha was investigated for alcl3 the maximum ha removal reached at weak acidic conditions where various in situ hydrolyzed al species containing al1 to al20 cores with different amounts of water molecules were present various al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability for weak binding sites meanwhile most of the binding sites are occupied by the aluminum ion which brought about better complexation capacity with the al species therefore the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species played important roles in the removal of ha compared with alcl3 preformed al13 had less efficient in ha removal because the zeta potential of ha formed by preformed al13 with uniform al species increased from negative to positive with increase in al13 dosage this study provided new insight into the interaction between ha and various hydrolyzed al species graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic acids aluminum hydrolysis synergistic effects complexation capacity 1 introduction coagulation is a widely applied unit process for removing particles and organic matter during the treatment of drinking water xu et al 2010 earlier research suggested coagulation mechanisms including double layer compression and adsorption neutralization for explaining inorganic particles destabilization black and chen 1965 singley et al 1971 packham 1963 proposed that sweep coagulation occurred with formation of amorphous aluminum hydroxides in 1963 prior to the 1960s many investigations dealt with removing color from water to improve its aesthetic value the research object of coagulation gradually focused on removing humic acid ha from water when it was discovered that the reaction of ha with free chlorine produced thms and other by products in 1970s randtke 1988 people have realized that the mechanisms involved in ha removal were significantly different inorganic particle removal therefore many researchers made great efforts to explain the difference between coagulation of ha and inorganic particle and found that complexation reaction was an important in the coagulation process based on traditional theory angelico et al 2014 benschoten and edzwald 1990 cheng and chi 2002 lin et al 2014 lu et al 1999 however most studies still used the traditional coagulation mechanisms to explain the reaction between ha and aluminium salts as is well known ha is a complex matrix of a heterogeneous mixture of organic substances with a high content of functional groups including carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh and carbonyl c o groups bahemmat et al 2016 the distribution of binding sites in ha could change due to differences in the type number and positions of functional group substituents on the benzene ring obviously traditional theory was inapplicable to ha removal as charges of inorganic particles are uniform under certain conditions which result in simplex interaction with hydrolyzed aluminum species according to physical chemistry these binding sites could act as lewis base in solution the stronger lewis base of binding site is the greater reactivity to form the complex through coordinate bond so the binding site in ha with higher affinity could preferentially react with al salts almost no research has been performed to investigate the reaction behaviour between ha and al salts from the viewpoint of the discrepancy in the binding sites of humic acid on the other hand aluminum salts coagulant can be hydrolyzed to different dissolved species in aqueous solution which play significant roles in removing ha during hydrolysis of alcl3 the hydrolyzed species included ala mainly monomeric species dimers trimers and some small polymers alb mainly al13o4 oh 24 7 often denoted al13 and alc mainly al oh 3 yan et al 2007 this spontaneous hydrolysis process is referred to as in situ hydrolysis various hydrolyzed aluminum species are formed by in situ hydrolysis of aluminum chloride resulting in diverse affinities and complexation capacity between ha and al species it can therefore be assumed that various al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability for weak binding sites which improves coagulation efficiency however few studies have considered the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species and investigated the difference affinity and complexation capacity between ha and aluminum due to the protonation deprotonation characteristics of functional groups and in situ hydrolysis of aluminum although many studies claimed polyaluminum chloride pacl to be superior to traditional aluminum coagulants in terms of turbidity and natural organic matter nom removal yan et al 2008a tang and luan 1995 few studies have considered the limitations of simplex preformed al species and the difference of coagulation behavior between preformed al species and alcl3 al13 was regarded as the most active species in pacl responsible for coagulation xu et al 2011 although the charge of preformed al13 was high the affinities to bind with all binding sites were almost equal in view of this point it can be deduced that preformed al13 first bound with strong binding sites which result in partial supersaturation of sites and charge reversal and less efficient in ha removal therefore the distinct performances of preformed al13 and in situ generated al species during coagulation needs further investigation to gain better understanding of the coagulation behaviour of in situ hydrolyzed and preformed al species 27al nmr and electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy esi ms were applied to investigate the distribution and performance of al species of preformed al13 and alcl3 at different ph during the coagulation process differential absorbance spectroscopy das was employed to quantitatively study ha al interactions with changes in al dosage and ph to investigate the reactivity of ha with coagulants py gc ms was used to monitor the different compounds of ha removed by preformed al13 and alcl3 based on experimental data this study provides insight into coagulation mechanisms for ha removal by al13 and alcl3 at different ph values 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents humic acid was obtained from sigma aldrich stock ha solution was prepared by adding 1 g ha into 1 l 0 1 mol l naoh solution after stirring for 12 h the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to remove suspended materials for the preparation of al13 pacl was adopted as the primary material a 100 ml 1 36 mol l alcl3 6h2o solution was titrated slowly with 240 ml of 1 36 mol l naoh solution within 5 h under rapid stirring conditions after preparation the solutions were set for at least 24 h of aging at room temperature polyaluminum chloride solution with a concentration of 0 4 mol l and basicity of 2 4 was obtained the purification of al13 was carried out using sulfate precipitation from pacl shi et al 2007 xu et al 2003 pacl solution 25 ml and naso4 1 4204 g were transferred into a colorimetric tube and diluted to 50 ml with deionised water after 24 h of reaction the samples were filtered and dried for 24 h the filtrates were then collected and sealed in a glass bottle to obtain a soluble al13 product 0 4 g of solid was placed in a 200 ml glass beaker then 95 2 ml water and 4 8 ml 0 306 mol l ba no3 2 were added under intense agitation for 3 h the insoluble product and soluble al13 were separated by filtering through a 0 45 μm membrane the filtrate al concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry 2 2 jar test procedure coagulation studies were performed in a conventional jar test apparatus equipped with six 1 l beakers the stock ha solution was diluted with ionized water to reach the designated concentration of dissolved organic matter doc 10 mg l aluminum chloride alcl3 6h2o and purified al13 were used in the study the calculated volumes of coagulant to achieve the required dosage and 0 1 m tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate ch3 4noh 5h2o tma solutions to achieve the required ph were added to the ha doc 10 mg l solution tma was more useful than naoh as base this was because while recording the esi mass spectra sodium formed several intense nacl aggregate signals that interfered with the interpretation of the spectra sarpola et al 2004 the coagulation procedure involved rapid mixing at 200 rpm for 1 min followed by slow stirring at 20 rpm for 30 min after 50 s approximately 10 ml solution was collected the corresponding absorbance spectra were then recorded on a persee tu 1901 uv vis spectrophotometer at wavelengths 200 600 nm in addition approximately 30 ml of the solution was taken to determine the zeta potential by a laser doppler electrophoresis apparatus malvern zetasizer 90 uk a 60 min settling period followed flocs were separated from the solution by centrifugation and lyophilised for solid 2 7al nmr analysis the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm

statistically compare the data of the experiment an analysis of variance anova at the p 0 05 significance level was conducted using ibm spss statistics software version 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal characteristics of ha by alcl3 and preformed al13 the removal efficiencies of ha by alcl3 and preformed al13 as functions of ph and dosage are shown in fig 1 the removal trends throughout the ph range investigated by alcl3 were similar the removal efficiency of doc increased significantly with increase in alcl3 dosage p 0 05 table s1 and reached a steady state when the dosage was above the optimal dosage p 0 05 table s1 however ph significantly affected the coagulation efficiency at optimal dosage of 6 mg l the removal increased first and then decreased as the ph increased the maximum removal was reached at around ph 5 7 which was above 80 preformed al13 and alcl3 exhibited distinct coagulation behaviours in terms of doc removal as shown in fig 1 the removal efficiency of doc of ha increased first and then decreased with dosage increased at ph 4 6 p 0 05 table s2 at acidic conditons the dosage at 4 mg l contributed to the maximal doc removal which was approximately 72 3 78 9 and 74 1 at ph 4 5 and 6 respectively therefore al13 was less dependent on ph for removing doc due to the presence of relatively stable aluminum species under acidic conditions the coagulation performances at ph 7 and ph 8 were similar doc removal increased with al dosage p 0 05 table s2 and then approached a plateau p 0 05 table s2 and the doc removal was much efficient than that under acidic conditions when the aluminum dosage reached concentrations above 4 mg l to investigate the compounds of ha removed by coagulation the properties of the pyrolysis volatiles of ha flocs formed by alcl3 and al13 coagulants at ph 5 and ph 7 were investigated fig s1 shows the pyrolysis chromatogram for each of the samples and their identified pyrolysis products are listed in table s3 s6 the relative contents of the main compound groups are presented in fig 2 the compositions of pyrolysis volatiles are divided into ten main groups polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons mah aliphatic hydrocarbons ah nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds nhp hydrocarbon derivatives hd esters amides furans nitriles and others as shown in fig 2 aromatics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were the most abundant products that were the main structural components of ha compared to alcl3 coagulant there were relatively higher contents of aromatics esters and amides and lower contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives with al13 these results indicated that esters and amides were most efficiently removed by al13 while aliphatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives were most efficiently removed by alcl3 the significant quantitative differences were heterocyclic n containing compounds furans and nitriles heterocyclic n containing compounds were more abundant in alcl3 samples 5 5 at ph 5 6 at ph 7 than in al13 samples 1 5 at ph 5 0 at ph 7 furan was particularly scarce in al13 sample 0 9 at ph 5 when compared to the alcl3 sample 6 6 at ph 5 nitrile accounted for 3 3 was detected only in the al13 sample at ph 5 which indicated the selective removal of nitrile by al13 heterocyclic n containing compounds and furan were selectively removed from ha solution by alcl3 coagulant 3 2 characteristics of in situ aluminum hydrolysis and coagulation behaviours ph has a great effect on the distribution of al species to investigate the effect of al species on the coagulation process esi ms spectra of alcl3 before and after coagulation with ph variation at dosage 6 mg l are shown in fig 3 all the aluminum complexes identified in this study are generally described as alxoy oh z h2o m 2y z 3x before coagulation at ph 4 0 signals at m z values 103 20 44 121 100 139 80 2 157 49 8 and 175 14 52 dominated the esi ms spectra these signals were assigned to the dimeric aluminum species al2o2 oh h2o 0 4 charged complexes with al1 cores m z 99 115 and 133 al3 cores m z 163 181 199 217 and 253 and al4 cores m z 81 99 and 105 were also detected in the spectra at ph 5 0 the aluminum salts further hydrolyzed and the aluminum speciation distribution changed significantly the multi charged al13 complex series m z 328 337 355 213 219 225 had the most intense signal series a series of polymers containing al2 al4 al5 al9 and al10 cores was also observed in the spectra at ph 5 0 when the ph was raised to 6 0 the signals of aluminum compounds decreased because of the formation of al oh 3 the dimeric species m z 121 139 157 and 175 were the dominant species again in the spectrum at ph 7 0 amorphous al oh 3 was formed and the total ions decreased the dimeric species m z 103 121 and 139 were still the dominant species in the spectrum according to the esi ms results discussed above the aluminum species were classified into five categories as follows monomeric and dimeric aluminum species al1 al2 small polymeric aluminum species al3 al5 median polymeric aluminum species al6 al10 large polymeric aluminum species al11 al20 and undetected part i e al oh 3 and or al oh 4 zhao et al 2009a the distribution of aluminum species before and after coagulation at different ph values are illustrated in table 1 as shown in table 1 before coagulation the monomeric and dimeric aluminum and small polymeric aluminum species decreased with the increase of ph which was due to hydrolysis to form larger polymer or al oh 3 median polymer and large polymer increased firstly and reached maximum at ph 5 then decreased when the ph value was higher than 5 undetected part mainly included al oh 3 and al oh 4 the content of undetected part increased and reached maximum of 90 56 at ph 7 due to formation of al oh 3 after coagulation fig 3 the aluminum speciation distribution changed significantly at ph 4 6 the number of ion peaks with higher m z reduced remarkably and relative intensity also decreased for example the polymeric aluminum species al14 al15 al16 and al17 were diminished and al13 species decreased significantly in the spectra at ph 5 meanwhile the relative content of large polymer decreased significantly from 43 56 to 6 56 table 1 under acidic conditions the removal of ha led to the complexation reaction between soluble cations and the functional groups of ha this indicated that large polymeric species played an important role in the complexation reaction similar spectra were achieved before and after coagulation at ph 7 as shown in table 1 the contents of different aluminium species before and after coagulation were quite similar this can be attributed to the formation of al oh 3 s as sweep coagulation occurred this could be compared favourably to our previous investigations jin et al 2018 which demonstrated that dosed al remained unreacted until the dosage was increased to a critical value to form amorphous al oh 3 at ph 7 to further identify aluminum speciation during coagulation ha flocs formed by alcl3 coagulant at ph 5 and ph 7 were collected and freeze dried to obtain solid state 27al nmr fig 4 the spectrum exhibited two distinctive resonances at about 2 ppm and 64 ppm at ph 5 fig 4 the strong peak at 2 ppm corresponded to octahedrally coordinated aluminum many researchers have stated that this shift corresponds to free al dimers or complexed al monomers and dimers zhao et al 2009b the 64 ppm signal was assigned to the tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum at the centre of al13 whose chemical shift was reported to be in the 61 64 ppm range depending on the conditions of formation and aging liu et al 2009 signals from the other 12 shell structured octahedral al in al were too broad to be detected by 27al nmr analysis as a result the concentration of al13 in the nmr result needed to be multiplied by thirteen hiradate and yamaguchi 2003 therefore even though it seemed that the peak at 64 ppm had weak resonance it was reasonable to confirm that the al13 structure existed in the flocs formed by alcl3 therefore the possible al species within the flocs were al13 polymer monomeric and dimeric aluminum this suggested that the in situ formed al13 and other hydrolyzed al species could complex with ha and precipitate subsequently as flocs namely in situ al13 and other hydrolyzed al species played synergistic effects in the removal of ha as shown in fig 4 the two spectra of al oh 3 s and ha flocs formed at ph 7 ha al oh 3 appeared similar the peak at 2 4 ppm is assigned to alo6 octahedral coordination 35 ppm to alo5 pentahedral coordination and 65 ppm to alo4 tetragonal coordination isobe et al 2003 rämö et al 2008 proposed that humic substances can be incorporated into al oh 3 s crystal to form solid state hs al complexes which give rise to new 27al nmr signals this study did not detect any new signals indicating that soluble aluminum species hardly reacted with ha and adsorption of ha by al oh 3 s was the main mechanism at ph 7 this observation is highly consistent with the results of esi ms and verifies the proposed coagulation mechanism at ph 7 3 3 hydrolzed species and coagulation behaviors of preformed al13 3 3 1 esi ms spectra of preformed al13 at different ph values al13 species can be relatively stable after dosing in water as compared to alcl3 hydrolysis the esi ms spectra of al13 in the ph range 4 0 8 0 are shown in fig s2 as shown in fig s2 the al13 species at m z 328 m z 337 m z 355 m z 364 m z 373 m z 219 m z 225 m z 231 and m z 237 dominated the spectra at ph 4 0 8 0 the total ion count tic value was 1 0 107 under acidic conditions ph 4 0 6 0 with ph value increased to 7 0 and 8 0 the total ions reduced probably due to the formation of species undetected by esi ms e g amorphous hydroxide solids the tic values for the same species decreased to 3 0 105 and 2 0 105 although some of the aluminum species formed undetected species al13 was still the dominant species this was similar to the results of rämö et al regarding the speciation of highly basic polyaluminum rämö et al 2008 polynuclear al13 is a keggin al13 7 cation alo4 al oh 2 12 7 or al13o4 oh 24 7 where the tetrahedral alo4 central unit is surrounded by twelve octahedral alo6 units in which the hydroxo groups are attached to the vertices of the octahedra al13 detected in the esi ms spectra is a species of forced hydrolysis formed by the addition of alkali alcl3 could generate the al13 polycation in situ by a spontaneous hydrolysis process the following studies were carried out to investigate coagulation behaviors of preformed al13 in order to compare the reactivity characteristics and mechanism of ha with in situ hydrolyzed and preformed al species 3 3 2 coagulation behaviors of preformed al13 based on esi ms results of preformed al13 the major detected aluminum species were the same al13 species as those at ph 4 0 8 0 thus we chose ph 5 and ph 7 as typical ph values to compare the esi ms spectra before and after coagulation fig 5 as shown in fig 5 after coagulation the aluminum speciation distribution was different from the initial al13 species the number of al13 ion peaks reduced remarkably and the relative intensity also decreased at ph 5 the peaks moved to a lower m z range and al13 also reduced al2 m z 103 121 139 and 157 al7 m z 117 123 129 and 135 and al8 m z 137 149 155 and 167 species dominated the spectra a series of small polymers containing al4 al5 al6 and al10 species was also observed in the spectra after coagulation there were similar changes at ph 7 it indicated that al13 was not stable and decomposed into oligomeric and median polymeric species during coagulation this could be compared favourably with the results of hiradate and yamaguchi 2003 who observed that tetrahedral al in al ha complexes gradually converted to octahedral al indicating that al in al ha complexes decomposed to al ha complexes with reaction time 3 4 complexation capacities of alcl3 and al13 with ha ha is a major light absorbing component in natural waters in the 200 800 nm range the wide variety of light absorbing functional groups chromophores in ha and the possible presence of complex intramolecular interactions result in absorbance spectra that are broad and featureless differential absorbance spectroscopy das is useful for detecting very subtle changes in nom chemistry and has high sensitivity with low sample pretreatment dryer et al 2008 in prior research this technique has successfully been used to quantify nom metal interactions changes in the spectral slope in the range of wavelengths 325 375 nm dslope325 375 in differential log transformed absorbance spectra can be used to characterise the complexation between nom and metal ions yan et al 2013 dslope325 375 parameters are given below zhou and meng 2016 d s l o p e 325 375 s l o p e 325 375 i s l o p e 325 375 ref where slope325 375 i is the slope of a straight line from 325 to 375 nm in the log transformed absorbance at different aluminium concentrations and slope325 375 ref represents the parameter in the absence of aluminum changes in the spectral parameters of dslope325 375 from ha by alcl3 and al13 at different ph values as functions of the total concentration of added al are shown in fig 6 the dslope325 375 changes in ha because alcl3 and al13 had distinctly different characteristics for alcl3 it was observed that the dslope325 375 value positively correlated with the dosed aluminium in acidic conditions moreover the curve increased rapidly p 0 05 table s7 and then gradually reached steady states p 0 05 table s7 at an al concentration of 6 mg l the maximum dslope325 375 value was reached at ph 5 followed by ph 6 and ph 4 the corresponding dslope325 375 value were 0 0019 0 0024 and 0 0021 at ph 4 5 and 6 respectively at ph 7 the dslope325 375 value was obviously lower than 0 0006 and there was no significant variation with increase in dosage p 0 05 table s7 for al13 the whole change trends of dslope325 375 were similar in the range of ph 4 8 the value of dslope325 375 increased and subsequently decreased when the al13 dosage increased p 0 05 table s8 while the dosage required to reach the maximum dslope325 375 at ph 7 was higher than that in acidic conditions dslope325 375 was independent of ha concentration and provided the extent of metal dom binding yan et al 2013 based on the above results the complexation reaction characteristics of alcl3 and al13 with ha were significantly different for alcl3 higher value of dslope325 375 indicated that high reactivity between ha and al occurred at ph 7 the best degree of complexation was reached at ph 5 0 by contrast the added aluminum hardly reacted with ha at ph 7 however complexation occurred between ha and al13 coagulant at all ph values tested 3 5 mechanisms of ha removal by alcl3 and al13 3 5 1 continuous multiligand distribution model to evaluate metal binding sites in humic materials continuous multiligand distribution model have been reported elsewhere dobbs et al 1989 grimm et al 1991 and shown in supporting information the normal distribution curves of binding site at different ph values are shown in fig 7 the abscissa and ordinate in fig 7 refer to the conditional stability constant and lb lt respectively aluminum binding site distributions in humic materials were distinct at different ph levels the higher the proton concentration the weaker the effective complex formation strengths and the narrower the effective width of the distribution of the binding sites under acidic conditions the binding site distribution gradually agreed with the normal distribution and the effective width of binding site distribution increased progressively with ph increased this indicated that the binding sites occupied by metal ions increased as the ph increased from 3 to 6 the area under the upper curve in the graph represented the amount of binding sites at low ph a significant portion of binding sites was occupied by protons al3 ions competed with protons to form complexes the proton migration of functional groups reduced due to the large proton concentration in solution therefore most of the binding sites were occupied by protons as the ph increased al3 was more strongly bound to the binding sites as the deprotonation of functional groups increased most of the binding sites are occupied by the metal ion therefore the amount of bound aluminum reached maximum at ph 5 6 at ph 7 the distribution of the binding sites appeared broader and the binding sites occupied by metal ions decreased in addition the conditional stability constants at ph 5 0 was much larger than that at ph 7 0 which proved that aluminum ions tended to combine with the functional groups on the ha molecules and form al ha complexes at ph 5 0 3 5 2 analysis of mechanisms the reactivity characteristics and mechanism of humic acid with alcl3 and performed al13 can be interpreted as shown in fig 8 as is well known the removal of ha was due to complexation between aluminum ions and ha under acidic conditions jin et al 2018 alcl3 can be hydrolyzed to various al species in aqueous solution depending on the ph the distributions of binding site in ha could be change due to protonation deprotonation of functional groups of ha therefore the coagulation efficiency was attributed to differences in al species and the amount of aluminum bound to ha for alcl3 the dominating al species at ph 4 were dimer monomer and other oligomers which had a certain complexation ability and ha removal although the charge of the dimer was not as high as that of al13 the charge per al ion in the dimer was higher than that in al13 yan et al 2008b the maximum level of ha removal was reached at ph 5 to 6 which was higher than that for preformed al13 at ph 5 6 alcl3 hydrolyzed to form various aluminum species including dimer small polymer larger polymer i e in situ al13 and so on due to the diversity of the hydrolyzed al species and discrepancy in the binding site distributions of ha the binding sites of ha with different affinities selectively bound with diverse al species which increased the complexing probability of the binding sites of ha yan et al 2007 concluded that the removal of unsatisfied coordinate bonds of organic matter correlated with the content of alb mainly al13 while the removal of aromatic compounds uv254 was determined by the content of alc mainly al oh 3 zhao et al 2009b concluded that monomer aluminum was preferentially bound to polysaccharides and cellulosic molecules whereas preformed al13 species selectively bound to carboxylic groups at ph 6 0 in addition complexation capacity of alcl3 was higher than that of al13 at the optimum dosage the values of dslope325 375 for alcl3 and al13 were determined to be 0 0024 and 0 0020 respectively therefore the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed al species with higher complexation capacity played important roles in removing ha at ph 5 6 according to py gc ms analysis compared to the alcl3 sample the products of the al13 sample had a higher content of aromatics at ph 5 as a result relatively lower proportions of other compounds in ha could be removed by the al13 coagulant moreover performed al13 could gradually be converted to octahedral al during coagulation and had less complexation capacity with ha affecting coagulation efficiency fig s3 shows the zeta potential at different al13 dosage at ph 5 for preformed al13 the zeta potential increased sharply at lower dosage and shifted to the positive region with increase in al13 dosage therefore preformed al13 with high positive charges could not completely neutralise the negative binding sites of ha with lower charge density this resulted in charge reversal and the formation of electrostatic patches the higher degree of binding consumed or covered some of the binding sites which made it difficult for flocs to aggregate alb could thus destabilise the particles efficiently to form aggregates however it could not form flocs that were large enough to settle efficiently and remained mostly in colloidal form yan et al 2007 the coagulation mechanisms of ha by alcl3 were distinctly different from those of al13 at ph 7 for alcl3 al oh 3 were the major species and some oligomers were also formed however most oligomers did not react with ha and almost all ha was removed via sweep flocculation therefore the dominant coagulation mechanism was the adsorption of ha on amorphous al oh 3 for alcl3 the value of dslope325 375 for preformed al13 indicated that complexation occurred between ha and preformed al13 therefore complexation and sweep coagulation were involved in the coagulation of ha by al13 these resulted in higher ha removal efficiency obtained at ph 7 in al13 coagulation 4 conclusions in this study the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminum hydrolysis and coagulation behavior of in situ and preformed al species for the removal humic acid ha were investigated for alcl3 the doc removal was strongly related to the ph values the maximum ha removal reached at weak acidic conditions where various in situ hydrolyzed al species containing al1 to al20 cores with different amounts of water molecules were present meanwhile the binding site distributions of ha were distinct with variations in ph which brought about different affinities with the al species because of the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminium species and discrepancy in the binding sites of ha various al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability therefore the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminium species played important roles in the removal of ha compared with alcl3 al13 was less dependent on ph to remove ha due to the simplex preformed al species under weak acidic conditions the zeta potential of ha formed by preformed al13 increased from negative to positive with increase in al13 dosage resulting in charge reversal and partial supersaturation of sites as a result ha was removed inefficiently moreover al13 could gradually be converted to octahedral al during coagulation and had less complexation capacity with ha affecting coagulation efficiency acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the national key technology support program

19185,due to the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species and discrepancy in the binding sites of humic acid ha the mechanisms involved in ha removal were significantly different in inorganic particle removal based on the background the coagulation behavior of in situ and performed hydrolyzed aluminum species for the removal of ha was investigated for alcl3 the maximum ha removal reached at weak acidic conditions where various in situ hydrolyzed al species containing al1 to al20 cores with different amounts of water molecules were present various al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability for weak binding sites meanwhile most of the binding sites are occupied by the aluminum ion which brought about better complexation capacity with the al species therefore the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species played important roles in the removal of ha compared with alcl3 preformed al13 had less efficient in ha removal because the zeta potential of ha formed by preformed al13 with uniform al species increased from negative to positive with increase in al13 dosage this study provided new insight into the interaction between ha and various hydrolyzed al species graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic acids aluminum hydrolysis synergistic effects complexation capacity 1 introduction coagulation is a widely applied unit process for removing particles and organic matter during the treatment of drinking water xu et al 2010 earlier research suggested coagulation mechanisms including double layer compression and adsorption neutralization for explaining inorganic particles destabilization black and chen 1965 singley et al 1971 packham 1963 proposed that sweep coagulation occurred with formation of amorphous aluminum hydroxides in 1963 prior to the 1960s many investigations dealt with removing color from water to improve its aesthetic value the research object of coagulation gradually focused on removing humic acid ha from water when it was discovered that the reaction of ha with free chlorine produced thms and other by products in 1970s randtke 1988 people have realized that the mechanisms involved in ha removal were significantly different inorganic particle removal therefore many researchers made great efforts to explain the difference between coagulation of ha and inorganic particle and found that complexation reaction was an important in the coagulation process based on traditional theory angelico et al 2014 benschoten and edzwald 1990 cheng and chi 2002 lin et al 2014 lu et al 1999 however most studies still used the traditional coagulation mechanisms to explain the reaction between ha and aluminium salts as is well known ha is a complex matrix of a heterogeneous mixture of organic substances with a high content of functional groups including carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh and carbonyl c o groups bahemmat et al 2016 the distribution of binding sites in ha could change due to differences in the type number and positions of functional group substituents on the benzene ring obviously traditional theory was inapplicable to ha removal as charges of inorganic particles are uniform under certain conditions which result in simplex interaction with hydrolyzed aluminum species according to physical chemistry these binding sites could act as lewis base in solution the stronger lewis base of binding site is the greater reactivity to form the complex through coordinate bond so the binding site in ha with higher affinity could preferentially react with al salts almost no research has been performed to investigate the reaction behaviour between ha and al salts from the viewpoint of the discrepancy in the binding sites of humic acid on the other hand aluminum salts coagulant can be hydrolyzed to different dissolved species in aqueous solution which play significant roles in removing ha during hydrolysis of alcl3 the hydrolyzed species included ala mainly monomeric species dimers trimers and some small polymers alb mainly al13o4 oh 24 7 often denoted al13 and alc mainly al oh 3 yan et al 2007 this spontaneous hydrolysis process is referred to as in situ hydrolysis various hydrolyzed aluminum species are formed by in situ hydrolysis of aluminum chloride resulting in diverse affinities and complexation capacity between ha and al species it can therefore be assumed that various al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability for weak binding sites which improves coagulation efficiency however few studies have considered the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminum species and investigated the difference affinity and complexation capacity between ha and aluminum due to the protonation deprotonation characteristics of functional groups and in situ hydrolysis of aluminum although many studies claimed polyaluminum chloride pacl to be superior to traditional aluminum coagulants in terms of turbidity and natural organic matter nom removal yan et al 2008a tang and luan 1995 few studies have considered the limitations of simplex preformed al species and the difference of coagulation behavior between preformed al species and alcl3 al13 was regarded as the most active species in pacl responsible for coagulation xu et al 2011 although the charge of preformed al13 was high the affinities to bind with all binding sites were almost equal in view of this point it can be deduced that preformed al13 first bound with strong binding sites which result in partial supersaturation of sites and charge reversal and less efficient in ha removal therefore the distinct performances of preformed al13 and in situ generated al species during coagulation needs further investigation to gain better understanding of the coagulation behaviour of in situ hydrolyzed and preformed al species 27al nmr and electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy esi ms were applied to investigate the distribution and performance of al species of preformed al13 and alcl3 at different ph during the coagulation process differential absorbance spectroscopy das was employed to quantitatively study ha al interactions with changes in al dosage and ph to investigate the reactivity of ha with coagulants py gc ms was used to monitor the different compounds of ha removed by preformed al13 and alcl3 based on experimental data this study provides insight into coagulation mechanisms for ha removal by al13 and alcl3 at different ph values 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents humic acid was obtained from sigma aldrich stock ha solution was prepared by adding 1 g ha into 1 l 0 1 mol l naoh solution after stirring for 12 h the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to remove suspended materials for the preparation of al13 pacl was adopted as the primary material a 100 ml 1 36 mol l alcl3 6h2o solution was titrated slowly with 240 ml of 1 36 mol l naoh solution within 5 h under rapid stirring conditions after preparation the solutions were set for at least 24 h of aging at room temperature polyaluminum chloride solution with a concentration of 0 4 mol l and basicity of 2 4 was obtained the purification of al13 was carried out using sulfate precipitation from pacl shi et al 2007 xu et al 2003 pacl solution 25 ml and naso4 1 4204 g were transferred into a colorimetric tube and diluted to 50 ml with deionised water after 24 h of reaction the samples were filtered and dried for 24 h the filtrates were then collected and sealed in a glass bottle to obtain a soluble al13 product 0 4 g of solid was placed in a 200 ml glass beaker then 95 2 ml water and 4 8 ml 0 306 mol l ba no3 2 were added under intense agitation for 3 h the insoluble product and soluble al13 were separated by filtering through a 0 45 μm membrane the filtrate al concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry 2 2 jar test procedure coagulation studies were performed in a conventional jar test apparatus equipped with six 1 l beakers the stock ha solution was diluted with ionized water to reach the designated concentration of dissolved organic matter doc 10 mg l aluminum chloride alcl3 6h2o and purified al13 were used in the study the calculated volumes of coagulant to achieve the required dosage and 0 1 m tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate ch3 4noh 5h2o tma solutions to achieve the required ph were added to the ha doc 10 mg l solution tma was more useful than naoh as base this was because while recording the esi mass spectra sodium formed several intense nacl aggregate signals that interfered with the interpretation of the spectra sarpola et al 2004 the coagulation procedure involved rapid mixing at 200 rpm for 1 min followed by slow stirring at 20 rpm for 30 min after 50 s approximately 10 ml solution was collected the corresponding absorbance spectra were then recorded on a persee tu 1901 uv vis spectrophotometer at wavelengths 200 600 nm in addition approximately 30 ml of the solution was taken to determine the zeta potential by a laser doppler electrophoresis apparatus malvern zetasizer 90 uk a 60 min settling period followed flocs were separated from the solution by centrifugation and lyophilised for solid 2 7al nmr analysis the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane to test esi ms and measure doc 2 3 esi ms spectroscopy to investigate aluminum hydrolysis at different ph values fresh alcl3 and al13 solutions were adjusted to different ph values by tma or hcl solution and immediately injected into the mass spectrometer esi mass spectra were recorded with a waters xevo tqd mass spectrometer all esi ms measurements were conducted in the positive ion mode

statistically compare the data of the experiment an analysis of variance anova at the p 0 05 significance level was conducted using ibm spss statistics software version 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal characteristics of ha by alcl3 and preformed al13 the removal efficiencies of ha by alcl3 and preformed al13 as functions of ph and dosage are shown in fig 1 the removal trends throughout the ph range investigated by alcl3 were similar the removal efficiency of doc increased significantly with increase in alcl3 dosage p 0 05 table s1 and reached a steady state when the dosage was above the optimal dosage p 0 05 table s1 however ph significantly affected the coagulation efficiency at optimal dosage of 6 mg l the removal increased first and then decreased as the ph increased the maximum removal was reached at around ph 5 7 which was above 80 preformed al13 and alcl3 exhibited distinct coagulation behaviours in terms of doc removal as shown in fig 1 the removal efficiency of doc of ha increased first and then decreased with dosage increased at ph 4 6 p 0 05 table s2 at acidic conditons the dosage at 4 mg l contributed to the maximal doc removal which was approximately 72 3 78 9 and 74 1 at ph 4 5 and 6 respectively therefore al13 was less dependent on ph for removing doc due to the presence of relatively stable aluminum species under acidic conditions the coagulation performances at ph 7 and ph 8 were similar doc removal increased with al dosage p 0 05 table s2 and then approached a plateau p 0 05 table s2 and the doc removal was much efficient than that under acidic conditions when the aluminum dosage reached concentrations above 4 mg l to investigate the compounds of ha removed by coagulation the properties of the pyrolysis volatiles of ha flocs formed by alcl3 and al13 coagulants at ph 5 and ph 7 were investigated fig s1 shows the pyrolysis chromatogram for each of the samples and their identified pyrolysis products are listed in table s3 s6 the relative contents of the main compound groups are presented in fig 2 the compositions of pyrolysis volatiles are divided into ten main groups polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons mah aliphatic hydrocarbons ah nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds nhp hydrocarbon derivatives hd esters amides furans nitriles and others as shown in fig 2 aromatics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were the most abundant products that were the main structural components of ha compared to alcl3 coagulant there were relatively higher contents of aromatics esters and amides and lower contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives with al13 these results indicated that esters and amides were most efficiently removed by al13 while aliphatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives were most efficiently removed by alcl3 the significant quantitative differences were heterocyclic n containing compounds furans and nitriles heterocyclic n containing compounds were more abundant in alcl3 samples 5 5 at ph 5 6 at ph 7 than in al13 samples 1 5 at ph 5 0 at ph 7 furan was particularly scarce in al13 sample 0 9 at ph 5 when compared to the alcl3 sample 6 6 at ph 5 nitrile accounted for 3 3 was detected only in the al13 sample at ph 5 which indicated the selective removal of nitrile by al13 heterocyclic n containing compounds and furan were selectively removed from ha solution by alcl3 coagulant 3 2 characteristics of in situ aluminum hydrolysis and coagulation behaviours ph has a great effect on the distribution of al species to investigate the effect of al species on the coagulation process esi ms spectra of alcl3 before and after coagulation with ph variation at dosage 6 mg l are shown in fig 3 all the aluminum complexes identified in this study are generally described as alxoy oh z h2o m 2y z 3x before coagulation at ph 4 0 signals at m z values 103 20 44 121 100 139 80 2 157 49 8 and 175 14 52 dominated the esi ms spectra these signals were assigned to the dimeric aluminum species al2o2 oh h2o 0 4 charged complexes with al1 cores m z 99 115 and 133 al3 cores m z 163 181 199 217 and 253 and al4 cores m z 81 99 and 105 were also detected in the spectra at ph 5 0 the aluminum salts further hydrolyzed and the aluminum speciation distribution changed significantly the multi charged al13 complex series m z 328 337 355 213 219 225 had the most intense signal series a series of polymers containing al2 al4 al5 al9 and al10 cores was also observed in the spectra at ph 5 0 when the ph was raised to 6 0 the signals of aluminum compounds decreased because of the formation of al oh 3 the dimeric species m z 121 139 157 and 175 were the dominant species again in the spectrum at ph 7 0 amorphous al oh 3 was formed and the total ions decreased the dimeric species m z 103 121 and 139 were still the dominant species in the spectrum according to the esi ms results discussed above the aluminum species were classified into five categories as follows monomeric and dimeric aluminum species al1 al2 small polymeric aluminum species al3 al5 median polymeric aluminum species al6 al10 large polymeric aluminum species al11 al20 and undetected part i e al oh 3 and or al oh 4 zhao et al 2009a the distribution of aluminum species before and after coagulation at different ph values are illustrated in table 1 as shown in table 1 before coagulation the monomeric and dimeric aluminum and small polymeric aluminum species decreased with the increase of ph which was due to hydrolysis to form larger polymer or al oh 3 median polymer and large polymer increased firstly and reached maximum at ph 5 then decreased when the ph value was higher than 5 undetected part mainly included al oh 3 and al oh 4 the content of undetected part increased and reached maximum of 90 56 at ph 7 due to formation of al oh 3 after coagulation fig 3 the aluminum speciation distribution changed significantly at ph 4 6 the number of ion peaks with higher m z reduced remarkably and relative intensity also decreased for example the polymeric aluminum species al14 al15 al16 and al17 were diminished and al13 species decreased significantly in the spectra at ph 5 meanwhile the relative content of large polymer decreased significantly from 43 56 to 6 56 table 1 under acidic conditions the removal of ha led to the complexation reaction between soluble cations and the functional groups of ha this indicated that large polymeric species played an important role in the complexation reaction similar spectra were achieved before and after coagulation at ph 7 as shown in table 1 the contents of different aluminium species before and after coagulation were quite similar this can be attributed to the formation of al oh 3 s as sweep coagulation occurred this could be compared favourably to our previous investigations jin et al 2018 which demonstrated that dosed al remained unreacted until the dosage was increased to a critical value to form amorphous al oh 3 at ph 7 to further identify aluminum speciation during coagulation ha flocs formed by alcl3 coagulant at ph 5 and ph 7 were collected and freeze dried to obtain solid state 27al nmr fig 4 the spectrum exhibited two distinctive resonances at about 2 ppm and 64 ppm at ph 5 fig 4 the strong peak at 2 ppm corresponded to octahedrally coordinated aluminum many researchers have stated that this shift corresponds to free al dimers or complexed al monomers and dimers zhao et al 2009b the 64 ppm signal was assigned to the tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum at the centre of al13 whose chemical shift was reported to be in the 61 64 ppm range depending on the conditions of formation and aging liu et al 2009 signals from the other 12 shell structured octahedral al in al were too broad to be detected by 27al nmr analysis as a result the concentration of al13 in the nmr result needed to be multiplied by thirteen hiradate and yamaguchi 2003 therefore even though it seemed that the peak at 64 ppm had weak resonance it was reasonable to confirm that the al13 structure existed in the flocs formed by alcl3 therefore the possible al species within the flocs were al13 polymer monomeric and dimeric aluminum this suggested that the in situ formed al13 and other hydrolyzed al species could complex with ha and precipitate subsequently as flocs namely in situ al13 and other hydrolyzed al species played synergistic effects in the removal of ha as shown in fig 4 the two spectra of al oh 3 s and ha flocs formed at ph 7 ha al oh 3 appeared similar the peak at 2 4 ppm is assigned to alo6 octahedral coordination 35 ppm to alo5 pentahedral coordination and 65 ppm to alo4 tetragonal coordination isobe et al 2003 rämö et al 2008 proposed that humic substances can be incorporated into al oh 3 s crystal to form solid state hs al complexes which give rise to new 27al nmr signals this study did not detect any new signals indicating that soluble aluminum species hardly reacted with ha and adsorption of ha by al oh 3 s was the main mechanism at ph 7 this observation is highly consistent with the results of esi ms and verifies the proposed coagulation mechanism at ph 7 3 3 hydrolzed species and coagulation behaviors of preformed al13 3 3 1 esi ms spectra of preformed al13 at different ph values al13 species can be relatively stable after dosing in water as compared to alcl3 hydrolysis the esi ms spectra of al13 in the ph range 4 0 8 0 are shown in fig s2 as shown in fig s2 the al13 species at m z 328 m z 337 m z 355 m z 364 m z 373 m z 219 m z 225 m z 231 and m z 237 dominated the spectra at ph 4 0 8 0 the total ion count tic value was 1 0 107 under acidic conditions ph 4 0 6 0 with ph value increased to 7 0 and 8 0 the total ions reduced probably due to the formation of species undetected by esi ms e g amorphous hydroxide solids the tic values for the same species decreased to 3 0 105 and 2 0 105 although some of the aluminum species formed undetected species al13 was still the dominant species this was similar to the results of rämö et al regarding the speciation of highly basic polyaluminum rämö et al 2008 polynuclear al13 is a keggin al13 7 cation alo4 al oh 2 12 7 or al13o4 oh 24 7 where the tetrahedral alo4 central unit is surrounded by twelve octahedral alo6 units in which the hydroxo groups are attached to the vertices of the octahedra al13 detected in the esi ms spectra is a species of forced hydrolysis formed by the addition of alkali alcl3 could generate the al13 polycation in situ by a spontaneous hydrolysis process the following studies were carried out to investigate coagulation behaviors of preformed al13 in order to compare the reactivity characteristics and mechanism of ha with in situ hydrolyzed and preformed al species 3 3 2 coagulation behaviors of preformed al13 based on esi ms results of preformed al13 the major detected aluminum species were the same al13 species as those at ph 4 0 8 0 thus we chose ph 5 and ph 7 as typical ph values to compare the esi ms spectra before and after coagulation fig 5 as shown in fig 5 after coagulation the aluminum speciation distribution was different from the initial al13 species the number of al13 ion peaks reduced remarkably and the relative intensity also decreased at ph 5 the peaks moved to a lower m z range and al13 also reduced al2 m z 103 121 139 and 157 al7 m z 117 123 129 and 135 and al8 m z 137 149 155 and 167 species dominated the spectra a series of small polymers containing al4 al5 al6 and al10 species was also observed in the spectra after coagulation there were similar changes at ph 7 it indicated that al13 was not stable and decomposed into oligomeric and median polymeric species during coagulation this could be compared favourably with the results of hiradate and yamaguchi 2003 who observed that tetrahedral al in al ha complexes gradually converted to octahedral al indicating that al in al ha complexes decomposed to al ha complexes with reaction time 3 4 complexation capacities of alcl3 and al13 with ha ha is a major light absorbing component in natural waters in the 200 800 nm range the wide variety of light absorbing functional groups chromophores in ha and the possible presence of complex intramolecular interactions result in absorbance spectra that are broad and featureless differential absorbance spectroscopy das is useful for detecting very subtle changes in nom chemistry and has high sensitivity with low sample pretreatment dryer et al 2008 in prior research this technique has successfully been used to quantify nom metal interactions changes in the spectral slope in the range of wavelengths 325 375 nm dslope325 375 in differential log transformed absorbance spectra can be used to characterise the complexation between nom and metal ions yan et al 2013 dslope325 375 parameters are given below zhou and meng 2016 d s l o p e 325 375 s l o p e 325 375 i s l o p e 325 375 ref where slope325 375 i is the slope of a straight line from 325 to 375 nm in the log transformed absorbance at different aluminium concentrations and slope325 375 ref represents the parameter in the absence of aluminum changes in the spectral parameters of dslope325 375 from ha by alcl3 and al13 at different ph values as functions of the total concentration of added al are shown in fig 6 the dslope325 375 changes in ha because alcl3 and al13 had distinctly different characteristics for alcl3 it was observed that the dslope325 375 value positively correlated with the dosed aluminium in acidic conditions moreover the curve increased rapidly p 0 05 table s7 and then gradually reached steady states p 0 05 table s7 at an al concentration of 6 mg l the maximum dslope325 375 value was reached at ph 5 followed by ph 6 and ph 4 the corresponding dslope325 375 value were 0 0019 0 0024 and 0 0021 at ph 4 5 and 6 respectively at ph 7 the dslope325 375 value was obviously lower than 0 0006 and there was no significant variation with increase in dosage p 0 05 table s7 for al13 the whole change trends of dslope325 375 were similar in the range of ph 4 8 the value of dslope325 375 increased and subsequently decreased when the al13 dosage increased p 0 05 table s8 while the dosage required to reach the maximum dslope325 375 at ph 7 was higher than that in acidic conditions dslope325 375 was independent of ha concentration and provided the extent of metal dom binding yan et al 2013 based on the above results the complexation reaction characteristics of alcl3 and al13 with ha were significantly different for alcl3 higher value of dslope325 375 indicated that high reactivity between ha and al occurred at ph 7 the best degree of complexation was reached at ph 5 0 by contrast the added aluminum hardly reacted with ha at ph 7 however complexation occurred between ha and al13 coagulant at all ph values tested 3 5 mechanisms of ha removal by alcl3 and al13 3 5 1 continuous multiligand distribution model to evaluate metal binding sites in humic materials continuous multiligand distribution model have been reported elsewhere dobbs et al 1989 grimm et al 1991 and shown in supporting information the normal distribution curves of binding site at different ph values are shown in fig 7 the abscissa and ordinate in fig 7 refer to the conditional stability constant and lb lt respectively aluminum binding site distributions in humic materials were distinct at different ph levels the higher the proton concentration the weaker the effective complex formation strengths and the narrower the effective width of the distribution of the binding sites under acidic conditions the binding site distribution gradually agreed with the normal distribution and the effective width of binding site distribution increased progressively with ph increased this indicated that the binding sites occupied by metal ions increased as the ph increased from 3 to 6 the area under the upper curve in the graph represented the amount of binding sites at low ph a significant portion of binding sites was occupied by protons al3 ions competed with protons to form complexes the proton migration of functional groups reduced due to the large proton concentration in solution therefore most of the binding sites were occupied by protons as the ph increased al3 was more strongly bound to the binding sites as the deprotonation of functional groups increased most of the binding sites are occupied by the metal ion therefore the amount of bound aluminum reached maximum at ph 5 6 at ph 7 the distribution of the binding sites appeared broader and the binding sites occupied by metal ions decreased in addition the conditional stability constants at ph 5 0 was much larger than that at ph 7 0 which proved that aluminum ions tended to combine with the functional groups on the ha molecules and form al ha complexes at ph 5 0 3 5 2 analysis of mechanisms the reactivity characteristics and mechanism of humic acid with alcl3 and performed al13 can be interpreted as shown in fig 8 as is well known the removal of ha was due to complexation between aluminum ions and ha under acidic conditions jin et al 2018 alcl3 can be hydrolyzed to various al species in aqueous solution depending on the ph the distributions of binding site in ha could be change due to protonation deprotonation of functional groups of ha therefore the coagulation efficiency was attributed to differences in al species and the amount of aluminum bound to ha for alcl3 the dominating al species at ph 4 were dimer monomer and other oligomers which had a certain complexation ability and ha removal although the charge of the dimer was not as high as that of al13 the charge per al ion in the dimer was higher than that in al13 yan et al 2008b the maximum level of ha removal was reached at ph 5 to 6 which was higher than that for preformed al13 at ph 5 6 alcl3 hydrolyzed to form various aluminum species including dimer small polymer larger polymer i e in situ al13 and so on due to the diversity of the hydrolyzed al species and discrepancy in the binding site distributions of ha the binding sites of ha with different affinities selectively bound with diverse al species which increased the complexing probability of the binding sites of ha yan et al 2007 concluded that the removal of unsatisfied coordinate bonds of organic matter correlated with the content of alb mainly al13 while the removal of aromatic compounds uv254 was determined by the content of alc mainly al oh 3 zhao et al 2009b concluded that monomer aluminum was preferentially bound to polysaccharides and cellulosic molecules whereas preformed al13 species selectively bound to carboxylic groups at ph 6 0 in addition complexation capacity of alcl3 was higher than that of al13 at the optimum dosage the values of dslope325 375 for alcl3 and al13 were determined to be 0 0024 and 0 0020 respectively therefore the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed al species with higher complexation capacity played important roles in removing ha at ph 5 6 according to py gc ms analysis compared to the alcl3 sample the products of the al13 sample had a higher content of aromatics at ph 5 as a result relatively lower proportions of other compounds in ha could be removed by the al13 coagulant moreover performed al13 could gradually be converted to octahedral al during coagulation and had less complexation capacity with ha affecting coagulation efficiency fig s3 shows the zeta potential at different al13 dosage at ph 5 for preformed al13 the zeta potential increased sharply at lower dosage and shifted to the positive region with increase in al13 dosage therefore preformed al13 with high positive charges could not completely neutralise the negative binding sites of ha with lower charge density this resulted in charge reversal and the formation of electrostatic patches the higher degree of binding consumed or covered some of the binding sites which made it difficult for flocs to aggregate alb could thus destabilise the particles efficiently to form aggregates however it could not form flocs that were large enough to settle efficiently and remained mostly in colloidal form yan et al 2007 the coagulation mechanisms of ha by alcl3 were distinctly different from those of al13 at ph 7 for alcl3 al oh 3 were the major species and some oligomers were also formed however most oligomers did not react with ha and almost all ha was removed via sweep flocculation therefore the dominant coagulation mechanism was the adsorption of ha on amorphous al oh 3 for alcl3 the value of dslope325 375 for preformed al13 indicated that complexation occurred between ha and preformed al13 therefore complexation and sweep coagulation were involved in the coagulation of ha by al13 these resulted in higher ha removal efficiency obtained at ph 7 in al13 coagulation 4 conclusions in this study the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminum hydrolysis and coagulation behavior of in situ and preformed al species for the removal humic acid ha were investigated for alcl3 the doc removal was strongly related to the ph values the maximum ha removal reached at weak acidic conditions where various in situ hydrolyzed al species containing al1 to al20 cores with different amounts of water molecules were present meanwhile the binding site distributions of ha were distinct with variations in ph which brought about different affinities with the al species because of the diversity of in situ hydrolyzed aluminium species and discrepancy in the binding sites of ha various al species could meet the demand for different binding sites and enhance the complexing probability therefore the synergistic effects of various in situ hydrolyzed aluminium species played important roles in the removal of ha compared with alcl3 al13 was less dependent on ph to remove ha due to the simplex preformed al species under weak acidic conditions the zeta potential of ha formed by preformed al13 increased from negative to positive

19186,bisphenol s bps and bisphenol af bpaf were increasingly consumed and these compounds are resistant to environmental degradation herein ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf was investigated and biodegradability of the oxidation products was examined the second order reaction rate constants of ferrate with bps and bpaf were 1 3 103 m 1s 1 and 3 102 m 1s 1 respectively at ph 7 0 25 c in the oxidation process some bps molecules dimerized while other bps molecules were oxidized through oxygen transfer process leading to the formation of hydroxylation products and benzene ring cleavage products the dominant reaction of bpaf with ferrate was oxygen transfer process and bpaf was degraded into lower molecular weight products the variation of assimilable organic carbon aoc suggested that the biodegradability of bpaf and bps was largely improved after ferrate oxidation compared with the bps oxidation products the bpaf oxidation products were easier to be bio consumed pure culture test showed that bpaf inhibited the growth of escherichia coli while ferrate oxidation completely eliminated this toxic effect co existing humic acid ha 1 mg c l to 5 mg c l decreased the removal of bps and bpaf with ferrate compared with bpaf more oxidation intermediates formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be reduced by ha to the parent molecular thus the inhibition effect of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps was more obvious than that on bpaf graphical abstract image 1 keywords ferrate bisphenol s bisphenol af oxidation biodegradability 1 introduction bisphenols are a large family of chemicals that were extensively used to improve the transparency mechanical properties such as indentation and abrasion resistance and electronic properties of industrial products delfosse et al 2012 li et al 2018b murphy 2001 bisphenol a bpa was one of the commonly used bisphenols in consumer products such as plastic bottles thermal paper food can linings dentistry sealants etc and over 3 million tons of bpa were consumed annually delfosse et al 2012 however bpa is a bio accumulative endocrine disrupting chemical and can jeopardize the reproductive and metabolic system of mammals newbold et al 2009 richter et al 2007 due to the adverse effects of bpa on human health and ecosystems decrees to limit the addition of bpa into consumer products were issued by many countries and the consumption of bpa substitutes surged accordingly yamazaki et al 2015 bisphenol s bps and bisphenol af bpaf are commonly used as bpa substitutes fig 1 although their environmental behavior bio toxicity effects and disposal method were not previously investigated as the consumption of bps and bpaf increasing their detection frequency in environmental samples such as sewage sludge river sediment and human urine increased accordingly choi 2016 liao et al 2012 xu et al 2018a more importantly compared with bpa bps and bpaf were more resistant to abatement processes such as bio degradation and photo degradation previous studies showed that no degradation of bps and bpaf was observed within 28 days in anaerobic sludge and the half life of bpaf ranged from 22 to 36 days in aerobic sludge in comparison the half life of bpa was less than 1 day under similar condition choi 2016 over 83 of bpa could be biodegraded in seawater while no bps degradation was observed in the experiment danzl et al 2009 due to the similar structure with that of bpa bps and bpaf also possess acute toxicity genotoxicity and estrogenic activity kitamura et al 2005 okuda et al 2011 rivas et al 2002 these bisphenols may be persistent in nature and arouse new ecological problems for the control or remediation of environmental pollutants chemical oxidation is an effective method feng et al 2018 li et al 2018a however chemical oxidants cannot fully mineralize the organic pollutants and some transformation products may be more toxic than their parent forms microbes ubiquitously exist in

filtered through a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size milipore millex gp before use recovery rate 99 control groups contain 25 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer and 5 μm of bps or bpaf in the experiment 5 μm of bps or bpaf is oxidized by different amount of ferrate the initial ferrate bp ratio was 5 1 10 1 15 1 20 1 30 1 respectively after reaction the solution samples are filtered through a filter of 0 22

strain in exponential phase was inoculated into the reactors under constant stirring at 35 c the optical density value of bacterial culture at 600 nm was measured by a hitachi uv visible spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics reaction kinetics of bps and bpaf with ferrate are determined based on second order reaction rate law eq 1 text s1 fig 2 a and b the rate constants kapp of bps with ferrate declined from 1 4 103 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 to 4 7 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 when solution ph increased to 10 0 the rate constant decreased below 0 1 m 1s 1 previous study showed that chlorination treatment could effectively degrade bps and the reaction constant was around 1 5 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 gao et al 2018 the reaction constant of bps with ferrate was nearly 8 times higher than that of bps with chlorine compared with bps ferrate oxidation of bpaf was slower when reacted at ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 the determined rate constants were 4 3 102 3 1 102 and 1 8 102 m 1s 1 respectively when solution ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 the rate constants decreased from 88 to 18 m 1s 1 density function theory calculation results about the reactivity of ferrate with organics showed that the spin density of oxo ligands was larger in hfeo4 than that in feo4 2 this property makes the oxidation ability of hfeo4 stronger than feo4 2 ohta et al 2001 sharma 2013 meanwhile the partial radical characters of ferrate may be proton stabilized and increase the reactivity under acidic ph condition sharma et al 2002 interestingly rate constant of bpaf with ferrate was lower than that of bps when the solution ph ranged from 6 5 to 7 5 1 4 103 4 7 102 m 1s 1 vs 4 3 102 1 8 102 m 1s 1 but higher under alkaline conditions ph 8 10 the intermediates of bps and bpaf formed in the oxidation process may have different activity with ferrate species leading to the difference in rate constants previous studies stated that the chemical structures of bps and bpaf are stable and more resistant to environmental degradation compared with that of bpa choi and lee 2017 the determined rate constant of bpa with ferrate was 6 4 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 lee et al 2005a main difference between bpa and bps in chemical structure lies in the phenol groups which are combined with c atom in bpa molecular while combined with s atom in bps molecular and ferrate is highly reactive with organics containing electron rich moieties such as s atom n atom benzene ring and unsaturated bonds sharma 2002 hence although the chemical stability of bps is higher than that of bpa the reactivity of ferrate with bps was higher than that of bpa in comparison the chemical structure of bpaf is similar to that of bpa but the f atoms are electron withdrawing groups and are not highly reactive with ferrate this may lead to the low rate constant of bpaf with ferrate 3 1 102 m 1s 1 ph 7 0 compared with that of bpa with ferrate to further elucidate the reaction mechanism the determined rate constants were compared with data fitting result based on nonlinear least squares regression fig 2c and d and table s2 for the reaction of bps with ferrate the modeled data is well fitted with the determined rate constants r2 0 979 especially at ph 6 5 8 5 the values of k11 k12 and k13 were 1 7 103 1 9 103 and 0 m 1s 1 respectively in comparison the values of k 11 k 12 and k 13 in the reaction of ferrate with bpaf were 5 1 102 1 5 103 and 1 5 104 m 1s 1 respectively these results suggested that 1 in the reaction of bps with ferrate overall reaction is controlled by the reaction of hfeo4 with bps xh2 and deprotonated bps xh 2 in the reaction of bpaf with ferrate the reaction is controlled by the reaction of hfeo4 with deprotonated bpaf xh and ionized bpaf x2 3 hfeo4 is the dominant ferrate species to react with bps and bpaf while the effects of feo4 2 on bps and bpaf oxidation was not obvious 3 2 transformation products and reaction mechanism lc esi qtof and hplc esi qqq are used for analyzing the transformation products by comparing the total ion current tic chromatograms of bps and bpaf before and after ferrate oxidation the peaks of possible oxidation products were identified and mass spectra of relevant compounds are extracted fig 3 and fig 4 and table s3 in tic chromatograms the highest peak at 27 48 min refers to bps m z 249 da by analyzing the peaks from 27 1 to 28 3 min in the tic chromatograms a compound p1 m z 497 da was identified fig 3g previous studies reported that this compound also formed in the reaction of bps with cl2 or mno2 gao et al 2018 li et al 2018b meanwhile a peak p5 m z 173 da at 29 8 min was obvious according to the ms spectrum ionization pattern and possible reaction pathway p5 may be 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid a product formed in the ferrate oxidation of the sulfur atom of bps besides bps p5 and p1 three products with m z values of 265 da p2 281 da p3 and 297 da p4 were identified and their mass spectra are presented in fig 3d e and 3f respectively the m z value of bps is 249 da while the m z values of p4 p3 and p2 are 48 da 32 da and 16 da larger than that of bps respectively p2 p3 and p4 may be a serial of hydroxylation products formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps during which oxygen atoms 16 da were added onto the mother molecular the most intense peak appearing at 35 5 min of the tic chromatograms is bpaf as the m z value of the compound is 335 da same with the deprotonated bpaf fig 4a besides bpaf two obvious peaks appear at 31 68 min and 33 79 min of the tic chromatograms respectively the m z value of the compound arousing the peak at 31 68 min is 367 da p7 figs 4f 32 da larger than that of deprotonated bpaf the peak at 33 79 min is composed by 3 compounds p6 m z 351 da p7 and p8 m z 259 da p6 and p7 may be the hydroxylation products of bpaf since their m z values are 16 da and 32 da larger than that of bpaf the m z value of p8 is 259 da 76 da lower than that of bpaf chemically the molecular weight of benzene is 78 da which is similar with the lost molecular weight of bpaf by analyzing the molecular ionization pattern and published results li et al 2018b p8 is assigned to 2 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl hexafluoropropane fig 4c besides the two emerging obvious peaks there are some small peaks appearing from 20 5 min to 22 6 min on the tic chromatogram p9 m z 223 da is assigned to the peak at 20 7 min according to the ionization pattern of its mass spectrum and possible reaction pathway p9 may be a ring cleavage product of p8 the variation of relative content of bps bpaf and their transformation products formed in the ferrate oxidation process is examined by hplc esi qqq under mrm mode fig s1 for the ferrate oxidation of bps ferrate bps 10 1 ph 7 0 the content of bps declined as a function of reaction time while the content of p5 increased accordingly fig s1a after 5 min of reaction the relative content of bps and p5 is on the same order of magnitude while the peak areas of p3 and p4 are one magnitude lower than that of p5 and the peak areas of p1 and p2 are two magnitudes lower than that of p5 this indicates that in the ferrate oxidation of bps ferrate bps 10 1 ph 7 0 p5 may be a main oxidation product the relative content of bps hydroxylation products p2 p3 and p4 is lower than the content of p5 and the content of bps self coupling product p1 is the lowest among these products for the products formed in the ferrate oxidation of bpaf ferrate bpaf 10 1 ph 7 0 fig s1b the relative content of p6 and p7 rapidly increased with the decrease of bpaf in the initial seconds one minute later the content of p6 and p7 hydroxylation products decreased with the abatement of bpaf these compounds may be further oxidized by ferrate in comparison the content of p9 ring cleavage product increased in the reaction process after 10 min of reaction the relative content of bpaf p6 p7 and p9 is on the same magnitude while the content of p8 is one magnitude lower this suggests that hydroxylation and ring cleavage reactions may be the dominant processes in the ferrate oxidation of bpaf based on the detected oxidation products and speculated reaction mechanism the ferrate oxidation pathways of bps and bpaf are proposed fig 5 ferrate initially attacks the phenol moiety electron rich moiety of bp bps bpaf and acquire one electron the bp were transformed into phenoxy radicals rs1 and rf1 and other resonance forms rs2 rs3 rf2 and rf3 due to the delocalization of the unpaired electron the radicals rs2 and rf2 with high electron density at ortho position would react with ferrate through oxygen transfer process leading to the formation of hydroxylation products p2 p3 p4 in bps and p6 p7 in bpaf li et al 2018b the radicals rs3 and rf3 with high electron density at para position would undergo β scission process walling and padwa 1963 with the formation of radicals rs5 and rf5 and cations rs4 and rf4 subsequently these compounds would transform into s c bond cleavage products p5 and hydroquinone in bps and c c bond cleavage products p8 and hydroquinone in bpaf for the hydroxylated benzene ring it may be further oxidized by ferrate leading to the formation of di hydroxy products the chemical structure of hydroquinone and di hydroxy ortho position products is not stable and would be oxidized into ring cleavage and hydrogen atom transfer products han et al 2015 xie et al 2016 the ring cleavage products may be further transformed into lower molecular weight products p9 in the reaction of bps with ferrate self coupling process would happen and result in the formation of low level of p1 in comparison the bpaf was stepwise oxidized by ferrate and no self coupling product was identified 3 3 biodegradability of the oxidation products bps and bpaf are used as bpa substitutes mainly because they are stable and resistant to photo and bio degradation however chemical stability also leads to environmental resistance previous study showed when the initial chlorine bps molar ratio was 30 1 over 90 of bps was removed within 15 min gao et al 2018 for the reaction of ferrate with bps when the initial ferrate bps molar ratio was 10 1 the content of bps decreases below 5 within 5 min fig 6 a when the ferrate bps molar ratios increased to 15 1 20 1 and 30 1 the elimination time of bps below detection limit decreased to 60 s 20 s and 10 s respectively similarly when the initial ferrate bpaf molar ratio was 10 1 over 94 of bpaf was removed within 10 min fig 6b when the ferrate bpaf molar ratio increased to 15 1 5 μm of bpaf was removed within 5 min as the ferrate bpaf molar ratios increased to 20 1 and 30 1 the elimination time of bpaf dropped to1 5 min and 0 5 min respectively since bps and bpaf are bio accumulative and can disrupt human metabolism at low concentration kitamura et al 2005 ruan et al 2015 high removal efficiency is important for preventing their accumulation in ecosystems besides transformation efficiency the variation of toc content in bps and bpaf bps 0 20 μm bpaf 0 20 μm groups is investigated fig 6c generally when treated by 100 μm 200 μm 300 μm 400 μm of ferrate around 10 15 20 and 25 of toc were removed from the solution respectively compared with that in bpaf samples more toc was removed in bps samples the organic compound may be mineralized by the ferrate when the applied dosage of ferrate increased to 600 μm around 40 of toc in both groups was removed ferrate could effectively oxidize bps and bpaf in aqueous solution and the variation of aoc content in relevant samples is determined to study the bio degradability of ferrate oxidation products of bps and bpaf fig 6d when the initial ferrate bps molar ratio is 5 1 the aoc content decreased by 5 in bps group while increased by 85 in bpaf group there are two main reaction pathways for the ferrate oxidation of bps self coupling and oxygen transfer fig 5 low level of ferrate may not fully degrade bps into lower molecular weight products while some bps molecules were self coupled and resist to biodegradation in comparison the bpaf was stepwise degraded by ferrate and the biodegradability was increased accordingly after the ferrate bp molar ratios increased to 10 1 15 1 20 1 and 30 1 the aoc content in bps group was increased by 28 57 86 and 107 respectively in comparison the aoc content in bpaf group was increased by 156 232 212 and 209 respectively compared with that of bps the improvement of bpaf biodegradability by ferrate oxidation was much higher as discussed in above paragraph the formation of self coupling products may decrease the biodegradation potential of ferrate oxidation products of bps in comparison bpaf could be stepwise oxidized into lower molecular weight products and these organics may be easy to be bio consumed the effects of bpaf bps and their ferrate oxidation products on the growth of e coli were further investigated fig 7 overall the peak value of e coli od600 in control group was 2 46 and the growth curve of e coli in control group is normal lag phase 0 3 5 h logarithmic phase 3 5 23 h and stationary phase 23 48 h fig 7a in comparison the peak value of e coli od600 in bpaf group was 0 84 and the lag phase of e coli in this group ranged from 0 to 16 5 h this suggests that bpaf inhibited the growth of e coli compared with that in bpaf group the growth of e coli in bps group was not obviously affected the antimicrobial effect of bps 20 μm on e coli was not intense for the e coli cultured in the oxidation products of bps and bpaf its growth condition was better than that in control group and bps group and much better than that in bpaf group for example the peak value of e coli growth curve in control group was 2 46 while for the e coli in the fe vi bps 20 1 fe vi bpaf 20 1 fe vi bps 30 1 and fe vi bpaf 30 1 groups the peak values of the growth curves were 2 58 2 96 3 22 and 3 01 respectively these data suggest that the antimicrobial effect of bpaf towards e coli was eliminated after ferrate oxidation meanwhile for the microbes in lag phase and logarithmic phase the growth condition of e coli in fe vi bps 30 1 and fe vi bpaf 30 1 groups was better than that in fe vi bps 20 1 and fe vi bpaf 20 1 groups this may be because that higher level of ferrate further oxidized some intermediate products in the system and the lower molecular weight products formed in the reaction process are easy to be bio consumed these results are in accordance with the variation of aoc content in relevant samples fig 7d which the antimicrobial activity of bpaf was largely removed after ferrate oxidation leading to the increasement of aoc content in comparison the antimicrobial activity of bps was not as strong as that of bpaf and thus the increasement of aoc content in relevant groups was not as high as those in bpaf samples the data in e coli culture experiment further suggests that ferrate oxidation would eliminate the antimicrobial effect of bpaf towards e coli and the oxidation products were not highly toxic and can be consumed by microbe 3 4 effects of ha on the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate humic acids ha ubiquitously exist in the environment and would affect the transformation of environment pollutants liu et al 2018b xu et al 2018b the effects of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf are investigated fig 8 generally the influence of ha on the oxidation of bps with ferrate was more obvious than that of bpaf for the oxidation of bps in pure water over 95 of bps was removed within 10 min as the initial ferrate bps molar ratio is 10 1 however the transformation efficiencies were decreased to 92 77 and 61 respectively when the solution contained 1 3 and 5 mg c l of ha ha decreased the transformation of bps with ferrate especially under high concentrations compared with that of bps the transformation of bpaf with ferrate was also influenced but to a less extent when the solution contained 1 3 and 5 mg c l of ha the bpaf transformation ratios were decreased to 93 87 and 81 respectively while over 96 of bpaf was removed by ferrate in pure water within 30 min ha can react with ferrate and competitively consume it leading to the insufficient oxidation of target pollutants previous studies gao et al 2018 wenk et al 2011 investigated the effect of ha on the oxidation of organic pollutants and speculated that ha would react with the oxidation intermediates oi and reduce them into the parent form with the presence of ha the transformation rate of oi and bp bps or bpaf can be interpreted by eq 1 1 l n c t c 0 k a p p c 0 t f e v i d t where ct and c0 represent the content of target compound at specific reaction time 0 t fe vi dt represents the exposure of oxidant ferrate kapp c represents the second order rate constant calculated by studying the decay of target compound when ferrate is in 10 fold excess considering that bp would be oxidized by ferrate with the formation of oi k1 represents the second order rate constant of ferrate with bp ha 0 mg l the oi would be further oxidized by ferrate k2 represents the second order rate constant of oi with ferrate and the oi would be reduced by ha into the parent form k3 represents the second order rate constant for the reduction of oi with ha the transformation of bp and oi could be interpreted by following equations 2 d bp d t k a p p c bp fe v i k 3 oi ha k 1 bp fe v i 3 d oi d t k 1 bp fe v i k 3 oi ha k 2 oi 4 oi k 1 bp fe v i k 2 k 3 ha 5 d bp d t k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 ha bp fe v i 6 k a p p c k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 ha 7 1 k a p p c 1 k 1 k 3 k 1 k 2 h a fig 8c and d shows the correlation of the determined second order constants in the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf with the presence of ha the r2 values of the 1 k a p p c with the presence of different amount of ha are 0 95 and 0 99 respectively this suggests that there are good linear relationships between the calculated 1 k a p p c and ha content according to the model fitting results the k1 values for the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf with the presence of ha are 1 4 103 m 1s 1 and 3 1 102 m 1s 1 respectively this result is in accordance with above data fig 2 in which ferrate is more reactive with bps than bpaf in comparison the k3 k2 values for the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf with the presence of ha are 0 324 and 0 049 respectively considering that k2 represents the rate constant for the ferrate oxidation of oi while k3 represents the rate constant for the reduction of oi with ha this result indicates that high level of oi formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be reduced by ha while to a less extent of bpaf oi may be reduced by ha besides the self coupling product dimer formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be transformed back to bps with the presence of ha while most products formed in the ferrate oxidation of bpaf were hydroxylation products and ring cleavage products fig 5 hence the effects of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps were more obvious than the ferrate oxidation of bpaf 3 5 transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate in authentic waters in above sections we found that ha would negatively affect the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate in addition to ha background ions and dissolved organics exist in natural waters and they may also influence the ferrate oxidation process the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate in authentic waters surface water ground water and wwtp effluent was examined fig 9 over 96 of bps was removed in pure water by ferrate within 10 min in comparison the transformation efficiencies of bps surpassed 92 in both surface water and ground water this suggests that the background constituents in the surface water and ground water did not greatly influence the transformation of bps with ferrate after 10 min of reaction 6 8 μm of ferrate was residual in pure water group while less than 2 μm of ferrate was residual in wwtp effluent group fig 9c the organics in wwtp competitively consumed ferrate and decreased the transformation ratio of bps only 50 of bps was oxidized by ferrate in wwtp in this process for the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf in authentic waters ferrate was transformed into ferric nano particles and settled at the bottom of the reactor the content of ferric ion in all water samples was below 0 3 mg l that can satisfy the drinking water standard of china gb5749 2006 on fe concentration for the bpaf in pure water surface water and ground water the ferrate oxidation efficiencies were 95 83 and 90 within 10 min respectively during this period 42 μm 45 μm and 43 μm of ferrate were consumed when reacted in wwtp effluent less than 45 of bpaf was oxidized and over 48 μm of ferrate was consumed based on these results low level of ferrate ferrate target compounds 10 1 or 15 1 can be used for the elimination of bps and bpaf in surface water and ground water while high level of ferrate ferrate target compounds 20 1 has to be applied for the efficient removal of bps and bpaf in wwtp 4 conclusions this study compared the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf in terms of reaction kinetics reaction mechanism and the biodegradability of oxidation products following conclusions were obtained 1 the reactions of ferrate with bps and bpaf were ph dependent and followed second order rate law bps was more readily oxidized by ferrate than that of bpaf under circumneutral ph conditions 2 two dominant reaction pathways for the reaction of ferrate with bps were i bps self coupling process with the formation of dimer ii oxygen transfer process with the formation of benzene ring cleavage products in comparison oxygen transfer was the dominant process for the ferrate oxidation of bpaf 3 compared with bps ferrate oxidation products the biodegradability of bpaf ferrate oxidation products was higher the dimers formed in the oxidation of bps may hard to be bio consumed ferrate oxidation would remove the antimicrobial effect of bpaf towards e coli and the oxidation products were not toxic 4 the presence of ha decreased the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate and the effects of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps were more obvious than the ferrate oxidation of bpaf high level of oxidation intermediates formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be reduced by ha while to a less extent of bpaf oxidation intermediates may be reduced ferrate can be used for the control of bps and bpaf in source water acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r

19186,bisphenol s bps and bisphenol af bpaf were increasingly consumed and these compounds are resistant to environmental degradation herein ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf was investigated and biodegradability of the oxidation products was examined the second order reaction rate constants of ferrate with bps and bpaf were 1 3 103 m 1s 1 and 3 102 m 1s 1 respectively at ph 7 0 25 c in the oxidation process some bps molecules dimerized while other bps molecules were oxidized through oxygen transfer process leading to the formation of hydroxylation products and benzene ring cleavage products the dominant reaction of bpaf with ferrate was oxygen transfer process and bpaf was degraded into lower molecular weight products the variation of assimilable organic carbon aoc suggested that the biodegradability of bpaf and bps was largely improved after ferrate oxidation compared with the bps oxidation products the bpaf oxidation products were easier to be bio consumed pure culture test showed that bpaf inhibited the growth of escherichia coli while ferrate oxidation completely eliminated this toxic effect co existing humic acid ha 1 mg c l to 5 mg c l decreased the removal of bps and bpaf with ferrate compared with bpaf more oxidation intermediates formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be reduced by ha to the parent molecular thus the inhibition effect of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps was more obvious than that on bpaf graphical abstract image 1 keywords ferrate bisphenol s bisphenol af oxidation biodegradability 1 introduction bisphenols are a large family of chemicals that were extensively used to improve the transparency mechanical properties such as indentation and abrasion resistance and electronic properties of industrial products delfosse et al 2012 li et al 2018b murphy 2001 bisphenol a bpa was one of the commonly used bisphenols in consumer products such as plastic bottles thermal paper food can linings dentistry sealants etc and over 3 million tons of bpa were consumed annually delfosse et al 2012 however bpa is a bio accumulative endocrine disrupting chemical and can jeopardize the reproductive and metabolic system of mammals newbold et al 2009 richter et al 2007 due to the adverse effects of bpa on human health and ecosystems decrees to limit the addition of bpa into consumer products were issued by many countries and the consumption of bpa substitutes surged accordingly yamazaki et al 2015 bisphenol s bps and bisphenol af bpaf are commonly used as bpa substitutes fig 1 although their environmental behavior bio toxicity effects and disposal method were not previously investigated as the consumption of bps and bpaf increasing their detection frequency in environmental samples such as sewage sludge river sediment and human urine increased accordingly choi 2016 liao et al 2012 xu et al 2018a more importantly compared with bpa bps and bpaf were more resistant to abatement processes such as bio degradation and photo degradation previous studies showed that no degradation of bps and bpaf was observed within 28 days in anaerobic sludge and the half life of bpaf ranged from 22 to 36 days in aerobic sludge in comparison the half life of bpa was less than 1 day under similar condition choi 2016 over 83 of bpa could be biodegraded in seawater while no bps degradation was observed in the

strain in exponential phase was inoculated into the reactors under constant stirring at 35 c the optical density value of bacterial culture at 600 nm was measured by a hitachi uv visible spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics reaction kinetics of bps and bpaf with ferrate are determined based on second order reaction rate law eq 1 text s1 fig 2 a and b the rate constants kapp of bps with ferrate declined from 1 4 103 m 1s 1 at ph 6 5 to 4 7 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 when solution ph increased to 10 0 the rate constant decreased below 0 1 m 1s 1 previous study showed that chlorination treatment could effectively degrade bps and the reaction constant was around 1 5 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 gao et al 2018 the reaction constant of bps with ferrate was nearly 8 times higher than that of bps with chlorine compared with bps ferrate oxidation of bpaf was slower when reacted at ph 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 the determined rate constants were 4 3 102 3 1 102 and 1 8 102 m 1s 1 respectively when solution ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 the rate constants decreased from 88 to 18 m 1s 1 density function theory calculation results about the reactivity of ferrate with organics showed that the spin density of oxo ligands was larger in hfeo4 than that in feo4 2 this property makes the oxidation ability of hfeo4 stronger than feo4 2 ohta et al 2001 sharma 2013 meanwhile the partial radical characters of ferrate may be proton stabilized and increase the reactivity under acidic ph condition sharma et al 2002 interestingly rate constant of bpaf with ferrate was lower than that of bps when the solution ph ranged from 6 5 to 7 5 1 4 103 4 7 102 m 1s 1 vs 4 3 102 1 8 102 m 1s 1 but higher under alkaline conditions ph 8 10 the intermediates of bps and bpaf formed in the oxidation process may have different activity with ferrate species leading to the difference in rate constants previous studies stated that the chemical structures of bps and bpaf are stable and more resistant to environmental degradation compared with that of bpa choi and lee 2017 the determined rate constant of bpa with ferrate was 6 4 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 lee et al 2005a main difference between bpa and bps in chemical structure lies in the phenol groups which are combined with c atom in bpa molecular while combined with s atom in bps molecular and ferrate is highly reactive with organics containing electron rich moieties such as s atom n atom benzene ring and unsaturated bonds sharma 2002 hence although the chemical stability of bps is higher than that of bpa the reactivity of ferrate with bps was higher than that of bpa in comparison the chemical structure of bpaf is similar to that of bpa but the f atoms are electron withdrawing groups and are not highly reactive with ferrate this may lead to the low rate constant of bpaf with ferrate 3 1 102 m 1s 1 ph 7 0 compared with that of bpa with ferrate to further elucidate the reaction mechanism the determined rate constants were compared with data fitting result based on nonlinear least squares regression fig 2c and d and table s2 for the reaction of bps with ferrate the modeled data is well fitted with the determined rate constants r2 0 979 especially at ph 6 5 8 5 the values of k11 k12 and k13 were 1 7 103 1 9 103 and 0 m 1s 1 respectively in comparison the values of k 11 k 12 and k 13 in the reaction of ferrate with bpaf were 5 1 102 1 5 103 and 1 5 104 m 1s 1 respectively these results suggested that 1 in the reaction of bps with ferrate overall reaction is controlled by the reaction of hfeo4 with bps xh2 and deprotonated bps xh 2 in the reaction of bpaf with ferrate the reaction is controlled by the reaction of hfeo4 with deprotonated bpaf xh and ionized bpaf x2 3 hfeo4 is the dominant ferrate species to react with bps and bpaf while the effects of feo4 2 on bps and bpaf oxidation was not obvious 3 2 transformation products and reaction mechanism lc esi qtof and hplc esi qqq are used for analyzing the transformation products by comparing the total ion current tic chromatograms of bps and bpaf before and after ferrate oxidation the peaks of possible oxidation products were identified and mass spectra of relevant compounds are extracted fig 3 and fig 4 and table s3 in tic chromatograms the highest peak at 27 48 min refers to bps m z 249 da by analyzing the peaks from 27 1 to 28 3 min in the tic chromatograms a compound p1 m z 497 da was identified fig 3g previous studies reported that this compound also formed in the reaction of bps with cl2 or mno2 gao et al 2018 li et al 2018b meanwhile a peak p5 m z 173 da at 29 8 min was obvious according to the ms spectrum ionization pattern and possible reaction pathway p5 may be 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid a product formed in the ferrate oxidation of the sulfur atom of bps besides bps p5 and p1 three products with m z values of 265 da p2 281 da p3 and 297 da p4 were identified and their mass spectra are presented in fig 3d e and 3f respectively the m z value of bps is 249 da while the m z values of p4 p3 and p2 are 48 da 32 da and 16 da larger than that of bps respectively p2 p3 and p4 may be a serial of hydroxylation products formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps during which oxygen atoms 16 da were added onto the mother molecular the most intense peak appearing at 35 5 min of the tic chromatograms is bpaf as the m z value of the compound is 335 da same with the deprotonated bpaf fig 4a besides bpaf two obvious peaks appear at 31 68 min and 33 79 min of the tic chromatograms respectively the m z value of the compound arousing the peak at 31 68 min is 367 da p7 figs 4f 32 da larger than that of deprotonated bpaf the peak at 33 79 min is composed by 3 compounds p6 m z 351 da p7 and p8 m z 259 da p6 and p7 may be the hydroxylation products of bpaf since their m z values are 16 da and 32 da larger than that of bpaf the m z value of p8 is 259 da 76 da lower than that of bpaf chemically the molecular weight of benzene is 78 da which is similar with the lost molecular weight of bpaf by analyzing the molecular ionization pattern and published results li et al 2018b p8 is assigned to 2 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl hexafluoropropane fig 4c besides the two emerging obvious peaks there are some small peaks appearing from 20 5 min to 22 6 min on the tic chromatogram p9 m z 223 da is assigned to the peak at 20 7 min according to the ionization pattern of its mass spectrum and possible reaction pathway p9 may be a ring cleavage product of p8 the variation of relative content of bps bpaf and their transformation products formed in the ferrate oxidation process is examined by hplc esi qqq under mrm mode fig s1 for the ferrate oxidation of bps ferrate bps 10 1 ph 7 0 the content of bps declined as a function of reaction time while the content of p5 increased accordingly fig s1a after 5 min of reaction the relative content of bps and p5 is on the same order of magnitude while the peak areas of p3 and p4 are one magnitude lower than that of p5 and the peak areas of p1 and p2 are two magnitudes lower than that of p5 this indicates that in the ferrate oxidation of bps ferrate bps 10 1 ph 7 0 p5 may be a main oxidation product the relative content of bps hydroxylation products p2 p3 and p4 is lower than the content of p5 and the content of bps self coupling product p1 is the lowest among these products for the products formed in the ferrate oxidation of bpaf ferrate bpaf 10 1 ph 7 0 fig s1b the relative content of p6 and p7 rapidly increased with the decrease of bpaf in the initial seconds one minute later the content of p6 and p7 hydroxylation products decreased with the abatement of bpaf these compounds may be further oxidized by ferrate in comparison the content of p9 ring cleavage product increased in the reaction process after 10 min of reaction the relative content of bpaf p6 p7 and p9 is on the same magnitude while the content of p8 is one magnitude lower this suggests that hydroxylation and ring cleavage reactions may be the dominant processes in the ferrate oxidation of bpaf based on the detected oxidation products and speculated reaction mechanism the ferrate oxidation pathways of bps and bpaf are proposed fig 5 ferrate initially attacks the phenol moiety electron rich moiety of bp bps bpaf and acquire one electron the bp were transformed into phenoxy radicals rs1 and rf1 and other resonance forms rs2 rs3 rf2 and rf3 due to the delocalization of the unpaired electron the radicals rs2 and rf2 with high electron density at ortho position would react with ferrate through oxygen transfer process leading to the formation of hydroxylation products p2 p3 p4 in bps and p6 p7 in bpaf li et al 2018b the radicals rs3 and rf3 with high electron density at para position would undergo β scission process walling and padwa 1963 with the formation of radicals rs5 and rf5 and cations rs4 and rf4 subsequently these compounds would transform into s c bond cleavage products p5 and hydroquinone in bps and c c bond cleavage products p8 and hydroquinone in bpaf for the hydroxylated benzene ring it may be further oxidized by ferrate leading to the formation of di hydroxy products the chemical structure of hydroquinone and di hydroxy ortho position products is not stable and would be oxidized into ring cleavage and hydrogen atom transfer products han et al 2015 xie et al 2016 the ring cleavage products may be further transformed into lower molecular weight products p9 in the reaction of bps with ferrate self coupling process would happen and result in the formation of low level of p1 in comparison the bpaf was stepwise oxidized by ferrate and no self coupling product was identified 3 3 biodegradability of the oxidation products bps and bpaf are used as bpa substitutes mainly because they are stable and resistant to photo and bio degradation however chemical stability also leads to environmental resistance previous study showed when the initial chlorine bps molar ratio was 30 1 over 90 of bps was removed within 15 min gao et al 2018 for the reaction of ferrate with bps when the initial ferrate bps molar ratio was 10 1 the content of bps decreases below 5 within 5 min fig 6 a when the ferrate bps molar ratios increased to 15 1 20 1 and 30 1 the elimination time of bps below detection limit decreased to 60 s 20 s and 10 s respectively similarly when the initial ferrate bpaf molar ratio was 10 1 over 94 of bpaf was removed within 10 min fig 6b when the ferrate bpaf molar ratio increased to 15 1 5 μm of bpaf was removed within 5 min as the ferrate bpaf molar ratios increased to 20 1 and 30 1 the elimination time of bpaf dropped to1 5 min and 0 5 min respectively since bps and bpaf are bio accumulative and can disrupt human metabolism at low concentration kitamura et al 2005 ruan et al 2015 high removal efficiency is important for preventing their accumulation in ecosystems besides transformation efficiency the variation of toc content in bps and bpaf bps 0 20 μm bpaf 0 20 μm groups is investigated fig 6c generally when treated by 100 μm 200 μm 300 μm 400 μm of ferrate around 10 15 20 and 25 of toc were removed from the solution respectively compared with that in bpaf samples more toc was removed in bps samples the organic compound may be mineralized by the ferrate when the applied dosage of ferrate increased to 600 μm around 40 of toc in both groups was removed ferrate could effectively oxidize bps and bpaf in aqueous solution and the variation of aoc content in relevant samples is determined to study the bio degradability of ferrate oxidation products of bps and bpaf fig 6d when the initial ferrate bps molar ratio is 5 1 the aoc content decreased by 5 in bps group while increased by 85 in bpaf group there are two main reaction pathways for the ferrate oxidation of bps self coupling and oxygen transfer fig 5 low level of ferrate may not fully degrade bps into lower molecular weight products while some bps molecules were self coupled and resist to biodegradation in comparison the bpaf was stepwise degraded by ferrate and the biodegradability was increased accordingly after the ferrate bp molar ratios increased to 10 1 15 1 20 1 and 30 1 the aoc content in bps group was increased by 28 57 86 and 107 respectively in comparison the aoc content in bpaf group was increased by 156 232 212 and 209 respectively compared with that of bps the improvement of bpaf biodegradability by ferrate oxidation was much higher as discussed in above paragraph the formation of self coupling products may decrease the biodegradation potential of ferrate oxidation products of bps in comparison bpaf could be stepwise oxidized into lower molecular weight products and these organics may be easy to be bio consumed the effects of bpaf bps and their ferrate oxidation products on the growth of e coli were further investigated fig 7 overall the peak value of e coli od600 in control group was 2 46 and the growth curve of e coli in control group is normal lag phase 0 3 5 h logarithmic phase 3 5 23 h and stationary phase 23 48 h fig 7a in comparison the peak value of e coli od600 in bpaf group was 0 84 and the lag phase of e coli in this group ranged from 0 to 16 5 h this suggests that bpaf inhibited the growth of e coli compared with that in bpaf group the growth of e coli in bps group was not obviously affected the antimicrobial effect of bps 20 μm on e coli was not intense for the e coli cultured in the oxidation products of bps and bpaf its growth condition was better than that in control group and bps group and much better than that in bpaf group for example the peak value of e coli growth curve in control group was 2 46 while for the e coli in the fe vi bps 20 1 fe vi bpaf 20 1 fe vi bps 30 1 and fe vi bpaf 30 1 groups the peak values of the growth curves were 2 58 2 96 3 22 and 3 01 respectively these data suggest that the antimicrobial effect of bpaf towards e coli was eliminated after ferrate oxidation meanwhile for the microbes in lag phase and logarithmic phase the growth condition of e coli in fe vi bps 30 1 and fe vi bpaf 30 1 groups was better than that in fe vi bps 20 1 and fe vi bpaf 20 1 groups this may be because that higher level of ferrate further oxidized some intermediate products in the system and the lower molecular weight products formed in the reaction process are easy to be bio consumed these results are in accordance with the variation of aoc content in relevant samples fig 7d which the antimicrobial activity of bpaf was largely removed after ferrate oxidation leading to the increasement of aoc content in comparison the antimicrobial activity of bps was not as strong as that of bpaf and thus the increasement of aoc content in relevant groups was not as high as those in bpaf samples the data in e coli culture experiment further suggests that ferrate oxidation would eliminate the antimicrobial effect of bpaf towards e coli and the oxidation products were not highly toxic and can be consumed by microbe 3 4 effects of ha on the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate humic acids ha ubiquitously exist in the environment and would affect the transformation of environment pollutants liu et al 2018b xu et al 2018b the effects of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf are investigated fig 8 generally the influence of ha on the oxidation of bps with ferrate was more obvious than that of bpaf for the oxidation of bps in pure water over 95 of bps was removed within 10 min as the initial ferrate bps molar ratio is 10 1 however the transformation efficiencies were decreased to 92 77 and 61 respectively when the solution contained 1 3 and 5 mg c l of ha ha decreased the transformation of bps with ferrate especially under high concentrations compared with that of bps the transformation of bpaf with ferrate was also influenced but to a less extent when the solution contained 1 3 and 5 mg c l of ha the bpaf transformation ratios were decreased to 93 87 and 81 respectively while over 96 of bpaf was removed by ferrate in pure water within 30 min ha can react with ferrate and competitively consume it leading to the insufficient oxidation of target pollutants previous studies gao et al 2018 wenk et al 2011 investigated the effect of ha on the oxidation of organic pollutants and speculated that ha would react with the oxidation intermediates oi and reduce them into the parent form with the presence of ha the transformation rate of oi and bp bps or bpaf can be interpreted by eq 1 1 l n c t c 0 k a p p c 0 t f e v i d t where ct and c0 represent the content of target compound at specific reaction time 0 t fe vi dt represents the exposure of oxidant ferrate kapp c represents the second order rate constant calculated by studying the decay of target compound when ferrate is in 10 fold excess considering that bp would be oxidized by ferrate with the formation of oi k1 represents the second order rate constant of ferrate with bp ha 0 mg l the oi would be further oxidized by ferrate k2 represents the second order rate constant of oi with ferrate and the oi would be reduced by ha into the parent form k3 represents the second order rate constant for the reduction of oi with ha the transformation of bp and oi could be interpreted by following equations 2 d bp d t k a p p c bp fe v i k 3 oi ha k 1 bp fe v i 3 d oi d t k 1 bp fe v i k 3 oi ha k 2 oi 4 oi k 1 bp fe v i k 2 k 3 ha 5 d bp d t k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 ha bp fe v i 6 k a p p c k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 ha 7 1 k a p p c 1 k 1 k 3 k 1 k 2 h a fig 8c and d shows the correlation of the determined second order constants in the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf with the presence of ha the r2 values of the 1 k a p p c with the presence of different amount of ha are 0 95 and 0 99 respectively this suggests that there are good linear relationships between the calculated 1 k a p p c and ha content according to the model fitting results the k1 values for the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf with the presence of ha are 1 4 103 m 1s 1 and 3 1 102 m 1s 1 respectively this result is in accordance with above data fig 2 in which ferrate is more reactive with bps than bpaf in comparison the k3 k2 values for the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf with the presence of ha are 0 324 and 0 049 respectively considering that k2 represents the rate constant for the ferrate oxidation of oi while k3 represents the rate constant for the reduction of oi with ha this result indicates that high level of oi formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be reduced by ha while to a less extent of bpaf oi may be reduced by ha besides the self coupling product dimer formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be transformed back to bps with the presence of ha while most products formed in the ferrate oxidation of bpaf were hydroxylation products and ring cleavage products fig 5 hence the effects of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps were more obvious than the ferrate oxidation of bpaf 3 5 transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate in authentic waters in above sections we found that ha would negatively affect the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate in addition to ha background ions and dissolved organics exist in natural waters and they may also influence the ferrate oxidation process the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate in authentic waters surface water ground water and wwtp effluent was examined fig 9 over 96 of bps was removed in pure water by ferrate within 10 min in comparison the transformation efficiencies of bps surpassed 92 in both surface water and ground water this suggests that the background constituents in the surface water and ground water did not greatly influence the transformation of bps with ferrate after 10 min of reaction 6 8 μm of ferrate was residual in pure water group while less than 2 μm of ferrate was residual in wwtp effluent group fig 9c the organics in wwtp competitively consumed ferrate and decreased the transformation ratio of bps only 50 of bps was oxidized by ferrate in wwtp in this process for the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf in authentic waters ferrate was transformed into ferric nano particles and settled at the bottom of the reactor the content of ferric ion in all water samples was below 0 3 mg l that can satisfy the drinking water standard of china gb5749 2006 on fe concentration for the bpaf in pure water surface water and ground water the ferrate oxidation efficiencies were 95 83 and 90 within 10 min respectively during this period 42 μm 45 μm and 43 μm of ferrate were consumed when reacted in wwtp effluent less than 45 of bpaf was oxidized and over 48 μm of ferrate was consumed based on these results low level of ferrate ferrate target compounds 10 1 or 15 1 can be used for the elimination of bps and bpaf in surface water and ground water while high level of ferrate ferrate target compounds 20 1 has to be applied for the efficient removal of bps and bpaf in wwtp 4 conclusions this study compared the ferrate oxidation of bps and bpaf in terms of reaction kinetics reaction mechanism and the biodegradability of oxidation products following conclusions were obtained 1 the reactions of ferrate with bps and bpaf were ph dependent and followed second order rate law bps was more readily oxidized by ferrate than that of bpaf under circumneutral ph conditions 2 two dominant reaction pathways for the reaction of ferrate with bps were i bps self coupling process with the formation of dimer ii oxygen transfer process with the formation of benzene ring cleavage products in comparison oxygen transfer was the dominant process for the ferrate oxidation of bpaf 3 compared with bps ferrate oxidation products the biodegradability of bpaf ferrate oxidation products was higher the dimers formed in the oxidation of bps may hard to be bio consumed ferrate oxidation would remove the antimicrobial effect of bpaf towards e coli and the oxidation products were not toxic 4 the presence of ha decreased the transformation of bps and bpaf with ferrate and the effects of ha on the ferrate oxidation of bps were more obvious than the ferrate oxidation of bpaf high level of oxidation intermediates formed in the ferrate oxidation of bps may be reduced by ha while to a less extent of bpaf oxidation intermediates may be reduced ferrate can be used for the control of bps and bpaf in source water acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national key r

19187,a new standard metric has been developed to express the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode in consideration of the electrode reactions the adsorption experiments were carried out by changing the cell potentials 0 6 1 6 v in the mcdi unit cell the point at which the electrode reactions occur was determined from the change in instantaneous charge efficiency during the adsorption process then the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode at this point was defined as the maximum allowable charge mac the mac values were constant at 59 c g irrespective of cell potentials in addition the salt adsorption capacity s a c m a c and the charge efficiency at mac were approximately 16 mg g and 91 respectively regardless of the cell potentials furthermore the equivalent circuit analysis for the mcdi cell revealed that faradaic reactions rarely occur at the mac the mac is the maximum charge that can be supplied to the carbon electrode without electrode reactions it is also unaffected by the cell components and operating conditions of the mcdi cell therefore the mac is expected to be a useful metric to objectively express the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization salt adsorption capacity charge efficiency electrode reaction maximum allowable charge 1 introduction as population growth and industrialization accelerate the demand for water continues to rise however it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure the necessary water resources with the impact of climate change thus various desalination technologies have been actively pursued to solve the water shortage problem by producing fresh water from brine and seawater elimelech and phillip 2011 since the 2000s there has been a growing interest in capacitive deionization cdi technology which has been known to have low energy consumption and a high recovery rate anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 cdi is a desalination technology that removes ions through electrostatic attraction by applying an electric potential to the electrode the amount of ion removal is proportional to the adsorption capacity of the electrode therefore utilizing an electrode with high adsorption capacity is the most important factor in the development of cdi technology huang et al 2017 indeed over the last two decades remarkable levels of carbon electrodes have been developed through a number of studies high performance carbon electrodes using various carbon materials such as activated carbon powder carbon nanotubes carbon aerogels carbon fibers and graphene have been developed huang et al 2012 2017 jia and zou 2012 li et al 2008 2009 nie et al 2012 xu et al 2008 carbon electrodes with enhanced adsorption capacity have also been made by controlling the pore size distribution in the carbon body or by surface modification cohen et al 2011 duan et al 2015 gao et al 2016 tsouris et al 2011 zou et al 2008 in addition the desalination performance of the cdi has been enhanced by modifying the cell structure in particular the membrane cdi mcdi which combines ion exchange membranes iems on the surface of the carbon electrode could drastically improve the low charge efficiency of the cdi biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 biesheuvel et al 2011 kim and choi 2010 lee et al 2006 zhao et al 2013 currently mcdi is mainly applied to the actual desalination processes the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes used in m cdi cells is indicated by the salt adsorption capacity sac sac is measured by adsorption desorption experiments in m cdi cells at a given cell potential the carbon electrode reaches equilibrium at a sufficiently long adsorption time the cell potential must be applied until the cell charging is complete and the effluent concentration no longer changes over time the measured sac at this state is called the maximum sac msac porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 since msac is measured at equilibrium it can be a standard metric that indicates the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode however most cdi related papers have reported sac values without any mention of the adsorption equilibrium porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 if equilibrium is not reached in the adsorption experiment the sac value may vary depending on the cell components theoretically m cdi is a desalination technology that uses a non faradaic charging current suss et al 2015 however electrode reactions faradaic reactions may occur depending on the cell potential applied to the m cdi cell choi 2014 cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2014 he et al 2016 the main reactions occurring at the carbon electrode are the oxidation of carbon and water and the reduction of dissolved oxygen and carbon tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 electrode reactions cause several serious problems during the desalination process particularly the oxidation reactions of carbon deteriorate the structural characteristics of the carbon electrode shortening the lifetime of the m cdi system and deteriorating the desalination performance additionally the reaction products may cause contamination of the treated water and scale formation cohen et al 2013 he et al 2016 lu and cai 2017 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 as described above electrode reactions in m cdi cause many serious problems however most of the m sac values presented in the literature do not consider the electrode reactions during the adsorption process in addition the sac value can vary depending on the measurement conditions such as the cell potential the concentration of feed solution and the spacer thickness in the cell porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to develop a standard metric measured without electrode reactions to objectively describe the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode the electrode reactions are affected by the electrode potential not the cell potential the electrode potential is proportional to the electric charge accumulated in the electrode the total charge accumulated in the electrode at the beginning of the electrode reaction was defined as the maximum allowable charge mac in this study since the mac is based on the charge supplied to the carbon electrode it is not influenced by the cell components i e types of iems feed concentration spacer thickness etc therefore the mac can be considered a standard metric that can objectively represent the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode used in m cdi system in this study we investigated the feasibility of mac as a new standard metric to express the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes the desalination experiments were carried out while changing the cell potential in the mcdi unit cell the instantaneous charge efficiencies were calculated to determine the point at which the electrode reactions begin we measured the mac values at each cell potential and analyzed the sac and charge efficiency at the mac in addition the validity of mac was verified by the equivalent circuit analysis for mcdi cells 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of carbon electrodes and the structure of the mcdi unit cell a carbon electrodes used for the mcdi unit cell were prepared using activated carbon powder cep 21k pct co korea carbon powder and sbr emulsion eq lib sbr mti co usa were mixed and stirred in a planetary centrifugal mixer ar 100 thinky co japan for 30 min to prepare a uniform electrode slurry the slurry was cast on a graphite foil f02511 dongbang carbon co korea as a current collector and dried in a drying oven at 50 c for 3 h the sbr binder content was 10 wt and the mass per unit area was approximately 9 30 mg cm2 the prepared carbon electrode was cut into a circular shape with a 9 5 cm diameter and used in the mcdi unit cell the neosepta amx membrane astom co japan was attached to the surface of the anodic carbon electrode and the neosepta cmx to the cathodic carbon electrode a 180 μm thick spacer ex31 071 80 pw nbc meshtec inc japan was inserted between the iems to supply the feed solution a hole with a diameter of 1 cm was formed at the center of the carbon electrode and the iems so that the influent flowed from the edge of the carbon electrode through the spacer and out through the central hole the fabrication of the carbon electrode and the structure of the mcdi cell are described in detail in our previous papers choi 2014 park and choi 2019 2 2 desalination experiments using the mcdi unit cell all mcdi experiments were performed by the single pass method in which the effluent water exiting the cell was discarded desalination experiments were carried out while supplying a 1000 mg l nacl solution to the mcdi unit cell at a flow rate of 30 ml min the cell was powered through a potentiostat wpg100 wona tech co korea all desalination experiments were performed at constant voltage mode the adsorption continued for 400 s at a constant cell potential and the cell potential was immediately changed to 0 0 v for desorption for 400 s the adsorption experiments were carried out at the cell potentials of 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v to analyze the desalination characteristics according to the cell potential the adsorption desorption experiments at each cell potential were repeated three times in succession to reach the dynamic steady state to verify the reproducibility of the experimental results mcdi cell was constructed with a new carbon electrode and the same experiments were repeated three times the cell potential current and electric charge supplied to the cell were measured at intervals of 2 s through the potentiostat operating software the conductivity and ph probe con bta ph bta vernier software technology usa were installed at the point where the effluent exited the mcdi cell interface labquest vernier software technology usa was connected to a computer to collect the conductivity and ph data of the effluent at 2 s intervals the nacl concentration of the effluent was calculated using the correlation between the conductivity and the concentration of nacl solution the nacl concentration was calculated after correcting the effluent conductivity to reflect the effluent ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of effluent concentration and ph according to the cell potentials fig 1 shows the change in nacl concentration a and ph b of the effluent at each cell potential concentration changes of effluent show typical mcdi desalination results biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 omosebi et al 2014 as soon as the potential was applied to the cell the effluent concentration decreased drastically as the ions adsorbed on the carbon electrodes the adsorption rate decreased as the adsorption capacity was reached at the given cell potential and the concentration of the effluent tended gradually to increase as the cell potential increases the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode increases as a result the concentration decreased more in proportion to the cell potential fig 1 b shows the ph changes of the effluent during the adsorption process the effluent ph was kept constant without significant change at the cell potential of 0 6 and 0 8 v however the ph began to change at a cell potential of 1 0 v the ph was significantly reduced to 4 0 at a cell potential of 1 6 v the ph change of effluent during mcdi operation is due to the electrode reactions when the cell potential exceeds the overpotential the effluent ph decreases due to the hydrogen ions generated by the oxidation reactions of the carbon and water at the anode choi 2014 tang et al 2017 the change in ph starting at 1 0 v indicates the start of the electrode reactions 3 2 salt adsorption capacity and charge efficiency according to cell potentials fig 1 a shows that the effluent concentration is equal to the feed concentration at the end of the adsorption process this finding indicates that the adsorption has reached equilibrium at a given cell potential the msac and charge efficiency λ were calculated from the effluent concentration and total charge supplied to the cell at each cell potential using the equations below kim and choi 2010 as shown in fig 2 1 msac mg g v c o c a v g w 2 λ f v c o c a v g m i d t 100 where v is the total volume of feed solution supplied to the cell during the adsorption process c o and c a v g are the feed concentration and average effluent concentration respectively w is the mass of anode and cathode carbon electrode including active carbon and binder f is the faraday constant m is the molecular mass of nacl and i is the current supplied to the cell as can be predicted from the effluent concentration the msac increased in proportion to the cell potentials when the cell potential increased from 0 6 to 1 6 v the msac increased 3 4 fold from 8 2 to 28 0 mg g however the increase rate of msac reduced slightly from the cell potential of 1 2 v in the ph change of effluent fig 1 b the electrode reaction was initiated at 1 0 v as the cell potential exceeded 1 0 v the more reactions occurred at the carbon electrode resulting in a decrease of ion adsorption the electrode reaction can also be confirmed by the change of charge efficiency according to the cell potential at a cell potential of 0 6 1 0 v the charge efficiencies remained constant at approximately 92 however charge efficiency began to decrease at 1 2 v and dropped to 85 at 1 6 v to be an objective metric for comparing and evaluating the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes it is necessary for the metric to show a constant value regardless of the measurement conditions however as seen in fig 2 msac showed a large difference according to the cell potential moreover the msac value measured at the potential with the electrode reactions is meaningless in terms of stable operation of the mcdi thus msac has a limitation in describing the actual adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes used in m cdi 3 3 maximum allowable charge mac as a standard metric of adsorption capacity when a current is supplied to the mcdi cell electric charges are accumulated in the carbon electrode and the electrode potentials of the anode and cathode increase additionally a voltage drop occurs due to the cell components iems feed stream therefore the cell potential can be regarded as the sum of the electrode potentials and the voltage drops of the resistance elements in the mcdi cell the electrode reactions are dominated by the electrode potential not the cell potential the electrode potential increases in proportion to the charge stored in the carbon electrode therefore the electrode reactions begin when a certain amount of charge accumulates in the carbon electrode irrespective of the cell potential electrode reactions in the mcdi cell can be confirmed from the effluent ph change choi 2014 dykstra et al 2017 tang et al 2017 as seen in fig 1 b however it is difficult to determine exactly when the electrode reaction begins therefore we used the instantaneous charge efficiency ice to find the precise point at which the electrode reactions start the effluent concentration and the amount of charge supplied to the cell were measured at 2 s intervals during the adsorption experiments the ices were calculated every 2 s using eq 2 as shown in fig 3 when the mcdi cell is operated at constant voltage mode the current supplied to the cell and the amount of ions adsorbed decrease with time as a result there can be errors in the calculation of ice showing fluctuations as time goes on when the cell potentials were 0 6 v and 0 8 v the ices were approximately 98 during the adsorption process which indicates no electrode reactions occur at these cell potentials on the other hand when the cell potential was higher than 1 0 v high ices are maintained at an early stage and then rapidly decreased as adsorption proceed as shown in fig 3 inset the point at which ice begins to decrease was determined as the starting points of the electrode reactions when the cell potentials were 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v the electrode reactions started at 300 130 100 and 82 s respectively the electrode reaction occurs when the electrode potential reaches overpotential the electrode potential is also proportional to the amount of charge stored in the electrode bard and faulkner 2001 therefore the total charge at the time at which the electrode reactions start is constant regardless of the cell potential in this study the mac was defined as the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode until the electrode reactions began the mac was calculated by dividing the total charge by the mass of one carbon electrode anode or cathode and expressed in units of c g table 1 summarizes the mac values at each cell potential as expected the mac values are constant at approximately 59 c g regardless of the cell potentials for adsorption experiments at the cell potentials of 0 6 and 0 8 v the total charge supplied to the cell were 29 0 and 42 6 c g respectively no electrode reactions occurred at these cell potentials because the total charge supplied did not reach the mac value the sac sacmac and charge efficiency λ m a c at the mac were calculated and are summarized in table 1 regardless of the cell potentials sacmac values were constant at approximately 16 mg g in addition the charge efficiencies were higher than 90 at all cell potentials because no electrode reactions occurred at the mac the mac can be defined as the maximum charge that can be supplied to the carbon electrode without electrode reactions the mac is not affected by the cell potential feed concentration resistances of iems or spacer thickness in the mcdi cell therefore the mac can be used as an objective standard metric indicating the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode while considering the electrode reactions for cases in which sac is the metric of adsorption capacity it seems reasonable to use sac sacmac measured at mac 3 4 determination of faradaic current through the equivalent circuit analysis if electrode reactions occur during the mcdi operation non faradic current i n f and faradaic current i f simultaneously flow through the cell the equivalent circuit analysis for the mcdi cell was conducted to calculate i n f and i f according to the cell potential fig 4 shows the equivalent circuit of the mcdi cell with electrode reactions the carbon electrode with electrode reactions can be regarded as a parallel circuit of a capacitor and a resistor of charge transfer bard and faulkner 2001 qu et al 2015 assuming that the capacitances c d l and charge transfer resistances r c t of the anode and the cathode are the same and the resistances of the iems and feed stream are constant the mcdi cell is equivalent to the series connection of the circuit of fig 4 b to determine the amount of electrode reactions occurring in the mcdi cell non faradaic current has to be calculated the following three relations are established for the equivalent circuit of fig 4 b 3 φ i c e l l r m s q d l c d l 0 4 φ i c e l l r m s i f r c t 0 5 i c e l l i n f i f where φ is half of the cell potential r m s is half of the resistances of the iems r a e m r c e m and feed stream r s o l and q d l is the charge accumulated in the capacitor eqs 6 and 7 can be obtained by rearranging i f and i c e l l from eqs 3 and 5 6 i f q d l r c t c d l 7 i c e l l i n f i f q d l r c t c d l i n f substituting eq 7 into eq 3 and arranging with i n f results in eq 8 8 i n f α r m s c d l q d l φ c d l α where α r m s r c t 1 integrating eq 8 gives eq 9 which shows the charge accumulated in the capacitor over time 9 q d l t φ c d l α 1 exp α t r m s c d l by differentiating eq 9 the non faradaic current flowing to the capacitor can be obtained 10 i n f t d q d l d t φ r m s exp α t r m s c d l i f and i c e l l can be obtained through eqs 5 6 and 9 11 i f t φ α r c t 1 exp α t r m s c d l 12 i c e l l t φ α r c t φ r m s φ α r c t exp α t r m s c d l the c d l r m s and r c t values were obtained by fitting the current data obtained from the mcdi experiments according to eq 12 using sigmaplot software systat software inc the results of data fitting for the cell potential of 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v are shown in fig 5 as a dotted line the results show good agreement with the experimental results therefore analysis of the electrode reactions in the mcdi cell using the equivalent circuit analysis is possible table 2 summarizes the adjustment parameter values c d l r m s and r c t obtained by data fitting the capacitances of the carbon electrode were approximately 80 f regardless of the cell potential as the cell potential increased r m s gradually increased the r m s is the sum of the resistances of the iems and the feed stream increased cell potential allowed more current to flow to the cell and concentration polarization become severe in the feed stream as a result the resistance of the feed stream increased resulting in an increase in r m s according to the cell potential on the other hand the r c t related to the electrode reactions was much higher than the r m s from this the faradaic current is not expected to be large it is notable that r c t decreases with increasing cell potential when multiple reactions occur on a carbon electrode each reaction can be regarded as an individual resistor in an equivalent circuit these resistors are interpreted as a circuit connected in parallel therefore r c t in fig 4 is the combined resistance of the resistors for the individual reaction in a circuit of resistors connected in parallel the combined resistance is less than the individual resistance as the cell potential increases the type of reaction can be varied therefore the combined resistance r c t decreases as the cell potential increases the parameter values in table 2 were substituted into eqs 10 and 11 and the changes of i n f and i f during the adsorption process were examined fig 6 shows the current change as a function of adsorption time when the cell potential is 1 4 v the initial current is mostly used to charge the carbon electrode over time the non faradaic current decreases exponentially and gradually the faradaic current related to the electrode reactions increase from fig 4 the electrode reaction was initiated at 100 s at the cell potential of 1 4 v the non faradaic and faradaic current at this time were 0 207 and 0 008 a respectively indicating that the amount of electrode reaction is negligible the cumulative charges over time at each cell potential were calculated and are shown in fig 7 the non faradaic charges tend to increase sharply and gradually increase over time the faradaic charges on the other hand are much smaller than non faradaic charges at cell potentials of 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v the maximum charges that can be supplied to the electrode were 72 86 and 98 c g respectively however faradaic charges increase simultaneously which can cause severe problems in mcdi operation due to the electrode reactions the mac was measured to be 59 c g regardless of the cell potential the faradaic charges at the mac are approximately 0 8 c g regardless of the cell potential from this it can be concluded that the electrode reactions are negligible when the total charges supplied to the cell are under the mac value 4 conclusion in this study we introduced a new standard metric describing the actual adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes used in mcdi desalination experiments were performed with varying cell potentials for the mcdi unit cell and the point at which the electrode reaction started was determined from the instantaneous charge efficiency the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode until this time was defined as the maximum allowable charge the mac values were approximately 59 c g regardless of cell potential in addition the sacs at mac were approximately 16 mg g and the charge efficiencies were approximately 91 regardless of cell potential faradaic charge at the mac could be neglected through the equivalent circuit analysis for the mcdi cell during the mcdi operation the electrode reactions can cause serious problems such as deterioration of desalination performance contamination of the effluent and scale formation the mac is measured without electrode reactions in addition it is not affected by measurement conditions cell potential and the resistance of cell components thus it is expected that mac can be used as a new standard metric describing the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode by using the mac metric it is possible to make an objective evaluation of the carbon electrodes which can contribute to the improvement of the carbon electrode acknowledgement this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government ministry of education nrf

by changing the cell potentials 0 6 1 6 v in the mcdi unit cell the point at which the electrode reactions occur was determined from the change in instantaneous charge efficiency during the adsorption process then the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode at this point was defined as the maximum allowable charge mac the mac values were constant at 59 c g irrespective of cell potentials in addition the salt adsorption capacity s a c m a c and the charge efficiency at mac were approximately 16 mg g and 91 respectively regardless of the cell potentials furthermore the equivalent circuit analysis for the mcdi cell revealed that faradaic reactions rarely occur at the mac the mac is the maximum charge that can be supplied to the carbon electrode without electrode reactions it is also unaffected by the cell components and operating conditions of the mcdi cell therefore the mac is expected to be a useful metric to objectively express the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization salt adsorption capacity charge efficiency electrode reaction maximum allowable charge 1 introduction as population growth and industrialization accelerate the demand for water continues to rise however it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure the necessary water resources with the impact of climate change thus various desalination technologies have been actively pursued to solve the water shortage problem by producing fresh water from brine and seawater elimelech and phillip 2011 since the 2000s there has been a growing interest in capacitive deionization cdi technology which has been known to have low energy consumption and a high recovery rate anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 cdi is a desalination technology that removes ions through electrostatic attraction by applying an electric potential to the electrode the amount of ion removal is proportional to the adsorption capacity of the electrode therefore utilizing an electrode with high adsorption capacity is the most important factor in the development of cdi technology huang et al 2017 indeed over the last two decades remarkable levels of carbon electrodes have been developed through a number of studies high performance carbon electrodes using various carbon materials such as activated carbon powder carbon nanotubes carbon aerogels carbon fibers and graphene have been developed huang et al 2012 2017 jia and zou 2012 li et al 2008 2009 nie et al 2012 xu et al 2008 carbon electrodes with enhanced adsorption capacity have also been made by controlling the pore size distribution in the carbon body or by surface modification cohen et al 2011 duan et al 2015 gao et al 2016 tsouris et al 2011 zou et al 2008 in addition the desalination performance of the cdi has been enhanced by modifying the cell structure in particular the membrane cdi mcdi which combines ion exchange membranes iems on the surface of the carbon electrode could drastically improve the low charge efficiency of the cdi biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 biesheuvel et al 2011 kim and choi 2010 lee et al 2006 zhao et al 2013 currently mcdi is mainly applied to the actual desalination processes the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes used in m cdi cells is indicated by the salt adsorption capacity sac sac is measured by adsorption desorption experiments in m cdi cells at a given cell potential the carbon electrode reaches equilibrium at a sufficiently long adsorption time the cell potential must be applied until the cell charging is complete and the effluent concentration no longer changes over time the measured sac at this state is called the maximum sac msac porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 since msac is measured at equilibrium it can be a standard metric that indicates the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode however most cdi related papers have reported sac values without any mention of the adsorption equilibrium porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 if equilibrium is not reached in the adsorption experiment the sac value may vary depending on the cell components theoretically m cdi is a desalination technology that uses a non faradaic charging current suss et al 2015 however electrode reactions faradaic reactions may occur depending on the cell potential applied to the m cdi cell choi 2014 cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2014 he et al 2016 the main reactions occurring at the carbon electrode are the oxidation of carbon and water and the reduction of dissolved oxygen and carbon tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 electrode reactions cause several serious problems during the desalination process particularly the oxidation reactions of carbon deteriorate the structural characteristics of the carbon electrode shortening the lifetime of the m cdi system and deteriorating the desalination performance additionally the reaction products may cause contamination of the treated water and scale formation cohen et al 2013 he et al 2016 lu and cai 2017 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 as described above electrode reactions in m cdi cause many serious problems however most of the m sac values presented in the literature do not consider the electrode reactions during the adsorption process in addition the sac value can vary depending on the measurement conditions such as the cell potential the concentration of feed solution and the spacer thickness in the cell porada et al 2013a b suss et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to develop a standard metric measured without electrode reactions to objectively describe the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode the electrode reactions are affected by the electrode potential not the cell potential the electrode potential is proportional to the electric charge accumulated in the electrode the total charge accumulated in the electrode at the beginning of the electrode reaction was defined as the maximum allowable charge mac in this study since the mac is based on the charge supplied to the carbon electrode it is not influenced by the cell components i e types of iems feed concentration spacer thickness etc therefore the mac can be considered a standard metric that can objectively represent the actual adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode used in m cdi system in this study we investigated the feasibility of mac as a new standard metric to express the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes the desalination experiments were carried out while changing the cell potential in the mcdi unit cell the instantaneous charge efficiencies were calculated to determine the point at which the electrode reactions begin we measured the mac values at each cell potential and analyzed the sac and charge efficiency at the mac in addition the validity of mac was verified by the equivalent circuit analysis for mcdi cells 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of carbon electrodes and the structure of the mcdi unit cell a carbon electrodes used for the mcdi unit cell were prepared using activated carbon powder cep 21k pct co korea carbon powder and sbr emulsion eq lib sbr mti co usa were mixed and stirred in a planetary centrifugal mixer ar 100 thinky co japan for 30 min to prepare a uniform electrode slurry the slurry was cast on a graphite foil f02511 dongbang carbon co korea as a current collector and dried in a drying oven at 50 c for 3 h the sbr binder content was 10 wt and the mass per unit area was approximately 9 30 mg cm2 the prepared carbon electrode was cut into a circular shape with a 9 5 cm diameter and used in the mcdi unit cell the neosepta amx membrane astom co japan was attached to the surface of the anodic carbon electrode and the neosepta cmx to the cathodic carbon electrode a 180 μm thick spacer ex31 071 80 pw nbc meshtec inc japan was inserted between the iems to supply the feed solution a hole with a diameter of 1 cm was formed at the center of the carbon electrode and the iems so that the influent flowed from the edge of the carbon electrode through the spacer and out through the central hole the fabrication of the carbon electrode and the structure of the mcdi cell are described in detail in our previous papers choi 2014 park and choi 2019 2 2 desalination experiments using the mcdi unit cell all mcdi experiments were performed by the single pass method in which the effluent water exiting the cell was discarded desalination experiments were carried out while supplying a 1000 mg l nacl solution to the mcdi unit cell at a flow rate of 30 ml min the cell was powered through a potentiostat wpg100 wona tech co korea all desalination experiments were performed at constant voltage mode the adsorption continued for 400 s at a constant cell potential and the cell potential was immediately changed to 0 0 v for desorption for 400 s the adsorption experiments were carried out at the cell potentials of 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v to analyze the desalination characteristics according to the cell potential the adsorption desorption experiments at each cell potential were repeated three times in succession to reach the dynamic steady state to verify the reproducibility of the experimental results mcdi cell was constructed with a new carbon electrode and the same experiments were repeated three times the cell potential current and electric charge supplied to the cell were measured at intervals of 2 s through the potentiostat operating software the conductivity and ph probe con bta ph bta vernier software technology usa were installed at the point where the effluent exited the mcdi cell interface labquest vernier software technology usa was connected to a computer to collect the conductivity and ph data of the effluent at 2 s intervals the nacl concentration of the effluent was calculated using the correlation between the conductivity and the concentration of nacl solution the nacl concentration was calculated after correcting the effluent conductivity to reflect the effluent ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of effluent concentration and ph according to the cell potentials fig 1 shows the change in nacl concentration a and ph b of the effluent at each cell potential concentration changes of effluent show typical mcdi desalination results biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 omosebi et al 2014 as soon as the potential was applied to the cell the effluent concentration decreased drastically as the ions adsorbed on the carbon electrodes the adsorption rate decreased as the adsorption capacity was reached at the given cell potential and the concentration of the effluent tended gradually to increase as the cell potential increases the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode increases as a result the concentration decreased more in proportion to the cell potential fig 1 b shows the ph changes of the effluent during the adsorption process the effluent ph was kept constant without significant change at the cell potential of 0 6 and 0 8 v however the ph began to change at a cell potential of 1 0 v the ph was significantly reduced to 4 0 at a cell potential of 1 6 v the ph change of effluent during mcdi operation is due to the electrode reactions when the cell potential exceeds the overpotential the effluent ph decreases due to the hydrogen ions generated by the oxidation reactions of the carbon and water at the anode choi 2014 tang et al 2017 the change in ph starting at 1 0 v indicates the start of the electrode reactions 3 2 salt adsorption capacity and charge efficiency according to cell potentials fig 1 a shows that the effluent concentration is equal to the feed concentration at the end of the adsorption process this finding indicates that the adsorption has reached equilibrium at a given cell potential the msac and charge efficiency λ were calculated from the effluent concentration and total charge supplied to the cell at each cell potential using the equations below kim and choi 2010 as shown in fig 2 1 msac mg g v c o c a v g w 2 λ f v c o c a v g m i d t 100 where v is the total volume of feed solution supplied to the cell during the adsorption process c o and c a v g are the feed concentration and average effluent concentration respectively w is the mass of anode and cathode carbon electrode including active carbon and binder f is the faraday constant m is the molecular mass of nacl and i is the current supplied to the cell as can be predicted from the effluent concentration the msac increased in proportion to the cell potentials when the cell potential increased from 0 6 to 1 6 v the msac increased 3 4 fold from 8 2 to 28 0 mg g however the increase rate of msac reduced slightly from the cell potential of 1 2 v in the ph change of effluent fig 1 b the electrode reaction was initiated at 1 0 v as the cell potential exceeded 1 0 v the more reactions occurred at the carbon electrode resulting in a decrease of ion adsorption the electrode reaction can also be confirmed by the change of charge efficiency according to the cell potential at a cell potential of 0 6 1 0 v the charge efficiencies remained constant at approximately 92 however charge efficiency began to decrease at 1 2 v and dropped to 85 at 1 6 v to be an objective metric for comparing and evaluating the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes it is necessary for the metric to show a constant value regardless of the measurement conditions however as seen in fig 2 msac showed a large difference according to the cell potential moreover the msac value measured at the potential with the electrode reactions is meaningless in terms of stable operation of the mcdi thus msac has a limitation in describing the actual adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes used in m cdi 3 3 maximum allowable charge mac as a standard metric of adsorption capacity when a current is supplied to the mcdi cell electric charges are accumulated in the carbon electrode and the electrode potentials of the anode and cathode increase additionally a voltage drop occurs due to the cell components iems feed stream therefore the cell potential can be regarded as the sum of the electrode potentials and the voltage drops of the resistance elements in the mcdi cell the electrode reactions are dominated by the electrode potential not the cell potential the electrode potential increases in proportion to the charge stored in the carbon electrode therefore the electrode reactions begin when a certain amount of charge accumulates in the carbon electrode irrespective of the cell potential electrode reactions in the mcdi cell can be confirmed from the effluent ph change choi 2014 dykstra et al 2017 tang et al 2017 as seen in fig 1 b however it is difficult to determine exactly when the electrode reaction begins therefore we used the instantaneous charge efficiency ice to find the precise point at which the electrode reactions start the effluent concentration and the amount of charge supplied to the cell were measured at 2 s intervals during the adsorption experiments the ices were calculated every 2 s using eq 2 as shown in fig 3 when the mcdi cell is operated at constant voltage mode the current supplied to the cell and the amount of ions adsorbed decrease with time as a result there can be errors in the calculation of ice showing fluctuations as time goes on when the cell potentials were 0 6 v and 0 8 v the ices were approximately 98 during the adsorption process which indicates no electrode reactions occur at these cell potentials on the other hand when the cell potential was higher than 1 0 v high ices are maintained at an early stage and then rapidly decreased as adsorption proceed as shown in fig 3 inset the point at which ice begins to decrease was determined as the starting points of the electrode reactions when the cell potentials were 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v the electrode reactions started at 300 130 100 and 82 s respectively the electrode reaction occurs when the electrode potential reaches overpotential the electrode potential is also proportional to the amount of charge stored in the electrode bard and faulkner 2001 therefore the total charge at the time at which the electrode reactions start is constant regardless of the cell potential in this study the mac was defined as the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode until the electrode reactions began the mac was calculated by dividing the total charge by the mass of one carbon electrode anode or cathode and expressed in units of c g table 1 summarizes the mac values at each cell potential as expected the mac values are constant at approximately 59 c g regardless of the cell potentials for adsorption experiments at the cell potentials of 0 6 and 0 8 v the total charge supplied to the cell were 29 0 and 42 6 c g respectively no electrode reactions occurred at these cell potentials because the total charge supplied did not reach the mac value the sac sacmac and charge efficiency λ m a c at the mac were calculated and are summarized in table 1 regardless of the cell potentials sacmac values were constant at approximately 16 mg g in addition the charge efficiencies were higher than 90 at all cell potentials because no electrode reactions occurred at the mac the mac can be defined as the maximum charge that can be supplied to the carbon electrode without electrode reactions the mac is not affected by the cell potential feed concentration resistances of iems or spacer thickness in the mcdi cell therefore the mac can be used as an objective standard metric indicating the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode while considering the electrode reactions for cases in which sac is the metric of adsorption capacity it seems reasonable to use sac sacmac measured at mac 3 4 determination of faradaic current through the equivalent circuit analysis if electrode reactions occur during the mcdi operation non faradic current i n f and faradaic current i f simultaneously flow through the cell the equivalent circuit analysis for the mcdi cell was conducted to calculate i n f and i f according to the cell potential fig 4 shows the equivalent circuit of the mcdi cell with electrode reactions the carbon electrode with electrode reactions can be regarded as a parallel circuit of a capacitor and a resistor of charge transfer bard and faulkner 2001 qu et al 2015 assuming that the capacitances c d l and charge transfer resistances r c t of the anode and the cathode are the same and the resistances of the iems and feed stream are constant the mcdi cell is equivalent to the series connection of the circuit of fig 4 b to determine the amount of electrode reactions occurring in the mcdi cell non faradaic current has to be calculated the following three relations are established for the equivalent circuit of fig 4 b 3 φ i c e l l r m s q d l c d l 0 4 φ i c e l l r m s i f r c t 0 5 i c e l l i n f i f where φ is half of the cell potential r m s is half of the resistances of the iems r a e m r c e m and feed stream r s o l and q d l is the charge accumulated in the capacitor eqs 6 and 7 can be obtained by rearranging i f and i c e l l from eqs 3 and 5 6 i f q d l r c t c d l 7 i c e l l i n f i f q d l r c t c d l i n f substituting eq 7 into eq 3 and arranging with i n f results in eq 8 8 i n f α r m s c d l q d l φ c d l α where α r m s r c t 1 integrating eq 8 gives eq 9 which shows the charge accumulated in the capacitor over time 9 q d l t φ c d l α 1 exp α t r m s c d l by differentiating eq 9 the non faradaic current flowing to the capacitor can be obtained 10 i n f t d q d l d t φ r m s exp α t r m s c d l i f and i c e l l can be obtained through eqs 5 6 and 9 11 i f t φ α r c t 1 exp α t r m s c d l 12 i c e l l t φ α r c t φ r m s φ α r c t exp α t r m s c d l the c d l r m s and r c t values were obtained by fitting the current data obtained from the mcdi experiments according to eq 12 using sigmaplot software systat software inc the results of data fitting for the cell potential of 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v are shown in fig 5 as a dotted line the results show good agreement with the experimental results therefore analysis of the electrode reactions in the mcdi cell using the equivalent circuit analysis is possible table 2 summarizes the adjustment parameter values c d l r m s and r c t obtained by data fitting the capacitances of the carbon electrode were approximately 80 f regardless of the cell potential as the cell potential increased r m s gradually increased the r m s is the sum of the resistances of the iems and the feed stream increased cell potential allowed more current to flow to the cell and concentration polarization become severe in the feed stream as a result the resistance of the feed stream increased resulting in an increase in r m s according to the cell potential on the other hand the r c t related to the electrode reactions was much higher than the r m s from this the faradaic current is not expected to be large it is notable that r c t decreases with increasing cell potential when multiple reactions occur on a carbon electrode each reaction can be regarded as an individual resistor in an equivalent circuit these resistors are interpreted as a circuit connected in parallel therefore r c t in fig 4 is the combined resistance of the resistors for the individual reaction in a circuit of resistors connected in parallel the combined resistance is less than the individual resistance as the cell potential increases the type of reaction can be varied therefore the combined resistance r c t decreases as the cell potential increases the parameter values in table 2 were substituted into eqs 10 and 11 and the changes of i n f and i f during the adsorption process were examined fig 6 shows the current change as a function of adsorption time when the cell potential is 1 4 v the initial current is mostly used to charge the carbon electrode over time the non faradaic current decreases exponentially and gradually the faradaic current related to the electrode reactions increase from fig 4 the electrode reaction was initiated at 100 s at the cell potential of 1 4 v the non faradaic and faradaic current at this time were 0 207 and 0 008 a respectively indicating that the amount of electrode reaction is negligible the cumulative charges over time at each cell potential were calculated and are shown in fig 7 the non faradaic charges tend to increase sharply and gradually increase over time the faradaic charges on the other hand are much smaller than non faradaic charges at cell potentials of 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 v the maximum charges that can be supplied to the electrode were 72 86 and 98 c g respectively however faradaic charges increase simultaneously which can cause severe problems in mcdi operation due to the electrode reactions the mac was measured to be 59 c g regardless of the cell potential the faradaic charges at the mac are approximately 0 8 c g regardless of the cell potential from this it can be concluded that the electrode reactions are negligible when the total charges supplied to the cell are under the mac value 4 conclusion in this study we introduced a new standard metric describing the actual adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes used in mcdi desalination experiments were performed with varying cell potentials for the mcdi unit cell and the point at which the electrode reaction started was determined from the instantaneous charge efficiency the total charge supplied to the carbon electrode until this time was defined as the maximum allowable charge the mac values were approximately 59 c g regardless of cell potential in addition the sacs at mac were approximately 16 mg g and the charge efficiencies were approximately 91 regardless of cell potential faradaic charge at the mac could be neglected through the equivalent circuit analysis for the mcdi cell during the mcdi operation the electrode reactions can cause serious problems such as deterioration of desalination performance contamination of the effluent and scale formation the mac is measured without electrode reactions in addition it is not affected by measurement conditions cell potential and the resistance of cell components thus it is expected that mac can be used as a new standard metric describing the adsorption capacity of the carbon electrode by using the mac metric it is possible to make an objective evaluation of the carbon electrodes which can contribute to the improvement of the carbon electrode acknowledgement this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government ministry of education nrf

19188,the kinetics and transformation pathway of acetaminophen apap in natural surface water one sample from the yangtze river and three others from different lakes and the changes of aquatic microbes in surface water were revealed in this study both photochemical and microbial reactions contributed to the transformation of apap under irradiance of 1 0 250 mw cm2 microbial compositions were significantly different among surface water and same microbial transformation product 1 4 bezoquinone was detected as the predominant biotransformation intermediate in four studied surface water but the lag phase 12 50 h for the transformation was highly dependent on the aquatic microbial abundance and composition the lag phase no longer existed with irradiance increased to 5 9 mw cm2 aquatic microbial abundance and composition were influenced by the presence of apap and radiation and the influence extent was dependent on microbial species the findings demonstrated that the individual contribution of biotic and abiotic process to the overall transformation of apap and maybe other phenol in surface water varied as the background composition of surface water and the external environment changed and biotransformation dominated 73 the overall transformation of apap in surface water graphical abstract image 1 keywords acetaminophen aquatic microbes biotransformation photo transformation surface water 1 introduction phenolic compounds in the aquatic environment can arise from the degradation of natural substances industrial activities and agricultural practices and have become one of the most widely distributed pollutants in surface waters aguer et al 2005 canonica et al 1995 2000 canonica and hoigné 1995 de laurentiis et al 2013 golanoski et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 identifying the exact transformation process of phenolic compounds would enable a better understanding of their environmental fate and toxicity and would also be helpful for establishing efficient treatment technologies once they enter surface water phenolic compounds undergo various transportation transformation processes including adsorption desorption oxidation reduction bioaccumulation and biotransformation photo transformation induced by colored dissolved organic matter cdom is the predominant chemical transformation process for various phenols numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the transformation of phenols in humic acid or cdom solutions it has been suggested that the excited triplet state of cdom 3cdom is the most important reactive species initiating the transformation of phenols as well as other compounds including herbicides and drugs canonica 2007 canonica et al 2006 golanoski et al 2012 mcneill and canonica 2016 remucal 2014 richard and canonica 2005 the photosensitized transformation of phenols is most likely initiated through one electron extraction from phenol to 3cdom leading to the formation of a long lived phenoxyl radical ph o at a diffusion controlled rate brede et al 2002 canonica et al 2000 it was suggested that ph o is further oxidized or reduced back to its parent compounds canonica et al 1995 wenk and canonica 2012 reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical singlet oxygen or other cdom excited states may also contribute to the chemical transformation of phenols canonica 2007 del vecchio and blough 2004 paul et al 2004 vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 many microbes are capable of degrading phenolic compounds fuchs et al 2011 martínková et al 2016 faust and hoigne 1987 suggested that the biotransformation of phenolic compounds is the only process that efficiently competes with the cdom sensitized chemical transformation process baena nogueras et al 2017 found that biotransformation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in seawater is often faster than photolysis compared with the large number of investigations of chemical transformation in cdom solutions few studies have focused on the microbe induced biotransformation of phenolic compounds in natural surface water baena nogueras et al 2017 e rubin and alexander 1983 shimp and pfaender 1985 polyphenol oxidase and or monophenol oxides can efficiently oxidize phenolic compounds to quinone mukherjee et al 2013 therefore despite the different transformation kinetics the biotransformation of phenolic compounds might lead to the generation of intermediates differing from those produced by the photochemical process it has been shown recently that cdom induced chemical reactions can produce adverse effects on some aquatic bacteria maraccini et al 2016 mostafa et al 2016 romero et al 2011 rosado lausell et al 2013 sun et al 2016 alternation of the microbial community and changes in the abundance of certain microbes may subsequently influence the biotransformation of phenolic compounds in natural surface waters moreover microbes may compete for 3cdom or other ros with phenolic compounds rosado lausell et al 2013 which would influence the chemical transformation of phenolic compounds however the knowledge for the change of aquatic microbes in natural surface water during the transformation of target compound under different experimental conditions were rare because both the chemical and biological transformation of phenolic compounds occurs in surface water the individual contribution of chemical and biological reactions in the overall transformation of phenolic compounds cannot be distinguished easily only through a comparison of the apparent transformation kinetic constants alternately given that the transformation pathway of a phenolic compound likely differs distinctly between chemical and biological reactions the contributions of these two reactions could be revealed through quantification of transformation intermediates acetaminophen apap also known as paracetamol is a typical substituted monophenol apap oligomers and an intermediate with a molecular weight of 183 da referred to as p183 were found to be the predominant intermediates generated in cdom solutions chen et al 2018 de laurentiis et al 2014 li et al 2017 hydroxylation products are the main intermediates formed in reactions involving the hydroxyl radical oh chen et al 2017 feng et al 2015 vogna et al 2002 apap is metabolized primarily in animal liver into nontoxic products and a minor pathway to n acetyl p benzoquinone imine by the cytochromes p450 2e1 1a2 3a4 and 2a6 has also been postulated to occur via a two electron oxidation process james et al 2003 the main intermediates in the transformation of apap in microbe induced biotransformation were identified as p aminophenol 1 4 hydroquinone and 1 4 benzoquinone involving enzyme of amidohydrolase hydrolytic enzyme etc liang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a therefore apap and these primary transformation intermediates maybe used as model reactions to reveal the complex transformation of phenolic compounds in natural surface waters in this study the transformation of apap and the formation of intermediates in four surface water sources the yangtze river and three different lakes were systematically investigated under dark incubation and different irradiance conditions the first objective was to identify the contributions of biological and chemical reactions to the transformation of apap in different surface waters with distinctly different microbial communities and optical characteristics and to identify to what extent the contributions changed with irradiance the second objective was to reveal the change of microbes in natural surface water and the relationship between aquatic microbes and apap s biotransformation the results were helpful for determining the environmental fate of apap in natural surface waters 2 experiments and methods 2 1 materials apap was purchased from alfa aesar morecambe uk apap oligomers apap dimer and trimer were synthesized according to previously reported methods liang et al 2016 1 4 benzoquinone 98 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents shanghai china the method for synthesis and purification of apap oxidation product was provided in a previous study chen et al 2018 all organic solvents high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade and other chemicals were of the highest purity that was commercially available ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm was used throughout the experiments 2 2 transformation of apap in surface water surface water 0 5 m samples 10 l were collected from the yangtze river in the wuhan region and three lakes in wuhan hubei province china on either september 9 2017 or may 20 2018 the details of the sampling sites are provided in the supporting information and the water properties are listed in table s1 the surface water samples were used in apap transformation experiments in order to quantify the trace transformation intermediates and compare with previous studies concentration of apap applied in this study is much higher than its maximum detected environmental concentration 0 2 μmol l campanha et al 2015 liang et al 2016 however the transformation of apap was also carried at low initial concentrations 2 0 and 5 0 μmol l which allowed to assess its environmental fate detailed information for the set up and simulated solar radiation was described in a previous study chen et al 2018 specifically a 100 ml natural surface water solution containing 2 50 μm apap was placed in a 150 ml glass flask a 0 5 ml aliquot was withdrawn to determine the initial concentration c 0 then the solution was either incubated under dark conditions or exposed to different levels of simulated solar radiation 340 800 nm 1 1 5 9 or 250 mw cm2 and the chosen irradiance region covered solar irradiance reached to the studying water surface all the irradiance was measured using an ocean optics usb2000 spectroradiometer largo usa during the reaction process 0 5 ml aliquots were collected centrifuged and immediately analyzed to determine the concentrations at different reaction times c t transformation of aniline 50 μm was also conducted as a reference control that was suggested in oecd guidelines 309 preliminary results showed that the pseudo first order reaction rate for transformation of aniline were ranged from 0 06 0 01 to 0 19 0 03 h 1 with a lag phase ranged from 14 to 44 h in these water samples the results demonstrated that all the water samples used in this study contains an active microbial population the transformation of apap in deionized water or surface water pre filtered through 0 22 μm mixed cellulose filters was also conducted under dark incubation as a control experiment to determine the contribution of hydrolysis or direct oxidation to the transformation of apap transformation of apap in deionized water was also investigated under different irradiance to assess the contribution of direct photolysis to apap s transformation all the experiments were carried out in triplet 2 3 absorption and emission spectra surface water because absorption and emission spectra could provide structural information for cdom that played an important role in the phototransformation of apap the optic spectra of these surface water were characterized water samples were filtrated through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose filter membrane before optical analysis the absorption spectra of surface water samples were recorded on an ultraviolet uv visible spectrometer uv 2550 shimadzu tokyo japan at 25 0 2 c the optical length was 1 cm fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were recorded on a fluorimeter fluorolog 3 horiba instruments at 25 0 2 c the scanning ranges were 250 450 nm for excitation and 300 600 nm for emission the scanning step and slit were 5 and 2 5 nm respectively for both excitation and emission the dwell time was 0 0100 s and the spectrum intensity was corrected using factory measured correction files pure

previous study chen et al 2018 2 4 aquatic microbes under different apap spike concentrations and irradiance because microbes played a key role in the biotic transformation of apap changes of aquatic microbes under different apap spike concentrations and radiation were also investigated specifically three independent 2 l surface water samples were spiked with 5 or 50 μmol l apap for 24 h or directly exposed to 1 1 or 250 mw cm2 simulated solar irradiation and then the solutions were filtered through a pre combusted whatman glass fiber gf c filter φ 47 mm followed by filtration over a 0 22 μm mixed cellulose filter φ 25 mm these mixed cellulose filters were then stored at 20 c prior to the genetic diversity analysis filters that collected the microbes were used to extract dna with a fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals solon usa following the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rdna and its fragment of the isolates was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using a universal primer and the resulting pcr products were sequenced in both directions the forward and reverse primers were 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 for bacteria and its1f 5 cttggtcatttagaggaagtaa 3 and its2r 5 gctgcgttcttcatcgatgc 3 for fungi the amplification reaction program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min 27 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s and an extension at 72 c for 45 s followed by a 10 min extension at 72 c and storage at room temperature the sequences were then determined by shanghai majorbio bio pharm biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the 16s rdna and its sequences were aligned with reference sequences in the silva database http www arb silva de and unite database http unite ut ee index php respectively the results were analyzed by i sanger http www i sanger com the different species between different groups of soil samples were determined based on the operational taxonomic units generated after clustering at a 97 similarity level 2 5 quantification of apap and its transformation products the concentrations of apap and its transformation products were analyzed by hplc with the commercial agents apap and 1 4 benzoquinone or synthesized compounds apap dimer and trimer p183 hplc was performed using the essentia lc 16 pump shimadzu and waters 484 uv detector waters milford ma usa a cosmosil 5c18 ms ii column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm particle size was used for separation of the products the mobile phase was a water acidified with 1 formic acid and methanol mixture v v 70 30 with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the injection volume was 20 μl and the detection wavelength was 250 nm the limit of detection lod of the analysis method was 0 05 0 06 0 30 0 06 0 08 μmol l for apap oxidation product p183 apap 1 4 benzoquinone apap dimer and apap trimer respectively 2 6 apap transformation kinetics the kinetics of apap transformation k obs first order rate constant were determined from the regression of the slope after the lag phase of a plot of apap concentration versus time the length of the lag period was defined as the period before a significant p 0 05 decrease in concentration was observed between successive time increments as determined by the t statistic 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of apap in natural water under dark incubation the transformation of apap in natural water was first investigated under dark incubation and the results are presented in fig 1 there was a lag phase during the transformation of apap in the four natural water samples which was shortest approximately 12 h in nanhu lake water and longest approximately 50 h in donghu lake water as shown in fig s1 lag phase existed for the transformation of apap with an initial concentration of 2 μm which is 6 7 times that of its detected maximum environmental concentration lag phases of 96 and 168 h were reported for the transformation of apap in fresh water and seawater respectively in spain baena nogueras et al 2017 and a lag phase has also been reported in the transformation of apap in the soil water system liang et al 2016 the concentration of apap decreased rapidly after the lag phase the pseudo first order kinetic constant k obs for transformation of apap was comparable in nanhu lake water 0 13 0 02 h 1 yangtze river water 0 14 0 01 h 1 and shahu lake water 0 14 0 02 h 1 while the k obs was only 0 04 0 003 h 1 in donghu lake water the control experiments showed that apap transformation did not occur in either natural water pre filtered through a 0 22 μm filter empty square fig 1a or in deionized water data not shown indicating that the transformation of apap in natural water under dark incubation occurred mainly via a biological process it is generally accepted that the lag phase reflects the time required for adaptation of the corresponding degraders to grow to a level at which an obvious degradation of the substrate can be detected otton et al 2008 after the elimination of apap apap stock solution was added to investigate the second round transformation of apap in natural water as shown in the inset of fig 1a the lag phase disappeared in the second round transformation indicating the adaption of aquatic microbes to apap the main intermediate formed during the transformation of apap under dark incubation was 1 4 benzoquinone although its maximum accumulated concentration occurred at different reaction times among the four water samples fig 1b 1 4 benzoquinone is reportedly one of the main intermediates formed during the transformation of apap in soils li et al 2014 this pathway has not been reported in the cdom induced chemical transformation of apap chen et al 2018 de laurentiis et al 2014 li et al 2017 and it can be used to distinguish the contribution of chemical transformation from microbial reactions in the transformation of apap in natural surface water the formation of 1 4 benzoquinone also indicated the operation of different reactions from those involved in the oxidation of apap by certain enzymes lu et al 2009 potter et al 1985 apap oligomers were found to be the main intermediates in laccase or horseradish peroxidase mediated oxidative reactions lu et al 2009 potter et al 1985 there are different reactions that could lead to the generation of 1 4 benzoquinone for example two electron oxidation of apap by certain enzymes could lead to the formation of n acetyl p benzoquinone imine which is rapidly hydrolyzed to 1 4 benzoquinone bedner and maccrehan 2006 bessems and vermeulen 2001 alternatively polyphenol oxidase and or monophenol oxides which are present in natural water may also oxidize apap to 1 4 benzoquinone valero et al reported that tyrosinase can also oxidize apap to its corresponding o quinone valero et al 2002 2003 there were not enough microbes present in the 2 l yangtze river water for microbial diversity analysis indicating the poor abundance of microbes in yangtze river as shown in fig 2 both the bacterial and fungal community abundances were very different among the different lake water samples the actinobacteria relative abundance of 69 3 1 1 gammaproteobacteria relative abundance of 50 9 7 1 and betaproteobacteria relative abundance of 45 3 5 3 is the most abundant bacterial class in donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively the relative abundance of most dominant bacteria and fungi at class level possessed statistically different among the three lake water fig 2a and b principal co ordinate analysis pcoa also clearly showed marked differences in the bacterial and fungal communities among nanhu lake donghu lake and shahu lake fig 2c and d despite the connection of donghu lake and shahu lake via a canal approximately 6 years ago and a distance between the two sampling locations of only 3 3 km as shown in fig s1 the length of lag phase for the transformation of apap in donghu lake water also dependents on surface water sampling time which is essentially because the aquatic bacteria in natural surface water changed with water sampling time as shown in fig s2 alphaproteobacteria 0 01 p 0 05 gammaproteobacteria p 0 001 norank p saccharibacteria 0 01 p 0 05 flavobacteriia p 0 001 and thermomicrobia p 0 001 were significantly different between two donghu lake water samples the results demonstrated that the microbial community structures were significantly different among the natural water samples the seasonal changing of microbial community structure has also been reported for many natural waters including donghu lake that was applied in this study and spatial differences in bacterial diversity were commonly observed in literature as well as in this study hullar et al 2006 wang et al 2015 yan et al 2017 on the other hand otus greatly overlapped in different samples fig s3 which indicated that the bacterial richness and compositions were comparable in these natural waters and taking functional redundancy into consideration it was not unexpected that same dominant intermediate was detected during the transformation of apap in these water samples 3 2 transformation of apap under different levels of simulated solar radiation as shown in fig s4 the lag phase still existed during the transformation of apap under low irradiance 1 1 mw cm2 solar radiation decreased lag phase to 28 h for the transformation of apap in yangtze river water while the length of lag phase for transformation of apap in lake water was retarded to different extents under solar radiation as shown in the inset of fig s4a the lag phase disappeared in the second round of transformation which was analogous to the second round transformation of apap under dark incubation inset in fig 1a conversely no observed transformation of apap occurred in deionized water indicating direct photolysis made no contribution to the transformation of apap in surface waters which was because of the lack of overlap between apap s absorption and the simulated solar emission despite 1 4 benzoquinone was still the predominant intermediate fig s4b trace levels 0 5 μmol l of apap dimer were also observed fig s3c apap oligomers are formed during the photo transformation of apap in cdom solutions under irradiation chen et al 2018 de laurentiis et al 2014 li et al 2017 and apap dimer was not detected during the transformation of apap under dark incubation where biotransformation dominated therefore these results show that photosensitized reactions begin to contribute to the transformation of apap in natural waters even under very low solar irradiance the lag phase barely existed for the transformation of apap under an irradiance of 5 9 mw cm2 fig 3 there was no difference in the transformation of apap in the four natural water samples during the first 20 h irradiation and the initial transformation rate of apap r apap was 0 34 0 31 0 28 and 0 26 μmol l in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively importantly besides 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3b apap dimer and apap oxidation intermediate with a molecular weight of 183 p183 were identified as new intermediates because apap dimer and p183 are produced from photochemical transformation of apap chen et al 2018 li et al 2017 indicating photochemical transformation also played important roles in the transformation of apap codm sensitized reactions were considered as the main phototransformation process of pollutants in aquatic environments the absorption spectra of these four water samples are shown in fig s5 the absorbance of yangtze river water at λ 250 nm was lower than that of the lake water the lower absorbance of yangtze river water was consistent with its lower total organic carbon concentration table s1 r apap was the highest under an irradiance of 5 9 mw cm2 in yangtze river water that has the lowest cdom concentration which was probably because the composition of cdom varied among these water samples the different composition of cdom was verified by steady state and time correlated fluorescence spectra analysis figs s6 and s7 the fluorescence intensity of yangtze river water was weak with two peaks a and c noted in its eem spectra fig s6 these two peaks represent terrigenous humic acids coble 1996 the fluorescence intensity was stronger for lake than river water particularly for shahu lake and nanhu lake in addition to the two humic acid like peaks the areas of two other peaks m and t were also increased to some extent in lake water samples the protein like fluorescence peak t originated mainly from a tyrosine like emission component while peak m was derived from a microbial humic acid like emission component coble 1996 the annual average concentrations of chla chlorophyll a near the sampling sites in donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake were 30 49 and 91 μg l respectively which are higher than the concentration of chla reported in taihu lake 22 1 μg l zhang et al 2013b therefore autochthonous sources could contribute to cdom in these lakes as listed in table s2 there were three different groups of fluorescence lifetimes τ ns for all water samples the intensity weighted average lifetime τ of fluorophores emitted at 450 nm was shortest for yangtze river 5 09 ns and longest for nanhu lake 5 45 ns while that emitted at 530 nm was shortest for donghu lake 5 11 ns and longest for nanhu lake 5 63 ns these apparently different distributions of τ and f demonstrated that the composition of dom differed among samples although similar emission peaks were present in the eem spectra the ratios of the sum of 2 multiply initial formation rate for apap dimer 2 r dimer and p183 r p183 to r apap were 0 57 0 62 0 86 and 0 73 in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively these large values showed that phototransformation process dominated apap s transformation under an irradiance of 5 9 mw cm2 in the early transformation stage within 35 h however it should be pointed out that the experiment was conducted under continuous radiation and the phototransformation rate under natural condition needs to be adjusted to actual hours of sunshine and light intensity see details in individual contribution calculation the lower accumulated concentration of 1 4 benzoquinone than that observed under dark incubation or low irradiance also suggested that biotransformation process contributed smaller in apap transformation under relative higher irradiance on the other side accelerated degradation of 1 4 benzoquinone under radiation could also lead to its relatively smaller accumulated concentration a monoexponential transformation of apap occurred in all four natural water samples under high irradiance fig 4 a r apap increased to 0 56 0 75 1 02 and 1 13 μm h 1 in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively apap dimer and p183 were also detected fig 4c and d and the accumulated concentrations of both intermediates were higher than those observed under medium irradiance particularly for p183 the ratios of the sum of 2 r dimer and r p183 to r apap were 0 93 0 63 0 45 and 0 40 in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water in the initial transformation stage respectively the results showed phototransformation contributed the smallest to the transformation of apap in nanhu lake among these four waters which was constant with the highest accumulated concentration of 1 4 benzoquinone in nanhu lake water fig 4b notably effect of irradiance on the ratio was dependent on natural water source indicating biotic and abiotic transformation of apap responded differently to irradiance as natural water changed the accumulation of 1 4 benzoquinone fig 4b was much lower under high irradiance than that under dark incubation or low irradiance which was because biotransformation contributed relative smaller to the overall transformation of apap other than it is not stable under high irradiance notably time for the overall elimination of apap increased with irradiance fig 1a s4a 3a and 4a combined with increasing of phototransformation rate with irradiance the results suggested that biotransformation of apap was suppressed under continuous irradiation the inhibition effect of irradiation on the biotransformation of apap mainly resulted from the shift of microbial community under irradiation see detail in section 3 4 these results clear demonstrated that both biotic and abiotic reactions contribute to the overall transformation of apap in natural surface water under ambient conditions their individual contribution to the overall transformation of apap under natural environmental condition was further assessed during a clear sunny day june 27 2018 the daily average irradiance was approximately 15 6 mw cm2 near the water sampling sites fig s8 taking the average light extinction coefficient of surface water 2 5 m 1 into calculation the average irradiance in surface water 0 5 m was ca 5 1 mw cm2 that was comparable with the medium irradiance applied in this study further assuming the length of the lag phase was not changed with irradiance loss rate of apap at the initial stage could be assigned to phototransformation the average value was 0 29 μm h 1 under continuous irradiation a normal 12 h light 12 h dark cycle was used to simplify the calculation and therefore the phototransformation rate r photo was 0 15 μm h 1 under environmental condition biotransformation rate of apap under natural condition r bio was calculated by averaging the value obtained under dark incubation and 5 9 mw cm2 irradiation which was 2 49 1 61 0 78 and 1 94 μm h 1 for apap s transformation in yangtze river nanhu lake donghu lake and shahu lake respectively the contribution of phototransformation η photo to the overall transformation was calculated by eq 1 t lag phae and apap 0 represented the length of lag phase period ca 35 h and apap initial concentration 50 μm respectively 1 η photo r photo t lag phase apap 0 r photo r photo r bio using the corresponding values in the calculation η photo was 16 19 27 and 18 for apap s transformation in yangtze river nanhu lake donghu lake and shahu lake respectively notably as r photo used in the calculation was almost its maximum value the contribution of phototransformation could be smaller than these calculated η photo values and biotransformation dominated the overall transformation of apap in these four surface waters 3 3 effects of apap concentration and radiance on the aquatic microbes the extracted dna was 1 75 0 98 and 1 91 μg l in native donghu lake water donghu lake water spiked with 5 μm and 50 μm apap respectively as dna was positively correlated with microbial abundance these data indicated microorganism abundance in donghu lake water was influenced in the presence of apap moreover as shown in fig 5 a the compositions of bacterial community at class level were different in donghu lake with or without spiked apap for 24 h the one way anova by tukey method showed that relative proportions of flavobacteriia 0 01 p 0 05 verrucomicrobia incertae sedis cytophagia and sphingobacteriia 0 001 p 0 01 possess significantly difference the change of bacterial abundance and compositions indicated that a lag phase could be needed for microbes to utilize apap figs s1 and 1 and the lag phase was dependent on both abundance and composition of aquatic microbes the extracted dna was 1 27 and 1 15 μg l in donghu lake water aforehand irradiated for 12 h at 5 9 and 250 mw cm2 which was 72 and 66 for native donghu lake water besides affecting bacterial abundance radiation also influenced the composition of bacteria in surface water donghu lake fig 5b although light can benefit the growth of microbes recent studies have shown that cdom photosensitized reactions have adverse effects on aquatic bacteria maraccini et al 2016 mostafa et al 2016 romero et al 2011 rosado lausell et al 2013 sun et al 2016 it has reported that both singlet oxygen and triplet excited state of dom result in inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 rosado lausell et al 2013 inactivation of somatic coliphage was also strengthened in the presence of dom under uva visible irradiation with the efficiency of inactivation being dependent on dom concentrations sun et al 2016 moreover uvb and uva components of simulated sunlight could also cause direct stress to aquatic microbes and the impact was species dependent hader et al 2015 santos et al 2012 in this study the relative proportion of dominant bacterial class actinobacteria and betaproteobacteria differed before and after radiation treatment although not to a statistical difference extent relative proportions of norank p saccharibacteria p 0 05 deltaproteobacteria p 0 05 and flavobacteriia 0 1 p 0 05 was statistically different before and after radiation fig 5b therefore the inactivation of microbes and alternation of microbes composition could decrease the contribution of biotransformation to apap s transformation in natural water under high irradiance 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study demonstrated that both chemical and microbial reactions contribute to the transformation of apap in natural water and biotransformation made dominant contribution 73 84 to the overall transformation of apap in surface water under a simulated experimental condition the microbial abundance and community structure were statistically different in studied natural surface water leading to a largely different length of lag phase for the transformation of 50 μm apap the same transformation product 1 4 benzoquinone was found in all surface water both cdom concentration and compositions in surface water influenced the phototransformation kinetic constants the phototransformation of apap in surface water tended to form an apap oligomer and an apap oxidation intermediate as reported in its transformation in cdom deionized water solution more importantly this study provided direct experimental evidence that the abundance and composition of aquatic microbes was influenced by radiation which supports the finding that the individual contributions of biotic and abiotic transformations were highly dependent on irradiance however only one phenolic compound was investigated in this study and more work related to the transformation kinetics and pathways of phenolic compounds in natural water particularly in their environmental concentrations is urgently needed to fully quantify the contributions of chemical and microbial reactions acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 21477091 the experimental project supported by the

19188,the kinetics and transformation pathway of acetaminophen apap in natural surface water one sample from the yangtze river and three others from different lakes and the changes of aquatic microbes in surface water were revealed in this study both photochemical and microbial reactions contributed to the transformation of apap under irradiance of 1 0 250 mw cm2 microbial compositions were significantly different among surface water and same microbial transformation product 1 4 bezoquinone was detected as the predominant biotransformation intermediate in four studied surface water but the lag phase 12 50 h for the transformation was highly dependent on the aquatic microbial abundance and composition the lag phase no longer existed with irradiance increased to 5 9 mw cm2 aquatic microbial abundance and composition were influenced by the presence of apap and radiation and the influence extent was dependent on microbial species the findings demonstrated that the individual contribution of biotic and abiotic process to the overall transformation of apap and maybe other phenol in surface water varied as the background composition of surface water and the external environment changed and biotransformation dominated 73 the overall transformation of apap in surface water graphical abstract image 1 keywords acetaminophen aquatic microbes biotransformation photo transformation surface water 1 introduction phenolic compounds in the aquatic environment can arise from the degradation of natural substances industrial activities and agricultural practices and have become one of the most widely distributed pollutants in surface waters aguer et al 2005 canonica et al 1995 2000 canonica and hoigné 1995 de laurentiis et al 2013 golanoski et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 identifying the exact transformation process of phenolic compounds would enable a better understanding of their environmental fate and toxicity and would also be helpful for establishing efficient treatment technologies once they enter surface water phenolic compounds undergo various transportation transformation processes including adsorption desorption oxidation reduction bioaccumulation and biotransformation photo transformation induced by colored dissolved organic matter cdom is the predominant chemical transformation process for various phenols numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the transformation of phenols in humic acid or cdom solutions it has been suggested that the excited triplet state of cdom 3cdom is the most important reactive species initiating the transformation of phenols as well as other compounds including herbicides and drugs canonica 2007 canonica et al 2006 golanoski et al 2012 mcneill and canonica 2016 remucal 2014 richard and canonica 2005 the photosensitized transformation of phenols is most likely initiated through one electron extraction from phenol to 3cdom leading to the formation of a long lived phenoxyl radical ph o at a diffusion controlled rate brede et al 2002 canonica et al 2000 it was suggested that ph o is further oxidized or reduced back to its parent compounds canonica et al 1995 wenk and canonica 2012 reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical singlet oxygen or other cdom excited states may also contribute to the chemical transformation of phenols canonica 2007 del vecchio and blough 2004 paul et al 2004 vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 many microbes are capable of degrading phenolic compounds fuchs et al 2011 martínková et al 2016 faust and hoigne 1987 suggested that the biotransformation of phenolic compounds is the only process that efficiently competes with the cdom sensitized chemical transformation process baena nogueras et al 2017 found that biotransformation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in seawater is often faster than photolysis compared with the large number of investigations of chemical transformation in cdom solutions few studies have focused on the microbe induced biotransformation of phenolic compounds in natural surface water baena nogueras et al 2017 e rubin and alexander 1983 shimp and pfaender 1985 polyphenol oxidase and or monophenol oxides can efficiently oxidize phenolic compounds to quinone mukherjee et al 2013 therefore despite the different transformation kinetics the biotransformation of phenolic compounds might lead to the generation of intermediates differing from those produced by the photochemical process it has been shown recently that cdom induced chemical reactions can produce adverse effects on some aquatic bacteria maraccini et al 2016 mostafa et al 2016 romero et al 2011 rosado lausell et al 2013 sun et al 2016 alternation of the microbial community and changes in the abundance of certain microbes may subsequently influence the biotransformation of phenolic compounds in natural surface waters moreover microbes may compete for 3cdom or other ros with phenolic compounds rosado lausell et al 2013 which would influence the chemical transformation of phenolic compounds however the knowledge for the change of aquatic microbes in natural surface water during the transformation of target compound under different experimental conditions were rare because both the chemical and biological transformation of phenolic compounds occurs in surface water the individual contribution of chemical and biological reactions in the overall transformation of phenolic compounds cannot be distinguished easily only through a comparison of the apparent transformation kinetic constants alternately given that the transformation pathway of a phenolic compound likely differs distinctly between chemical and biological reactions the contributions of these two reactions could be revealed through quantification of transformation intermediates acetaminophen apap also known as paracetamol is a typical substituted monophenol apap oligomers and an intermediate with a molecular weight of 183 da referred to as p183 were found to be the predominant intermediates generated in cdom solutions chen et al 2018 de laurentiis et al 2014 li et al 2017 hydroxylation products are the main intermediates formed in reactions involving the hydroxyl radical oh chen et al 2017 feng et al 2015 vogna et al 2002 apap is metabolized primarily in animal liver into nontoxic products and a minor pathway to n acetyl p benzoquinone imine by the cytochromes p450 2e1 1a2 3a4 and 2a6 has also been postulated to occur via a two electron oxidation process james et al 2003 the main intermediates in the transformation of apap in microbe induced biotransformation were identified as p aminophenol 1 4 hydroquinone and 1 4 benzoquinone involving enzyme of amidohydrolase hydrolytic enzyme etc liang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a therefore apap and these primary transformation intermediates maybe used as model reactions to reveal the complex transformation of phenolic compounds in natural surface waters in this study the transformation of apap and the formation of intermediates in four surface water sources the yangtze river and three different lakes were systematically investigated under dark incubation and different irradiance conditions the first objective was to identify the contributions of biological and chemical reactions to the transformation of apap in different surface waters with distinctly different microbial communities and optical characteristics and to identify to what extent the contributions changed with irradiance the second objective was to reveal the change of microbes in natural surface water and the relationship between aquatic microbes and apap s biotransformation the results were helpful for determining the environmental fate of apap in natural surface waters 2 experiments and methods 2 1 materials apap was purchased from alfa aesar morecambe uk apap oligomers apap dimer and trimer were synthesized according to previously reported methods liang et al 2016 1 4 benzoquinone 98 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents shanghai china the method for synthesis and purification of apap oxidation product was provided in a previous study chen et al 2018 all organic solvents high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade and other chemicals were of the highest purity that was commercially available ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm was used throughout the experiments 2 2 transformation of apap in surface water surface water 0 5 m samples 10 l were collected from the yangtze river in the wuhan region and three lakes in wuhan hubei province china on either september 9 2017 or may 20 2018 the details of the sampling sites are provided in the supporting information and the water properties are listed in table s1 the surface water samples were used in apap transformation experiments in order to quantify the trace transformation intermediates and compare with previous studies concentration of apap applied in this study is much higher than its maximum detected environmental concentration 0 2 μmol l campanha et al 2015 liang et al 2016 however the transformation of apap was also carried at low initial concentrations 2 0 and 5 0 μmol l which allowed to assess its environmental fate detailed information for the set up and simulated solar radiation was described in a previous study chen et al 2018 specifically a 100 ml natural surface water solution containing 2 50 μm apap was placed in a 150 ml glass flask a 0 5 ml aliquot was withdrawn to determine the initial concentration c 0 then the solution was either incubated under dark conditions or exposed to different levels of simulated solar radiation 340 800 nm 1 1 5 9 or 250 mw cm2 and the chosen irradiance region covered solar irradiance reached to the studying water surface all the irradiance was measured using an ocean optics usb2000 spectroradiometer largo usa during the reaction process 0 5 ml aliquots were collected centrifuged and immediately analyzed to determine the concentrations at different reaction times c t transformation of aniline 50 μm was also conducted as a reference control that was suggested in oecd guidelines 309 preliminary results showed that the pseudo first order reaction rate for transformation of aniline were ranged from 0 06 0 01 to 0 19 0 03 h 1 with a lag phase ranged from 14 to 44 h in these water samples the results demonstrated that all the water samples used in this study contains an active microbial population the transformation of apap in deionized water or surface water pre filtered through 0 22 μm mixed cellulose filters was also conducted under dark incubation as a control experiment to determine the contribution of hydrolysis or direct oxidation to the transformation of apap transformation of apap in deionized water was also investigated under different irradiance to assess the contribution of direct photolysis to apap s transformation all the experiments were carried out in triplet 2 3 absorption and emission spectra surface water because absorption and emission spectra could provide structural information for cdom that played an important role in the phototransformation of apap the optic spectra of these surface water were characterized water samples were filtrated through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose filter membrane before optical analysis the absorption spectra of surface water samples were recorded on an ultraviolet uv visible spectrometer uv 2550 shimadzu tokyo japan at 25 0 2 c the optical length was 1 cm fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were recorded on a fluorimeter fluorolog 3 horiba instruments at 25 0 2 c the scanning ranges were 250 450 nm for excitation and 300 600 nm for emission the scanning step and slit were 5 and 2 5 nm respectively for both excitation and emission the dwell time was 0 0100 s and the spectrum intensity was corrected using factory measured correction files pure water was used for raman scatter subtraction time resolved fluorescence spectra were recorded on picoquant ft 200 picoquant gmbh berlin germany and detailed procedure was the same as reported in our previous study chen et al 2018 2 4 aquatic microbes under different apap spike concentrations and irradiance because microbes played a key role in the biotic transformation of apap changes of aquatic microbes under different apap spike concentrations and radiation were also investigated specifically three independent 2 l surface water samples were spiked with 5 or 50 μmol l apap for 24 h or directly exposed to 1 1 or 250 mw cm2 simulated solar irradiation and then the solutions were filtered through a pre combusted whatman glass fiber gf c filter φ 47 mm followed by filtration over a 0 22 μm mixed cellulose filter φ 25 mm these mixed cellulose filters were then stored at 20 c prior to the genetic diversity analysis filters that collected the microbes were used to extract dna with a

biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the 16s rdna and its sequences were aligned with reference sequences in the silva database http www arb silva de and unite database http unite ut ee index php respectively the results were analyzed by i sanger http www i sanger com the different species between different groups of soil samples were determined based on the operational taxonomic units generated after clustering at a 97 similarity level 2 5 quantification of apap and its transformation products the concentrations of apap and its transformation products were analyzed by hplc with the commercial agents apap and 1 4 benzoquinone or synthesized compounds apap dimer and trimer p183 hplc was performed using the essentia lc 16 pump shimadzu and waters 484 uv detector waters milford ma usa a cosmosil 5c18 ms ii column 250 4 6 mm 5 μm particle size was used for separation of the products the mobile phase was a water acidified with 1 formic acid and methanol mixture v v 70 30 with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the injection volume was 20 μl and the detection wavelength was 250 nm the limit of detection lod of the analysis method was 0 05 0 06 0 30 0 06 0 08 μmol l for apap oxidation product p183 apap 1 4 benzoquinone apap dimer and apap trimer respectively 2 6 apap transformation kinetics the kinetics of apap transformation k obs first order rate constant were determined from the regression of the slope after the lag phase of a plot of apap concentration versus time the length of the lag period was defined as the period before a significant p 0 05 decrease in concentration was observed between successive time increments as determined by the t statistic 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of apap in natural water under dark incubation the transformation of apap in natural water was first investigated under dark incubation and the results are presented in fig 1 there was a lag phase during the transformation of apap in the four natural water samples which was shortest approximately 12 h in nanhu lake water and longest approximately 50 h in donghu lake water as shown in fig s1 lag phase existed for the transformation of apap with an initial concentration of 2 μm which is 6 7 times that of its detected maximum environmental concentration lag phases of 96 and 168 h were reported for the transformation of apap in fresh water and seawater respectively in spain baena nogueras et al 2017 and a lag phase has also been reported in the transformation of apap in the soil water system liang et al 2016 the concentration of apap decreased rapidly after the lag phase the pseudo first order kinetic constant k obs for transformation of apap was comparable in nanhu lake water 0 13 0 02 h 1 yangtze river water 0 14 0 01 h 1 and shahu lake water 0 14 0 02 h 1 while the k obs was only 0 04 0 003 h 1 in donghu lake water the control experiments showed that apap transformation did not occur in either natural water pre filtered through a 0 22 μm filter empty square fig 1a or in deionized water data not shown indicating that the transformation of apap in natural water under dark incubation occurred mainly via a biological process it is generally accepted that the lag phase reflects the time required for adaptation of the corresponding degraders to grow to a level at which an obvious degradation of the substrate can be detected otton et al 2008 after the elimination of apap apap stock solution was added to investigate the second round transformation of apap in natural water as shown in the inset of fig 1a the lag phase disappeared in the second round transformation indicating the adaption of aquatic microbes to apap the main intermediate formed during the transformation of apap under dark incubation was 1 4 benzoquinone although its maximum accumulated concentration occurred at different reaction times among the four water samples fig 1b 1 4 benzoquinone is reportedly one of the main intermediates formed during the transformation of apap in soils li et al 2014 this pathway has not been reported in the cdom induced chemical transformation of apap chen et al 2018 de laurentiis et al 2014 li et al 2017 and it can be used to distinguish the contribution of chemical transformation from microbial reactions in the transformation of apap in natural surface water the formation of 1 4 benzoquinone also indicated the operation of different reactions from those involved in the oxidation of apap by certain enzymes lu et al 2009 potter et al 1985 apap oligomers were found to be the main intermediates in laccase or horseradish peroxidase mediated oxidative reactions lu et al 2009 potter et al 1985 there are different reactions that could lead to the generation of 1 4 benzoquinone for example two electron oxidation of apap by certain enzymes could lead to the formation of n acetyl p benzoquinone imine which is rapidly hydrolyzed to 1 4 benzoquinone bedner and maccrehan 2006 bessems and vermeulen 2001 alternatively polyphenol oxidase and or monophenol oxides which are present in natural water may also oxidize apap to 1 4 benzoquinone valero et al reported that tyrosinase can also oxidize apap to its corresponding o quinone valero et al 2002 2003 there were not enough microbes present in the 2 l yangtze river water for microbial diversity analysis indicating the poor abundance of microbes in yangtze river as shown in fig 2 both the bacterial and fungal community abundances were very different among the different lake water samples the actinobacteria relative abundance of 69 3 1 1 gammaproteobacteria relative abundance of 50 9 7 1 and betaproteobacteria relative abundance of 45 3 5 3 is the most abundant bacterial class in donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively the relative abundance of most dominant bacteria and fungi at class level possessed statistically different among the three lake water fig 2a and b principal co ordinate analysis pcoa also clearly showed marked differences in the bacterial and fungal communities among nanhu lake donghu lake and shahu lake fig 2c and d despite the connection of donghu lake and shahu lake via a canal approximately 6 years ago and a distance between the two sampling locations of only 3 3 km as shown in fig s1 the length of lag phase for the transformation of apap in donghu lake water also dependents on surface water sampling time which is essentially because the aquatic bacteria in natural surface water changed with water sampling time as shown in fig s2 alphaproteobacteria 0 01 p 0 05 gammaproteobacteria p 0 001 norank p saccharibacteria 0 01 p 0 05 flavobacteriia p 0 001 and thermomicrobia p 0 001 were significantly different between two donghu lake water samples the results demonstrated that the microbial community structures were significantly different among the natural water samples the seasonal changing of microbial community structure has also been reported for many natural waters including donghu lake that was applied in this study and spatial differences in bacterial diversity were commonly observed in literature as well as in this study hullar et al 2006 wang et al 2015 yan et al 2017 on the other hand otus greatly overlapped in different samples fig s3 which indicated that the bacterial richness and compositions were comparable in these natural waters and taking functional redundancy into consideration it was not unexpected that same dominant intermediate was detected during the transformation of apap in these water samples 3 2 transformation of apap under different levels of simulated solar radiation as shown in fig s4 the lag phase still existed during the transformation of apap under low irradiance 1 1 mw cm2 solar radiation decreased lag phase to 28 h for the transformation of apap in yangtze river water while the length of lag phase for transformation of apap in lake water was retarded to different extents under solar radiation as shown in the inset of fig s4a the lag phase disappeared in the second round of transformation which was analogous to the second round transformation of apap under dark incubation inset in fig 1a conversely no observed transformation of apap occurred in deionized water indicating direct photolysis made no contribution to the transformation of apap in surface waters which was because of the lack of overlap between apap s absorption and the simulated solar emission despite 1 4 benzoquinone was still the predominant intermediate fig s4b trace levels 0 5 μmol l of apap dimer were also observed fig s3c apap oligomers are formed during the photo transformation of apap in cdom solutions under irradiation chen et al 2018 de laurentiis et al 2014 li et al 2017 and apap dimer was not detected during the transformation of apap under dark incubation where biotransformation dominated therefore these results show that photosensitized reactions begin to contribute to the transformation of apap in natural waters even under very low solar irradiance the lag phase barely existed for the transformation of apap under an irradiance of 5 9 mw cm2 fig 3 there was no difference in the transformation of apap in the four natural water samples during the first 20 h irradiation and the initial transformation rate of apap r apap was 0 34 0 31 0 28 and 0 26 μmol l in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively importantly besides 1 4 benzoquinone fig 3b apap dimer and apap oxidation intermediate with a molecular weight of 183 p183 were identified as new intermediates because apap dimer and p183 are produced from photochemical transformation of apap chen et al 2018 li et al 2017 indicating photochemical transformation also played important roles in the transformation of apap codm sensitized reactions were considered as the main phototransformation process of pollutants in aquatic environments the absorption spectra of these four water samples are shown in fig s5 the absorbance of yangtze river water at λ 250 nm was lower than that of the lake water the lower absorbance of yangtze river water was consistent with its lower total organic carbon concentration table s1 r apap was the highest under an irradiance of 5 9 mw cm2 in yangtze river water that has the lowest cdom concentration which was probably because the composition of cdom varied among these water samples the different composition of cdom was verified by steady state and time correlated fluorescence spectra analysis figs s6 and s7 the fluorescence intensity of yangtze river water was weak with two peaks a and c noted in its eem spectra fig s6 these two peaks represent terrigenous humic acids coble 1996 the fluorescence intensity was stronger for lake than river water particularly for shahu lake and nanhu lake in addition to the two humic acid like peaks the areas of two other peaks m and t were also increased to some extent in lake water samples the protein like fluorescence peak t originated mainly from a tyrosine like emission component while peak m was derived from a microbial humic acid like emission component coble 1996 the annual average concentrations of chla chlorophyll a near the sampling sites in donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake were 30 49 and 91 μg l respectively which are higher than the concentration of chla reported in taihu lake 22 1 μg l zhang et al 2013b therefore autochthonous sources could contribute to cdom in these lakes as listed in table s2 there were three different groups of fluorescence lifetimes τ ns for all water samples the intensity weighted average lifetime τ of fluorophores emitted at 450 nm was shortest for yangtze river 5 09 ns and longest for nanhu lake 5 45 ns while that emitted at 530 nm was shortest for donghu lake 5 11 ns and longest for nanhu lake 5 63 ns these apparently different distributions of τ and f demonstrated that the composition of dom differed among samples although similar emission peaks were present in the eem spectra the ratios of the sum of 2 multiply initial formation rate for apap dimer 2 r dimer and p183 r p183 to r apap were 0 57 0 62 0 86 and 0 73 in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively these large values showed that phototransformation process dominated apap s transformation under an irradiance of 5 9 mw cm2 in the early transformation stage within 35 h however it should be pointed out that the experiment was conducted under continuous radiation and the phototransformation rate under natural condition needs to be adjusted to actual hours of sunshine and light intensity see details in individual contribution calculation the lower accumulated concentration of 1 4 benzoquinone than that observed under dark incubation or low irradiance also suggested that biotransformation process contributed smaller in apap transformation under relative higher irradiance on the other side accelerated degradation of 1 4 benzoquinone under radiation could also lead to its relatively smaller accumulated concentration a monoexponential transformation of apap occurred in all four natural water samples under high irradiance fig 4 a r apap increased to 0 56 0 75 1 02 and 1 13 μm h 1 in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water respectively apap dimer and p183 were also detected fig 4c and d and the accumulated concentrations of both intermediates were higher than those observed under medium irradiance particularly for p183 the ratios of the sum of 2 r dimer and r p183 to r apap were 0 93 0 63 0 45 and 0 40 in yangtze river donghu lake shahu lake and nanhu lake water in the initial transformation stage respectively the results showed phototransformation contributed the smallest to the transformation of apap in nanhu lake among these four waters which was constant with the highest accumulated concentration of 1 4 benzoquinone in nanhu lake water fig 4b notably effect of irradiance on the ratio was dependent on natural water source indicating biotic and abiotic transformation of apap responded differently to irradiance as natural water changed the accumulation of 1 4 benzoquinone fig 4b was much lower under high irradiance than that under dark incubation or low irradiance which was because biotransformation contributed relative smaller to the overall transformation of apap other than it is not stable under high irradiance notably time for the overall elimination of apap increased with irradiance fig 1a s4a 3a and 4a combined with increasing of phototransformation rate with irradiance the results suggested that biotransformation of apap was suppressed under continuous irradiation the inhibition effect of irradiation on the biotransformation of apap mainly resulted from the shift of microbial community under irradiation see detail in section 3 4 these results clear demonstrated that both biotic and abiotic reactions contribute to the overall transformation of apap in natural surface water under ambient conditions their individual contribution to the overall transformation of apap under natural environmental condition was further assessed during a clear sunny day june 27 2018 the daily average irradiance was approximately 15 6 mw cm2 near the water sampling sites fig s8 taking the average light extinction coefficient of surface water 2 5 m 1 into calculation the average irradiance in surface water 0 5 m was ca 5 1 mw cm2 that was comparable with the medium irradiance applied in this study further assuming the length of the lag phase was not changed with irradiance loss rate of apap at the initial stage could be assigned to phototransformation the average value was 0 29 μm h 1 under continuous irradiation a normal 12 h light 12 h dark cycle was used to simplify the calculation and therefore the phototransformation rate r photo was 0 15 μm h 1 under environmental condition biotransformation rate of apap under natural condition r bio was calculated by averaging the value obtained under dark incubation and 5 9 mw cm2 irradiation which was 2 49 1 61 0 78 and 1 94 μm h 1 for apap s transformation in yangtze river nanhu lake donghu lake and shahu lake respectively the contribution of phototransformation η photo to the overall transformation was calculated by eq 1 t lag phae and apap 0 represented the length of lag phase period ca 35 h and apap initial concentration 50 μm respectively 1 η photo r photo t lag phase apap 0 r photo r photo r bio using the corresponding values in the calculation η photo was 16 19 27 and 18 for apap s transformation in yangtze river nanhu lake donghu lake and shahu lake respectively notably as r photo used in the calculation was almost its maximum value the contribution of phototransformation could be smaller than these calculated η photo values and biotransformation dominated the overall transformation of apap in these four surface waters 3 3 effects of apap concentration and radiance on the aquatic microbes the extracted dna was 1 75 0 98 and 1 91 μg l in native donghu lake water donghu lake water spiked with 5 μm and 50 μm apap respectively as dna was positively correlated with microbial abundance these data indicated microorganism abundance in donghu lake water was influenced in the presence of apap moreover as shown in fig 5 a the compositions of bacterial community at class level were different in donghu lake with or without spiked apap for 24 h the one way anova by tukey method showed that relative proportions of flavobacteriia 0 01 p 0 05 verrucomicrobia incertae sedis cytophagia and sphingobacteriia 0 001 p 0 01 possess significantly difference the change of bacterial abundance and compositions indicated that a lag phase could be needed for microbes to utilize apap figs s1 and 1 and the lag phase was dependent on both abundance and composition of aquatic microbes the extracted dna was 1 27 and 1 15 μg l in donghu lake water aforehand irradiated for 12 h at 5 9 and 250 mw cm2 which was 72 and 66 for native donghu lake water besides affecting bacterial abundance radiation also influenced the composition of bacteria in surface water donghu lake fig 5b although light can benefit the growth of microbes recent studies have shown that cdom photosensitized reactions have adverse effects on aquatic bacteria maraccini et al 2016 mostafa et al 2016 romero et al 2011 rosado lausell et al 2013 sun et al 2016 it has reported that both singlet oxygen and triplet excited state of dom result in inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 rosado lausell et al 2013 inactivation of somatic coliphage was also strengthened in the presence of dom under uva visible irradiation with the efficiency of inactivation being dependent on dom concentrations sun et al 2016 moreover uvb and uva components of simulated sunlight could also cause direct stress to aquatic microbes and the impact was species dependent hader et al 2015 santos et al 2012 in this study the relative proportion of dominant bacterial class actinobacteria and betaproteobacteria differed before and after radiation treatment although not to a statistical difference extent relative proportions of norank p saccharibacteria p 0 05 deltaproteobacteria p 0 05 and flavobacteriia 0 1 p 0 05 was statistically different before and after radiation fig 5b therefore the inactivation of microbes and alternation of microbes composition could decrease the contribution of biotransformation to apap s transformation in natural water under high irradiance 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study demonstrated that both chemical and microbial reactions contribute to the transformation of apap in natural water and biotransformation made dominant contribution 73 84 to the overall transformation of apap in surface water under a simulated experimental condition the microbial abundance and community structure were statistically different in studied natural surface water leading to a largely different length of lag phase for the transformation of 50 μm apap the same transformation product 1 4 benzoquinone was found in all surface water both cdom concentration and compositions in surface water influenced the phototransformation kinetic constants the phototransformation of apap in surface water tended to form an apap oligomer and an apap oxidation intermediate as reported in its transformation in cdom deionized water solution more importantly this study provided direct experimental evidence that the abundance and composition of aquatic microbes was influenced by radiation which supports the finding that the individual contributions of biotic and abiotic transformations were highly dependent on irradiance however only one phenolic compound was investigated in this study and more work related to the transformation kinetics and pathways of phenolic compounds in natural water particularly in their environmental concentrations is urgently needed to fully quantify the contributions of chemical and microbial reactions acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 21477091 the experimental project supported by the

xiamen university xiamen 361102 china key laboratory of ministry of education for coastal and wetland ecosystems xiamen university xiamen 361102 china glomalin related soil protein grsp is a widespread glycoprotein found to have strong ability of sequestering heavy metals in soils however the underlying mechanism for metal and metalloid removal as well as water quality improvement and the ecological role played by grsp are still not well documented this study was initiated to investigate the interconnection of metal loading in grsp between sediments and suspended solids focusing on the mobilization mechanisms of grsp in the coastal mangrove wetland combined indicators of nine heavy metals were significantly positively correlated with grsp concentration by principal component analysis indicating that grsp could act as an indicator of contamination level in the mangrove wetlands large distribution of grsp in sediments and suspended solids elevated sequestration potential of heavy metals fe mn cr cu zn ni cd pb and metalloid arsenic in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem grsp mobilized and sequestered heavy metals in sediment profiles which reduced the bioavailability of heavy metals grsp was also a significant contributor for suspended solids to adsorb heavy metals enhancing suspended solids deposition and burial process in sediments this new finding provided insights into the ecological functions of grsp and the heavy metal cycling in wetland environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental assessment metal binding sediment suspended solids coastal water quality 1 introduction coastal mangrove ecosystems which commonly thrive in the tropical and subtropical intertidal estuarine wetlands are a potential large depositional pool of heavy metals and thereby play a key role for water quality restoration alongi et al 2004 de wolf and rashid 2008 mangrove forests could regulate sediment characteristics including acidity redox potential salinity and organic matter contents which facilitates heavy metal accumulation in sediments and subsequently reduces heavy metal exposure to the adjacent oceans alongi et al 2004 zhou et al 2010 donato et al 2011 furthermore mangroves can effectively restore water quality by enhancing deposition of suspended solids from tidal water rivers and storm water runoff adame et al 2010 lacerda et al 1988 however the relative importance of these mechanisms for stabilization and accumulation of heavy metals in mangrove wetlands is not well explored recent findings documented that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce a recalcitrant glycoprotein glomalin related soil protein grsp which is deposited into soils and sediments after the senescence of hyphae and spores wright and upadhyaya 1996 adame et al 2012 wang et al 2018a b generally grsp is categorized into two fractions by using assay methods easily extractable and total grsp ee grsp and t grsp wright and upadhyaya 1996 zhang et al 2015 ee grsp is considered as the newly produced or relatively labile fraction koide and peoples 2013 as a stable fungal protein grsp is distributed in terrestrial ecosystems such as forests grasslands desert and agricultural ecosystems treseder and turner 2007 singh et al 2013 and has a turnover time of 6 42 years rillig et al 2001 which implies a substantial role of grsp in soil carbon sequestration treseder and turner 2007 grsp is also transported and deposited by erosion river foam and groundwater into coastal wetland and marine ecosystems harner et al 2004 adame et al 2010 2012 wang et al 2018a b where it accumulates and remains a long term record about 1250 years lópez merino et al 2015 meanwhile coastal wetland ecosystems even contain higher grsp contents compared with terrestrial ecosystems harner et al 2004 wang et al 2018a furthermore grsp is a glue like protein and insoluble in water and it binds together organic matter and clay particles to form water stable aggregates rillig 2004 spohn and giani 2010 thus grsp could be used as a novel bioflocculant or aggregate binding agent in soils and sediments which implies that grsp can be a metal binding protein in mangrove wetlands spohn and giani 2010 chern et al 2007 soil proteins including detrital proteins and functional proteins are recognized increasingly to play major roles in controls on persistence of soil organic matter rillig et al 2007 as a recalcitrant sticky and hydrophobic soil protein grsp binds and sequesters copious amounts of heavy metals and thus can help to remediate polluted soils in terrestrial ecosystems gonzález chávez et al 2004 cornejo et al 2008 vodnik et al 2008 jia et al 2016 an early study showed grsp and associated metals can be transported with sediment erosion into the urban coastal watersheds chern et al 2007 however deposition and burial of the protein and its potential of sequestering heavy metals in mangrove sediment profiles were not known a survey of grsp in suspended solids indicated that grsp can be transported with suspended solids adame et al 2010 suspended solids distribution which relates to the physical chemical and biological properties of the waterbody is known to be a key driver factor of water quality deterioration mccarthy et al 2012 bilotta and brazier 2008 the suspended solids load and their metal content significantly affected the balance between inputs and outputs of metals in estuarine areas lacerda et al 1988 sarma et al 2012 consequently suspended solids may play a key role in understanding metal biogeochemical processes in sediments of mangrove ecosystems sarma et al 2012 however there is no direct evidence about the intrinsic mechanism of suspended solids adsorbing heavy metals and how the interconnection between suspended solids and sediments contributes to water quality restoration in mangrove wetlands the aim of this study is to reveal the mechanisms of grsp in sediment associated heavy metal accumulation and heavy metal adsorption by suspended solids as well as sediment loading and to reveal the potential ecological role of this stable fungal protein in water quality restoration in coastal wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in zhangjiang river estuary mangrove national natural reserve which runs into dongshan bay fujian province southeast china 23 53ʹn 117 30ʹe

of zhangjiang estuary china four sample sites were chosen for this study including mudflat pure mangrove stand of a marina k obovata and a corniculatum in october 2016 all samples including core sediments 60 sediment samples in 12 cores and suspended solids 20 samples were collected twelve core sediment samples 0 50 cm three duplicates at each site were collected using acid washed pvc pipes of 70 cm in length and 7 5 cm in internal diameter and immediately capped and sealed to avoid oxygen diffusion before transfer to the laboratory after being transported to the laboratory the sediments in the cores were drawn out and separated into 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 50 cm segments under nitrogen gas in the field we used sediment trap method to collect suspended solids thomas and ridd 2004 adame et al 2010 traps were devised by acid washed pvc pipes of 25 cm in length and 5 cm in internal diameter samples were taken in five points within each sample site and the traps were collected during low tide after 2 weeks the water samples in the trap were filtered through a pre weighed 47 mm glass microfibre gf c whatman filter 1 2 μm pore size in laboratory adame et al 2010 all sampling locations were spaced at least 50 m intervals within each sample site after plants material and stones were picked out from core sediments the sediment samples were freeze dried then the dry samples were ground in an agate mortar and sieved to 0 25 mm and 0 149 mm respectively for the analysis of grsp organic matter and heavy metals the filter papers were spread out in petri dishes air dried and sieved for further analysis 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 heavy metal and organic matter determination the total iron fe manganese mn chromium cr copper cu zinc zn arsenic as nickel ni cadmium cd and lead pb concentrations were determined in the core sediments and suspended solids by pressurizing digestion 0 1 g of 0 149 mm sieved sediment samples with an acid mixture of concentrated hf hno3 and hclo4 5 2 1 v v v gao and chen 2012 all heavy metal concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700x agilent technologies usa quality assurance and quality control were assessed using duplicates method blanks and the chinese national certified reference materials gsd 12 with each set of samples the results were consistent with the reference values and the recovery rates were all among 90 106 the total organic carbon c and total nitrogen n contents were determined using a vario el iii chnos elemental analyzer 2 3 2 glomalin related soil protein grsp analyses easily extractable glomalin ee grsp and total glomalin t grsp concentrations were determined in the core sediments and suspended solids grsp extractions were determined by an improved protocol wang et al 2018a based on the bradford protein assay wright and upadhyaya 1996 ee grsp was extracted at 121 c with 20 mm sodium citrate ph 7 0 for 30 min t grsp was repeatedly extracted at 121 c with 50 mm sodium citrate ph 8 0 for 60 min until the supernatant was straw colored for each of the autoclaving cycles the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min and collected into clean 50 ml centrifuge tubes 4 c before determination the extracts were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10min to remove soil particles ee grsp and t grsp concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by the bradford dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard to determine heavy metals bound to grsp we used the modified method described by gonzález chávez et al 2004 briefly the above supernatants were precipitated by slowly adding 1 m hcl until the ph of the solution reached 2 the acidified supernatants were settled in ice for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min the precipitate was then re dissolved in 0 1 m naoh dialyzed against deionized water and freeze dried the concentrations of grsp bound heavy metals fe al mn cr ni cu zn as cd and pb were determined using icp ms agilent 7700x agilent technologies usa after pressurized acid digestion with a mixture of 4 ml of hno3 and 2 ml of h2o2 the c and n contents in the t grsp were determined by a vario el iii chnos elemental analyzer furthermore we defined grsp and heavy metals in suspended solids as transportation in sediments as accumulation in this study the contribution of grsp bound metals was calculated from the measured concentration of grsp concentration of grsp bound metals and total metal concentration as follows g r s p c o n t r i b u t i o n grsp concentration grsp bound metal concentration total metal concentration we also calculated the ratio of grsp bound metal concentrations to total metal concentrations and the sum of the ratios to estimate the metal sequestration potential of grsp sequestration potential of grsp was calculated as follows grsp sequestration potential grsp b o u n d m e t a l t o t a l m e t a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was conducted using spss 22 0 software package spss usa prior to significance analysis normality was assessed by the shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variances was determined by levene s test one way anova analyses were performed to test the differences among four sampling sites and between different sediment layers at 0 50 cm two way anova analyses were implemented to test differences caused by sediment layer depths and sample sites regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between grsp fractions and total organic c or total nitrogen n because many of the heavy metals are highly correlated we used principal components analysis pca to assess whether grsp concentrations vary with combined indicators of heavy metal pollution factor 1 significant differences between treatments were determined with least significant difference lsd for multiple comparisons at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 vertical distribution of heavy metals in the sediments fig 1 illustrates the vertical profiles of total heavy metal concentrations at 0 50 cm at the four sampling sites the ranges of concentrations of fe mn cr cu zn as ni cd and pb were 3 3 104 4 6 104 291 5 1036 7 28 4 72 8 12 1 23 7 10 6 140 9 3 1 16 5 14 2 34 2 0 10 0 28 and 47 9 83 3 mg kg 1 respectively a significant decrease in mn cr and cu concentrations with the increasing depth was observed at the mudflat site p 0 05 indicating recent heavy metal pollution probably the concentrations varied along sediment profiles because of molecular diffusion furthermore the average concentrations at the 0 50 cm sediments from the mangrove sites contained more fe cr cu zn as ni cd and pb than mudflat sediments but a significantly lower mn concentration p 0 05 the results of two way anova analysis for the sampling sites and soil layer depth showed that different sampling sites demonstrated a significant difference in the concentrations of all those heavy metals while soil layer depth was not significantly correlated with those heavy metals except fe and mn listed in supplementary table 1 all sediment samples for fe cr pb and 70 90 soil samples for mn cu as and ni exceeded the lowest effect level according to the ontario guidelines lel below which no effects on the majority of sediment dwelling organisms are expected moreover fe concentrations in different soil layers in the mangrove sites even exceeded the severe effect levels sel fig 1 those results implied the toxic impact of heavy metals on the mangrove ecosystem which might be reintroduced into waterbody and cause adverse effects on adjacent aquatic environments 3 2 relationship between grsp and heavy metals in sediments total extractable glomalin t grsp and easily extractable glomalin ee grsp in samples at 0 10 cm across the mangrove forests and mudflat ranged from 1 48 mg g 1 to 2 60 mg g 1 and from 1 38 mg g 1 to 2 16 mg g 1 respectively both t grsp and ee grsp concentrations were significantly higher in the mangrove forests than in the mudflat p 0 001 interestingly we found that grsp occurred at all sediment layers at 0 50 cm t grsp and ee grsp concentrations decreased with an increasing sediment depth under all sample sites indicating that grsp could be transported and accumulate in sediment profiles because of co variation across many metal elements a principal component analysis was used to test the relationship between variation in heavy metal pollution and grsp concentrations at 0 50 cm for the total metal concentration in sediments two principle components pcs explained 68 of the variation in the total suite of heavy metals the first principal component pc1 explained 52 3 of the total variance this component was strongly and positively related to zn pb cd cr cu fe as and ni table 1 the second principal component pc2 accounted for 15 4 of the variation in the metals data and showed highly positive factor loadings on mn t grsp and ee grsp were significantly positively correlated with pc1 fig 4a and b which suggested that grsp could be a significant driver of heavy metal biogeochemical cycle in the mangrove wetland similar to heavy metals in sediments two main factors in the suspended solids explained 78 of the total variance the first pc1 explaining 62 6 of the total variance was also strongly and positively related to zn pb cd cr cu fe as and ni the second pc2 explaining 15 1 of the total variance was also characterized by strong positive contributions from mn table 1 those degrees of covariance are strongly suggestive of common sources for the metals among the sediments and suspended solids 3 3 grsp and heavy metal sequestration in the sediments metal concentrations associated with grsp ranged from 71 3 to 133 9 mg of fe 0 31 2 25 mg of mn 0 12 0 57 mg of cr 0 04 0 30 mg of cu 0 21 0 93 mg of zn 0 04 0 14 mg of as 0 04 0 08 mg of ni 1 5 10 4 2 5 10 4 mg of cd and 0 05 0 25 mg of pb per gram of protein at the 0 50 cm in the four sites grsp bound metal concentrations were even up to 60 fold of total metal concentrations in sediments indicating that grsp has high capacity to sequester and accumulate heavy metals there were no statistically significant differences in grsp bound metal concentrations across all soil layers except cr and as however there was a significant difference in most metal concentrations at different sampling sites listed in supplementary table 2 grsp bound mn cr cu and zn concentrations in almost all soil layers in the mudflat were significantly higher than those in mangrove sites while pb and as 20 50 cm concentrations were significantly lower fig 3 listed in supplementary fig 1 the average heavy metal ratio in the mangrove wetland decreased in the order as cu zn cr pb fe ni mn cd fig 4 that indicated relatively higher contributions of as 22 56 2 44 cu 21 41 1 59 zn 16 32 5 09 and cr 12 62 0 93 and the lowest contributions of cd 3 31 0 45 to the sum of the ratios in mudflat samples there was a higher sum of ratios than in mangrove sites indicating a higher heavy metals sequestration potential of per gram grsp the average contributions of grsp bound metals to the total metal in 0 50 cm sediments ranged from 0 36 to 0 71 of fe range 0 28 0 82 n 60 0 21 0 45 of mn range 0 13 0 54 n 60 0 61 2 27 of cr

n 60 0 19 0 43 of cd range 0 10 0 44 n 60 table 2 grsp bound as cu zn and cr have significantly higher contributions to total as cu zn and cr concentrations and the lowest contributions to total cd p 0 05 in addition grsp in the mudflat have a higher contribution to as cu zn and cr than in mangrove sites 3 4 grsp and heavy metal concentrations in suspended solids the mean t grsp concentrations in suspended solids were 1 64 0 06 2 95 0 17 2 76 0 07 and 2 39 0 09 mg g 1 in mudflat a marina a corniculatum k obovate respectively the mean ee grsp concentrations were 0 91 0 07 1 94 0 15 1 93 0 04 and 1 51 0 08 mg g 1 respectively table 3 t grsp and ee grsp concentrations were significantly higher in mangrove sites than in the mudflat the ratios of ee grsp to t grsp range 0 46 0 75 n 20 in suspended solids were significantly lower than in sediments p 0 05 the ranges of average concentrations of fe mn cr cu zn as ni cd and pb in suspended solids were 2 71 104 3 16 104 738 56 1053 78 21

separated from suspended solids displayed a wide variation in metal concentrations fig 5 metal concentrations associated with grsp in the suspended solids ranged from 64 9 to 150 7 mg of fe 1 16 3 41 mg of mn 0 20 0 51 mg of cr 0 12 0 29 mg of cu 0 19 0 68 mg of zn 0 07 0 14 mg of as 0 04 0 08 mg of ni 1 2 10 4 3 0 10 4 mg of cd and 0 07 0 27 mg of pb per gram of grsp at four sites fig 5 similar to the grsp bound metals in the sediments grsp bound mn cr cu and zn concentrations at the suspended solids in the mudflat were significantly higher than almost all mangrove sites but significantly lower pb and as concentrations fig 5 p 0 05 the ratio of grsp bound metal concentration to total metal concentration grsp bound metal total metal concentration and the sum of ratios of all the heavy metals in suspended solids were illustrated in fig 6 similar to sediments suspended solid samples have a higher sum of ratios in the mudflat in mangrove sites sequestration potential of grsp in suspended solids was almost 2 fold that of surface sediments indicating grsp has a higher sequestration potential for heavy metals in suspended solids contributions of grsp bound metals were 0 42 1 58 fe 0 28 1 02 mn 1 04 6 00 cr 2 21 5 04 cu 1 06 2 98 zn 2 92 10 86 as 0 48 1 86 ni 0 26 1 84 cd 0 28 2 81 pb table 3 in the mudflat contributions of grsp bound fe mn pb and as in suspended solid samples were significantly lower than those in mangrove sites p 0 05 compared with sediments grsp contributions to nine metals were obviously greater in suspended solids especially as the grsp therefore could play a central role in metal transport and sequestration in mangrove wetland not only in suspended solids but also in sediments 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between grsp and heavy metal pollution in sediments from the natural mangrove ecosystem in southeast china the concentrations of ee grsp and t grsp in the surface sediments across mangrove forest and mudflat were 1 38 2 16 mg g 1 and 1 48 2 60 mg g 1 respectively table 2 the concentrations of t grsp in the mangrove sediments were in the range of concentrations of the protein in soils from a floodplain in montana harner et al 2004 a subtropical forest zhang et al 2015 and a tropical rain forest in costa rica lovelock et al 2004 the occurrence of grsp at 0 50 cm depth in the sediment profiles suggests that the protein may move vertically in the sediment profiles or be deposited at depth wang et al 2018a mangrove sediments have significant higher grsp concentrations compared with mudflat possibly because the complex roots of mangrove enhanced deposition of soil particles especially suspended solids and terrigenous matters adame et al 2010 additionally as a recalcitrant and glue like soil protein grsp accumulation in the sediment profiles could increase stabilization and burial of contaminants especially heavy metals chern et al 2007 however few studies have focused on the effects of heavy metal contaminants on the grsp concentration in mangrove ecosystems in the present study the concentrations of t grsp and ee grsp were positively correlated with the combined indicators of heavy metals this result suggested that grsp concentrations covaried with heavy metal concentrations which in turn could indicate indirectly the contamination level in the mangrove wetlands fig 2 rillig and steinberg 2002 grsp was accumulated in the sediment profiles and its metal sequestration ability further implied that grsp could play a key role in metal storage which promoted ecological rehabilitation in mangrove wetlands 4 2 contribution of grsp in heavy metal sequestration in sediments in this study all heavy metals in almost all soil depths exceeded the lowest effect levels lel thresholds except that cd was below the lel fig 1 this suggested that heavy metal pollution in sediments in the mangrove ecosystem has resulted in considerable or moderate ecological risk for the current reclamation which is consistent with previous studies liu et al 2014 meanwhile risk assessment of extractable metals in the same site by our previous work also indicated potential metal pollution risk existed in mangrove sediments liu et al 2010 during transport and accumulation of grsp we found that grsp sequestered large amounts of heavy metals fe mn cr cu zn as ni cd and pb in the sediment profiles suggesting that grsp had high capacity to sequester heavy metals which could accumulate in the profiles in the mangrove ecosystem fig 3 our result agreed with a previous study that grsp effectively sequestered cd fe mn and pb in embankment soils and sediments along an urban coastal watershed chern et al 2007 furthermore previous research reported that each gram of grsp sequestered as much as 44 7 mg of fe 1 88 mg of mn 4 29 mg of cu 1 70 mg of zn 0 08 mg of cd and 1 12 mg of pb in two polluted soils in devon consol mines gonzález chávez et al 2004 in contrast our results showed that each gram of grsp sequestered more fe 71 3 133 9 mg g 1 and mn 0 31 2 25 mg g 1 but less cu zn cd and pb in the sediments fig 3 based on the results we found that sediments contained significantly more fe and mn but less cu zn cd and pb than those two polluted soils and previous studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of grsp bound metals are positively correlated with total metal concentrations in the soils cornejo et al 2008 wu et al 2014 jia et al 2016 grsp bound mn was second only to the protein s fe concentration which was similar to previous research gonzález chávez et al 2004 the heavy metal sequestration potential of grsp in all sediment samples followed the order as cu zn cr pb fe ni mn cd fig 4 interestingly grsp has an obviously higher metal sequestration potential in the mudflat than in mangrove sites although concentrations of most metals were lower in sediments in the mudflat figs 1 and 4 this could be attributed to 1 with low elevations the mudflat has more complex hydrological conditions or more variable pollutant sources where it s frequently flooded by neap and spring tides 2 in mudflat grsp is an exogenous protein that is deposited and transported from other sources and a significant quantity of grsp is leached and washed into water during transport harner et al 2004 chern et al 2007 which increases grsp exposure to heavy metals these results further emphasized that grsp and associated heavy metals could be deposited in sediments during transport which reduced the retention of metal contaminants in waterbody similar to grsp sequestration potential grsp contributions to total concentrations of cu zn and cr were higher than its contributions to other metals in the sediments table 2 agreeing with previous studies in terrestrial soils that showed great contributions of grsp to cu zn and cr gonzález chávez et al 2004 cornejo et al 2008 gil cardeza et al 2014 remarkably this was the first study to record the substantial contribution of grsp to arsenic sequestration fig 4 table 2 generally as concentration is significantly associated with fe mn and organic matter contents in sediments in mangrove ecosystems meharg et al 2006 hossain et al 2012 our results demonstrated that grsp was a significant component of sediment organic matter and contained large amounts of fe and mn furthermore we found that concentrations of grsp and grsp bound fe were positively correlated with as concentration in grsp r 0 38 p 0 05 r 0 34 p 0 05 which agreed with previous observations these findings raise awareness of the combination of arsenic in wetland our data concluded that grsp restored water quality by increasing sequestration of heavy metals including arsenic and burying them in sediment profiles in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem 4 3 grsp in suspended solids 4 3 1 grsp contribution to suspended solid s biogeochemistry the concentrations of ee grsp and t grsp in the suspended solids across mangrove wetlands were 0 82 2 25 mg g 1 and 1 50 3 42 mg g 1 respectively table 3 compared with sediments a decrease in ee grsp with an increased t grsp in suspended solids might therefore result in a lower ee grsp t grsp ratio suggesting that suspended solids with high t grsp levels could contain considerably older grsp tables 1 and 2 those results also showed that suspended solids could be an important factor affecting grsp distribution in sediments because suspended solids contained large amounts of grsp and could be transported or deposited with tides and rivers in mangrove ecosystems therefore grsp acted as a bridge connecting suspended solids and sediments suspended solids had a high organic matter content that contained 7 6 18 1 mg g 1 of soc and 0 9 1 8 mg g 1 of tn in addition soc and tn concentrations were positively correlated with ee grsp or t grsp concentrations listed in supplementary fig 2 this finding was consistent with studies in coastal sediments and terrestrial soils wang et al 2018a b zhang et al 2015 the c and n in grsp accounted for approximately 2 9 5 3 of total organic c and 1 6 4 8 of total nitrogen n in the suspended solids this was similar to grsp contributions to soil c and n in the 0 10 cm soil layer in the mangrove sediments based on our initial findings in suspended solids we expected that grsp could improve water quality by protecting organic matter from decomposing because of the hydrophobic and recalcitrant nature of grsp rillig et al 2001 harner et al 2004 lópez merino et al 2015 furthermore grsp is an aggregate binding agent and can bind together organic matter and clay particles to form water stable aggregates harner et al 2004 rillig 2004 spohn and giani 2010 which might increase size of suspended solids and enhance deposition of those flocculated materials therefore we expect grsp to be an important mechanism underlying the fact that suspended solids are transported frequently in the form of larger aggregated flocs droppo 2001 bilotta and brazier 2008 4 3 2 effect of grsp on heavy metal sequestration here the suspended solids contained heavy metal concentrations equivalent to or even higher than those in sediments fig 5 which is in agreement with the results of previous studies in the river danube woitke et al 2003 indicating that suspended solids are an extremely important cause of water quality deterioration bilotta and brazier 2008 we found that there were common sources for heavy metals in the sediments and suspended solids by pca analysis table 1 and complex mangrove roots enhanced deposition and accretion capacity of suspended solids adame et al 2010 thus suspended solids and sediments were interconnected and suspended solids transport and deposition could be a significant source of sediment contamination despite some studies on the contributions of grsp to heavy metal sequestration gonzález chávez et al 2004 cornejo et al 2008 jia et al 2016 the grsp contributions in suspended solids is poorly known the heavy metal sequestration order of grsp in suspended solids is similar to that in sediments figs 4 and 6 in contrast to grsp in sediments grsp in suspended solids had a relatively higher heavy metal sequestration potential especially in mangrove sites figs 4 and 6 suspended solids in the interface between sediment and water could increase the glue like protein exposure to metal contaminants fig 7 furthermore grsp a glue like protein could be a significant mechanism of heavy metal adsorption by suspended solids in this study we showed that grsp had greater contributions to total metal concentrations in suspended solids than in sediments especially to metalloid as table 3 interestingly we also found that grsp bound fe and mn concentrations in suspended solids were significantly higher than other grsp bound metals fe and mn concentrations were positively correlated with as concentration in the grsp r 0 48 p 0 03 r 0 84 p 0 001 which was a significant component of the organic matter in suspended solids that is consistent with previous studies that as concentration is associated with fe mn and organic matter hossain et al 2012 in both sediments and suspended solids grsp contained 6 15 fe which could be responsible for sequestering elevated as of grsp 4 4 grsp a driver for heavy metal cycling in wetlands as is shown in fig 7 we hypothesized that grsp could adsorb or capture more heavy metals during transport because of its high potential of sequestering heavy metals in suspended solids and mudflat we put forward that hypothesis because grsp is an aggregate binding agent and can be leached or washed from soils and released into waterbody harner et al 2004 thus we expected that the grsp could be a metal carrier during transport in aquatic environments in this study our results demonstrated that grsp as it sequestered large amounts of heavy metals and buried them in sediment profiles was an effective bioremediation or sequestration agent in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem in a previous study our result has shown that grsp binds metals and is deposited in sediment at old yellow river delta wang et al 2018b which implied that grsp could reduce metal bioavailability and improve water quality gonzález chávez et al 2004 furthermore we found that environmental change sample sites significantly affected grsp bound metal concentrations listed in supplementary table 2 indicating that grsp might also be a heavy metal source for aquatic environments because it could release heavy metals through the slow decomposition of microbes during transport chern et al 2007 the role of grsp in the in situ sequestration and dynamic transport of heavy metals can provide important indications for pathways of transport deposition and release of metals in the marine environment fig 7 5 conclusions in summary we provided new evidence of grsp contribution to water quality improvement through enhancing sediment associated heavy metal loading and suspended solids adsorption of heavy metals in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem the main conclusions can be drawn as follows grsp sequestered large amounts of heavy metals and buried them in the sediment profiles furthermore this is the first study to show that grsp effectively sequestered metalloid arsenic which was found to be associated with elevated fe in grsp given that suspended solids contained substantial grsp their transport and deposition could be a significant factor affecting grsp distributions in the mangrove ecosystem grsp is a significant component of the c and n pools in the suspended solids which affected deposition characteristics of suspended solids grsp was present in sediments as well as in suspended solids which provided an important channel for grsp transport grsp in suspended solids has a higher metal sequestration potential than in sediments which ultimately contributed to metal cycling in aquatic systems our results could advance current understanding of the ecological functions of grsp and provide new insights into the water quality improvement in coastal mangrove wetlands authors contributions statement qiang wang and haoliang lu conceived the ideas and designed methodology qiang wang

contribution to water quality improvement with the senescence of hyphae and spores grsp is produced part of which is permanently buried in soil and sediment and part is transferred along with rivers groundwater to new ecosystems including aquatic and marine systems wang et al 2018a b adame et al 2010 2012 suspended solids as they are ubiquitous in aquatic systems under natural conditions are an important transport medium for terrestrial matter including grsp and are important for water quality restoration grsp could increase adsorption of heavy metals by suspended solids and enhanced their deposition chern et al 2007 adame et al 2010 grsp can adsorb and sequestrate large amounts of heavy metals in vitro which stabilizes metals reduces metal availability and decreases the toxicity risk gonzález chávez et al 2004 furthermore grsp is leached or washed from soils and released into waterbody harner et al 2004 thus promoting grsp s ability to capture or adsorb heavy metals that ultimately deposited and are buried in sediments during transport remarkably grsp can be buried for 1250 years in sediments lópez merino et al 2015 which implies a substantial role for grsp in heavy metal sequestration wang et al 2018b thus improving ecological environments and facilitating hyphae and spores growth rillig and steinberg 2002 combined grsp could improve water quality through two

xiamen university xiamen 361102 china key laboratory of ministry of education for coastal and wetland ecosystems xiamen university xiamen 361102 china glomalin related soil protein grsp is a widespread glycoprotein found to have strong ability of sequestering heavy metals in soils however the underlying mechanism for metal and metalloid removal as well as water quality improvement and the ecological role played by grsp are still not well documented this study was initiated to investigate the interconnection of metal loading in grsp between sediments and suspended solids focusing on the mobilization mechanisms of grsp in the coastal mangrove wetland combined indicators of nine heavy metals were significantly positively correlated with grsp concentration by principal component analysis indicating that grsp could act as an indicator of contamination level in the mangrove wetlands large distribution of grsp in sediments and suspended solids elevated sequestration potential of heavy metals fe mn cr cu zn ni cd pb and metalloid arsenic in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem grsp mobilized and sequestered heavy metals in sediment profiles which reduced the bioavailability of heavy metals grsp was also a significant contributor for suspended solids to adsorb heavy metals enhancing suspended solids deposition and burial process in sediments this new finding provided insights into the ecological functions of grsp and the heavy metal cycling in wetland environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental assessment metal binding sediment suspended solids coastal water quality 1 introduction coastal mangrove ecosystems which commonly thrive in the tropical and subtropical intertidal estuarine wetlands are a potential large depositional pool of heavy metals and thereby play a key role for water quality restoration alongi et al 2004 de wolf and rashid 2008 mangrove forests could regulate sediment characteristics including acidity redox potential salinity and organic matter contents which facilitates heavy metal accumulation in sediments and subsequently reduces heavy metal exposure to the adjacent oceans alongi et al 2004 zhou et al 2010 donato et al 2011 furthermore mangroves can effectively restore water quality by enhancing deposition of suspended solids from tidal water rivers and storm water runoff adame et al 2010 lacerda et al 1988 however the relative importance of these mechanisms for stabilization and accumulation of heavy metals in mangrove wetlands is not well explored recent findings documented that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce a recalcitrant glycoprotein glomalin related soil protein grsp which is deposited into soils and sediments after the senescence of hyphae and spores wright and upadhyaya 1996 adame et al 2012 wang et al 2018a b generally grsp is categorized into two fractions by using assay methods easily extractable and total grsp ee grsp and t grsp wright and upadhyaya 1996 zhang et al 2015 ee grsp is considered as the newly produced or relatively labile fraction koide and peoples 2013 as a stable fungal protein grsp is distributed in terrestrial ecosystems such as forests grasslands desert and agricultural ecosystems treseder and turner 2007 singh et al 2013 and has a turnover time of 6 42 years rillig et al 2001 which implies a substantial role of grsp in soil carbon sequestration treseder and turner 2007 grsp is also transported and deposited by erosion river foam and groundwater into coastal wetland and marine ecosystems harner et al 2004 adame et al 2010 2012 wang et al 2018a b where it accumulates and remains a long term record about 1250 years lópez merino et al 2015 meanwhile coastal wetland ecosystems even contain higher grsp contents compared with terrestrial ecosystems harner et al 2004 wang et al 2018a furthermore grsp is a glue like protein and insoluble in water and it binds together organic matter and clay particles to form water stable aggregates rillig 2004 spohn and giani 2010 thus grsp could be used as a novel bioflocculant or aggregate binding agent in soils and sediments which implies that grsp can be a metal binding protein in mangrove wetlands spohn and giani 2010 chern et al 2007 soil proteins including detrital proteins and functional proteins are recognized increasingly to play major roles in controls on persistence of soil organic matter rillig et al 2007 as a recalcitrant sticky and hydrophobic soil protein grsp binds and sequesters copious amounts of heavy metals and thus can help to remediate polluted soils in terrestrial ecosystems gonzález chávez et al 2004 cornejo et al 2008 vodnik et al 2008 jia et al 2016 an early study showed grsp and associated metals can be transported with sediment erosion into the urban coastal watersheds chern et al 2007 however deposition and burial of the protein and its potential of sequestering heavy metals in mangrove sediment profiles were not known a survey of grsp in suspended solids indicated that grsp can be transported with suspended solids adame et al 2010 suspended solids distribution which relates to the physical chemical and biological properties of the waterbody is known to be a key driver factor of water quality deterioration mccarthy et al 2012 bilotta and brazier 2008 the suspended solids load and their metal content significantly affected the balance between inputs and outputs of metals in estuarine areas lacerda et al 1988 sarma et al 2012 consequently suspended solids may play a key role in understanding metal biogeochemical processes in sediments of mangrove ecosystems sarma et al 2012 however there is no direct evidence about the intrinsic mechanism of suspended solids adsorbing heavy metals and how the interconnection between suspended solids and sediments contributes to water quality restoration in mangrove wetlands the aim of this study is to reveal the mechanisms of grsp in sediment associated heavy metal accumulation and heavy metal adsorption by suspended solids as well as sediment loading and to reveal the potential ecological role of this stable fungal protein in water quality restoration in coastal wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in zhangjiang river estuary mangrove national natural reserve which runs into dongshan bay fujian province southeast china 23 53ʹn 117 30ʹe

dominant species the mean height of a marina plants is 3 3 m k obovata plants 4 7 m and a corniculatum plants 2 7 m wang et al 2014 2 2 sample collection and preparation in the mangrove nature reserve of zhangjiang estuary china four sample sites were chosen for this study including mudflat pure mangrove stand of a marina k obovata and a corniculatum in october 2016 all samples including core sediments 60 sediment samples in 12 cores and suspended solids 20 samples were collected twelve core sediment samples 0 50 cm three duplicates at each site were collected using acid washed pvc pipes of 70 cm in length and 7 5 cm in internal diameter and immediately capped and sealed to avoid oxygen diffusion before transfer to the laboratory after being transported to the laboratory the sediments in the cores were drawn out and separated into 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 50 cm segments under nitrogen gas in the field we used sediment trap method to collect suspended solids thomas and ridd 2004 adame et al 2010 traps were devised by acid washed pvc pipes of 25 cm in length and 5 cm in internal diameter samples were taken in five points within each sample site and the traps were collected during low tide after 2 weeks the water samples in the trap were filtered through a pre weighed 47 mm glass microfibre gf c whatman filter 1 2 μm pore size in laboratory adame et al 2010 all sampling locations were spaced at least 50 m intervals within each sample site after plants material and stones were picked out from core sediments the sediment samples were freeze dried then the dry samples were ground in an agate mortar and sieved to 0 25 mm and 0 149 mm respectively for the analysis of grsp organic matter and heavy metals the filter papers were spread out in petri dishes air dried and sieved for further analysis 2 3 sample analysis 2 3 1 heavy metal and organic matter determination the total iron fe manganese mn chromium cr copper cu zinc zn arsenic as nickel ni cadmium cd and lead pb concentrations were determined in the core sediments and suspended solids by pressurizing digestion 0 1 g of 0 149 mm sieved sediment samples with an acid mixture of concentrated hf hno3 and hclo4 5 2 1 v v v gao and chen 2012 all heavy metal concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700x agilent technologies usa quality assurance and quality control were assessed using duplicates method blanks and the chinese national certified reference materials gsd 12 with each set of samples the results were consistent with the reference values and the recovery rates were all among 90 106 the total organic carbon c and total nitrogen n contents were determined using a vario el iii chnos elemental analyzer 2 3 2 glomalin related soil protein grsp analyses easily extractable glomalin ee grsp and total glomalin t grsp concentrations were determined in the core sediments and suspended solids grsp extractions were determined by an improved protocol wang et al 2018a based on the bradford protein assay wright and upadhyaya 1996 ee grsp was extracted at 121 c with 20 mm sodium citrate ph 7 0 for 30 min t grsp was repeatedly extracted at 121 c with 50 mm sodium citrate ph 8 0 for 60 min until the supernatant was straw colored for each of the autoclaving cycles the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min and collected into clean 50 ml centrifuge tubes 4 c before determination the extracts were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10min to remove soil particles ee grsp and t grsp concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by the bradford dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard to determine heavy metals bound to grsp we used the modified method described by gonzález chávez et al 2004 briefly the above supernatants were precipitated by slowly adding 1 m hcl until the ph of the solution reached 2 the acidified supernatants were settled in ice for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min the precipitate was then re dissolved in 0 1 m naoh dialyzed against deionized water and freeze dried the concentrations of grsp bound heavy metals fe al mn cr ni cu zn as cd and pb were determined using icp ms agilent 7700x agilent technologies usa after pressurized acid digestion with a mixture of 4 ml of hno3 and 2 ml of h2o2 the c and n contents in the t grsp were determined by a vario el iii chnos elemental analyzer furthermore we defined grsp and heavy metals in suspended solids as transportation in sediments as accumulation in this study the contribution of grsp bound metals was calculated from the measured concentration of grsp concentration of grsp bound metals and total metal concentration as follows g r s p c o n t r i b u t i o n grsp concentration grsp bound metal concentration total metal concentration we also calculated the ratio of grsp bound metal concentrations to total metal concentrations and the sum of the ratios to estimate the metal sequestration potential of grsp sequestration potential of grsp was calculated as follows grsp sequestration potential grsp b o u n d m e t a l t o t a l m e t a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was conducted using spss 22 0 software package spss usa prior to significance analysis normality was assessed by the shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variances was determined by levene s test one way anova analyses were performed to test the differences among four sampling sites and between different sediment layers at 0 50 cm two way anova analyses were implemented to test differences caused by sediment layer depths and sample sites regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between grsp fractions and total organic c or total nitrogen n because many of the heavy metals are highly correlated we used principal components analysis pca to assess whether grsp concentrations vary with combined indicators of heavy metal pollution factor 1 significant differences between treatments were determined with least significant difference lsd for multiple comparisons at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 vertical distribution of heavy metals in the sediments fig 1 illustrates the vertical profiles of total heavy metal concentrations at 0 50 cm at the four sampling sites the ranges of concentrations of fe mn cr cu zn as ni cd and pb were 3 3 104 4 6 104 291 5 1036 7 28 4 72 8 12 1 23 7 10 6 140 9 3 1 16 5 14 2 34 2 0 10 0 28 and 47 9 83 3 mg kg 1 respectively a significant decrease in mn cr and cu concentrations with the increasing depth was observed at the mudflat site p 0 05 indicating recent heavy metal pollution probably the concentrations varied along sediment profiles because of molecular diffusion furthermore the average concentrations at the 0 50 cm sediments from the mangrove sites contained more fe cr cu zn as ni cd and pb than mudflat sediments but a significantly lower mn concentration p 0 05 the results of two way anova analysis for the sampling sites and soil layer depth showed that different sampling sites demonstrated a significant difference in the concentrations of all those heavy metals while soil layer depth was not significantly correlated with those heavy metals except fe and mn listed in supplementary table 1 all sediment samples for fe cr pb and 70 90 soil samples for mn cu as and ni exceeded the lowest effect level according to the ontario guidelines lel below which no effects on the majority of sediment dwelling organisms are expected moreover fe concentrations in different soil layers in the mangrove sites even exceeded the severe effect levels sel fig 1 those results implied the toxic impact of heavy metals on the mangrove ecosystem which might be reintroduced into waterbody and cause adverse effects on adjacent aquatic environments 3 2 relationship between grsp and heavy metals in sediments total extractable glomalin t grsp and easily extractable glomalin ee grsp in samples at 0 10 cm across the mangrove forests and mudflat ranged from 1 48 mg g 1 to 2 60 mg g 1 and from 1 38 mg g 1 to 2 16 mg g 1 respectively both t grsp and ee grsp concentrations were significantly higher in the mangrove forests than in the mudflat p 0 001 interestingly we found that grsp occurred at all sediment layers at 0 50 cm t grsp and ee grsp concentrations decreased with an increasing sediment depth under all sample sites indicating that grsp could be transported and accumulate in sediment profiles because of co variation across many metal elements a principal component analysis was used to test the relationship between variation in heavy metal pollution and grsp concentrations at 0 50 cm for the total metal concentration in sediments two principle components pcs explained 68 of the variation in the total suite of heavy metals the first principal component pc1 explained 52 3 of the total variance this component was strongly and positively related to zn pb cd cr cu fe as and ni table 1 the second principal component pc2 accounted for 15 4 of the variation in the metals data and showed highly positive factor loadings on mn t grsp and ee grsp were significantly positively correlated with pc1 fig 4a and b which suggested that grsp could be a significant driver of heavy metal biogeochemical cycle in the mangrove wetland similar to heavy metals in sediments two main factors in the suspended solids explained 78 of the total variance the first pc1 explaining 62 6 of the total variance was also strongly and positively related to zn pb cd cr cu fe as and ni the second pc2 explaining 15 1 of the total variance was also characterized by strong positive contributions from mn table 1 those degrees of covariance are strongly suggestive of common sources for the metals among the sediments and suspended solids 3 3 grsp and heavy metal sequestration in the sediments metal concentrations associated with grsp ranged from 71 3 to 133 9 mg of fe 0 31 2 25 mg of mn 0 12 0 57 mg of cr 0 04 0 30 mg of cu 0 21 0 93 mg of zn 0 04 0 14 mg of as 0 04 0 08 mg of ni 1 5 10 4 2 5 10 4 mg of cd and 0 05 0 25 mg of pb per gram of protein at the 0 50 cm in the four sites grsp bound metal concentrations were even up to 60 fold of total metal concentrations in sediments indicating that grsp has high capacity to sequester and accumulate heavy metals there were no statistically significant differences in grsp bound metal concentrations across all soil layers except cr and as however there was a significant difference in most metal concentrations at different sampling sites listed in supplementary table 2 grsp bound mn cr cu and zn concentrations in almost all soil layers in the mudflat were significantly higher than those in mangrove sites while pb and as 20 50 cm concentrations were significantly lower fig 3 listed in supplementary fig 1 the average heavy metal ratio in the mangrove wetland decreased in the order as cu zn cr pb fe ni mn cd fig 4 that indicated relatively higher contributions of as 22 56 2 44 cu 21 41 1 59 zn 16 32 5 09 and cr 12 62 0 93 and the lowest contributions of cd 3 31 0 45 to the sum of the ratios in mudflat samples there was a higher sum of ratios than in mangrove sites indicating a higher heavy metals sequestration potential of per gram grsp the average contributions of grsp bound metals to the total metal in 0 50 cm sediments ranged from 0 36 to 0 71 of fe range 0 28 0 82 n 60 0 21 0 45 of mn range 0 13 0 54 n 60 0 61 2 27 of cr

0 05 in addition grsp in the mudflat have a higher contribution to as cu zn and cr than in mangrove sites 3 4 grsp and heavy metal concentrations in suspended solids the mean t grsp concentrations in suspended solids were 1 64 0 06 2 95 0 17 2 76 0 07 and 2 39 0 09 mg g 1 in mudflat a marina a corniculatum k obovate respectively the mean ee grsp concentrations were 0 91 0 07 1 94 0 15 1 93 0 04 and 1 51 0 08 mg g 1 respectively table 3 t grsp and ee grsp concentrations were significantly higher in mangrove sites than in the mudflat the ratios of ee grsp to t grsp range 0 46 0 75 n 20 in suspended solids were significantly lower than in sediments p 0 05 the ranges of average concentrations of fe mn cr cu zn as ni cd and pb in suspended solids were 2 71 104 3 16 104 738 56 1053 78 21

separated from suspended solids displayed a wide variation in metal concentrations fig 5 metal concentrations associated with grsp in the suspended solids ranged from 64 9 to 150 7 mg of fe 1 16 3 41

to the grsp bound metals in the sediments grsp bound mn cr cu and zn concentrations at the suspended solids in the mudflat were significantly higher than almost all mangrove sites but significantly lower pb and as concentrations fig 5 p 0 05 the ratio of grsp bound metal concentration to total metal concentration grsp bound metal total metal concentration and the sum of ratios of all the heavy metals in suspended solids were illustrated in fig 6 similar to sediments suspended solid samples have a higher sum of ratios in the mudflat in mangrove sites sequestration potential of grsp in suspended solids was almost 2 fold that of surface sediments indicating grsp has a higher sequestration potential for heavy metals in suspended solids contributions of grsp bound metals were 0 42 1 58 fe 0 28 1 02 mn 1 04 6 00 cr 2 21 5 04 cu 1 06 2 98 zn 2 92 10 86 as 0 48 1 86 ni 0 26 1 84 cd 0 28 2 81 pb table 3 in the mudflat contributions of grsp bound fe mn pb and as in suspended solid samples were significantly lower than those in mangrove sites p 0 05 compared with sediments grsp contributions to nine metals were obviously greater in suspended solids especially as the grsp therefore could play a central role in metal transport and sequestration in mangrove wetland not only in suspended solids but also in sediments 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between grsp and heavy metal pollution in sediments from the natural mangrove ecosystem in southeast china the concentrations of ee grsp and t grsp in the surface sediments across mangrove forest and mudflat were 1 38 2 16 mg g 1 and 1 48 2 60 mg g 1 respectively table 2 the concentrations of t grsp in the mangrove sediments were in the range of concentrations of the protein in soils from a floodplain in montana harner et al 2004 a subtropical forest zhang et al 2015 and a tropical rain forest in costa rica lovelock et al 2004 the occurrence of grsp at 0 50 cm depth in the sediment profiles suggests that the protein may move vertically in the sediment profiles or be deposited at depth wang et al 2018a mangrove sediments have significant higher grsp concentrations compared with mudflat possibly because the complex roots of mangrove enhanced deposition of soil particles especially suspended solids and terrigenous matters adame et al 2010 additionally as a recalcitrant and glue like soil protein grsp accumulation in the sediment profiles could increase stabilization and burial of contaminants especially heavy metals chern et al 2007 however few studies have focused on the effects of heavy metal contaminants on the grsp concentration in mangrove ecosystems in the present study the concentrations of t grsp and ee grsp were positively correlated with the combined indicators of heavy metals this result suggested that grsp concentrations covaried with heavy metal concentrations which in turn could indicate indirectly the contamination level in the mangrove wetlands fig 2 rillig and steinberg 2002 grsp was accumulated in the sediment profiles and its metal sequestration ability further implied that grsp could play a key role in metal storage which promoted ecological rehabilitation in mangrove wetlands 4 2 contribution of grsp in heavy metal sequestration in sediments in this study all heavy metals in almost all soil depths exceeded the lowest effect levels lel thresholds except that cd was below the lel fig 1 this suggested that heavy metal pollution in sediments in the mangrove ecosystem has resulted in considerable or moderate ecological risk for the current reclamation which is consistent with previous studies liu et al 2014 meanwhile risk assessment of extractable metals in the same site by our previous work also indicated potential metal pollution risk existed in mangrove sediments liu et al 2010 during transport and accumulation of grsp we found that grsp sequestered large amounts of heavy metals fe mn cr cu zn as ni cd and pb in the sediment profiles suggesting that grsp had high capacity to sequester heavy metals which could accumulate in the profiles in the mangrove ecosystem fig 3 our result agreed with a previous study that grsp effectively sequestered cd fe mn and pb in embankment soils and sediments along an urban coastal watershed chern et al 2007 furthermore previous research reported that each gram of grsp sequestered as much as 44 7 mg of fe 1 88 mg of mn 4 29 mg of cu 1 70 mg of zn 0 08 mg of cd and 1 12 mg of pb in two polluted soils in devon consol mines gonzález chávez et al 2004 in contrast our results showed that each gram of grsp sequestered more fe 71 3 133 9 mg g 1 and mn 0 31 2 25 mg g 1 but less cu zn cd and pb in the sediments fig 3 based on the results we found that sediments contained significantly more fe and mn but less cu zn cd and pb than those two polluted soils and previous studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of grsp bound metals are positively correlated with total metal concentrations in the soils cornejo et al 2008 wu et al 2014 jia et al 2016 grsp bound mn was second only to the protein s fe concentration which was similar to previous research gonzález chávez et al 2004 the heavy metal sequestration potential of grsp in all sediment samples followed the order as cu zn cr pb fe ni mn cd fig 4 interestingly grsp has an obviously higher metal sequestration potential in the mudflat than in mangrove sites although concentrations of most metals were lower in sediments in the mudflat figs 1 and 4 this could be attributed to 1 with low elevations the mudflat has more complex hydrological conditions or more variable pollutant sources where it s frequently flooded by neap and spring tides 2 in mudflat grsp is an exogenous protein that is deposited and transported from other sources and a significant quantity of grsp is leached and washed into water during transport harner et al 2004 chern et al 2007 which increases grsp exposure to heavy metals these results further emphasized that grsp and associated heavy metals could be deposited in sediments during transport which reduced the retention of metal contaminants in waterbody similar to grsp sequestration potential grsp contributions to total concentrations of cu zn and cr were higher than its contributions to other metals in the sediments table 2 agreeing with previous studies in terrestrial soils that showed great contributions of grsp to cu zn and cr gonzález chávez et al 2004 cornejo et al 2008 gil cardeza et al 2014 remarkably this was the first study to record the substantial contribution of grsp to arsenic sequestration fig 4 table 2 generally as concentration is significantly associated with fe mn and organic matter contents in sediments in mangrove ecosystems meharg et al 2006 hossain et al 2012 our results demonstrated that grsp was a significant component of sediment organic matter and contained large amounts of fe and mn furthermore we found that concentrations of grsp and grsp bound fe were positively correlated with as concentration in grsp r 0 38 p 0 05 r 0 34 p 0 05 which agreed with previous observations these findings raise awareness of the combination of arsenic in wetland our data concluded that grsp restored water quality by increasing sequestration of heavy metals including arsenic and burying them in sediment profiles in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem 4 3 grsp in suspended solids 4 3 1 grsp contribution to suspended solid s biogeochemistry the concentrations of ee grsp and t grsp in the suspended solids across mangrove wetlands were 0 82 2 25 mg g 1 and 1 50 3 42 mg g 1 respectively table 3 compared with sediments a decrease in ee grsp with an increased t grsp in suspended solids might therefore result in a lower ee grsp t grsp ratio suggesting that suspended solids with high t grsp levels could contain considerably older grsp tables 1 and 2 those results also showed that suspended solids could be an important factor affecting grsp distribution in sediments because suspended solids contained large amounts of grsp and could be transported or deposited with tides and rivers in mangrove ecosystems therefore grsp acted as a bridge connecting suspended solids and sediments suspended solids had a high organic matter content that contained 7 6 18 1 mg g 1 of soc and 0 9 1 8 mg g 1 of tn in addition soc and tn concentrations were positively correlated with ee grsp or t grsp concentrations listed in supplementary fig 2 this finding was consistent with studies in coastal sediments and terrestrial soils wang et al 2018a b zhang et al 2015 the c and n in grsp accounted for approximately 2 9 5 3 of total organic c and 1 6 4 8 of total nitrogen n in the suspended solids this was similar to grsp contributions to soil c and n in the 0 10 cm soil layer in the mangrove sediments based on our initial findings in suspended solids we expected that grsp could improve water quality by protecting organic matter from decomposing because of the hydrophobic and recalcitrant nature of grsp rillig et al 2001 harner et al 2004 lópez merino et al 2015 furthermore grsp is an aggregate binding agent and can bind together organic matter and clay particles to form water stable aggregates harner et al 2004 rillig 2004 spohn and giani 2010 which might increase size of suspended solids and enhance deposition of those flocculated materials therefore we expect grsp to be an important mechanism underlying the fact that suspended solids are transported frequently in the form of larger aggregated flocs droppo 2001 bilotta and brazier 2008 4 3 2 effect of grsp on heavy metal sequestration here the suspended solids contained heavy metal concentrations equivalent to or even higher than those in sediments fig 5 which is in agreement with the results of previous studies in the river danube woitke et al 2003 indicating that suspended solids are an extremely important cause of water quality deterioration bilotta and brazier 2008 we found that there were common sources for heavy metals in the sediments and suspended solids by pca analysis table 1 and complex mangrove roots enhanced deposition and accretion capacity of suspended solids adame et al 2010 thus suspended solids and sediments were interconnected and suspended solids transport and deposition could be a significant source of sediment contamination despite some studies on the contributions of grsp to heavy metal sequestration gonzález chávez et al 2004 cornejo et al 2008 jia et al 2016 the grsp contributions in suspended solids is poorly known the heavy metal sequestration order of grsp in suspended solids is similar to that in sediments figs 4 and 6 in contrast to grsp in sediments grsp in suspended solids had a relatively higher heavy metal sequestration potential especially in mangrove sites figs 4 and 6 suspended solids in the interface between sediment and water could increase the glue like protein exposure to metal contaminants fig 7 furthermore grsp a glue like protein could be a significant mechanism of heavy metal adsorption by suspended solids in this study we showed that grsp had greater contributions to total metal concentrations in suspended solids than in sediments especially to metalloid as table 3 interestingly we also found that grsp bound fe and mn concentrations in suspended solids were significantly higher than other grsp bound metals fe and mn concentrations were positively correlated with as concentration in the grsp r 0 48 p 0 03 r 0 84 p 0 001 which was a significant component of the organic matter in suspended solids that is consistent with previous studies that as concentration is associated with fe mn and organic matter hossain et al 2012 in both sediments and suspended solids grsp contained 6 15 fe which could be responsible for sequestering elevated as of grsp 4 4 grsp a driver for heavy metal cycling in wetlands as is shown in fig 7 we hypothesized that grsp could adsorb or capture more heavy metals during transport because of its high potential of sequestering heavy metals in suspended solids and mudflat we put forward that hypothesis because grsp is an aggregate binding agent and can be leached or washed from soils and released into waterbody harner et al 2004 thus we expected that the grsp could be a metal carrier during transport in aquatic environments in this study our results demonstrated that grsp as it sequestered large amounts of heavy metals and buried them in sediment profiles was an effective bioremediation or sequestration agent in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem in a previous study our result has shown that grsp binds metals and is deposited in sediment at old yellow river delta wang et al 2018b which implied that grsp could reduce metal bioavailability and improve water quality gonzález chávez et al 2004 furthermore we found that environmental change sample sites significantly affected grsp bound metal concentrations listed in supplementary table 2 indicating that grsp might also be a heavy metal source for aquatic environments because it could release heavy metals through the slow decomposition of microbes during transport chern et al 2007 the role of grsp in the in situ sequestration and dynamic transport of heavy metals can provide important indications for pathways of transport deposition and release of metals in the marine environment fig 7 5 conclusions in summary we provided new evidence of grsp contribution to water quality improvement through enhancing sediment associated heavy metal loading and suspended solids adsorption of heavy metals in the mangrove aquatic ecosystem the main conclusions can be drawn as follows grsp sequestered large amounts of heavy metals and buried them in the sediment profiles furthermore this is the first study to show that grsp effectively sequestered metalloid arsenic which was found to be associated with elevated fe in grsp given that suspended solids contained substantial grsp their transport and deposition could be a significant factor affecting grsp distributions in the mangrove ecosystem grsp is a significant component of the c and n pools in the suspended solids which affected deposition characteristics of suspended solids grsp was present in sediments as well as in suspended solids which provided an important channel for grsp transport grsp in suspended solids has a higher metal sequestration potential than in sediments which ultimately contributed to metal cycling in aquatic systems our results could advance current understanding of the ecological functions of grsp and provide new insights into the water quality improvement in coastal mangrove wetlands authors contributions statement qiang wang and haoliang lu conceived the ideas and designed methodology qiang wang
