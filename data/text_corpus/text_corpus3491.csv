17455,previous studies demonstrate that free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 detaches sewer biofilms breaks down flocs of waste activated sludge was and enhances biogas production from was this suggests possible interactions of fna with organic extracellular polymeric substances eps that bind the cells into biofilms or sludge flocs this study evaluates the chemical interactions and reaction mechanisms between fna and molecules representative of key eps in biofilm and sludge flocs molecules chosen to represent components found in the extracellular polymeric matrix were treated with fna at 6 09 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 0 0 2 t 22 c for 24 hours conditions typically used in applications so as to consider the hypothesized chemical interactions and the consequent reaction pathways a number of analytical techniques were employed to measure the molecular changes in the eps molecules including proton 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry esi ms and gel permeation chromatography gpc the results demonstrated that fna broke down a range of large eps molecules including carbohydrates protein and lipids to smaller molecules two mechanistic pathways have been proposed including electrophilic substitution whereby the nitrosium ion no was the reactive electrophile and oxidative radical reactions through which the nitrogen radicals no2 no and reactive nitrogen intermediates rnis e g n2o3 and n2o4 formed from the decomposition of fna became part of the reaction products larger more complex organic molecules such as humic acid required higher concentrations of fna 6 09 mgn l or greater to cause molecular breakdown whereas smaller molecules such as calcium alginate was broken down at lower concentrations 3 04 mgn l the study

significant impact in both natural systems e g global biogeochemical cycles and engineered systems such as in wastewater treatment kim 2011 in these systems biofilms can have essential and beneficial roles however there are many instances where biofilms cause huge problems for example biofouling of clinical devices corrosion of expensive infrastructure such as concrete sewers jiang et al 2015a and increased roughness of ship hulls leading to greatly increased transport costs ciriminna et al 2015 therefore there are situations where control of biofilms either to enhance or eliminate them is highly important in the context of this paper biofilms include floccular structures such as those in activated sludge systems for wastewater treatment formed by microorganisms without a substratum extracellular polymeric substances eps are high molecular weight polymers secreted by microorganisms and are an essential element of the biofilm matrix evans 2000 eps are highly hydrated and mostly consist of polysaccharides and proteins but also include other macro molecules such as dna lipids and humic substances eps constitute 50 90 of biofilm s total organic matter donlan 2002 donlan and costerton 2002 and play essential roles in the biofilm state that include formation of the biofilm structure adhesion of cells and water retention flemming and wingener 2010 consequently for control of biofilms it is very important to understand and be able to manipulate the relevant eps molecules eps components including cell surface structures can be targeted as control points for manipulation of biofilms there are many strategies currently applied for biofilm control for example chlorine dioxide disinfection and enzyme based detergents simoes et al 2010 however these can have various limitations such as high costs associated with large chemical dosage and the production of harmful chlorinated disinfection biproducts improved approaches are therefore highly sought hasan et al 2013 recently free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite hno2 has emerged as a potentially sustainable and economic antimicrobial agent jiang et al 2011b fna is seen to have broad biocidal effects on an array of microorganisms which has led to its potential use in a range of applications for wastewater treatment processes these include the control of microbial induced sewer corrosion jiang et al 2013 and enhanced biogas wang et al 2013a and hydrogen wang et al 2018 production from waste activated sludge was since eps are a major component of the biofilm and sludge it is hypothesised that fna causes the biofilm sludge breakdown through disruption of eps molecules wang et al 2013a to understand the nature of this fna induced biofilm sludge disruption details of the effects of fna on eps need to be studies the detremination of structural and functional group changes in eps at the molecular and atomic levels will provide valuable insight and potentially lead to optimisation strategies for improvements in the destruction of was and detachment of sewer biofilms the scope of the present study was to understand the chemical structural changes in representative eps molecules following fna treatment the mechanisms for the destruction of large complex eps substances to smaller more readily biodegradable molecules were also investigated the effect of varying the fna concentration on the extent of molecule breakdown was also considered and this would be relevant to optimisation of biofilm sludge treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 eps materials eps materials can be categorised into protein polysaccharides lipids and humic substances all presenting a vital effect on microbial adhesive and aggregation processes zeng et al 2016 a number of characteristic eps materials were chosen for the fna treatment experiments to represent the key eps fractions of wastewater biofilms including was we labelled these eps molecules table 1 with detailed structures provided in the supporting information si figures s1 s4 all of the representative molecules were purchased from sigma aldrich carbohydrates represent the largest fraction of eps in wastewater biofilms and have a huge diversity in molecular structure compared to the lipid fraction for example holden 2004 therefore two molecules humic acid and calcium alginate with very different molecular structures and bondings were chosen to represent the carbohydrate fraction table 1 figure s1 and s2 humic acid was chosen to represent the humic substances in eps materials humic acid is a heterogenous molecule found in soil and wastewater miao and tao 2007 the molecule we have chosen was previously shown to be relevant to microbial aggregates figure s1 flemming and wingener 2010 alginate previously shown to be an abundant polysaccharide eps in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms boyd and chakrabarty 1995 was also selected for this study glyceryl tristearate was chosen as a model triglyceride lipid it is often located in the cellular membrane and helps to maintain the structure of bacterial cell membranes by forming a lipid bilayer pollard et al 2017 l tryptophan a building block for proteins was chosen as a model molecule for proteins a protein building block is an amino acid residue which is an organic molecule consisting of a central carbon atom linked to an amino group a carboxyl group a hydrogen atom and a variable component called a side chain a protein building block was chosen to represent the protein fraction of eps due to the complexity of the three dimensional protein structures including secondary tertiary and quaternary folding this study focusses on molecular bonding and structural changes in two dimensional organic macromolecules 2 2 fna treatment of eps molecules the fna treatment experiments were conducted through batch tests to assess the impact on the molecular structure and possible breakdown of the eps molecules two 60 ml solutions of 250 mgno2 n per l nitrite stock were prepared one stock solution was prepared in deuterated water sigma aldrich an appropriate solvent for proton 1h nmr analysis the second stock solution was prepared in deionised water a suitable solvent for esi ms analysis the ph of the two solutions was adjusted to ph 5 0 0 2 with aliquots of 1m hcl solution in order to achieve an fna concentration of 6 09 mgn l calculated using the formula s n o 2 n k a 10 p h ka value determined as a function of temperature t c 25 c in this study with the formula k a e 2300 273 t earlier studies on anaerobic digestion of fna treated was shows that this fna concentration is optimal in increasing volatile solids destruction and methane yield zhang et al 2019 5 ml of the deuterated 6 09 mgn l fna solution was added to 0 05g of each eps molecule for nmr analysis then 5 ml of the deionised 6 09 mgn l fna solution was added to 0 05g of each eps molecule for esi ms and gpc ananlysis independently these volumes gave rise to 1 w v solutions for both deionised and deuterated fna treated eps solutions a 1 w v solution is an optimal concentration for structural analysis for 1h nmr esi ms techniques and gpc techniques baldwin and benz 2002 pieri et al 2011 the tests were carried out in triplicate each fna treatment period lasted 24 hr selected based on prior application studies zhang et al 2019 during which ph was adjusted to 5 0 the ph was monitored but not controlled and found to stay at 5 0 0 2 a sequence of control tests were carried out simultaneously with treatment conditions provided in table 2 proton 1h nmr spectroscopy was used to analyse all of the control samples prepared in deuterated water control i denotes the eps molecules without any treatment or ph control ph was observed to be around 6 8 7 2 i e original ph of the molecules in solution control ii with 250 mgno2 n l added to the sample without ph control ph was observed to be around 6 6 7 0 aimed to study potential molecular changes initiated by the nitrite no2 similarly control iii with the sample ph adjusted to 5 0 through the addition of aliquots of 1m hcl without nitrite addition served to examine potential eps molecule structural changes caused by acid h the ph was monitored but not controlled and stayed at 5 0 0 2 all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 experiments to investigate effect of fna concentration on eps breakdown a series of batch experiments were then carried out to investigate the impact of altered fna concentration on the molecular structural changes in the eps molecules two fna concentrations 3 04 125 mg no2 n l 5 0 0 2 and 9 73 mgn l 400 mg no2 n l ph 5 0 0 2 were used the tests were conducted in the same way as in the case of fna 6 09 mgn l each test was conducted in triplicate and lasted 24 hr 2 4 esi ms molecular structural analysis of treated eps molecules after the 24 hr treatment the fna treated eps samples were filtered 0 45µm pore size to obtain the soluble eps fractions 1 5 ml of the deionised filtrate was then transferred to centrifuge tubes for esi ms and flow injection analysis 2 ml of the deionised filtrated was transferred to glass vials for gpc analysis section 2 6 and 2 ml of the deuterated water filtrate was then transferred to aldrich 5mm thrift nmr spectroscopy tubes for nmr analysis section 2 5 eps samples dissolved in deionized water were analysed using an automated continuous infusion hplc ms workflow on a shimadzu nexera uhplc japan coupled to a triple tof 5600 mass spectrometer absciex canada equipped with a duo electrospray ion source samples were analysed in both positive and negative ion detection modes initially 5ul of each sample was injected into a mobile phase of 50 50 v v acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid aq at a 50ul minute flow rate to acquire accurate molecular mass information the ionspray voltage was set to 5300v for positive ion and 4500v for negative ion detection declustering potential dp 100v curtain gas flow 25 nebuliser gas 1 gs1 25 interface heater at 150 c for the molecular mass determination tofms spectra were acquired from m z 80 to m z 2000 for 500ms scan the data was acquired and processed using analyst tf 1 6 software sciex canada 2 5 proton 1h nmr molecular structural analysis of treated eps molecules eps samples dissolved in deuterated water were analysed by proton 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr using a bruker advance hd 700 mhz nuclear magnetic spectrometer a sweep width of 13 ppm centred on the water at 4 7 ppm the residual water was supressed using an excitation sculpting pulse sequence zgesgp a three second recycle time was used and 250 transients collected 2 6 gpc analyses of molecular weight distribution of treated eps molecules eps samples dissolved in deionised water were analysed with agilent aqueous gel permeation chromatography 1260 infinity system connected with a refractive index ri detector for data acquisition the system was equipped with agilent gpc sec software for operation and data analysis two agilent aqua gel pl aquagel oh mixed m 8 µm columns were kept at 40 c with milli q water as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 during the analysis 3 results 3 1 humic acid molecular structural changes following fna treatment the humic acid 1h nmr spectra shows that broad peaks in the untreated spectrum top line fig 1 a were replaced by sharper peaks in the treated spectrum bottom line fig 1a this is a clear indication of molecular breakdown broad peaks in an 1h nmr spectrum typically indicate large molecules which have a poor magnetic spin in contrast smaller molecules have a more efficient magnetic spin and therefore produce sharper peaks foster et al 2007 the 1h nmr chemical shifts corresponding to functional groups are provided in table s1 the large broad peak betweem 7 8 5 ppm in the untreated humic acid spectrum indicates a large number of aromatic proton environments in a high molecular weight molecule table s1 the decrease in the area under this peak on the fna treatment spectrum signifies that the aromatic protons are likely a part of a smaller molecule with an improved magnetic spin fig 1a however the peak is still broadened suggesting complete molecular breakdown did not occur the broad peak between 5 5 5 ppm on the untreated spectrum also greatly reduces in intensity following fna treatment fig 1a this is likely due to cleavage of the amide peptide bond linking the humic acid molecules together since amide groups absorb in this region table s1 the largest difference between the untreated and fna treated humic acid spectra can be seen in the 3 4 ppm region which represents ch groups with oxygen atoms attached hc o table s1 there is a reduction in the number of hc o peaks in the fna treated spectrum fig 1a this could be due to cleavage of the ester bond linking the sugar residue to the molecule cleavage of this bond would produce a symmetrical sugar molecule and therefore decrease the number of different hc o environments thus producing less peaks the literature identifies that ester bonds can be cleaved during acid catalysed hydrolysis cohen and schneider 1941 the reduction in the number of hc o peaks could also be due to cleavage of the ether and ester linkages throughout the molecule the literature suggests that under acidic conditions ether bonds can be broken bruce and prasad 2008 cleavage of these oxygen linkages would substantially decrease the size of the molecule and further explain the reduction in the breadth of peaks throughout the fna treated spectrum overall the two control spectra show greater peak similarities to the untreated spectrum than the fna treated spectrum indicating that it is hno2 causing the most substantial extent of molecular breakdown and not the acid h or nitrite no2 counterparts independently fig 1a there are slight similarities in the region of 3 4 ppm between the nitrite and the fna treated spectra including a reduction in the number of peaks present however small changes in molecular structure in the presence of nitrite are expected since at 250 mg no2 n ph 7 0 the concentration of fna is approximately 0 06 mgn l which could account for the small molecular changes fig 1a the esi ms spectrum displays the masses and the corresponding structures of the proposed breakdown products following fna treatment of humic acid fig 1b the x axis on the spectrum represents the mass to charge ration m z of the molecules while the y axis represents the intensity i e the relative abundance of the product breakdown products were defined as peaks on the fna treated spectrum fig 1b that weren t present on the control spectrum figure s5 the peaks that were possible to assign a molecular structure to have been marked fig 1b it is possible to identify which bonds have been cleaved in the eps molecules by comparing the structure of the untreated molecule with the structure of the breakdown products fig 1b c and figure s1 for example the breakdown molecule with a mass to charge ratio m z of 90 1 shown on the humic acid ms spectrum was bonded via an intermolecular and intramolecular peptide bond fig 1b and s1 these two bonds have been cleaved during fna exposure to produce a smaller breakdown product with an m z 90 1 fig 1b the remaining fragmented molecules throughout fig 1b and c have been produced through the cleavage of ether and ester bonds within the eps molecules for example the symmetrical humic acid breakdown product with an m z 195 has been produced through the cleavage of both an ester and an ether bond within the humic acid molecule fig 1b 3 2 calcium alginate molecular structural changes following fna treatment the untreated 1h nmr calcium alginate spectrum shows a broad peak in the region of 1 2 ppm whereas the fna treated spectrum shows numerous sharper peaks in this region fig 2 a the broad peak between 1 2 ppm in the untreated spectrum likely represents a hydrogen group neighbouring a carboxyl group in a large molecule while the sharper peaks in this region of the fna treated spectrum likely represent a hydrogen environment neighbouring a carboxyl group in smaller molecules with a more effective molecular spin table s1 a reduction in the size of the calcium alginate molecules following fna treatment is indicative of molecular breakdown by fna there are also a number of new peaks in the region of 2 2 5 ppm in the fna treated spectrum that aren t present on the untreated spectrum fig 2a these peaks represent new hydrogen environments in the hc o or no2 electron withdrawing region hc n electron donating region table s1 these peaks can be attributed to no forming part of the reaction products following fna treatment of calcium alginate in fig 2a the two control spectra are similar to the untreated spectrum however there are a few similarities between the acid control and the fna treated spectra in the region of 2 3 2 5 ppm these similarities most likely highlight the sensitivity of alginate to acidic exposure the nmr method is not a quantitative method therefore it is difficult to draw conclusions on the significance of the peak differences however the change is indicating further molecular changes following addition of fna the esi ms spectrum in fig 2b shows the masses of the proposed calcium alginate breakdown products following fna treatment as these peaks were not present in the control spectrum figure s6 the molecular weight of calcium alginate polymers is between 32 000 and 400 000 g mol four monomers have been formed from the reaction between calcium alginate and fna with an m z between 195 8 and 235 this reveals significant molecular breakdown when comparing the structure of the calcium alginate polymer and the breakdown monomers it is possible that the ether bond connecting multiple calcium alginate molecules has been broken by fna resulting in the molecular breakdown fig 2b figure s2 there are two monomers formed in the reaction between calcium alginate and fna with an m z 209 and m z 256 fig 2b the mass to charge ratio of these monomers indicates that nitration and nitrolsylation have occured as a result of the fna reaction this is shown by the difference between the mass to charge of the monomers for example the difference between m z 209 and m z 196 which is equal the m z of an no group m z 30 the presence of new nitrogen groups in the fna treated products is also supported by the h1 nmr spectra in fig 2a 3 3 l tryptophan molecular structural changes following fna treatment the l tryptophan 1h nmr spectrum in fig 3 a has been cropped to highlight the most relevant part of the spectrum and the full spectrum is provided in the supplementary material figure s10 the fna treated 1h nmr spectrum for l tryptophan shows a number of new peaks in the region of 2 4 3 ppm that aren t present on the untreated l tryptophan spectrum fig 3a these peaks represent new hydrogen environments absorbing in the hc n electron donating region following fna treatment table s1 these peaks can thus be attributed to no forming part of the reaction products following fna treatment of l tryptophan there are also new peaks in the fna treated spectrum at around 4 2 ppm when compared to the untreated spectrum fig 3a this signifies hydrogen environments absorbing in the no2 electron withdrawing region therefore reactive nitrogen species no2 are likely forming part of the fna breakdown products the two control spectra show greater peak similarities to the untreated spectrum than the fna treated spectrum for example there are new peaks on the fna treated spectrum at 4 2 ppm and between 2 4 3 ppm that are not present on the control spectra therefore it is hno2 causing the molecular changes in l tryptophan and not the acid h and nitrite no2 counterparts individually fig 3a however there is one peak present in both of the control and the fna treated spectra at around 4 7 ppm that is not present in the untreated spectrum this peak is due to the absorbance of hydrogens in water which may be present due to the humidity of the atmosphere the esi ms spectrum in fig 3b shows the mass to charge ratio of the l tryptophan breakdown products following fna treatment see figure s7 for the control spectrum and figure s9 for the expanded fna treated esi ms spectrum the molecular mass of l tryptophan is 204 23 g mol a number of smaller products have been formed from the reaction between tryptophan and fna with an m z between 86 and 234 therefore fna has led to the breakdown of l tryptophan fig 3b the esi ms spectrum also demonstrates that nitration of aromatic rings and other functional groups has occurred this is seen by the addition of an no2 m z 46 or an no m z 30 species to a number of the fragments in the spectra for example fig 3b shows a breakdown product with an m z 118 there is also a breakdown product with an m z 163 this is the difference of an no2 group m z 46 attached to an aromatic ring fig 3b also shows a breakdown product with a mass of 205 and one with an m z of 235 this is the difference of no m z 30 the h1 nmr spectra also indicates that nitrogen species are forming part of the products through nitration addition of no2 and nitrosylation addition of no 3 4 glyceryl tristearate molecular structural changes following fna treatment the untreated glyceryl tristearate 1h nmr spectrum has a large broad peak in the 1 5 2 ppm region representing the large polymer with electron withdrawing hc o groups fig 4 a this broad peak is not present on the fna treated spectrum indicating that the large molecule with a poor magnetic spin is no longer present and that molecular breakdown has occurred following fna treatment fig 4a there are a number of new sharp peaks present in the fna treated spectrum in the region of 2 2 2 8 ppm that aren t present on the control or untreated spectra fig 4a peaks in this region represent hc n electron withdrawing groups therefore nitration is likely occurring following fna treatment table s1 there are fewer new peaks on the control spectra compared to the fna treated spectrum indicating that hno2 has caused the molecular changes and not the acid h or nitrite no2 counterparts individually fig 4a the esi ms spectrum fig 4b illustrates the masses of the breakdown products of glyceryl tristearate following fna treatment see figure s8 for the control spectrum the molecular weight of glyceryl tristearate is 891 48 g mol and the m z of the breakdown products ranges from m z 251 477 therefore fna has caused molecular breakdown fig 4b glyceryl tristearate is a triglyceride derived from three units of stearic acid there is a fragment producing a peak of m z 313 which represents a nitrated form of stearic acid following fna treatment fig 4b 3 5 the effect of varying the concentration of fna on eps molecular structure the 1h nmr concentration spectra display that molecular breakdown was dependent on the concentration of fna fig 5 this is particularly the case for humic acid a large complex molecule where the molecular breakdown is more prevalent at higher concentrations of fna greater than 3 04 mg n l fna fig 5a at 3 04 mgn l fna the spectrum looks similar to the untreated humic acid spectrum there is a number of broad peaks indicating the presence of large molecules with a poor molecular spin however at 3 04 mgn l fna there is no peak absorbing in the 5 5 5 ppm region where peptide bonds absorb table s1 this implies that the peptide bonds were cleaved at the lower concentration of fna it was seen that there were no substantial differences between the 6 09 mgn l and 9 73 mgn l fna spectra for humic acid fig 5a alginate l tryptophan and glyceryl tristearate are smaller less complex molecules in comparison to humic acid fig 5b c and d for alginate the same extent of molecular changes was seen at the lower and higher fna treatment concentrations fig 5b in the case of l tryptophan the concentration spectra look very similar therefore the molecular changes by fna observed at 6 09 mgn l and 9 73 mgn l fna can occur at 3 4 mgn l fna in both alginate and l tryptophan in the case of glyceryl tristearate there is a broad peak absorbing between 1 5 2 ppm in both the untreated and 3 4 mgn l fna fig 5d this broad peak signifies the presence of large molecules with a poor magnetic spin and is not present on the 6 09 mgn l and 9 73 mgn l fna spectra thererfore glyceryl tristearate is not broken down as effectively at the lower concentration of fna 3 04 mgn l fna 3 6 eps molecular weight distribution following fna treatment the molecular weight distributions of the eps molecules with and without fna treatment are shown in table 3 fna at 6 09 mg n l caused a decrease in mw for all eps molecules substantial peak shift were observed in peaks 1 and 2 for all molecules while peak 3 and peak 4 observed in the control samples for humic acid and calcium alginate disappeared in the fna treated samples these results confirm the molecular breakdown and structural changes observed in fig 1 4 discussion 4 1 reaction pathways the fna decomposition reactions are listed below eq 1 3 due to the unstable nature of fna in solution it decomposes in acidic reducing conditions to produce reactive nitrogen species rns including nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no eq 2 rns are characterised as free radicals due to the presence of the lone electron on the nitrogen atom this makes them highly chemically reactive nitric acid hno3 in eq 3 is formed as a result of the no2 radical in eq 2 undergoing hydrolysis via rnis including dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 1 hn o 2 h no 2 2 2 hn o 2 no n o 2 h 2 o 3 3 hn o 2 hn o 3 h 2 o 2 no ahulwalia and dhingra 2005 these oxidative by products in eq 1 3 can participate in unwanted side reactions with a range of molecules and can have damaging effects to molecular structures such as reacting with sulfhydryl groups consequently inactivating proteins or by inducing oxidative damage to lipids or dna jiang et al 2011b the nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no rns have been found to cause protein deamination consequently leading to molecular breakdown tannenbaum 2004 in addition to protein nitration and nitrosylation thus adjusting protein structure stability and biological activity hnizdova et al 2009 the no2 radical in particular has previously been found to break down ester bonds in lipids leading to a nitrated biproduct and a reduction in the size of the molecule freeman et al 2008 both the h1 nmr and esi ms spectra give evidence of eps molecular breakdown by fna fig 1 4 the control experiments ruled out molecular breakdown caused by the acid h or nitrite no2 equivalents independently fig 1a 4a when the fna treatment concentration was varied it was clear that molecular breakdown was achievable at the lower concentration of 3 04 mgn l fna for the majority of the molecules fig 5 humic acid was an exception to this the 3 04 mgn l spectrum looked more similar to the untreated spectrum than to the higher concentration spectra 6 09 and 9 73 mgn l fna fig 5a this is likely due to the complexity of the molecular structure and the binding strength associated with the vast aromatic regions within the molecule figure s1 molecular breakdown was observed in the esi ms spectra of the fna treated samples fig 1b 4b the fna treated spectra showed a number of peaks that weren t visible on the untreated spectra fig s5 s8 indicating the presence of molecular breakdown products fig 1b 4b in a lot of cases it was possible to assign a molecular structure to the breakdown products fig 1b 4b the untreated molecular structures figure s1 s4 could then be compared to the resulting fragmented breakdown products displayed on the fna treated esi ms spectra fig 1b 4b in order to see which bonds were targeted and broken by fna and it s oxidative deratives thus providing insight into the breakdown reaction mechanisms figure s11 s20 table 3 provided quantitative evidence for the substantial decrease in mw shift in peaks of the molecules in the fna treated eps samples compared to the control samples the spectral data acquired in this study indicate that the fna eps reactions are acid catalysed and can progress via two general pathways it is hypothesised that these pathways consist of electrophilic substitution whereby the nitrosonium ion no is the reactive electrophile or via oxidative reactions involving nitrogen radicals no2 no and rnis for example n2o3 and n2o4 formed from the decomposition of fna proposed mechanisms for the reactions of fna with components of the eps molecules are stipulated in the si figures s11 s20 the functional groups targeted and consequently broken down by fna were determined by the types of bonding present in the eps molecules the bonds targetd by fna included ether ester and amide bonds these bonds all provide structural intra and inter molecular linkages eqn s1 s5 cleavage of these structural linkages particularly for humic acid that had a large number of these bonds resulted in a substantial reduction in the size of the molecules and contributed largely to the eps molecule breakdown this work studied the effects of fna on carbohydrates lipids and a protein building block l tryptophan previous work has found that fna can target amide bonds in large folded protein structures through deaminative depolymerisation hnizdova et al 2009 it is therefore possible to propose that carbohydrates lipids and protein structures collectively are vulnerable to the effects of fna as determined by the functional groups and bonding present in the molecules 4 2 implications to wastewater treatment waste activated sludge was is produced during wastewater treatment it is made up of sludge flocs which are a form of suspended biofilm encompassing cells and eps and it is costly to treat for disposal recently fna has been used to treat both sludge and biofilm in wastewater applications in particular fna has been applied to anaerobic digestion pretreatement and has been found to be effective in increasing the degradability of was thus improving methane yield and sludge reduction wang et al 2014a wang et al 2013a zahedi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 previous studies have also accomplished a loss and slow recovery of biofilms using fna treatment this has been of particular interest for control of sewer biofilms that cause expensive damage to concrete infrastructure jiang and yuan 2013 wang et al 2013a previous studies have postulated that the chemical breakdown of eps molecules by fna could explain the disintegration of sludge flocs and biofilm however there was an absence of direct evidence to support the interaction between fna and eps molecules this research has revealed for the first time that fna leads to the chemical breakdown of eps molecules at a macromolecular level since eps contributes to around 90 of the organic matter in biofilm structures the disintegration of eps molecules should have an important role in the detachment and fragmentation of biofilms in sewers correspondingly sludge flocs are comprised of eps molecules in a suspended aggregate thus the improved degradability of activated sludge following fna treatment can also be explained at least somewhat by the chemical breakdown of eps molecules to smaller more biodegradable fragments the conversion of large eps molecules in sludge flocs to smaller degradable fragments through the breakdown of integral structural bonds involved in eps network formation also justifies the 16 35 increase in methane yield observed in the anaerobic digestion of fna pre treated was meng et al 2020 this study also revealed that more eps molecules can be broken down at higher fna concentrations 6 09 mgn l which explains that fna pre treatment of sludge at 6 1 mgn l increased in biogas production by 35 zhang et al 2019 whereas only 16 increased was obtained at an fna concentration of 1 8 mgn l wei et al 2017 in summary the outcomes accomplished in this study expand our understanding of why fna pretreatment could increase both sludge biodegradability and biofilm detachment additionally the results from this work can be used to direct optimisation of anaerobic digestion processes and biofilm management in sewer networks 5 conclusions the potential chemical reactions between fna and model carbohydrate lipid and protein molecules in eps of biological aggregates biofilms and sludge floc were investigated the following conclusions are drawn 1 fna reacts with organic molecules considered to be representative of eps molecules it is fna hno2 causing the molecular breakdown and not the acid h or nitrite no2 independently 2 fna targets eps inter and intramolecular structural bonds such as ethers esters and peptide bonds these bonds play an integral role in the molecules structural and conformational integrity 3 it is hypothesised that electrophilic substitution and oxidative reactions involving rns radicals are the key pathways involved in the chemical reactions between fna and eps molecules the electrophilc substitution reaction involves the fna breakdown product and reactive electrophile no displacing a functional group in a molecule whereas the oxidative radical reactions involve the addition of a radical species for example no2 no formed from the decomposition of fna to an electron rich part of the molecule 4 different molecules are broken down at different fna concentrations humic substances and glyceryl tristearate are large complex molecules with a variety of inter and intramolecular structural bonds these moelcules can not be broken down at an fna concnetration of 3 04 mgn l relatively simple molecules such as alginate and l tryptophan can be effectively broken down at the lower concentration of fna 3 04 mgn l fna however all molecules tested could be broken down at an fna concentration of 6 09 mgn l and increasing fna concentration from 6 09 mgn l to 9 37 mgn l did not further enhance the breadown of any of the molecules studied consequently an fna concentration around 6 0 mgn l is recommended for wastewater applications declaration of competing interest the authors

17455,previous studies demonstrate that free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 detaches sewer biofilms breaks down flocs of waste activated sludge was and enhances biogas production from was this suggests possible interactions of fna with organic extracellular polymeric substances eps that bind the cells into biofilms or sludge flocs this study evaluates the chemical interactions and reaction mechanisms between fna and molecules representative of key eps in biofilm and sludge flocs molecules chosen to represent components found in the extracellular polymeric matrix were treated with fna at 6 09 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 0 0 2 t 22 c for 24 hours conditions typically used in applications so as to consider the hypothesized chemical interactions and the consequent reaction pathways a number of analytical techniques were employed to measure the molecular changes in the eps molecules including proton 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry esi ms and gel permeation chromatography gpc the results demonstrated that fna broke down a range of large eps molecules including carbohydrates protein and lipids to smaller molecules two mechanistic pathways have been proposed including electrophilic substitution whereby the nitrosium ion no was the reactive electrophile and oxidative radical reactions through which the nitrogen radicals no2 no and reactive nitrogen intermediates rnis e g n2o3 and n2o4 formed from the decomposition of fna became part of the reaction products larger more complex organic molecules such as humic acid required higher concentrations of fna 6 09 mgn l or greater to cause molecular breakdown whereas smaller molecules such as calcium alginate was broken down at lower concentrations 3 04 mgn l the study

significant impact in both natural systems e g global biogeochemical cycles and engineered systems such as in wastewater treatment kim 2011 in these systems biofilms can have essential and beneficial roles however there are many instances where biofilms cause huge problems for example biofouling of clinical devices corrosion of expensive infrastructure such as concrete sewers jiang et al 2015a and increased roughness of ship hulls leading to greatly increased transport costs ciriminna et al 2015 therefore there are situations where control of biofilms either to enhance or eliminate them is highly important in the context of this paper biofilms include floccular structures such as those in activated sludge systems for wastewater treatment formed by microorganisms without a substratum extracellular polymeric substances eps are high molecular weight polymers secreted by microorganisms and are an essential element of the biofilm matrix evans 2000 eps are highly hydrated and mostly consist of polysaccharides and proteins but also include other macro molecules such as dna lipids and humic substances eps constitute 50 90 of biofilm s total organic matter donlan 2002 donlan and costerton 2002 and play essential roles in the biofilm state that include formation of the biofilm structure adhesion of cells and water retention flemming and wingener 2010 consequently for control of biofilms it is very important to understand and be able to manipulate the relevant eps molecules eps components including cell surface structures can be targeted as control points for manipulation of biofilms there are many strategies currently applied for biofilm control for example chlorine dioxide disinfection and enzyme based detergents simoes et al 2010 however these can have various limitations such as high costs associated with large chemical dosage and the production of harmful chlorinated disinfection biproducts improved approaches are therefore highly sought hasan et al 2013 recently free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite hno2 has emerged as a potentially sustainable and economic antimicrobial agent jiang et al 2011b fna is seen to have broad biocidal effects on an array of microorganisms which has led to its potential use in a range of applications for wastewater treatment processes these include the control of microbial induced sewer corrosion jiang et al 2013 and enhanced biogas wang et al 2013a and hydrogen wang et al 2018 production from waste activated sludge was since eps are a major component of the biofilm and sludge it is hypothesised that fna causes the biofilm sludge breakdown through disruption of eps molecules wang et al 2013a to understand the nature of this fna induced biofilm sludge disruption details of the effects of fna on eps need to be studies the detremination of structural and functional group changes in eps at the molecular and atomic levels will provide valuable insight and potentially lead to optimisation strategies for improvements in the destruction of was and detachment of sewer biofilms the scope of the present study was to understand the chemical structural changes in representative eps molecules following fna treatment the mechanisms for the destruction of large complex eps substances to smaller more readily biodegradable molecules were also investigated the effect of varying the fna concentration on the extent of molecule breakdown was also considered and this would be relevant to optimisation of biofilm sludge treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 eps materials eps materials can be categorised into protein polysaccharides lipids and humic substances all presenting a vital effect on microbial adhesive and aggregation processes zeng et al 2016 a number of characteristic eps materials were chosen for the fna treatment experiments to represent the key eps fractions of wastewater biofilms including was we labelled these eps molecules table 1 with detailed structures provided in the supporting information si figures s1 s4 all of the representative molecules were purchased from sigma aldrich carbohydrates represent the largest fraction of eps in wastewater biofilms and have a huge diversity in molecular structure compared to the lipid fraction for example holden 2004 therefore two molecules humic acid and calcium alginate with very different molecular structures and bondings were chosen to represent the carbohydrate fraction table 1 figure s1 and s2 humic acid was chosen to represent the humic substances in eps materials humic acid is a heterogenous molecule found in soil and wastewater miao and tao 2007 the molecule we have chosen was previously shown to be relevant to microbial aggregates figure s1 flemming and wingener 2010 alginate previously shown to be an abundant polysaccharide eps in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms boyd and chakrabarty 1995 was also selected for this study glyceryl tristearate was chosen as a model triglyceride lipid it is often located in the cellular membrane and helps to maintain the structure of bacterial cell membranes by forming a lipid bilayer pollard et al 2017 l tryptophan a building block for proteins was chosen as a model molecule for proteins a protein building block is an amino acid residue which is an organic molecule consisting of a central carbon atom linked to an amino group a carboxyl group a hydrogen atom and a variable component called a side chain a protein building block was chosen to represent the protein fraction of eps due to the complexity of the three dimensional protein structures including secondary tertiary and quaternary folding this study focusses on molecular bonding and structural changes in two dimensional organic macromolecules 2 2 fna treatment of eps molecules the fna treatment experiments were conducted through batch tests to assess the impact on the molecular structure and possible breakdown of the eps molecules two 60 ml solutions of 250 mgno2 n per l nitrite stock were prepared one stock solution was prepared in deuterated water sigma aldrich an appropriate solvent for proton 1h nmr analysis the second stock solution was prepared in deionised water a suitable solvent for esi ms analysis the ph of the two solutions was adjusted to ph 5 0 0 2 with aliquots of 1m hcl solution in order to achieve an fna concentration of 6 09 mgn l calculated using the formula s n o 2 n k a 10 p h ka value determined as a function of temperature t c 25 c in this study with the formula k a e 2300 273 t earlier studies on anaerobic digestion of fna treated was shows that this fna concentration is optimal in increasing volatile solids destruction and methane yield zhang et al 2019 5 ml of the deuterated 6 09 mgn l fna solution was added to 0 05g of each eps molecule for nmr analysis then 5 ml of the deionised 6 09 mgn l fna solution was added to 0 05g of each eps molecule for esi ms and gpc ananlysis independently these volumes gave rise to 1 w v solutions for both deionised and deuterated fna treated eps solutions a 1 w v solution is an optimal concentration for structural analysis for 1h nmr esi ms techniques and gpc techniques baldwin and benz 2002 pieri et al 2011 the tests were carried out in triplicate each fna treatment period lasted 24 hr selected based on prior application studies zhang et al 2019 during which ph was adjusted to 5 0 the ph was monitored but not controlled and found to stay at 5 0 0 2 a sequence of control tests were carried out simultaneously with treatment conditions provided in table 2 proton 1h nmr spectroscopy was used to analyse all of the control samples prepared in deuterated water control i denotes the eps molecules without any treatment or ph control ph was observed to be around 6 8 7 2 i e original ph of the molecules in solution control ii with 250 mgno2 n l added to the sample without ph control ph was observed to be around 6 6 7 0 aimed to study potential molecular changes initiated by the nitrite no2 similarly control iii with the sample ph adjusted to 5 0 through the addition of aliquots of 1m hcl without nitrite addition served to examine potential eps molecule structural changes caused by acid h the ph was monitored but not controlled and stayed at 5 0 0 2 all experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 3 experiments to investigate effect of fna concentration on eps breakdown a series of batch experiments were then carried out to investigate the impact of altered fna concentration on the molecular structural changes in the eps molecules two fna concentrations 3 04 125 mg no2 n l 5 0 0 2 and 9 73 mgn l 400 mg no2 n l ph 5 0 0 2 were used the tests were conducted in the same way as in the case of fna 6 09 mgn l each test was conducted in triplicate and lasted 24 hr 2 4 esi ms molecular structural analysis of treated eps molecules after the 24 hr treatment the fna treated eps samples were filtered 0 45µm pore size to obtain the soluble eps fractions 1 5 ml of the deionised filtrate was then transferred to centrifuge tubes for esi ms and flow injection analysis 2 ml of the deionised filtrated was transferred to glass vials for gpc analysis section 2 6 and 2 ml of the deuterated water filtrate was then transferred to aldrich 5mm thrift nmr spectroscopy tubes for nmr analysis section 2 5 eps samples dissolved in deionized water were analysed using an automated continuous infusion hplc ms workflow on a shimadzu nexera uhplc japan coupled to a triple tof 5600 mass spectrometer absciex canada equipped with a

acid aq at a 50ul minute flow rate to acquire accurate molecular mass information the ionspray voltage was set to 5300v for positive ion and 4500v for negative ion detection declustering potential dp 100v curtain gas flow 25 nebuliser gas 1 gs1 25 interface heater at 150 c for the molecular mass determination tofms spectra were acquired from m z 80 to m z 2000 for 500ms scan the data was acquired and processed using analyst tf 1 6 software sciex canada 2 5 proton 1h nmr molecular structural analysis of treated eps molecules eps samples dissolved in deuterated water were analysed by proton 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr using a bruker advance hd 700 mhz nuclear magnetic spectrometer a sweep width of 13 ppm centred on the water at 4 7 ppm the residual water was supressed using an excitation sculpting pulse sequence zgesgp a three second recycle time was used and 250 transients collected 2 6 gpc analyses of molecular weight distribution of treated eps molecules eps samples dissolved in deionised water were analysed with agilent aqueous gel permeation chromatography 1260 infinity system connected with a refractive index ri detector for data acquisition the system was equipped with agilent gpc sec software for operation and data analysis two agilent aqua gel pl aquagel oh mixed m 8 µm columns were kept at 40 c with milli q water as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 during the analysis 3 results 3 1 humic acid molecular structural changes following fna treatment the humic acid 1h nmr spectra shows that broad peaks in the untreated spectrum top line fig 1 a were replaced by sharper peaks in the treated spectrum bottom line fig 1a this is a clear indication of molecular breakdown broad peaks in an 1h nmr spectrum typically indicate large molecules which have a poor magnetic spin in contrast smaller molecules have a more efficient magnetic spin and therefore produce sharper peaks foster et al 2007 the 1h nmr chemical shifts corresponding to functional groups are provided in table s1 the large broad peak betweem 7 8 5 ppm in the untreated humic acid spectrum indicates a large number of aromatic proton environments in a high molecular weight molecule table s1 the decrease in the area under this peak on the fna treatment spectrum signifies that the aromatic protons are likely a part of a smaller molecule with an improved magnetic spin fig 1a however the peak is still broadened suggesting complete molecular breakdown did not occur the broad peak between 5 5 5 ppm on the untreated spectrum also greatly reduces in intensity following fna treatment fig 1a this is likely due to cleavage of the amide peptide bond linking the humic acid molecules together since amide groups absorb in this region table s1 the largest difference between the untreated and fna treated humic acid spectra can be seen in the 3 4 ppm region which represents ch groups with oxygen atoms attached hc o table s1 there is a reduction in the number of hc o peaks in the fna treated spectrum fig 1a this could be due to cleavage of the ester bond linking the sugar residue to the molecule cleavage of this bond would produce a symmetrical sugar molecule and therefore decrease the number of different hc o environments thus producing less peaks the literature identifies that ester bonds can be cleaved during acid catalysed hydrolysis cohen and schneider 1941 the reduction in the number of hc o peaks could also be due to cleavage of the ether and ester linkages throughout the molecule the literature suggests that under acidic conditions ether bonds can be broken bruce and prasad 2008 cleavage of these oxygen linkages would substantially decrease the size of the molecule and further explain the reduction in the breadth of peaks throughout the fna treated spectrum overall the two control spectra show greater peak similarities to the untreated spectrum than the fna treated spectrum indicating that it is hno2 causing the most substantial extent of molecular breakdown and not the acid h or nitrite no2 counterparts independently fig 1a there are slight similarities in the region of 3 4 ppm between the nitrite and the fna treated spectra including a reduction in the number of peaks present however small changes in molecular structure in the presence of nitrite are expected since at 250 mg no2 n ph 7 0 the concentration of fna is approximately 0 06 mgn l which could account for the small molecular changes fig 1a the esi ms spectrum displays the masses and the corresponding structures of the proposed breakdown products following fna treatment of humic acid fig 1b the x axis on the spectrum represents the mass to charge ration m z of the molecules while the y axis represents the intensity i e the relative abundance of the product breakdown products were defined as peaks on the fna treated spectrum fig 1b that weren t present on the control spectrum figure s5 the peaks that were possible to assign a molecular structure to have been marked fig 1b it is possible to identify which bonds have been cleaved in the eps molecules by comparing the structure of the untreated molecule with the structure of the breakdown products fig 1b c and figure s1 for example the breakdown molecule with a mass to charge ratio m z of 90 1 shown on the humic acid ms spectrum was bonded via an intermolecular and intramolecular peptide bond fig 1b and s1 these two bonds have been cleaved during fna exposure to produce a smaller breakdown product with an m z 90 1 fig 1b the remaining fragmented molecules throughout fig 1b and c have been produced through the cleavage of ether and ester bonds within the eps molecules for example the symmetrical humic acid breakdown product with an m z 195 has been produced through the cleavage of both an ester and an ether bond within the humic acid molecule fig 1b 3 2 calcium alginate molecular structural changes following fna treatment the untreated 1h nmr calcium alginate spectrum shows a broad peak in the region of 1 2 ppm whereas the fna treated spectrum shows numerous sharper peaks in this region fig 2 a the broad peak between 1 2 ppm in the untreated spectrum likely represents a hydrogen group neighbouring a carboxyl group in a large molecule while the sharper peaks in this region of the fna treated spectrum likely represent a hydrogen environment neighbouring a carboxyl group in smaller molecules with a more effective molecular spin table s1 a reduction in the size of the calcium alginate molecules following fna treatment is indicative of molecular breakdown by fna there are also a number of new peaks in the region of 2 2 5 ppm in the fna treated spectrum that aren t present on the untreated spectrum fig 2a these peaks represent new hydrogen environments in the hc o or no2 electron withdrawing region hc n electron donating region table s1 these peaks can be attributed to no forming part of the reaction products following fna treatment of calcium alginate in fig 2a the two control spectra are similar to the untreated spectrum however there are a few similarities between the acid control and the fna treated spectra in the region of 2 3 2 5 ppm these similarities most likely highlight the sensitivity of alginate to acidic exposure the nmr method is not a quantitative method therefore it is difficult to draw conclusions on the significance of the peak differences however the change is indicating further molecular changes following addition of fna the esi ms spectrum in fig 2b shows the masses of the proposed calcium alginate breakdown products following fna treatment as these peaks were not present in the control spectrum figure s6 the molecular weight of calcium alginate polymers is between 32 000 and 400 000 g mol four monomers have been formed from the reaction between calcium alginate and fna with an m z between 195 8 and 235 this reveals significant molecular breakdown when comparing the structure of the calcium alginate polymer and the breakdown monomers it is possible that the ether bond connecting multiple calcium alginate molecules has been broken by fna resulting in the molecular breakdown fig 2b figure s2 there are two monomers formed in the reaction between calcium alginate and fna with an m z 209 and m z 256 fig 2b the mass to charge ratio of these monomers indicates that nitration and nitrolsylation have occured as a result of the fna reaction this is shown by the difference between the mass to charge of the monomers for example the difference between m z 209 and m z 196 which is equal the m z of an no group m z 30 the presence of new nitrogen groups in the fna treated products is also supported by the h1 nmr spectra in fig 2a 3 3 l tryptophan molecular structural changes following fna treatment the l tryptophan 1h nmr spectrum in fig 3 a has been cropped to highlight the most relevant part of the spectrum and the full spectrum is provided in the supplementary material figure s10 the fna treated 1h nmr spectrum for l tryptophan shows a number of new peaks in the region of 2 4 3 ppm that aren t present on the untreated l tryptophan spectrum fig 3a these peaks represent new hydrogen environments absorbing in the hc n electron donating region following fna treatment table s1 these peaks can thus be attributed to no forming part of the reaction products following fna treatment of l tryptophan there are also new peaks in the fna treated spectrum at around 4 2 ppm when compared to the untreated spectrum fig 3a this signifies hydrogen environments absorbing in the no2 electron withdrawing region therefore reactive nitrogen species no2 are likely forming part of the fna breakdown products the two control spectra show greater peak similarities to the untreated spectrum than the fna treated spectrum for example there are new peaks on the fna treated spectrum at 4 2 ppm and between 2 4 3 ppm that are not present on the control spectra therefore it is hno2 causing the molecular changes in l tryptophan and not the acid h and nitrite no2 counterparts individually fig 3a however there is one peak present in both of the control and the fna treated spectra at around 4 7 ppm that is not present in the untreated spectrum this peak is due to the absorbance of hydrogens in water which may be present due to the humidity of the atmosphere the esi ms spectrum in fig 3b shows the mass to charge ratio of the l tryptophan breakdown products following fna treatment see figure s7 for the control spectrum and figure s9 for the expanded fna treated esi ms spectrum the molecular mass of l tryptophan is 204 23 g mol a number of smaller products have been formed from the reaction between tryptophan and fna with an m z between 86 and 234 therefore fna has led to the breakdown of l tryptophan fig 3b the esi ms spectrum also demonstrates that nitration of aromatic rings and other functional groups has occurred this is seen by the addition of an no2 m z 46 or an no m z 30 species to a number of the fragments in the spectra for example fig 3b shows a breakdown product with an m z 118 there is also a breakdown product with an m z 163 this is the difference of an no2 group m z 46 attached to an aromatic ring fig 3b also shows a breakdown product with a mass of 205 and one with an m z of 235 this is the difference of no m z 30 the h1 nmr spectra also indicates that nitrogen species are forming part of the products through nitration addition of no2 and nitrosylation addition of no 3 4 glyceryl tristearate molecular structural changes following fna treatment the untreated glyceryl tristearate 1h nmr spectrum has a large broad peak in the 1 5 2 ppm region representing the large polymer with electron withdrawing hc o groups fig 4 a this broad peak is not present on the fna treated spectrum indicating that the large molecule with a poor magnetic spin is no longer present and that molecular breakdown has occurred following fna treatment fig 4a there are a number of new sharp peaks present in the fna treated spectrum in the region of 2 2 2 8 ppm that aren t present on the control or untreated spectra fig 4a peaks in this region represent hc n electron withdrawing groups therefore nitration is likely occurring following fna treatment table s1 there are fewer new peaks on the control spectra compared to the fna treated spectrum indicating that hno2 has caused the molecular changes and not the acid h or nitrite no2 counterparts individually fig 4a the esi ms spectrum fig 4b illustrates the masses of the breakdown products of glyceryl tristearate following fna treatment see figure s8 for the control spectrum the molecular weight of glyceryl tristearate is 891 48 g mol and the m z of the breakdown products ranges from m z 251 477 therefore fna has caused molecular breakdown fig 4b glyceryl tristearate is a triglyceride derived from three units of stearic acid there is a fragment producing a peak of m z 313 which represents a nitrated form of stearic acid following fna treatment fig 4b 3 5 the effect of varying the concentration of fna on eps molecular structure the 1h nmr concentration spectra display that molecular breakdown was dependent on the concentration of fna fig 5 this is particularly the case for humic acid a large complex molecule where the molecular breakdown is more prevalent at higher concentrations of fna greater than 3 04 mg n l fna fig 5a at 3 04 mgn l fna the spectrum looks similar to the untreated humic acid spectrum there is a number of broad peaks indicating the presence of large molecules with a poor molecular spin however at 3 04 mgn l fna there is no peak absorbing in the 5 5 5 ppm region where peptide bonds absorb table s1 this implies that the peptide bonds were cleaved at the lower concentration of fna it was seen that there were no substantial differences between the 6 09 mgn l and 9 73 mgn l fna spectra for humic acid fig 5a alginate l tryptophan and glyceryl tristearate are smaller less complex molecules in comparison to humic acid fig 5b c and d for alginate the same extent of molecular changes was seen at the lower and higher fna treatment concentrations fig 5b in the case of l tryptophan the concentration spectra look very similar therefore the molecular changes by fna observed at 6 09 mgn l and 9 73 mgn l fna can occur at 3 4 mgn l fna in both alginate and l tryptophan in the case of glyceryl tristearate there is a broad peak absorbing between 1 5 2 ppm in both the untreated and 3 4 mgn l fna fig 5d this broad peak signifies the presence of large molecules with a poor magnetic spin and is not present on the 6 09 mgn l and 9 73 mgn l fna spectra thererfore glyceryl tristearate is not broken down as effectively at the lower concentration of fna 3 04 mgn l fna 3 6 eps molecular weight distribution following fna treatment the molecular weight distributions of the eps molecules with and without fna treatment are shown in table 3 fna at 6 09 mg n l caused a decrease in mw for all eps molecules substantial peak shift were observed in peaks 1 and 2 for all molecules while peak 3 and peak 4 observed in the control samples for humic acid and calcium alginate disappeared in the fna treated samples these results confirm the molecular breakdown and structural changes observed in fig 1 4 discussion 4 1 reaction pathways the fna decomposition reactions are listed below eq 1 3 due to the unstable nature of fna in solution it decomposes in acidic reducing conditions to produce reactive nitrogen species rns including nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no eq 2 rns are characterised as free radicals due to the presence of the lone electron on the nitrogen atom this makes them highly chemically reactive nitric acid hno3 in eq 3 is formed as a result of the no2 radical in eq 2 undergoing hydrolysis via rnis including dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 1 hn o 2 h no 2 2 2 hn o 2 no n o 2 h 2 o 3 3 hn o 2 hn o 3 h 2 o 2 no ahulwalia and dhingra 2005 these oxidative by products in eq 1 3 can participate in unwanted side reactions with a range of molecules and can have damaging effects to molecular structures such as reacting with sulfhydryl groups consequently inactivating proteins or by inducing oxidative damage to lipids or dna jiang et al 2011b the nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no rns have been found to cause protein deamination consequently leading to molecular breakdown tannenbaum 2004 in addition to protein nitration and nitrosylation thus adjusting protein structure stability and biological activity hnizdova et al 2009 the no2 radical in particular has previously been found to break down ester bonds in lipids leading to a nitrated biproduct and a reduction in the size of the molecule freeman et al 2008 both the h1 nmr and esi ms spectra give evidence of eps molecular breakdown by fna fig 1 4 the control experiments ruled out molecular breakdown caused by the acid h or nitrite no2 equivalents independently fig 1a 4a when the fna treatment concentration was varied it was clear that molecular breakdown was achievable at the lower concentration of 3 04 mgn l fna for the majority of the molecules fig 5 humic acid was an exception to this the 3 04 mgn l spectrum looked more similar to the untreated spectrum than to the higher concentration spectra 6 09 and 9 73 mgn l fna fig 5a this is likely due to the complexity of the molecular structure and the binding strength associated with the vast aromatic regions within the molecule figure s1 molecular breakdown was observed in the esi ms spectra of the fna treated samples fig 1b 4b the fna treated spectra showed a number of peaks that weren t visible on the untreated spectra fig s5 s8 indicating the presence of molecular breakdown products fig 1b 4b in a lot of cases it was possible to assign a molecular structure to the breakdown products fig 1b 4b the untreated molecular structures figure s1 s4 could then be compared to the resulting fragmented breakdown products displayed on the fna treated esi ms spectra fig 1b 4b in order to see which bonds were targeted and broken by fna and it s oxidative deratives thus providing insight into the breakdown reaction mechanisms figure s11 s20 table 3 provided quantitative evidence for the substantial decrease in mw shift in peaks of the molecules in the fna treated eps samples compared to the control samples the spectral data acquired in this study indicate that the fna eps reactions are acid catalysed and can progress via two general pathways it is hypothesised that these pathways consist of electrophilic substitution whereby the nitrosonium ion no is the reactive electrophile or via oxidative reactions involving nitrogen radicals no2 no and rnis for example n2o3 and n2o4 formed from the decomposition of fna proposed mechanisms for the reactions of fna with components of the eps molecules are stipulated in the si figures s11 s20 the functional groups targeted and consequently broken down by fna were determined by the types of bonding present in the eps molecules the bonds targetd by fna included ether ester and amide bonds these bonds all provide structural intra and inter molecular linkages eqn s1 s5 cleavage of these structural linkages particularly for humic acid that had a large number of these bonds resulted in a substantial reduction in the size of the molecules and contributed largely to the eps molecule breakdown this work studied the effects of fna on carbohydrates lipids and a protein building block l tryptophan previous work has found that fna can target amide bonds in large folded protein structures through deaminative depolymerisation hnizdova et al 2009 it is therefore possible to propose that carbohydrates lipids and protein structures collectively are vulnerable to the effects of fna as determined by the functional groups and bonding present in the molecules 4 2 implications to wastewater treatment waste activated sludge was is produced during wastewater treatment it is made up of sludge flocs which are a form of suspended biofilm encompassing cells and eps and it is costly to treat for disposal recently fna has been used to treat both sludge and biofilm in wastewater applications in particular fna has been applied to anaerobic digestion pretreatement and has been found to be effective in increasing the degradability of was thus improving methane yield and sludge reduction wang et al 2014a wang et al 2013a zahedi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 previous studies have also accomplished a loss and slow recovery of biofilms using fna treatment this has been of particular interest for control of sewer biofilms that cause expensive damage to concrete infrastructure jiang and yuan 2013 wang et al 2013a previous studies have postulated that the chemical breakdown of eps molecules by fna could explain the disintegration of sludge flocs and biofilm however there was an absence of direct evidence to support the interaction between fna and eps molecules this research has revealed for the first time that fna leads to the chemical breakdown of eps molecules at a macromolecular level since eps contributes to around 90 of the organic matter in biofilm structures the disintegration of eps molecules should have an important role in the detachment and fragmentation of biofilms in sewers correspondingly sludge flocs are comprised of eps molecules in a suspended aggregate thus the improved degradability of activated sludge following fna treatment can also be explained at least somewhat by the chemical breakdown of eps molecules to smaller more biodegradable fragments the conversion of large eps molecules in sludge flocs to smaller degradable fragments through the breakdown of integral structural bonds involved in eps network formation also justifies the 16 35 increase in methane yield observed in the anaerobic digestion of fna pre treated was meng et al 2020 this study also revealed that more eps molecules can be broken down at higher fna concentrations 6 09 mgn l which explains that fna pre treatment of sludge at 6 1 mgn l increased in biogas production by 35 zhang et al 2019 whereas only 16 increased was obtained at an fna concentration of 1 8 mgn l wei et al 2017 in summary the outcomes accomplished in this study expand our understanding of why fna pretreatment could increase both sludge biodegradability and biofilm detachment additionally the results from this work can be used to direct optimisation of anaerobic digestion processes and biofilm management in sewer networks 5 conclusions the potential chemical reactions between fna and model carbohydrate lipid and protein molecules in eps of biological aggregates biofilms and sludge floc were investigated the following conclusions are drawn 1 fna reacts with organic molecules considered to be representative of eps molecules it is fna hno2 causing the molecular breakdown and not the acid h or nitrite no2 independently 2 fna targets eps inter and intramolecular structural bonds such as ethers esters and peptide bonds these bonds play an integral role in the molecules structural and conformational integrity 3 it is hypothesised that electrophilic substitution and oxidative reactions involving rns radicals are the key pathways involved in the chemical reactions between fna and eps molecules the electrophilc substitution reaction involves the fna breakdown product and reactive electrophile no displacing a functional group in a molecule whereas the oxidative radical reactions involve the addition of a radical species for example no2 no formed from the decomposition of fna to an electron rich part of the molecule 4 different molecules are broken down at different fna concentrations humic substances and glyceryl tristearate are large complex molecules with a variety of inter and intramolecular structural bonds these moelcules can not be broken down at an fna concnetration of 3 04 mgn l relatively simple molecules such as alginate and l tryptophan can be effectively broken down at the lower concentration of fna 3 04 mgn l fna however all molecules tested could be broken down at an fna concentration of 6 09 mgn l and increasing fna concentration from 6 09 mgn l to 9 37 mgn l did not further enhance the breadown of any of the molecules studied consequently an fna concentration around 6 0 mgn l is recommended for wastewater applications declaration of competing interest the authors

17456,it would be highly beneficial to use the methane produced by anaerobic digestion which is low cost and accessible as the carbon source in the removal of nitrogenous contaminants in wastewater however there is a knowledge gap regarding coupling systems that entail methane oxidation nitrification and denitrification which restricts their industrial application in this study we acclimated a mixed culture to deal with simultaneous nitrification denitrification coupled to methane oxidation in a laboratory scale hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor which achieved a steady ammonia removal rate of 38 09 mg n l d furthermore a series of batch experiments were conducted to test methane oxidation coupled to nitrate denitrification ame d3 nitrite denitrification ame d2 and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd the molar ratio between methane consumed and nitrate reduced c n equals 10 and 5 mol ch4 c mol 1 no3 n in ame d3 and ame d2 averagely and respectively without methane injection the removal of nitrates and nitrites was very low indicating that the coupling of nitrate nitrite denitrification and methane oxidation was beneficial the average ammonia removal rates in the 20 o2 and 25 o2 groups were 20 06 and 22 03 mg n l d in the me snd system respectively without methane the ammonia oxidation rate declined and large amounts of nitrite accumulated as traditional ammonia and nitrite oxidation approaches are autotrophic we proposed the possibility of heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hn ad to study the coupling systems the

chemical oxygen demand tin total inorganic nitrogen tn total nitrogen 1 introduction after anaerobic fermentation landfill leachate and poultry wastewater often entail severe conditions and along with

and sugar the utilization of methane won t increase cod in the effluent in the last century some researchers found that aerobic methanotrophs could oxidize methane into co2 and water and generate a series of soluble intermediate metabolites such as methanol and formaldehyde linton and buckee 1977 rhee and fuhs 1978 later confirmed that denitrifying bacteria could use products oxidized from methane as substrates for denitrification in a process referred to as methane oxidation coupled to denitrification ame d furthermore as ammonia is the main nitrogen pollutant in anaerobic digesters some researchers have studied methane oxidation coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd directly using ammonia as the nitrogen contaminant first waki et al 2002 studied the effect of ammonia on ame d and reported that ammonia could promote denitrification at a temperature higher than 10 c ammonia had no negative effect on methane oxidation therefore waki et al 2009 conducted assays using nitrate and ammonia as a mix of nitrogen respective concentration of 400 mg n l when methane and oxygen existed simultaneously ammonia oxidation and anammox accounted for 34 5 and 6 4 of nitrification respectively ame d and anammox accounted for 53 4 and 8 7 of denitrification respectively as some bacteria facilitate heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad under aerobic conditions robertson and kuenen 1990 jin et al 2019 the me snd process becomes more attractive as organics produced by methane oxidation could provide hn ad bacteria carbon sources therefore ammonia can be removed by combining autotrophic ammonia oxidation and ame d or by the cooperation of methane oxidation and hn ad additionally owing to the close evolutionary relations between the amoa and pmoa genes that encode key enzymes for ammonia and methane oxidation the methanotrophs and ammonia oxidizing bacteria could partially oxidize one another s substrates knowles 2005 rosenzweig 2018 previous studies have improved our knowledge of this coupling system however which process would be mainly conducted under certain conditions and what were the main microorganisms were still unclear therefore we constructed a coupling system in a laboratory scale hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor in which methanotrophs mainly accumulated in the hollow fiber membrane and ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrifiers were acclimated in the suspension we then conducted batch experiments to assess the methane oxidation ammonia oxidation and denitrification and their coupling potentials combined with the illumina high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna and functional genes including pmoa aob amoa and nirs nitrite reductase the limited step in denitrification genes the functional microorganisms and coupling pathways were revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge culture a laboratory scale hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor hfmbr was used to culture the

the medium was recirculated in the hfmbr for several days when the concentration of ammonia nitrogen was less than 100 mg l additional nh4 2so4 was added to maintain the ammonia nitrogen concentration at the initial level the hfmbr was operated for over three months before the batch experiments began to establish a stable microbial community 2 2 batch experiments three main assays were conducted to determine the potential of methane ammonia oxidation and nitrate nitrite denitrification 1 methane oxidation coupled to nitrate denitrification ame d3 2 methane oxidation coupled to nitrite denitrification ame d2 and 3 methane oxidation coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd additionally three control assays were conducted to test whether methane was utilized as the main carbon source 1 nitrate denitrification without methane supply 2 nitrite denitrification without methane supply and 3 ammonia removal without methane supply in each batch experiment 100 ml of a medium containing the same mineral salts as those in the culture medium was added to a serum bottle and inoculated with seed sludge from the hfmbr the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and the air in the bottle headspaces was evacuated and purged with different levels of n2 o2 ch4 proportion shown in table 1 over three times to exchange the air additionally 200 ml of mixed gas with the same proportion was purged into the serum bottle in order to maintain positive pressure o2 levels of 5 and 20 were reported to be suitable for microaerobic and aerobic ame d costa et al 2000 waki et al 2009 modin et al 2007 therefore 5 and 20 o2 were injected into the microaerobic and aerobic groups respectively two other groups were injected with 10 and 25 o2 for the modification of oxygen tension the operational parameters of each batch experiment are presented in table 1 each group was replicated twice and all groups were cultured in an incubator at 160 rpm and 30 1 c each batch

coupled to nitrate denitrification ame d3 fig 2 a and b present the consumption of substrates and generation of products in the processes that used methane as a carbon source for nitrate denitrification methane and oxygen consumptions were shown in fig s1 a all treatment groups supplemented with methane and oxygen exhibited stable methane and oxygen consumption with 20 and 25 o2 having average ch4 consumption rates of 2 14 and 2 52 mmol d respectively the o2 ch4 consumption ratios in all groups were not significantly different 1 48 1 43 1 52 and 1 35 as the oxygen content increased p 0 975 suggesting that the same methane oxidation process likely occurred and that higher oxygen tension resulted in a higher methane oxidation rate nitrate removal exhibited two different trends 1 in the 100 n2 5 and 10 o2 groups the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 70 mg l on the first day and then increased to the initial concentration the decline in the nitrate content even without methane and oxygen in the 100 n2 group suggested that the microbial community could use endogenous carbon to conduct a limited level of anaerobic denitrification the increase in the nitrate content may be due to the oxidation of ammonia as shown in fig 2 b the residual ammonia decreased in all oxygen treated groups indicating that without sufficient oxygen to oxidize the methane the denitrification rate was lower than the ammonia oxidation rate 2 in the groups with 20 and 25 o2 the nitrate content decreased continuously with average consumption rates of 25 03 and 29 07 mg n l d respectively meanwhile the residual ammonia was almost fully eliminated in all groups nitrite did not accumulate fig 2 b and n2o was almost undetectable the c n ratios methane oxidation nitrogen consumption ratios amended with residual ammonia and nitrite were 10 00 20 o2 and 9 99 25 o2 respectively compared to the control groups supplemented with no methane fig 2 a the nitrate concentration of all groups only slightly declined the results demonstrate that nitrate removal was stimulated by methane the 25 o2 group without methane exhibited the smallest nitrate decline while the 100 n2 group exhibited the highest decline this indicates that all groups could utilize endogenous carbon sources to conduct limited denitrification either anaerobically or aerobically furthermore the anaerobic denitrification activity was higher than aerobic denitrification later in the groups with oxygen the nitrate level returned to its original value which might be due to the oxidation of residual ammonia ame d3 has been widely studied and the cooperation of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers to denitrify nitrate using organic intermediates produced by aerobic methane oxidation is the main coupling mechanism considered modin et al 2007 operated a membrane biofilm reactor with o2 ch4 ratios ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 and obtained a total inorganic nitrogen tin nitrate plus nitrite removal rate of 4 20 to 7 98 mg n l d sun et al 2013b achieved a maximum total nitrogen tn removal rate of approximately 83 at an o2 ch4 ratio of approximately 1 5 the theoretical o2 ch4 ratio in nitrate dependent methane oxidation is 1 02 modin et al 2007 however as observed here the o2 ch4 ratio always exceeds 1 02 which is also supported by other studies sun et al 2013a thalasso 1997 the remaining oxygen may have been used for the aerobic respiration of other microorganisms including aerobic denitrifiers thus the results reveal that methane oxidation was coupled to anaerobic aerobic denitrification and the highest nitrate removal was achieved under 25 oxygen 3 1 2 potential of methane oxidation coupled to nitrite denitrification ame d2 the methane and oxygen consumption in ame d2 are presented in fig s1 b and they followed the same trends observed in ame d3 the methane and oxygen consumption rates in the 20 o2 group were higher than those in the 25 o2 group during the first two days and then those of the 25 o2 group were higher after three days the average o2 ch4 ratios in the 5 10 20 and 25 o2 groups were 1 16 1 32 1 24 and 1 33 respectively which were all lower than those in ame d3 meanwhile the methane consumption rates in the 20 and 25 o2 groups were 1 47 and 1 44 mmol d respectively the average nitrite removal rates of all treatment groups presented in fig 3 a were 6 78 12 33 18 57 27 52 and 19 06 mg n l d as the oxygen content increased without the supply of methane and oxygen the microorganisms could use endogenous carbon to denitrify nitrite at a rate of approximately 6 78 mg n l d as observed in the 100 n2 group the nitrite denitrification capability was strongly improved by the presence of methane and oxygen in the control groups without methane injection fig 3 a nitrite accumulated in all oxygen supply groups due to the oxidation of residual ammonia suggesting that methane also stimulated the removal of nitrite as shown in figs 3 b the residual nitrate and ammonia contents declined in all groups supplied with methane the c n ratios methane oxidation nitrogen consumption ratios amended with residual ammonia and nitrate were 4 93 20 o2 and 6 39 mol ch4 c mol 1 no3 n 25 o2 the accumulation of n2o was highest in the 20 o2 group and n2o was barely detected in the 100 n2 group the chemical interactions in ame d3 and ame d2 could be described by the following theoretical equations which only consider the organic matter used for denitrification modin et al 2007 ahn 2006 1 c h 4 o 2 2 h 2 e c h 3 oh h 2 o 2 no 3 1 08 c h 3 oh 0 24 h 2 c o 3 0 056 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 47 n 2 1 68 h 2 o hco 3 3 no 2 0 53 c h 3 oh 0 67 h 2 c o 3 0 04 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 48 n 2 1 23 h 2 o hco 3 according to the equations it is proposed that the same amount of nitrogen was removed in ame d2 as in ame d3 with fewer carbon sources indicating that the demand for methane oxidation was lower the lower c n ratios obtained in ame d2 agreed with the theoretical equations nevertheless all c n ratios exceeded the theoretical ratios which may be because the carbon intermediates also supported the metabolism of other microorganisms modin et al 2007 thalasso 1997 additionally we found that the c n ratio in ame d2 was lower than that in ame d3 the molar ratio of which equals 10 and 5 mol ch4 c mol 1 no3 n in ame d3 and ame d2 averagely and respectively these results suggest that denitrification beginning with nitrite could use methane and oxygen more efficiently n2o was undetectable in ame d3 but highly accumulated in ame d2 thus the functional microorganisms for nitrite and nitrate denitrification may have differed which is further discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 3 1 3 potential of methane oxidation coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd the methane and oxygen consumption in me snd are presented in fig s1 c and the ammonia consumption and nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide generation in the me snd process are presented in fig 4 a c after the lag phase of the first day the consumption of methane and oxygen became relatively stable during the subsequent days the methane and oxygen consumption rates increased with the oxygen tension the average methane and oxygen consumption rates in the 20 and 25 o2 groups were 1 64 and 2 35 and 2 34 and 3 64 mmol d respectively the removal of ammonia greatly differed between the 100 n2 5 o2 and 10 o2 and 20 and 25 o2 groups the total amounts of ammonia removal in the 100 n2 5 o2 and 10 o2 groups were below 50 mg l while the average ammonia removal rates in the 20 o2 and 25 o2 groups were 20 06 and 22 03 mg n l d respectively in all treatment groups nitrite accumulated on the second day and was eliminated on the fourth day nitrate mostly accumulated on the third day and then returned to the initial concentration nitrous oxide was produced following the denitrification of nitrite and nitrate with most accumulating on the third day without the injection of methane the ammonia declined by approximately 50 mg l during cultivation and reached nitrite accumulation of approximately 90 mg l in all groups excluding the 100 n2 control group the level of residual nitrate decreased by approximately 30 mg l including that in the control group conventional nitrification typically occurs in two sequential oxidative steps under strict aerobic conditions i e ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate ahn 2006 conventional denitrification is generally conducted by heterotrophic denitrifiers under anaerobic conditions followed by the release of n2o and n2 and requires a large amount of organic carbon novel nitrification and denitrification processes in which bacteria can heterotrophically nitrify and aerobically denitrify matter have recently shown excellent potential jin et al 2019 wan et al 2017 heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad process can also generate nitrite nitrate and n2o as intermediates zhao et al 2017 in our systems ammonia methane and oxygen were consumed alongside the generation of nitrite nitrate and nitrous oxide this indicates the coexistence of aerobic methane oxidation conventional nitrification and denitrification or aerobic methane oxidation and hn ad the main difference between aob nob and hn ad bacteria is carbon metabolism in which aob nob are autotrophic bacteria and hn ad bacteria consume carbon matters to find out which kind of nitrification was the main nitrogen oxidation pathway in the system methane was not supplied in the control groups which demonstrated lower ammonia oxidation capacity and accumulation of nitrite as the oxygen was not exhausted the accumulation of nitrite was not caused by deficiency of oxygen which reported to be the main reason for inhibiting conventional nitrite oxidation bae et al 2001 sun et al 2017 the incomplete nitrification and inhibition of denitrification at the nitrite level were due to the insufficient carbon sources therefore the system was not likely driven by traditional autotrophic ammonia and nitrite oxidation but was more possible that ammonia was oxidized through hn ad by using endogenous carbon this could also inspire the nitrite accumulation through hn ad bacteria to form the sharon anammox system where the whole system is lacking organics moreover the residual nitrate was reduced to nitrite under aerobic conditions which supported aerobic denitrification when ch4 was present o2 was the main factor restraining ammonia removal when ch4 was not supplied ch4 was the limiting factor of ammonia removal suggesting that ammonia removal in our system required both methane and oxygen 3 2 analysis of microbial communities and functional bacteria based on high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna and functional genes 3 2 1 microbial structures and functional bacteria in the ame d3 system according to the high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples treated under ame d3 the relative abundance of which exceeded 75 the microbial structures of ame d3 at the genus level are shown in fig 5 a methanotrophs identified as methylomonas belonging to the methylomonaceae family were predominant in the original sample with a relative abundance of 18 49 chryseobacterium belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family was the second most common species with a relative abundance of 11 88 additionally two methylotrophic bacteria of the methylophilaceae family methylophilus 11 42 and methylobacillus 11 60 exhibited high relative abundances the proportions of which significantly changed after 5 d of cultivation figure s2 in all groups the abundances of thermomonas increased while the abundances of methylomonas significantly declined fig s2 methylobacter was the most dominant bacteria in the 10 and 20 o2 groups with relative abundances of 21 67 and 55 81 respectively thermomonas methylobacillus hydrogenophaga simplicispira and pseudoxanthomonas were predominant in the 25 o2 group with relative abundances of 12 90 10 10 13 38 7 67 and 6 70 respectively to identify the original methanotrophic community of the ame d3 system the inocula were analyzed through the high throughput sequencing of the pmoa gene the taxonomy determined based on the ncbi refseq representative genome database is presented in the pie chart in fig 5 a the relative abundance of methylomonas was 98 35 methylocystis methylobacter and methylocaldum were also present in the methanotrophic community after cultivation the abundance of methylomonas decreased in all cultivation groups while that of methylobacter rose to 21 67 and 55 81 in the 10 and 20 o2 groups respectively in the 25 o2 group the abundances of methylobacter and methylomonas were 2 82 and 4 38 respectively kits et al 2015 revealed that under hypoxic conditions methylomonas could use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor to oxidize methane while reducing nitrate to n2o however when the oxygen tension increased the abundance of methylomonas declined methylobacter exhibited greater potential for methane oxidation particularly in the 20 o2 group methylobacter has been found to be an active methanotroph at high methane and oxygen concentrations hao et al 2020 methylomonas was more active and abundant under low oxygen conditions the analysis of denitrifiers through the high throughput sequencing of the nirs gene indicated that 155 of the bacteria in the ame d3 system could reduce nitrite into nitric oxide however most of the bacteria could not be identified using the ncbi blast algorithm with the refseq representative genome database which may have been due to the lack of functional gene sequencing in the database therefore we summarized previous studies on denitrification to identify potential denitrifiers in our system several studies have reported that nitrate denitrification by methylophilaceae mostly methylobacillus and methylophilus is linked to methane oxidation liu et al 2014 beck et al 2013 pseudomonas is a multi functional genus containing many species that have anaerobic or aerobic denitrification abilities gao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 su et al 2019 many strains of comamonas and acinetobacter are denitrifiers some of which conduct conventional anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification etchebehere et al 2002 some of which play a role in aerobic denitrification patureau et al 1997 su et al 2017 xia et al 2020 some hydrogenophaga thermomonas simplicispira and arenimonas species have also been shown to have denitrification ability siddiqi et al 2019 xing et al 2018 mergaert et al 2003 in conclusion nitrate dependent methane oxidation was more likely to have been conducted by the cooperation of methanotrophs mainly methylomonas methylobacter and denitrifiers pseudomonas comamonas and acinetobacter under aerobic conditions methylobacillus methylophilus hydrogenophaga thermomonas simplicispira and arenimonas under anaerobic conditions from the analysis of the microbial communities we could observe that methylobacter was the most abundant heterotrophic bacteria under 20 o2 while facultative heterotrophic denitrifiers were more abundant in the 25 o2 group this is also demonstrated in fig s3 the microbial community was more diverse under 25 o2 these results support our proposal in section 3 1 1 that the remaining oxygen was used for the aerobic respiration of other microorganisms 3 2 2 microbial structures and functional bacteria in the ame d2 system the original microbial community of the ame d2 system was dominated by firmicutes 37 23 proteobacteria 36 79 and bacteroidetes 14 71 and was gradually overwhelmed by proteobacteria after cultivation at the genus level fig 5 b bacillus accounted for 34 74 of the original sample but was very rare in all samples after cultivation the relative abundance of comamonas which was less than 4 in the original sample increased to 5 0 11 72 31 66 27 78 and 41 43 in the cultivated samples with increasing oxygen content the abundance of simplicispira increased in the 5 10 20 and 25 o2 groups with relative abundances of 32 15 21 88 16 55 and 14 44 respectively the other dominant bacteria in the 100 n2 culture were thermomonas 10 76 and methylobacillus 6 02 in the 5 o2 culture were methylobacillus 10 58 shinella 3 35 and rhodobacter 6 71 in the 10 o2 culture thermomonas 4 36 methylobacillus 6 50 and methylophilus 8 77 in the 20 o2 culture thermomonas 3 99 shinella 3 70 rhodobacter 3 40 and acinetobacter 4 1 and in the 25 o2 culture thermomonas 3 48 shinella 6 26 rhodobacter 3 02 and hyphomicrobium 3 41 the results of the high throughput sequencing of the pmoa gene in the original sample are presented in the pie chart in fig 5 b and they indicated that methylomicrobium methylobacter and methylocaldum were the dominant methanotrophs their proportion in the whole microbial community was small and declined as the oxygen tension rose this might be due to the low carbon demand in nitrite denitrification or inhibition of nitrite to methanotrophs through nirs sequence analysis 183 phylotypes with denitrification potential were identified and these were more complex than those in the ame d3 system most denitrifiers identified in section 3 2 1 could also reduce nitrites patureau et al 1997 kim et al 2008 as comamonas and simplicispira were predominant in all experimental groups they were assumed to be the main denitrifying bacteria in the system while comamonas was more accustomed to high oxygen atmospheres 3 2 3 microbial structures and functional bacteria in the me snd system proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were also predominant at the phylum level in all samples firmicutes exhibited a high relative abundance of 36 51 in the original sample but almost disappeared after cultivation fig 5 c shows that enterobacter solibacillus and bacillus were the dominant bacterial genera in the original sample and their abundances were limited after cultivation chrysobacterium and comamonas were the most abundant bacteria in the 5 10 15 and 20 o2 groups and they exhibited the highest potential in the 20 and 25 o2 groups with relative abundances of 28 65 and 17 82 and 17 18 and 32 02 respectively the accumulation of thermomonas was highest in the 10 o2 group with a relative abundance of 16 38 and it decreased in the 20 and 25 o2 groups the abundances of shinella and enterobacter which are heterotrophic nitrifiers were high in all groups supplied with oxygen particularly in the 25 o2 group with relative abundances of 11 55 and 8 95 respectively wan et al 2017 chen et al 2016 the pmoa gene analysis of the original me snd sample presenting in the pie chart in fig 5 c indicated that methylomonas 31 23 methylocaldum 28 27 methylobacter 14 33 methylocystis 9 95 and methylomicrobium 9 1 were initially abundant a similar result was presented in the ame d2 system with the methanotrophic expression of nitrosospira to characterize the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the aob amoa gene in the original sample was analyzed through high throughput sequencing representative ammonia oxidizing bacteria genera including nitrosospira 42 91 of the aob group and nitrosomonas 12 61 of the aob group were identified methylomicrobium 41 19 of aob group which are type i methanotrophs have high ammonia oxidizing ability kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 five methanotrophs were identified in the whole microbial community and methylobacter was the most abundant methanotroph especially in the 20 o2 group with a relative abundance of 10 40 methylomicrobium which are methanotrophs and ammonia oxidizers occupied 0 32 of the original sample and 1 61 of the 10 o2 group the other ammonia oxidizers such as nitrosospira and nitrosomonas accounted for less than 1 of the microbial population in all groups the abundances of typical autotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob such as nitrospira and nitrobacter were less than 0 1 in the system ahn 2006 however the potential hn ad bacteria were found in the me snd system with high abundances particularly chryseobacterium comamonas shinella and enterobacter in the presence of high oxygen tension which were positively correlated with oxygen methane and ammonia fig 5 d kim et al 2005 kundu et al 2014 therefore hn ad bacteria were the main nitrification denitrification functional bacteria in the system including chryseobacterium comamonas shinella and enterobacter the hn ad bacteria could also use the metabolites produced by methanotrophs as carbon sources 3 2 4 microbial similarities and differences among the three systems three size fractionated samples presenting different nitrogen treating groups were significantly separated from each other according to the principal co ordinates analysis pcoa in fig 6 a anosim r 0 8866 p 0 001 indicating that nitrogenous substrates influenced the microbial community structure the significantly differed genera among the three systems were presented in fig 6 b as the followings 1 methylomonas and methylobacter as type i methanotrophs and methylobacillus as methylotrophic denitrifiers were the most abundant bacteria in the ame d3 system methylomicrobium was the most abundant methanotroph in ame d2 methylobacter and chryseobacterium were the most abundant in me snd the relative abundances of comamonas in ame d2 and me snd were significantly higher than that in ame d3 p 0 0039 a relationship graph was then constructed to clarify the correlation between methane oxidation nitrification and denitrification along with the associated microorganisms fig 6 c in summary methane was mainly oxidized by methylobacter producing carbonaceous intermediates for nitrification and denitrification according to the variations in the microbial abundance anaerobic nitrate denitrification was more active than aerobic nitrate denitrification methylobacillus and methylophilus were the main denitrifiers in contrast aerobic nitrite denitrification may have been more active in ame d2 when ammonia was the nitrogen substrate hn ad bacteria exhibited high activity while comamonas was present in all systems and chryseobacterium conducting heterotrophic nitrification was only abundant in me snd 4 conclusions and perspectives based on the results of this study we confirmed the occurrence of aerobic and anaerobic nitrate nitrite denitrification using methane as the sole carbon source which involved the activities of methanotrophs mainly methylobacter and methylomonas anaerobic denitrifiers such as methylophilus methylobacillus and simlicispira and aerobic denitrifiers comamonas as the dominant bacteria in the me snd the ammonia removal was strongly promoted by methane while nitrite was largely accumulated without methane based on the microbial community analysis conventional aob and nob bacteria occupied only a very small proportion of the communities while chryseobacterium comamonas shinella and enterobacter were predominant we proposed the coupling of methane oxidation and hn ad in all systems methanotrophs methylobacter as the dominant bacteria oxidized methane into organic intermediates which supplied carbon the methane oxidation and nitrogen removal rates were also assessed with different oxygen supply levels and they were substantially high in the presence of 25 o2 in ame d3 and me snd and in the presence of 20 o2 in ame d2 ethical approval this article does

17456,it would be highly beneficial to use the methane produced by anaerobic digestion which is low cost and accessible as the carbon source in the removal of nitrogenous contaminants in wastewater however there is a knowledge gap regarding coupling systems that entail methane oxidation nitrification and denitrification which restricts their industrial application in this study we acclimated a mixed culture to deal with simultaneous nitrification denitrification coupled to methane oxidation in a laboratory scale hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor which achieved a steady ammonia removal rate of 38 09 mg n l d furthermore a series of batch experiments were conducted to test methane oxidation coupled to nitrate denitrification ame d3 nitrite denitrification ame d2 and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd the molar ratio between methane consumed and nitrate reduced c n equals 10 and 5 mol ch4 c mol 1 no3 n in ame d3 and ame d2 averagely and respectively without methane injection the removal of nitrates and nitrites was very low indicating that the coupling of nitrate nitrite denitrification and methane oxidation was beneficial the average ammonia removal rates in the 20 o2 and 25 o2 groups were 20 06 and 22 03 mg n l d in the me snd system respectively without methane the ammonia oxidation rate declined and large amounts of nitrite accumulated as traditional ammonia and nitrite oxidation approaches are autotrophic we proposed the possibility of heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hn ad to study the coupling systems the

and sugar the utilization of methane won t increase cod in the effluent in the last century some researchers found that aerobic methanotrophs could oxidize methane into co2 and water and generate a series of soluble intermediate metabolites such as methanol and formaldehyde linton and buckee 1977 rhee and fuhs 1978 later confirmed that denitrifying bacteria could use products oxidized from methane as substrates for denitrification in a process referred to as methane oxidation coupled to denitrification ame d furthermore as ammonia is the main nitrogen pollutant in anaerobic digesters some researchers have studied methane oxidation coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd directly using ammonia as the nitrogen contaminant first waki et al 2002 studied the effect of ammonia on ame d and reported that ammonia could promote denitrification at a temperature higher than 10 c ammonia had no negative effect on methane oxidation therefore waki et al 2009 conducted assays using nitrate and ammonia as a mix of nitrogen respective concentration of 400 mg n l when methane and oxygen existed simultaneously ammonia oxidation and anammox accounted for 34 5 and 6 4 of nitrification respectively ame d and anammox accounted for 53 4 and 8 7 of denitrification respectively as some bacteria facilitate heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad under aerobic conditions robertson and kuenen 1990 jin et al 2019 the me snd process becomes more attractive as organics produced by methane oxidation could provide hn ad bacteria carbon sources therefore ammonia can be removed by combining autotrophic ammonia oxidation and ame d or by the cooperation of methane oxidation and hn ad additionally owing to the close evolutionary relations between the amoa and pmoa genes that encode key enzymes for ammonia and methane oxidation the methanotrophs and ammonia oxidizing bacteria could partially oxidize one another s substrates knowles 2005 rosenzweig 2018 previous studies have improved our knowledge of this coupling system however which process would be mainly conducted under certain conditions and what were the main microorganisms were still unclear therefore we constructed a coupling system in a laboratory scale hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor in which methanotrophs mainly accumulated in the hollow fiber membrane and ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrifiers were acclimated in the suspension we then conducted batch experiments to assess the methane oxidation ammonia oxidation and denitrification and their coupling potentials combined with the illumina high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna and functional genes including pmoa aob amoa and nirs nitrite reductase the limited step in denitrification genes the functional microorganisms and coupling pathways were revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge culture a laboratory scale hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor hfmbr was used to culture the seed sludge which is illustrated in fig 1 the hfmbr consisted of four main parts 1 a column with an inner diameter of 30 cm 2 an immersed polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane module 3 an upflow gas distribution system equipped with a round gas distributor with an inner diameter of 25 cm and 4 a downflow liquid distribution system the total volume of the container was 30 l and the effective liquid volume was 20 l methane was continuously supplied through a hollow fiber membrane at a rate of 50 ml min the methane supply rate was regulated by a digital mass flow controller

the medium was recirculated in the hfmbr for several days when the concentration of ammonia nitrogen was less than 100 mg l additional nh4 2so4 was added to maintain the ammonia nitrogen concentration at the initial level the hfmbr was operated for over three months before the batch experiments began to establish a stable microbial community 2 2 batch experiments three main assays were conducted to determine the potential of methane ammonia oxidation and nitrate nitrite denitrification 1 methane oxidation coupled to nitrate denitrification ame d3 2 methane oxidation coupled to nitrite denitrification ame d2 and 3 methane oxidation coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd additionally three control assays were conducted to test whether methane was utilized as the main carbon source 1 nitrate denitrification without methane supply 2 nitrite denitrification without methane supply and 3 ammonia removal without methane supply in each batch experiment 100 ml of a medium containing the same mineral salts as those in the culture medium was added to a serum bottle and inoculated with seed sludge from the hfmbr the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and the air in the bottle headspaces was evacuated and purged with different levels of n2 o2 ch4 proportion shown in table 1 over three times to exchange the air additionally 200 ml of mixed gas with the same proportion was purged into the serum bottle in order to maintain positive pressure o2 levels of 5 and 20 were reported to be suitable for microaerobic and aerobic ame d costa et al 2000 waki et al 2009 modin et al 2007 therefore 5 and 20 o2 were injected into the microaerobic and aerobic groups respectively two other groups were injected with 10 and 25 o2 for the modification of oxygen tension the operational parameters of each batch experiment are presented in table 1 each group was replicated twice and all groups were cultured in an incubator at 160 rpm and 30 1 c each batch

by multiplying the concentration and liquid volume 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential methane oxidation and nitrogen transformation in the batch experiments 3 1 1 potential of methane oxidation coupled to nitrate denitrification ame d3 fig 2 a and b present the consumption of substrates and generation of products in the processes that used methane as a carbon source for nitrate denitrification methane and oxygen consumptions were shown in fig s1 a all treatment groups supplemented with methane and oxygen exhibited stable methane and oxygen consumption with 20 and 25 o2 having average ch4 consumption rates of 2 14 and 2 52 mmol d respectively the o2 ch4 consumption ratios in all groups were not significantly different 1 48 1 43 1 52 and 1 35 as the oxygen content increased p 0 975 suggesting that the same methane oxidation process likely occurred and that higher oxygen tension resulted in a higher methane oxidation rate nitrate removal exhibited two different trends 1 in the 100 n2 5 and 10 o2 groups the nitrate concentration decreased by approximately 70 mg l on the first day and then increased to the initial concentration the decline in the nitrate content even without methane and oxygen in the 100 n2 group suggested that the microbial community could use endogenous carbon to conduct a limited level of anaerobic denitrification the increase in the nitrate content may be due to the oxidation of ammonia as shown in fig 2 b the residual ammonia decreased in all oxygen treated groups indicating that without sufficient oxygen to oxidize the methane the denitrification rate was lower than the ammonia oxidation rate 2 in the groups with 20 and 25 o2 the nitrate content decreased continuously with average consumption rates of 25 03 and 29 07 mg n l d respectively meanwhile the residual ammonia was almost fully eliminated in all groups nitrite did not accumulate fig 2 b and n2o was almost undetectable the c n ratios methane oxidation nitrogen consumption ratios amended with residual ammonia and nitrite were 10 00 20 o2 and 9 99 25 o2 respectively compared to the control groups supplemented with no methane fig 2 a the nitrate concentration of all groups only slightly declined the results demonstrate that nitrate removal was stimulated by methane the 25 o2 group without methane exhibited the smallest nitrate decline while the 100 n2 group exhibited the highest decline this indicates that all groups could utilize endogenous carbon sources to conduct limited denitrification either anaerobically or aerobically furthermore the anaerobic denitrification activity was higher than aerobic denitrification later in the groups with oxygen the nitrate level returned to its original value which might be due to the oxidation of residual ammonia ame d3 has been widely studied and the cooperation of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers to denitrify nitrate using organic intermediates produced by aerobic methane oxidation is the main coupling mechanism considered modin et al 2007 operated a membrane biofilm reactor with o2 ch4 ratios ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 and obtained a total inorganic nitrogen tin nitrate plus nitrite removal rate of 4 20 to 7 98 mg n l d sun et al 2013b achieved a maximum total nitrogen tn removal rate of approximately 83 at an o2 ch4 ratio of approximately 1 5 the theoretical o2 ch4 ratio in nitrate dependent methane oxidation is 1 02 modin et al 2007 however as observed here the o2 ch4 ratio always exceeds 1 02 which is also supported by other studies sun et al 2013a thalasso 1997 the remaining oxygen may have been used for the aerobic respiration of other microorganisms including aerobic denitrifiers thus the results reveal that methane oxidation was coupled to anaerobic aerobic denitrification and the highest nitrate removal was achieved under 25 oxygen 3 1 2 potential of methane oxidation coupled to nitrite denitrification ame d2 the methane and oxygen consumption in ame d2 are presented in fig s1 b and they followed the same trends observed in ame d3 the methane and oxygen consumption rates in the 20 o2 group were higher than those in the 25 o2 group during the first two days and then those of the 25 o2 group were higher after three days the average o2 ch4 ratios in the 5 10 20 and 25 o2 groups were 1 16 1 32 1 24 and 1 33 respectively which were all lower than those in ame d3 meanwhile the methane consumption rates in the 20 and 25 o2 groups were 1 47 and 1 44 mmol d respectively the average nitrite removal rates of all treatment groups presented in fig 3 a were 6 78 12 33 18 57 27 52 and 19 06 mg n l d as the oxygen content increased without the supply of methane and oxygen the microorganisms could use endogenous carbon to denitrify nitrite at a rate of approximately 6 78 mg n l d as observed in the 100 n2 group the nitrite denitrification capability was strongly improved by the presence of methane and oxygen in the control groups without methane injection fig 3 a nitrite accumulated in all oxygen supply groups due to the oxidation of residual ammonia suggesting that methane also stimulated the removal of nitrite as shown in figs 3 b the residual nitrate and ammonia contents declined in all groups supplied with methane the c n ratios methane oxidation nitrogen consumption ratios amended with residual ammonia and nitrate were 4 93 20 o2 and 6 39 mol ch4 c mol 1 no3 n 25 o2 the accumulation of n2o was highest in the 20 o2 group and n2o was barely detected in the 100 n2 group the chemical interactions in ame d3 and ame d2 could be described by the following theoretical equations which only consider the organic matter used for denitrification modin et al 2007 ahn 2006 1 c h 4 o 2 2 h 2 e c h 3 oh h 2 o 2 no 3 1 08 c h 3 oh 0 24 h 2 c o 3 0 056 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 47 n 2 1 68 h 2 o hco 3 3 no 2 0 53 c h 3 oh 0 67 h 2 c o 3 0 04 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 0 48 n 2 1 23 h 2 o hco 3 according to the equations it is proposed that the same amount of nitrogen was removed in ame d2 as in ame d3 with fewer carbon sources indicating that the demand for methane oxidation was lower the lower c n ratios obtained in ame d2 agreed with the theoretical equations nevertheless all c n ratios exceeded the theoretical ratios which may be because the carbon intermediates also supported the metabolism of other microorganisms modin et al 2007 thalasso 1997 additionally we found that the c n ratio in ame d2 was lower than that in ame d3 the molar ratio of which equals 10 and 5 mol ch4 c mol 1 no3 n in ame d3 and ame d2 averagely and respectively these results suggest that denitrification beginning with nitrite could use methane and oxygen more efficiently n2o was undetectable in ame d3 but highly accumulated in ame d2 thus the functional microorganisms for nitrite and nitrate denitrification may have differed which is further discussed in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 3 1 3 potential of methane oxidation coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification me snd the methane and oxygen consumption in me snd are presented in fig s1 c and the ammonia consumption and nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide generation in the me snd process are presented in fig 4 a c after the lag phase of the first day the consumption of methane and oxygen became relatively stable during the subsequent days the methane and oxygen consumption rates increased with the oxygen tension the average methane and oxygen consumption rates in the 20 and 25 o2 groups were 1 64 and 2 35 and 2 34 and 3 64 mmol d respectively the removal of ammonia greatly differed between the 100 n2 5 o2 and 10 o2 and 20 and 25 o2 groups the total amounts of ammonia removal in the 100 n2 5 o2 and 10 o2 groups were below 50 mg l while the average ammonia removal rates in the 20 o2 and 25 o2 groups were 20 06 and 22 03 mg n l d respectively in all treatment groups nitrite accumulated on the second day and was eliminated on the fourth day nitrate mostly accumulated on the third day and then returned to the initial concentration nitrous oxide was produced following the denitrification of nitrite and nitrate with most accumulating on the third day without the injection of methane the ammonia declined by approximately 50 mg l during cultivation and reached nitrite accumulation of approximately 90 mg l in all groups excluding the 100 n2 control group the level of residual nitrate decreased by approximately 30 mg l including that in the control group conventional nitrification typically occurs in two sequential oxidative steps under strict aerobic conditions i e ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate ahn 2006 conventional denitrification is generally conducted by heterotrophic denitrifiers under anaerobic conditions followed by the release of n2o and n2 and requires a large amount of organic carbon novel nitrification and denitrification processes in which bacteria can heterotrophically nitrify and aerobically denitrify matter have recently shown excellent potential jin et al 2019 wan et al 2017 heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification hn ad process can also generate nitrite nitrate and n2o as intermediates zhao et al 2017 in our systems ammonia methane and oxygen were consumed alongside the generation of nitrite nitrate and nitrous oxide this indicates the coexistence of aerobic methane oxidation conventional nitrification and denitrification or aerobic methane oxidation and hn ad the main difference between aob nob and hn ad bacteria is carbon metabolism in which aob nob are autotrophic bacteria and hn ad bacteria consume carbon matters to find out which kind of nitrification was the main nitrogen oxidation pathway in the system methane was not supplied in the control groups which demonstrated lower ammonia oxidation capacity and accumulation of nitrite as the oxygen was not exhausted the accumulation of nitrite was not caused by deficiency of oxygen which reported to be the main reason for inhibiting conventional nitrite oxidation bae et al 2001 sun et al 2017 the incomplete nitrification and inhibition of denitrification at the nitrite level were due to the insufficient carbon sources therefore the system was not likely driven by traditional autotrophic ammonia and nitrite oxidation but was more possible that ammonia was oxidized through hn ad by using endogenous carbon this could also inspire the nitrite accumulation through hn ad bacteria to form the sharon anammox system where the whole system is lacking organics moreover the residual nitrate was reduced to nitrite under aerobic conditions which supported aerobic denitrification when ch4 was present o2 was the main factor restraining ammonia removal when ch4 was not supplied ch4 was the limiting factor of ammonia removal suggesting that ammonia removal in our system required both methane and oxygen 3 2 analysis of microbial communities and functional bacteria based on high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna and functional genes 3 2 1 microbial structures and functional bacteria in the ame d3 system according to the high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples treated under ame d3 the relative abundance of which exceeded 75 the microbial structures of ame d3 at the genus level are shown in fig 5 a methanotrophs identified as methylomonas belonging to the methylomonaceae family were predominant in the original sample with a relative abundance of 18 49 chryseobacterium belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family was the second most common species with a relative abundance of 11 88 additionally two methylotrophic bacteria of the methylophilaceae family methylophilus 11 42 and methylobacillus 11 60 exhibited high relative abundances the proportions of which significantly changed after 5 d of cultivation figure s2 in all groups the abundances of thermomonas increased while the abundances of methylomonas significantly declined fig s2 methylobacter was the most dominant bacteria in the 10 and 20 o2 groups with relative abundances of 21 67 and 55 81 respectively thermomonas methylobacillus hydrogenophaga simplicispira and pseudoxanthomonas were predominant in the 25 o2 group with relative abundances of 12 90 10 10 13 38 7 67 and 6 70 respectively to identify the original methanotrophic community of the ame d3 system the inocula were analyzed through the high throughput sequencing of the pmoa gene the taxonomy determined based on the ncbi refseq representative genome database is presented in the pie chart in fig 5 a the relative abundance of methylomonas was 98 35 methylocystis methylobacter and methylocaldum were also present in the methanotrophic community after cultivation the abundance of methylomonas decreased in all cultivation groups while that of methylobacter rose to 21 67 and 55 81 in the 10 and 20 o2 groups respectively in the 25 o2 group the abundances of methylobacter and methylomonas were 2 82 and 4 38 respectively kits et al 2015 revealed that under hypoxic conditions methylomonas could use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor to oxidize methane while reducing nitrate to n2o however when the oxygen tension increased the abundance of methylomonas declined methylobacter exhibited greater potential for methane oxidation particularly in the 20 o2 group methylobacter has been found to be an active methanotroph at high methane and oxygen concentrations hao et al 2020 methylomonas was more active and abundant under low oxygen conditions the analysis of denitrifiers through the high throughput sequencing of the nirs gene indicated that 155 of the bacteria in the ame d3 system could reduce nitrite into nitric oxide however most of the bacteria could not be identified using the ncbi blast algorithm with the refseq representative genome database which may have been due to the lack of functional gene sequencing in the database therefore we summarized previous studies on denitrification to identify potential denitrifiers in our system several studies have reported that nitrate denitrification by methylophilaceae mostly methylobacillus and methylophilus is linked to methane oxidation liu et al 2014 beck et al 2013 pseudomonas is a multi functional genus containing many species that have anaerobic or aerobic denitrification abilities gao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 su et al 2019 many strains of comamonas and acinetobacter are denitrifiers some of which conduct conventional anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification etchebehere et al 2002 some of which play a role in aerobic denitrification patureau et al 1997 su et al 2017 xia et al 2020 some hydrogenophaga thermomonas simplicispira and arenimonas species have also been shown to have denitrification ability siddiqi et al 2019 xing et al 2018 mergaert et al 2003 in conclusion nitrate dependent methane oxidation was more likely to have been conducted by the cooperation of methanotrophs mainly methylomonas methylobacter and denitrifiers pseudomonas comamonas and acinetobacter under aerobic conditions methylobacillus methylophilus hydrogenophaga thermomonas simplicispira and arenimonas under anaerobic conditions from the analysis of the microbial communities we could observe that methylobacter was the most abundant heterotrophic bacteria under 20 o2 while facultative heterotrophic denitrifiers were more abundant in the 25 o2 group this is also demonstrated in fig s3 the microbial community was more diverse under 25 o2 these results support our proposal in section 3 1 1 that the remaining oxygen was used for the aerobic respiration of other microorganisms 3 2 2 microbial structures and functional bacteria in the ame d2 system the original microbial community of the ame d2 system was dominated by firmicutes 37 23 proteobacteria 36 79 and bacteroidetes 14 71 and was gradually overwhelmed by proteobacteria after cultivation at the genus level fig 5 b bacillus accounted for 34 74 of the original sample but was very rare in all samples after cultivation the relative abundance of comamonas which was less than 4 in the original sample increased to 5 0 11 72 31 66 27 78 and 41 43 in the cultivated samples with increasing oxygen content the abundance of simplicispira increased in the 5 10 20 and 25 o2 groups with relative abundances of 32 15 21 88 16 55 and 14 44 respectively the other dominant bacteria in the 100 n2 culture were thermomonas 10 76 and methylobacillus 6 02 in the 5 o2 culture were methylobacillus 10 58 shinella 3 35 and rhodobacter 6 71 in the 10 o2 culture thermomonas 4 36 methylobacillus 6 50 and methylophilus 8 77 in the 20 o2 culture thermomonas 3 99 shinella 3 70 rhodobacter 3 40 and acinetobacter 4 1 and in the 25 o2 culture thermomonas 3 48 shinella 6 26 rhodobacter 3 02 and hyphomicrobium 3 41 the results of the high throughput sequencing of the pmoa gene in the original sample are presented in the pie chart in fig 5 b and they indicated that methylomicrobium methylobacter and methylocaldum were the dominant methanotrophs their proportion in the whole microbial community was small and declined as the oxygen tension rose this might be due to the low carbon demand in nitrite denitrification or inhibition of nitrite to methanotrophs through nirs sequence analysis 183 phylotypes with denitrification potential were identified and these were more complex than those in the ame d3 system most denitrifiers identified in section 3 2 1 could also reduce nitrites patureau et al 1997 kim et al 2008 as comamonas and simplicispira were predominant in all experimental groups they were assumed to be the main denitrifying bacteria in the system while comamonas was more accustomed to high oxygen atmospheres 3 2 3 microbial structures and functional bacteria in the me snd system proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were also predominant at the phylum level in all samples firmicutes exhibited a high relative abundance of 36 51 in the original sample but almost disappeared after cultivation fig 5 c shows that enterobacter solibacillus and bacillus were the dominant bacterial genera in the original sample and their abundances were limited after cultivation chrysobacterium and comamonas were the most abundant bacteria in the 5 10 15 and 20 o2 groups and they exhibited the highest potential in the 20 and 25 o2 groups with relative abundances of 28 65 and 17 82 and 17 18 and 32 02 respectively the accumulation of thermomonas was highest in the 10 o2 group with a relative abundance of 16 38 and it decreased in the 20 and 25 o2 groups the abundances of shinella and enterobacter which are heterotrophic nitrifiers were high in all groups supplied with oxygen particularly in the 25 o2 group with relative abundances of 11 55 and 8 95 respectively wan et al 2017 chen et al 2016 the pmoa gene analysis of the original me snd sample presenting in the pie chart in fig 5 c indicated that methylomonas 31 23 methylocaldum 28 27 methylobacter 14 33 methylocystis 9 95 and methylomicrobium 9 1 were initially abundant a similar result was presented in the ame d2 system with the methanotrophic expression of nitrosospira to characterize the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the aob amoa gene in the original sample was analyzed through high throughput sequencing representative ammonia oxidizing bacteria genera including nitrosospira 42 91 of the aob group and nitrosomonas 12 61 of the aob group were identified methylomicrobium 41 19 of aob group which are type i methanotrophs have high ammonia oxidizing ability kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 five methanotrophs were identified in the whole microbial community and methylobacter was the most abundant methanotroph especially in the 20 o2 group with a relative abundance of 10 40 methylomicrobium which are methanotrophs and ammonia oxidizers occupied 0 32 of the original sample and 1 61 of the 10 o2 group the other ammonia oxidizers such as nitrosospira and nitrosomonas accounted for less than 1 of the microbial population in all groups the abundances of typical autotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob such as nitrospira and nitrobacter were less than 0 1 in the system ahn 2006 however the potential hn ad bacteria were found in the me snd system with high abundances particularly chryseobacterium comamonas shinella and enterobacter in the presence of high oxygen tension which were positively correlated with oxygen methane and ammonia fig 5 d kim et al 2005 kundu et al 2014 therefore hn ad bacteria were the main nitrification denitrification functional bacteria in the system including chryseobacterium comamonas shinella and enterobacter the hn ad bacteria could also use the metabolites produced by methanotrophs as carbon sources 3 2 4 microbial similarities and differences among the three systems three size fractionated samples presenting different nitrogen treating groups were significantly separated from each other according to the principal co ordinates analysis pcoa in fig 6 a anosim r 0 8866 p 0 001 indicating that nitrogenous substrates influenced the microbial community structure the significantly differed genera among the three systems were presented in fig 6 b as the followings 1 methylomonas and methylobacter as type i methanotrophs and methylobacillus as methylotrophic denitrifiers were the most abundant bacteria in the ame d3 system methylomicrobium was the most abundant methanotroph in ame d2 methylobacter and chryseobacterium were the most abundant in me snd the relative abundances of comamonas in ame d2 and me snd were significantly higher than that in ame d3 p 0 0039 a relationship graph was then constructed to clarify the correlation between methane oxidation nitrification and denitrification along with the associated microorganisms fig 6 c in summary methane was mainly oxidized by methylobacter producing carbonaceous intermediates for nitrification and denitrification according to the variations in the microbial abundance anaerobic nitrate denitrification was more active than aerobic nitrate denitrification methylobacillus and methylophilus were the main denitrifiers in contrast aerobic nitrite denitrification may have been more active in ame d2 when ammonia was the nitrogen substrate hn ad bacteria exhibited high activity while comamonas was present in all systems and chryseobacterium conducting heterotrophic nitrification was only abundant in me snd 4 conclusions and perspectives based on the results of this study we confirmed the occurrence of aerobic and anaerobic nitrate nitrite denitrification using methane as the sole carbon source which involved the activities of methanotrophs mainly methylobacter and methylomonas anaerobic denitrifiers such as methylophilus methylobacillus and simlicispira and aerobic denitrifiers comamonas as the dominant bacteria in the me snd the ammonia removal was strongly promoted by methane while nitrite was largely accumulated without methane based on the microbial community analysis conventional aob and nob bacteria occupied only a very small proportion of the communities while chryseobacterium comamonas shinella and enterobacter were predominant we proposed the coupling of methane oxidation and hn ad in all systems methanotrophs methylobacter as the dominant bacteria oxidized methane into organic intermediates which supplied carbon the methane oxidation and nitrogen removal rates were also assessed with different oxygen supply levels and they were substantially high in the presence of 25 o2 in ame d3 and me snd and in the presence of 20 o2 in ame d2 ethical approval this article does

17457,antibiotics are considered emerging pollutants as their presence in the environment is increasingly common although their environmental concentrations are generally low they can pose risk to organisms through bioaccumulation causing sublethal effects furthermore solar radiation can trigger reactions in certain compounds after their accumulation within organisms or in the environment toxicity and photoinduced toxicity of oxytetracycline otc widely used antibiotic in salmon aquaculture on daphnia magna crustacea cladocera and microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata chlorophyceae as its food source was assessed via aqueous exposure also the impact via diet microalga to the crustacean was examined in addition to lethal immobility effect in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to determine food ingestion gut content as a biomarker of physiological health in d magna and physiological status of microalgae otc 10 mg l 1 was not acutely 24 h toxic to r subcapitata when measured as maximum quantum yield fv fm in darkness however under short 1 h uv exposure otc caused irreversible decrease of fv fm 50 at 0 5 mg l 1 otc was not acutely lethal to d magna 10 mg l 1 however sublethal effects 43 decrease in food ingestion at 10 mg l 1 were demonstrated uv exposure 4 5 h strongly exacerbated toxicity of otc leading to lethal 87 immobility and sublethal 81 decrease of feeding in survived individuals effects uptake of otc aqueous exposure and its photosensitization in tissues of d magna under uv exposure was confirmed on the other hand rapid bioadsorption of otc on cell surface was evident in r subcapitata uptake of otc in d magna through diet could not be confirmed at short term photomodification of otc under uv exposure was observed through changes in its absorption spectrum the results show that short exposure to summer uv levels of southern chile can rapidly induce phototoxicity of otc suggesting a potential risk to aquatic organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics daphnia magna phototoxicity raphidocelis subcapitata sublethality uv radiation 1 introduction interaction of certain natural and artificial substances with sunlight to form reactive oxygen species ros is a well known example of photosensitization absorption of light followed by transfer of energy to other molecules in fact such photoreactions play an important role in plant defense and are the basis of many applications e g in certain medical treatments on the other hand interaction of many pharmaceutical products with sunlight can cause undesired effects such as sunburn vesicles etc björn and huovinen 2015 in the context of environmental pollution phototoxicity defined as light enhanced or induced toxicity started to gain awareness in the early 1980s particularly related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs giesy et al 2013 and its importance in risk assessment has been recognized ankley et al 2010 phototoxicity can result from photosensitization reactions and or from photomodification photooxidation photolysis leading in formation of photoproducts with different characteristics björn and huovinen 2015 in the case of pahs interaction of bioaccumulated pahs with uv radiation leading to photosensitization reactions inside organism was described as the main mechanism of their acute phototoxicity for the crustacean daphnia magna while photomodification of the compound in the aquatic environment apparently played minor role at short term huovinen et al 2001 currently pharmaceuticals including antibiotics are considered among emerging contaminants and their presence is increasingly common in different types of natural ecosystems sauvé and desrosiers 2014 the negative impact that they can generate in non target aquatic organisms is of increasing concern therefore knowledge on their environmental photochemistry defining their fate and impact is urgently needed boreen et al 2003 most antibiotics are generally considered to display relatively low toxicity to aquatic organisms brausch et al 2012 fu et al 2017 and at environmentally relevant concentrations their adverse effects are considered unlikely brausch et al 2012 microalgae have been reported to be the most sensitive aquatic organisms to antibiotics which is related to similar target sites of toxic action in plants and bacteria isidori et al 2005 brausch et al 2012 fu et al 2017 while reported toxicity levels for crustaceans are 1 2 order of magnitude lower isidori et al 2005 oxytetracycline otc is one of the most widely used antibiotics in salmon aquaculture in europe rigos and troisi 2005 and chile buschmann et al 2012 it is only metabolized to a lesser extent in fish and is therefore excreted in water in considerable quantities rigos et al 2004 according to a risk assessment by isidori et al 2005 otc was classified to present an acceptable risk based on its environmental levels ng l 1 in surface waters µg l 1 in effluents and observed toxicity from µg l 1 chronic to mg l 1 acute level and it was found neither mutagenic nor genotoxic however tetracyclines are among the known photosensitive antibiotics and especially doxycycline has been described as a potent photosensitizer björn and huovinen 2015 based on its photosensitivity photodegradation of otc under sunlight has been proposed as a low cost methodology to remove it from aquaculture waters leal et al 2016 this strategy however does not consider the phototoxic potential which actually has been confirmed for this antibiotic lee et al 2017 among the characteristics that define a phototoxic potential of a compound are its spectral absorption properties huovinen et al 2001 in sum despite their relatively low environmental levels and toxicity antibiotics with phototoxic potential such as tetracyclines might pose an elevated risk to organisms through their interaction with solar uv radiation in aquatic environments the risk for phototoxic reactions is determined by the depth of the uv light penetration in the water column which is strongly governed by the amount of colored dissolved organic material cdom huovinen et al 2003 2016 considering the reported sensitivity of microalgae to antibiotics see above their uptake by d magna e g bioaccumulation of antibiotics or impaired food quality could exacerbate the environmental risk of antibiotics in aquatic systems feeding rate has also been found a good biomarker of physiological health barata et al 2008 grintzalis et al 2017 and sensitive techniques based on in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence coelho et al 2009 sastri et al 2011 have been developed recently allowing improved estimations of food uptake in larval stages and small zooplankton in the present study acute toxicity and photoinduced toxicity of otc for two freshwater organisms the crustacean daphnia magna cladocera and the microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata chlorophyceae as its food source was assessed via aqueous exposure in laboratory also the potential impact from otc contaminated microalga diet to crustacean food uptake was assessed non invasive in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were applied to determine sublethal physiological status of microalgae and food ingestion gut content in daphnia in addition to immobility effect we tested the hypotheses that 1 low acute toxicity of otc is induced enhanced under uv radiation leading to sublethal effects at short term in these aquatic organisms after uptake photosensitization mechanism and 2 exposure to otc through trophic chain food uptake can lead to toxic and phototoxic effects in addition 3 a potential for photomodification of otc under uv irradiation was assessed through changes in its absorption properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 test organisms resting eggs ephippia of the crustacean daphnia magna straus 1820 cladocera were obtained from a bioassay kit daphtoxkit belgium ephippia were incubated in a petri dish with oxygenated reconstituted water containing 294 mg l 1 cacl2 2 h2o 123 mg l 1 mgso4 7 h2o 64 8 mg l 1 nahco3 5 75 mg l 1 kcl oecd 2004 at ph 7 8 0 2 and 20 2

with 20 μmol m 2 s 1 of photosynthetically active radiation par daphnids were fed with microalga r subcapitata see below once a day for two weeks before using them in bioassays raphidocelis subcapitata korshikov nygaard komárek j kristiansen o m skulberg chlorophyceae strain cm udec 093 was grown in the bold s basal medium culture medium bbm phytotechnology laboratories usa ph 6 6 0 1 at

phase were used for bioassays 2 2 test compound stock solution of oxytetracycline otc oxytetracycline hydrochloride analytical grade 95 purity sigma aldrich 50 mg l 1 was prepared in deionized water test solutions of otc were prepared in the culture media in bbm for microalgal bioassays and in the reconstituted water culture medium for crustacean bioassays see point 2 1 2 3 exposures to uv radiation artificial radiation during the experiments was provided by fluorescent tubes centered in uv a q panel 340 and uv b bands q panel 313 q panel co cleveland usa and par westinghouse electric pittsburg usa cellulose acetate filters ultraphan 295 and ultraphan 395 digefra germany were used to cut off wavelengths below 295 nm uv par treatment and below 395 nm only par control treatment respectively the experimental radiation levels measured with a hyper spectral radiometer ramses acc2 trios gmbh oldenburg germany were 2 2 and 8 4 w m 2 for uv b and uv a respectively and 54 μmol m 2 s 1 for par the level of uv b was chosen to represent mid summer solar noon conditions in central southern chile huovinen et al 2006 however uv a and par levels were kept lower as they may mask uv b effects it should be pointed out that due to the methodological limitations to simulate natural solar levels of uv a and in particular of par in laboratory conditions the spectral composition deviates from solar spectrum towards the visible wavelengths in order to evaluate spectral absorption characteristics and photomodification of the antibiotic absorption of otc solution 10 mg l 1 was measured in a quartz cuvette in a scanning spectrophotometer optizen pop usa before and after being exposed to par and par uv treatments see above for 4 5 h corresponding to the exposure time in daphnia bioassays point 2 5 similar measurements were made with otc solution kept in darkness for 24 h 2 4 uptake of otc in daphnids and microalgae for the quantification of otc in the tissues of the organisms the method described in kim et al 2014 was applied both organisms were exposed to 10 mg otc l 1 for 24 h in the darkness see fig a 1 2 for experimental design the daphnids were removed from the exposure vials rinsed with deionized water in order to remove residues of otc on the surface of the individuals and deposited on a 0 5 µm glass fiber filter advantec mfs tokyo japan in order to

millipore usa prior to analysis in addition to the control treatments organisms not exposed to otc a methodological control was used this consisted of a very brief around 1 min exposure of the organisms both d magna and r subcapitata to otc immediately before the extraction samples of r subcapitata were filtered under vacuum 0 5 µm glass fiber filter advantec mfs tokyo japan rinsed with

syringe filters millipore millex hv hydrophilic millipore usa quantification of otc in the extracts of both organisms was performed with hplc with uv vis detector shimadzu japan equipped with a 100 4 6 mm poroshell 120 ec c18 column with a particle size of 2 7 μm wavelengths at 370 and 254 nm were used in the analyses orellana 2009 volumes of extracts loaded in the column were 20 μl for daphnids and 25 μl for microalgae a mobile phase composed by 0 1 formic acid in water a and methanol b was used in a gradient program in which b concentration changed from 10 to 75 between 0 min and 3 min and then to a 100 between 3 min and 6 min under these conditions the chromatographic method showed quantification and detection limits of 2 89 10 4 and 9 6 10 5 μg 14 5 and 4 83 μg l 1 respectively the calibration curve was obtained by injecting different volumes 1 2 4 and 6 μl of the otc stock solution 2 3 mg l 1 for d magna and 0 46 mg l 1 for r subcapitata which showed excellent linearity r2 1 0000 and r2 0 9997 respectively 2 5 daphnia bioassay the bioassay with d magna was carried out in 20 ml glass scintillation vials test volume 18 ml according to huovinen et al 2001 five replicates were used for each treatment six adult individuals two weeks of age were transferred in each vial they were not fed for 24 h before the bioassays in order to study uptake aqueous exposure and toxicity daphnids were exposed to otc 10 mg l 1 for 24 h in the darkness for the analysis of uptake in tissue see point 2 4 subsequently daphnids were transferred to a clean culture medium and exposed to uv and par treatments for a period of 4 5 h non lethal uv exposure time to evaluate phototoxicity via photosensitization mechanisms fig a 1 for trophic transfer in d magna via diet r subcapitata as a food source was exposed to otc 10 mg l 1 for 24 h in the darkness after that microalgal suspension was centrifuged 15 min at 3000 rpm the supernatant rinsed centrifuged again and resuspended into clean culture medium daphnids were exposed to contaminated otc treatments and uncontaminated control microalgae final concentration 2 106 cells ml 1 for 3 h again daphnids were transferred to a clean culture medium and exposed to uv and par treatments for a period of 1 5 h to evaluate phototoxicity via diet fig a 2 at different experimental stages figs a1 and a 2 immobility lethal and feeding rate sublethal were used as responses organisms that did not exhibit mobility during 15 s of observation were considered immobile iso 1996 for the evaluation of feeding rate as gut content daphnids were transferred to a clean medium and 1 ml of microalgae r subcapitata 2 106 cells ml 1 was added after allowing feeding for 3 h the baseline fluorescence f0 of chlorophyll a within d magna was measured with a fluorometer water pam walz effeltrich germany adapted from coelho et al 2009 sastri et al 2011 figs a 1 and a 2 each individual was placed in the cuvette and measured separately average of five

estimate the number of cells ingested expressed as gut content 2 6 microalgal bioassay the experiments were carried out in 24 well cell culture plates trueline model tr5002 with a total volume of 2 ml in each well fig a 3 treatments included control without otc and four concentrations of otc in a wide range 5 2500 μg l 1 in four replicates the initial concentration of r subcapitata was around 4 5 105 cells ml 1 first a 24 h incubation in the darkness to avoid light induced modifications of otc was carried out in order to allow uptake of otc in r subcapitata and to assess toxicity in the absence of radiation subsequently the microalgae were exposed to uv par and only par treatments see point 2 3 for 1 h in order to evaluate phototoxicity of otc the exposure time was chosen based on preliminary screening for sublethal effects afterwards recovery was assessed after 24 h in the darkness finally the microalgae were transferred under par for 5 h to evaluate recovery under low par light repair maximum quantum yield fv fm in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence parameter associated with photosystem ii was used as an indicator of physiological status of the microalgae this parameter represents the ratio of the variable fv the difference between basal fo and maximum possible fluorescence fm of a dark adapted cell schreiber et al 1986 to obtain fm from a saturating actinic light algae were exposed to darkness for 10 min prior to measurement with the modulated amplitude pulse fluorometer imaging pam maxi version walz germany inhibition of fv fm after 24 h with otc in darkness with respect to the initial value toxicity and after light and recovery treatments with respect to the value after the 24 h uptake phototoxicity were calculated to determine the effect of otc under different light treatments fig a 3 in order to evaluate the toxicity in the absence of radiation at the higher concentration of otc used in daphnid tests 10 mg l 1 see point 2 5 a short term 24 h bioassay with r subcapitata was carried out in darkness in multiwell plates test volume 2 ml algal cell density 2 106 cells ml 1 samples from similar exposure were also used for the analyses of otc tissue content see point 2 4 as well as for tests of trophic transfer to d magna test volume 5 ml algal cell density 1 5 107 cells ml 1 see point 2 5 fig a 2 and a 3 2 7 statistical analyses parametric two way anova and non parametric kruskal wallis anova tests were applied to compare fv fm of microalgae as well as the fluorescence of microalgae in the gut content in relation with otc concentrations and uv radiation within and between treatments and for the different periods of the experiment p 0 05 tukey s post hoc was applied to identify subgroups of means that did not differ from each other p 0 05 the normality and homoscedasticity were evaluated with the kolmogorov smirnov and levene tests respectively all statistical analyses were performed using statistica 12 statsoft usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 uptake and toxicity of otc to daphnid exposure of d magna to otc 10 mg l 1 for 24 h in the darkness did not cause acute lethal toxicity as immobility however sublethal toxicity was observed as food ingestion in the gut was significantly 43 lower in otc treatment as compared to control p 0 05 fig 1 uptake of otc in d magna from surrounding water was confirmed table 1 low lethal toxicity of otc to d magna at short term has also been reported in previous studies ec50 ranging from 23 mg l 1 isidori et al 2005 to 100 mg l 1 wollenberger et al 2000 the observed decreased feeding gut content could potentially be related with altered swimming pan et al 2017 decreases in intestinal microbiota diversity associated with digestive function gorokhova et al 2015 increases in ros and or inhibition of activity of digestive enzymes yan et al 2019 in response to antibiotics otc has been shown to cause shifts in community composition of the microbiota associated to d magna affecting its subsequent colonization and growth callens et al 2018 no statistically significant sublethal food uptake or lethal immobility effect of otc on d magna was observed after a 3 h exposure via contaminated microalgae p 0 05 fig 2 uptake of otc in d magna via diet was not confirmed either table 1 this is in accordance with the lower uptake of tetracycline in d magna through diet than from surrounding water and consequently unlikely biomagnification in the food chain kim et al 2014 the observed fast bioadsorption of otc on algal cell surface see point 3 4 points to a possibility for uptake via diet thus the lack of it could have been influenced by the inhibition of processes related to uptake of contaminated food in d magna and or the limited time of exposure used in the present study decreased feeding rate in d magna exposed to cadmium contaminated microalgae has in fact been related with inhibition of filtration process and avoidance of contaminated food taylor et al 1998 a recent study demonstrated different effects on feeding behavior nutrition accumulation and digestive enzymes of d magna exposed to azithromycin antibiotic through different exposure pathways aqueous vs diet li et al 2020 3 2 impact of uv radiation on daphnid after exposure to uv radiation no lethal effects immobility were detected in d magna however sublethal effect was observed after a 4 5 h uv exposure reducing the food uptake significantly 49 in comparison with darkness and par treatment p 0 05 fig 1 shorter 1 5 h uv exposure did not cause statistically significant sublethal effects p 0 05 fig 2 sublethal effects reduced food uptake in d magna could be related to uv damage on the digestive tract decreasing the ability to feed and the activity of digestive enzymes as has been reported in a previous study zellmer et al 2006 detrimental uv effects have also been related to production of ros causing oxidative damage to dna lipids and proteins in cells with digestive functions hansson and hylander 2009 however daphnia also displays a variety of protective and repair strategies against uv damage such as antioxidant enzymes borgeraas and hessen 2002 carotenoids rhode et al 2001 vitamin d connelly et al 2015 production of melanin herbert and emery 1990 photolyase enzyme for repair of dna damage huebner et al 2006 and uv avoidance rhode et al 2001 thus previous uv exposure can modify the responses of organism to contaminants either positively by enhancing protective mechanisms or negatively by making the organisms more sensible kim et al 2009a the extent of the uv impact depends on the optical characteristics of the aquatic environment defining the penetration depth of solar uv radiation that sets finally the risk also for the induction of phototoxicity in fact underwater uv penetration depth can range from only a few centimeters in highly humic freshwaters to tens of meters in clear oceanic waters huovinen et al 2003 2016 it should be mentioned that uv radiation also has beneficial effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystems williamson et al 2001 the aspect that has gained more emphasis recently connelly et al 2015 e g decreasing the infectivity of parasites in daphnia overholt et al 2020 3 3 phototoxicity of otc to daphnid otc uptaken by d magna caused both sublethal and lethal effects under a 4 5 h uv exposure resulting in 87 immobility of all individuals and 81 decrease of food gut content of survived individuals as compared to dark control p 0 05 also under low par the toxicity of otc increased as evidenced by 43 immobility and 67 decrease in food ingestion p 0 05 fig 1 although uptake of otc in d magna via diet could not be confirmed table 1 see point 3 1 both light treatments par and uv with otc contaminated microalgae pointed to lower 32 38 feeding rates than the dark control with uncontaminated food fig 2 phototoxicity of sulfonamide antibiotics have been previously shown in daphnia related to oxidative stress due to increased production of ros kim et al 2009b the present results clearly proved the high phototoxicity of otc after uptake period in the darkness thus confirming the importance of the same mechanism photosensitization as reported for pahs anthracene and pyrene in daphnia huovinen et al 2001 interestingly light enhanced sublethal toxicity was suggested also after dietary exposure although uptake could not be confirmed pointing to a high light reactivity of otc even at low levels and even by par 3 4 uptake and toxicity of otc to microalga after a 24 h exposure to otc 0 05 2 5 mg l 1 in the darkness no significant differences in fv fm between control and otc treatments were observed p 0 05 in microalga r subcapitata table 2 even at higher concentration 10 mg otc l 1 no physiological stress based on fv fm was observed either p 0 05 table 2 previous studies have reported ec50 values for otc in the same species formerly known as selenastrum capricornutum and pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ranging from 0 17 mg l 1 evaluating cell density isidori et al 2005 to 4 5 mg l 1 ethanol extract of chlorophyll lützhøft et al 1999 and in other species from 0 2 mg l 1 cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa lützhøft et al 1999 to 17 mg l 1 marine green alga tetraselmis suecica seoane et al 2014 reflecting differences in the sensibility between species and measured endpoints in the present study otc did not affect chlorophyll fluorescence based fv fm pointing to a low impact on photochemical processes table 2 fv fm is a well known indicator of physiological status in photosynthetic organisms representing the maximum efficiency at which light absorbed by psii is used for reduction of qa thus observed decreases under abiotic stress can be indicative of the efficiency of how photosynthetic activity is affected as the inactivation or damage of psii may be a response to various stressors schreiber 2004 the photochemical effects observed in the present study can be considered an indirect response to otc however other studies have reported that otc can cause ultrastructural changes in photosynthetic sites e g disruptive damage of chloroplast moro et al 2020 and induce oxidative stress through inhibition of antioxidant enzymes such as catalases chi et al 2010 thus direct impact on primary photochemical processes cannot be ruled out either the present results could also reflect the low uptake of otc in r subcapitata rather than uptake within algal cells a rapid adsorption of otc on the cell surface of r subcapitata was suggested as quantitative analyses revealed similar otc levels in the methodological control and otc treatment table 1 it is well known that different functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl amino and sulfate in the cell wall of algae act as binding sites for contaminants apparently also for otc due to its small size r subcapitata has a large surface volume ratio that could explain its high bioadsorption capacity as has also been observed for tetracycline kim et al 2014 3 5 impact of uv radiation and phototoxicity of otc on microalgae after a 1 h exposure to uv radiation a 28 inhibition of fv fm was observed in r subcapitata under control treatment without otc fig 3 a table 2 short exposure 1 h to uv radiation induced the toxicity of otc at concentrations 0 5 mg l 1 causing significant inhibition close to 50 of fv fm as compared to control p 0 05 at lower concentrations of otc 5 50 µg l 1 no enhanced toxicity under uv was observed there was a significant difference between uv and par treatments p 0 05 with no effect under par even at the highest otc concentration 2 5 mg l 1 fig 3 a table 2 there was no significant recovery from phototoxic effect after a 24 h period in the dark fig 3 b table 2 however transfer of microalgae to visible light par for 5 h resulted in a full recovery from uv effect but not of phototoxicity of otc 0 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 which was further enhanced fig 3 c table 2 this could be indicative of light dependent repair mechanisms such as the participation of photolyases in the repair of damaged dna by uv interestingly inhibition of fv fm was enhanced also in microalgae previously exposed to the highest concentrations of otc 0 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 but not to uv radiation par treatment fig 3 b c table 2 this points to the increased toxicity of otc at extended exposure times 2 d overall ros generated by the interaction of uv radiation and otc could damage cells directly while otc alone could impair the action of ros scavengers including enzymes chi et al 2010 3 6 absorption spectrum and photomodification of otc otc showed maximal absorbance in the uv c 269 nm and uv a 370 nm wavelengths with relatively high absorbance also in the uv b range absorption in the par range decreased strongly from 400 nm onwards being zero at 450 nm fig 4 uv radiation has a potential to modify the structure of otc which was evidenced by changes in its absorption spectrum after a 4 5 h exposure to uv par the absorption spectrum underwent a marked change as the maximum absorbance in the uv a range was reduced to 36 which may be due to photolysis and or formation of byproducts in addition an increase in absorbance in the par range 420 nm was observed after exposure to par a slight decrease in absorption in the uv a range was observed fig 4 in all the results show the photoreactivity of otc especially in the uv a band but also in uv b and even in low par range this was also reflected in the observed phototoxicity see point 3 5 fig 3 c photomodification of otc under uv radiation points to a possibility that at least part of the observed phototoxicity in microalgal tests may have been caused by photoproducts as these organisms were not transferred to clean medium before uv exposure as was the case in daphnia tests according to leal et al 2016 a 70 min solar exposure in midsummer at 40 n degrades 90 of otc however a possibility of formation of toxic or photoreactive photoproducts was not considered another study showed that under simulated sunlight photodegradation can eliminate the antibacterial activity of otc photoproducts not maintaining antibacterial activity leal et al 2017 on the other hand increased toxicity in the presence of photoproducts of otc to bacteria has been reported jiao et al 2008 it should be pointed out that byproducts are formed through different non biodegradation and biodegradation pathways li et al 2019 and reports on the toxicity of otc metabolites such as 4 epi oxytetracycline han et al 2016 formed e g by microbial degradation li et al 2019 involve different processes than light induced pathway thus resulting in different byproducts although the potential changes increase or decrease in the toxicity of otc after photomodification were not directly examined in the present study it is clear that its absorption in the uv a band extending also to lower par range implies an elevated risk for light induced toxicity of otc under natural conditions due to the higher intensities and deeper underwater penetration depths of these wavelengths than uv b finally although detected environmental concentrations of otc in surface waters are overall low in relation to their measured acute toxicity including in the present study their potential occurrence in sediments and periodically enhanced levels during maximal discharge events could be relevant to consider in evaluation of their more realistic ecological impact isidori et al 2005 4 conclusions otc was uptaken by the crustacean d magna low acute lethality of otc in the darkness even at rather high concentrations confirmed earlier reports however previously less reported sublethal toxicity was reflected in a decreased food uptake these results emphasize the importance of development and use of sensitive sublethal biomarker endpoints in order to achieve more realistic environmental risk evaluation of pharmaceuticals rapid bioadsorption of otc on the cell surface of the microalga r subcapitata was observed pointing to a potential for its transfer through food web further studies with longer exposure times are needed to conclude the transfer of toxicity and or phototoxicity of otc in the food chain toxicity of otc to both d magna and the microalga r subcapitata was highly enhanced under uv radiation at short term in d magna photosensitization of otc within organisms was confirmed while in r subcapitata the observed phototoxicity was likely related to formation of ros at cell surface and or in the aquatic medium in addition to uv short wavelength end of visible light was capable of inducing phototoxic reactions this could have severe implications for aquatic organisms as sunlight levels of par are higher and their penetration in water column is deeper than those of uv band these observations clearly point to a higher than previously reported risk of otc to aquatic systems through phototoxic reactions at environmentally relevant irradiance levels and time scales hours author statement luis peroti conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft pirjo huovinen

17457,antibiotics are considered emerging pollutants as their presence in the environment is increasingly common although their environmental concentrations are generally low they can pose risk to organisms through bioaccumulation causing sublethal effects furthermore solar radiation can trigger reactions in certain compounds after their accumulation within organisms or in the environment toxicity and photoinduced toxicity of oxytetracycline otc widely used antibiotic in salmon aquaculture on daphnia magna crustacea cladocera and microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata chlorophyceae as its food source was assessed via aqueous exposure also the impact via diet microalga to the crustacean was examined in addition to lethal immobility effect in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to determine food ingestion gut content as a biomarker of physiological health in d magna and physiological status of microalgae otc 10 mg l 1 was not acutely 24 h toxic to r subcapitata when measured as maximum quantum yield fv fm in darkness however under short 1 h uv exposure otc caused irreversible decrease of fv fm 50 at 0 5 mg l 1 otc was not acutely lethal to d magna 10 mg l 1 however sublethal effects 43 decrease in food ingestion at 10 mg l 1 were demonstrated uv exposure 4 5 h strongly exacerbated toxicity of otc leading to lethal 87 immobility and sublethal 81 decrease of feeding in survived individuals effects uptake of otc aqueous exposure and its photosensitization in tissues of d magna under uv exposure was confirmed on the other hand rapid bioadsorption of otc on cell surface was evident in r subcapitata uptake of otc in d magna through diet could not be confirmed at short term photomodification of otc under uv exposure was observed through changes in its absorption spectrum the results show that short exposure to summer uv levels of southern chile can rapidly induce phototoxicity of otc suggesting a potential risk to aquatic organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics daphnia magna phototoxicity raphidocelis subcapitata sublethality uv radiation 1 introduction interaction of certain natural and artificial substances with sunlight to form reactive oxygen species ros is a well known example of photosensitization absorption of light followed by transfer of energy to other molecules in fact such photoreactions play an important role in plant defense and are the basis of many applications e g in certain medical treatments on the other hand interaction of many pharmaceutical products with sunlight can cause undesired effects such as sunburn vesicles etc björn and huovinen 2015 in the context of environmental pollution phototoxicity defined as light enhanced or induced toxicity started to gain awareness in the early 1980s particularly related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs giesy et al 2013 and its importance in risk assessment has been recognized ankley et al 2010 phototoxicity can result from photosensitization reactions and or from photomodification photooxidation photolysis leading in formation of photoproducts with different characteristics björn and huovinen 2015 in the case of pahs interaction of bioaccumulated pahs with uv radiation leading to photosensitization reactions inside organism was described as the main mechanism of their acute phototoxicity for the crustacean daphnia magna while photomodification of the compound in the aquatic environment apparently played minor role at short term huovinen et al 2001 currently pharmaceuticals including antibiotics are considered among emerging contaminants and their presence is increasingly common in different types of natural ecosystems sauvé and desrosiers 2014 the negative impact that they can generate in non target aquatic organisms is of increasing concern therefore knowledge on their environmental photochemistry defining their fate and impact is urgently needed boreen et al 2003 most antibiotics are generally considered to display relatively low toxicity to aquatic organisms brausch et al 2012 fu et al 2017 and at environmentally relevant concentrations their adverse effects are considered unlikely brausch et al 2012 microalgae have been reported to be the most sensitive aquatic organisms to antibiotics which is related to similar target sites of toxic action in plants and bacteria isidori et al 2005 brausch et al 2012 fu et al 2017 while reported toxicity levels for crustaceans are 1 2 order of magnitude lower isidori et al 2005 oxytetracycline otc is one of the most widely used antibiotics in salmon aquaculture in europe rigos and troisi 2005 and chile buschmann et al 2012 it is only metabolized to a lesser extent in fish and is therefore excreted in water in considerable quantities rigos et al 2004 according to a risk assessment by isidori et al 2005 otc was classified to present an acceptable risk based on its environmental levels ng l 1 in surface waters µg l 1 in effluents and observed toxicity from µg l 1 chronic to mg l 1 acute level and it was found neither mutagenic nor genotoxic however tetracyclines are among the known photosensitive antibiotics and especially doxycycline has been described as a potent photosensitizer björn and huovinen 2015 based on its photosensitivity photodegradation of otc under sunlight has been proposed as a low cost methodology to remove it from aquaculture waters leal et al 2016 this strategy however does not consider the phototoxic potential which actually has been confirmed for this antibiotic lee et al 2017 among the characteristics that define a phototoxic potential of a compound are its spectral absorption properties huovinen et al 2001 in sum despite their relatively low environmental levels and toxicity antibiotics with phototoxic potential such as tetracyclines might pose an elevated risk to organisms through their interaction with solar uv radiation in aquatic environments the risk for phototoxic reactions is determined by the depth of the uv light penetration in the water column which is strongly governed by the amount of colored dissolved organic material cdom huovinen et al 2003 2016 considering the reported sensitivity of microalgae to antibiotics see above their uptake by d magna e g bioaccumulation of antibiotics or impaired food quality could exacerbate the environmental risk of antibiotics in aquatic systems feeding rate has also been found a good biomarker of physiological health barata et al 2008 grintzalis et al 2017 and sensitive techniques based on in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence coelho et al 2009 sastri et al 2011 have been developed recently allowing improved estimations of food uptake in larval stages and small zooplankton in the present study acute toxicity and photoinduced toxicity of otc for two freshwater organisms the crustacean daphnia magna cladocera and the microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata chlorophyceae as its food source was assessed via aqueous exposure in laboratory also the potential impact from otc contaminated microalga diet to crustacean food uptake was assessed non invasive in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were applied to determine sublethal physiological status of microalgae and food ingestion gut content in daphnia in addition to immobility effect we tested the hypotheses that 1 low acute toxicity of otc is induced enhanced under uv radiation leading to sublethal effects at short term in these aquatic organisms after uptake photosensitization mechanism and 2 exposure to otc through trophic chain food uptake can lead to toxic and phototoxic effects in addition 3 a potential for photomodification of otc under uv irradiation was assessed through changes in its absorption properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 test organisms resting eggs ephippia of the crustacean daphnia magna straus 1820 cladocera were obtained from a bioassay kit daphtoxkit belgium ephippia were incubated in a petri dish with oxygenated reconstituted water containing 294 mg l 1 cacl2 2 h2o 123 mg l 1 mgso4 7 h2o 64 8 mg l 1 nahco3 5 75 mg l 1 kcl oecd 2004 at ph 7 8 0 2 and 20 2

with 20 μmol m 2 s 1 of photosynthetically active radiation par daphnids were fed with microalga r subcapitata see below once a day for two weeks before using them in bioassays raphidocelis subcapitata korshikov nygaard komárek j kristiansen o m skulberg chlorophyceae strain cm udec 093 was grown in the bold s basal medium culture medium bbm phytotechnology laboratories usa ph 6 6 0 1 at

phase were used for bioassays 2 2 test compound stock solution of oxytetracycline otc oxytetracycline hydrochloride analytical grade 95 purity sigma aldrich 50 mg l 1 was prepared in deionized water test solutions of otc were prepared in the culture media in bbm for microalgal bioassays and in the reconstituted water culture medium for crustacean bioassays see point 2 1 2 3 exposures to uv radiation artificial radiation during the experiments was provided by fluorescent tubes centered in uv a q panel 340 and uv b bands q panel 313 q panel co cleveland usa and par westinghouse electric pittsburg usa cellulose acetate filters ultraphan 295 and ultraphan 395 digefra germany were used to cut off wavelengths below 295 nm uv par treatment and below 395 nm only par control treatment respectively the experimental radiation levels measured with a hyper spectral radiometer ramses acc2 trios gmbh oldenburg germany were 2 2 and 8 4 w m 2 for uv b and uv a respectively and 54 μmol m 2 s 1 for par the level of uv b was chosen to represent mid summer solar noon conditions in central southern chile huovinen et al 2006 however uv a and par levels were kept lower as they may mask uv b effects it should be pointed out that due to the methodological limitations to simulate natural solar levels of uv a and in particular of par in laboratory conditions the spectral composition deviates from solar spectrum towards the visible wavelengths in order to evaluate spectral absorption characteristics and photomodification of the antibiotic absorption of otc solution 10 mg l 1 was measured in a quartz cuvette in a scanning spectrophotometer optizen pop usa before and after being exposed to par and par uv treatments see above for 4 5 h corresponding to the exposure time in daphnia bioassays point 2 5 similar measurements were made with otc solution kept in darkness for 24 h 2 4 uptake of otc in daphnids and microalgae for the quantification of otc in the tissues of the organisms the method described in kim et al 2014 was applied both organisms were exposed to 10 mg otc l 1 for 24 h in the darkness see fig a 1 2 for experimental design the daphnids were removed from the exposure vials rinsed with deionized water in order to remove residues of otc on the surface of the individuals and deposited on a 0 5 µm glass fiber filter advantec mfs tokyo japan in order to eliminate the water daphnids were transferred to eppendorf tubes and homogenized with micropestle geneaid new taipei city taiwan fresh samples were weighed with microbalance mya 0 8 3 3y radwag poland

millipore usa prior to analysis in addition to the control treatments organisms not exposed to otc a methodological control was used this consisted of a very brief around 1 min exposure of the organisms both d magna and r subcapitata to otc immediately before the extraction samples of r subcapitata were filtered under vacuum 0 5 µm glass fiber filter advantec mfs tokyo japan rinsed with

syringe filters millipore millex hv hydrophilic millipore usa quantification of otc in the extracts of both organisms was performed with hplc with uv vis detector shimadzu japan equipped with a 100 4 6 mm poroshell 120 ec c18 column with a particle size of 2 7 μm wavelengths at 370 and 254 nm were used in the analyses orellana 2009 volumes of extracts loaded in the column were 20 μl for daphnids and 25 μl for microalgae a mobile phase composed by 0 1 formic acid in water a and methanol b was used in a gradient program in which b concentration changed from 10 to 75 between 0 min and 3 min and then to a 100 between 3 min and 6 min under these conditions the chromatographic method showed quantification and detection limits of 2 89 10 4 and 9 6 10 5 μg 14 5 and 4 83 μg l 1 respectively the calibration curve was obtained by injecting different volumes 1 2 4 and 6 μl of the otc stock solution 2 3 mg l 1 for d magna and 0 46 mg l 1 for r subcapitata which showed excellent linearity r2 1 0000 and r2 0 9997 respectively 2 5 daphnia bioassay the bioassay with d magna was carried out in 20 ml glass scintillation vials test volume 18 ml according to huovinen et al 2001 five replicates were used for each treatment six adult individuals two weeks of age were transferred in each vial they were not fed for 24 h before the bioassays in order to study uptake aqueous exposure and toxicity daphnids were exposed to otc 10 mg l 1 for 24 h in the darkness for the analysis of uptake in tissue see point 2 4 subsequently daphnids were transferred to a clean culture medium and exposed to uv and par treatments for a period of 4 5 h non lethal uv exposure time to evaluate phototoxicity via photosensitization mechanisms fig a 1 for trophic transfer in d magna via diet r subcapitata as a food source was exposed to otc 10 mg l 1 for 24 h in the darkness after that microalgal suspension was centrifuged 15 min at 3000 rpm the supernatant rinsed centrifuged again and resuspended into clean culture medium daphnids were exposed to contaminated otc treatments and uncontaminated control microalgae final concentration 2 106 cells ml 1 for 3 h again daphnids were transferred to a clean culture medium and exposed to uv and par treatments for a period of 1 5 h to evaluate phototoxicity via diet fig a 2 at different experimental stages figs a1 and a 2 immobility lethal and feeding rate sublethal were used as responses organisms that did not exhibit mobility during 15 s of observation were considered immobile iso 1996 for the evaluation of feeding rate as gut content daphnids were transferred to a clean medium and 1 ml of microalgae r subcapitata 2 106 cells ml 1 was added after allowing feeding for 3 h the baseline fluorescence f0 of chlorophyll a within d magna was measured with a fluorometer water pam walz effeltrich germany adapted from coelho et al 2009 sastri et al 2011 figs a 1 and a 2 each individual was placed in the cuvette and measured separately average of five individuals in a vial was used for each replicate calibration curve between f0 and cell count ml 1 cells through microscopy using neubauer chamber and microscope olympus ckx41sf japan was used to estimate the number of cells ingested expressed as gut content 2 6 microalgal bioassay the experiments were carried out in 24 well cell culture plates trueline model tr5002 with a total volume of 2 ml in each well fig a 3 treatments included control without otc and four concentrations of otc in a wide range 5 2500 μg l 1 in four replicates the initial concentration of r subcapitata was around 4 5 105 cells ml 1 first a 24 h incubation in the darkness to avoid light induced modifications of otc was carried out in order to allow uptake of otc in r subcapitata and to assess toxicity in the absence of radiation subsequently the microalgae were exposed to uv par and only par treatments see point 2 3 for 1 h in order to evaluate phototoxicity of otc the exposure time was chosen based on preliminary screening for sublethal effects afterwards recovery was assessed after 24 h in the darkness finally the microalgae were transferred under par for 5 h to evaluate recovery under low par light repair maximum quantum yield fv fm in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence parameter associated with photosystem ii was used as an indicator of physiological status of the microalgae this parameter represents the ratio of the variable fv the difference between basal fo and maximum possible fluorescence fm of a dark adapted cell schreiber et al 1986 to obtain fm from a saturating actinic light algae were exposed to darkness for 10 min prior to measurement with the modulated amplitude pulse fluorometer imaging pam maxi version walz germany inhibition of fv fm after 24 h with otc in darkness with respect to the initial value toxicity and after light and recovery treatments with respect to the value after the 24 h uptake phototoxicity were calculated to determine the effect of otc under different light treatments fig a 3 in order to evaluate the toxicity in the absence of radiation at the higher concentration of otc used in daphnid tests 10 mg l 1 see point 2 5 a short term 24 h bioassay with r subcapitata was carried out in darkness in multiwell plates test volume 2 ml algal cell density 2 106 cells ml 1 samples from similar exposure were also used for the analyses of otc tissue content see point 2 4 as well as for tests of trophic transfer to d magna test volume 5 ml algal cell density 1 5 107 cells ml 1 see point 2 5 fig a 2 and a 3 2 7 statistical analyses parametric two way anova and non parametric kruskal wallis anova tests were applied to compare fv fm of microalgae as well as the fluorescence of microalgae in the gut content in relation with otc concentrations and uv radiation within and between treatments and for the different periods of the experiment p 0 05 tukey s post hoc was applied to identify subgroups of means that did not differ from each other p 0 05 the normality and homoscedasticity were evaluated with the kolmogorov smirnov and levene tests respectively all statistical analyses were performed using statistica 12 statsoft usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 uptake and toxicity of otc to daphnid exposure of d magna to otc 10 mg l 1 for 24 h in the darkness did not cause acute lethal toxicity as immobility however sublethal toxicity was observed as food ingestion in the gut was significantly 43 lower in otc treatment as compared to control p 0 05 fig 1 uptake of otc in d magna from surrounding water was confirmed table 1 low lethal toxicity of otc to d magna at short term has also been reported in previous studies ec50 ranging from 23 mg l 1 isidori et al 2005 to 100 mg l 1 wollenberger et al 2000 the observed decreased feeding gut content could potentially be related with altered swimming pan et al 2017 decreases in intestinal microbiota diversity associated with digestive function gorokhova et al 2015 increases in ros and or inhibition of activity of digestive enzymes yan et al 2019 in response to antibiotics otc has been shown to cause shifts in community composition of the microbiota associated to d magna affecting its subsequent colonization and growth callens et al 2018 no statistically significant sublethal food uptake or lethal immobility effect of otc on d magna was observed after a 3 h exposure via contaminated microalgae p 0 05 fig 2 uptake of otc in d magna via diet was not confirmed either table 1 this is in accordance with the lower uptake of tetracycline in d magna through diet than from surrounding water and consequently unlikely biomagnification in the food chain kim et al 2014 the observed fast bioadsorption of otc on algal cell surface see point 3 4 points to a possibility for uptake via diet thus the lack of it could have been influenced by the inhibition of processes related to uptake of contaminated food in d magna and or the limited time of exposure used in the present study decreased feeding rate in d magna exposed to cadmium contaminated microalgae has in fact been related with inhibition of filtration process and avoidance of contaminated food taylor et al 1998 a recent study demonstrated different effects on feeding behavior nutrition accumulation and digestive enzymes of d magna exposed to azithromycin antibiotic through different exposure pathways aqueous vs diet li et al 2020 3 2 impact of uv radiation on daphnid after exposure to uv radiation no lethal effects immobility were detected in d magna however sublethal effect was observed after a 4 5 h uv exposure reducing the food uptake significantly 49 in comparison with darkness and par treatment p 0 05 fig 1 shorter 1 5 h uv exposure did not cause statistically significant sublethal effects p 0 05 fig 2 sublethal effects reduced food uptake in d magna could be related to uv damage on the digestive tract decreasing the ability to feed and the activity of digestive enzymes as has been reported in a previous study zellmer et al 2006 detrimental uv effects have also been related to production of ros causing oxidative damage to dna lipids and proteins in cells with digestive functions hansson and hylander 2009 however daphnia also displays a variety of protective and repair strategies against uv damage such as antioxidant enzymes borgeraas and hessen 2002 carotenoids rhode et al 2001 vitamin d connelly et al 2015 production of melanin herbert and emery 1990 photolyase enzyme for repair of dna damage huebner et al 2006 and uv avoidance rhode et al 2001 thus previous uv exposure can modify the responses of organism to contaminants either positively by enhancing protective mechanisms or negatively by making the organisms more sensible kim et al 2009a the extent of the uv impact depends on the optical characteristics of the aquatic environment defining the penetration depth of solar uv radiation that sets finally the risk also for the induction of phototoxicity in fact underwater uv penetration depth can range from only a few centimeters in highly humic freshwaters to tens of meters in clear oceanic waters huovinen et al 2003 2016 it should be mentioned that uv radiation also has beneficial effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystems williamson et al 2001 the aspect that has gained more emphasis recently connelly et al 2015 e g decreasing the infectivity of parasites in daphnia overholt et al 2020 3 3 phototoxicity of otc to daphnid otc uptaken by d magna caused both sublethal and lethal effects under a 4 5 h uv exposure resulting in 87 immobility of all individuals and 81 decrease of food gut content of survived individuals as compared to dark control p 0 05 also under low par the toxicity of otc increased as evidenced by 43 immobility and 67 decrease in food ingestion p 0 05 fig 1 although uptake of otc in d magna via diet could not be confirmed table 1 see point 3 1 both light treatments par and uv with otc contaminated microalgae pointed to lower 32 38 feeding rates than the dark control with uncontaminated food fig 2 phototoxicity of sulfonamide antibiotics have been previously shown in daphnia related to oxidative stress due to increased production of ros kim et al 2009b the present results clearly proved the high phototoxicity of otc after uptake period in the darkness thus confirming the importance of the same mechanism photosensitization as reported for pahs anthracene and pyrene in daphnia huovinen et al 2001 interestingly light enhanced sublethal toxicity was suggested also after dietary exposure although uptake could not be confirmed pointing to a high light reactivity of otc even at low levels and even by par 3 4 uptake and toxicity of otc to microalga after a 24 h exposure to otc 0 05 2 5 mg l 1 in the darkness no significant differences in fv fm between control and otc treatments were observed p 0 05 in microalga r subcapitata table 2 even at higher concentration 10 mg otc l 1 no physiological stress based on fv fm was observed either p 0 05 table 2 previous studies have reported ec50 values for otc in the same species formerly known as selenastrum capricornutum and pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ranging from 0 17 mg l 1 evaluating cell density isidori et al 2005 to 4 5 mg l 1 ethanol extract of chlorophyll lützhøft et al 1999 and in other species from 0 2 mg l 1 cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa lützhøft et al 1999 to 17 mg l 1 marine green alga tetraselmis suecica seoane et al 2014 reflecting differences in the sensibility between species and measured endpoints in the present study otc did not affect chlorophyll fluorescence based fv fm pointing to a low impact on photochemical processes table 2 fv fm is a well known indicator of physiological status in photosynthetic organisms representing the maximum efficiency at which light absorbed by psii is used for reduction of qa thus observed decreases under abiotic stress can be indicative of the efficiency of how photosynthetic activity is affected as the inactivation or damage of psii may be a response to various stressors schreiber 2004 the photochemical effects observed in the present study can be considered an indirect response to otc however other studies have reported that otc can cause ultrastructural changes in photosynthetic sites e g disruptive damage of chloroplast moro et al 2020 and induce oxidative stress through inhibition of antioxidant enzymes such as catalases chi et al 2010 thus direct impact on primary photochemical processes cannot be ruled out either the present results could also reflect the low uptake of otc in r subcapitata rather than uptake within algal cells a rapid adsorption of otc on the cell surface of r subcapitata was suggested as quantitative analyses revealed similar otc levels in the methodological control and otc treatment table 1 it is well known that different functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl amino and sulfate in the cell wall of algae act as binding sites for contaminants apparently also for otc due to its small size r subcapitata has a large surface volume ratio that could explain its high bioadsorption capacity as has also been observed for tetracycline kim et al 2014 3 5 impact of uv radiation and phototoxicity of otc on microalgae after a 1 h exposure to uv radiation a 28 inhibition of fv fm was observed in r subcapitata under control treatment without otc fig 3 a table 2 short exposure 1 h to uv radiation induced the toxicity of otc at concentrations 0 5 mg l 1 causing significant inhibition close to 50 of fv fm as compared to control p 0 05 at lower concentrations of otc 5 50 µg l 1 no enhanced toxicity under uv was observed there was a significant difference between uv and par treatments p 0 05 with no effect under par even at the highest otc concentration 2 5 mg l 1 fig 3 a table 2 there was no significant recovery from phototoxic effect after a 24 h period in the dark fig 3 b table 2 however transfer of microalgae to visible light par for 5 h resulted in a full recovery from uv effect but not of phototoxicity of otc 0 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 which was further enhanced fig 3 c table 2 this could be indicative of light dependent repair mechanisms such as the participation of photolyases in the repair of damaged dna by uv interestingly inhibition of fv fm was enhanced also in microalgae previously exposed to the highest concentrations of otc 0 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 but not to uv radiation par treatment fig 3 b c table 2 this points to the increased toxicity of otc at extended exposure times 2 d overall ros generated by the interaction of uv radiation and otc could damage cells directly while otc alone could impair the action of ros scavengers including enzymes chi et al 2010 3 6 absorption spectrum and photomodification of otc otc showed maximal absorbance in the uv c 269 nm and uv a 370 nm wavelengths with relatively high absorbance also in the uv b range absorption in the par range decreased strongly from 400 nm onwards being zero at 450 nm fig 4 uv radiation has a potential to modify the structure of otc which was evidenced by changes in its absorption spectrum after a 4 5 h exposure to uv par the absorption spectrum underwent a marked change as the maximum absorbance in the uv a range was reduced to 36 which may be due to photolysis and or formation of byproducts in addition an increase in absorbance in the par range 420 nm was observed after exposure to par a slight decrease in absorption in the uv a range was observed fig 4 in all the results show the photoreactivity of otc especially in the uv a band but also in uv b and even in low par range this was also reflected in the observed phototoxicity see point 3 5 fig 3 c photomodification of otc under uv radiation points to a possibility that at least part of the observed phototoxicity in microalgal tests may have been caused by photoproducts as these organisms were not transferred to clean medium before uv exposure as was the case in daphnia tests according to leal et al 2016 a 70 min solar exposure in midsummer at 40 n degrades 90 of otc however a possibility of formation of toxic or photoreactive photoproducts was not considered another study showed that under simulated sunlight photodegradation can eliminate the antibacterial activity of otc photoproducts not maintaining antibacterial activity leal et al 2017 on the other hand increased toxicity in the presence of photoproducts of otc to bacteria has been reported jiao et al 2008 it should be pointed out that byproducts are formed through different non biodegradation and biodegradation pathways li et al 2019 and reports on the toxicity of otc metabolites such as 4 epi oxytetracycline han et al 2016 formed e g by microbial degradation li et al 2019 involve different processes than light induced pathway thus resulting in different byproducts although the potential changes increase or decrease in the toxicity of otc after photomodification were not directly examined in the present study it is clear that its absorption in the uv a band extending also to lower par range implies an elevated risk for light induced toxicity of otc under natural conditions due to the higher intensities and deeper underwater penetration depths of these wavelengths than uv b finally although detected environmental concentrations of otc in surface waters are overall low in relation to their measured acute toxicity including in the present study their potential occurrence in sediments and periodically enhanced levels during maximal discharge events could be relevant to consider in evaluation of their more realistic ecological impact isidori et al 2005 4 conclusions otc was uptaken by the crustacean d magna low acute lethality of otc in the darkness even at rather high concentrations confirmed earlier reports however previously less reported sublethal toxicity was reflected in a decreased food uptake these results emphasize the importance of development and use of sensitive sublethal biomarker endpoints in order to achieve more realistic environmental risk evaluation of pharmaceuticals rapid bioadsorption of otc on the cell surface of the microalga r subcapitata was observed pointing to a potential for its transfer through food web further studies with longer exposure times are needed to conclude the transfer of toxicity and or phototoxicity of otc in the food chain toxicity of otc to both d magna and the microalga r subcapitata was highly enhanced under uv radiation at short term in d magna photosensitization of otc within organisms was confirmed while in r subcapitata the observed phototoxicity was likely related to formation of ros at cell surface and or in the aquatic medium in addition to uv short wavelength end of visible light was capable of inducing phototoxic reactions this could have severe implications for aquatic organisms as sunlight levels of par are higher and their penetration in water column is deeper than those of uv band these observations clearly point to a higher than previously reported risk of otc to aquatic systems through phototoxic reactions at environmentally relevant irradiance levels and time scales hours author statement luis peroti conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft pirjo huovinen

17458,in the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent covid 19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health care improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections through measuring trends of rna signal in wastewater systems in this study sars cov 2 viral rna n1 and n2 gene regions are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids pgs and primary clarified sludge pcs in two water resource recovery facilities wrrf serving canada s national capital region i e the city of ottawa on pop 1 1m and the city of gatineau qc pop 280k pcs samples show signal inhibition using rt ddpcr compared to rt qpcr with pgs samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of rna using both assays rt qpcr shows higher frequency of detection of n1 and n2 gene regions in pcs 92 7 90 6 n 6 as compared to pgs samples 79 2 82 3 n 5 sampling of pcs may therefore be an effective approach for sars cov 2 viral quantification especially during periods of declining and low covid 19 incidence in the community the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov is determined to have a less variable rna signal in pcs over a three month period for two wrrfs regardless of environmental conditions compared to bacteroides 16s rrna or human 18s rrna making pmmov a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of sars cov 2 signal pmmov normalized pcs rna signal from wrrfs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics identifying pcs normalized to a fecal indicator pmmov as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low incidence of infection of sars cov 2 in communities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords covid 19 sars cov 2 wastewater primary clarified sludge solids virus 1 introduction since the onset of the novel coronavirus disease in 2019 covid 19 the rapid transmission and global spread of the disease has placed significant strain on public health agencies around the world detection of sars cov 2 rna in nasopharyngeal np swab specimens by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr is the standard diagnostic test to confirm covid 19 accurately measuring the prevalence of covid 19 in many countries has been complicated by limited and or biased np testing targeting symptomatic groups and an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infectious period in a significant proportion of cases long et al 2020 pan et al 2020 additional detection tools are thus desirable to mitigate these challenges and provide public health agencies and government s new metrics to help guide their implementation of societal restrictions daughton 2009 hill et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 recent systematic reviews and meta analyses of the current peer reviewed and preprint literature confirm fecal sars cov 2 viral rna detection in roughly half of covid 19 patients gupta et al 2020 parasa et al 2020 moreover a systematic review and meta analysis of sars cov 2 viral rna detection profiles in several different types of covid 19 patient specimens found that positive detection rates were higher in rectal and sputum swabs than in the commonly used np swab bwire et al 2020 these data provide a clear rationale to probe wastewater for sars cov 2 rna medema et al 2020 first reported the detection of sars cov 2 viral rna in wastewater from wrrfs located in seven different cities in the netherlands sars cov 2 viral rna has subsequently been identified and is being monitored at numerous wrrfs around the world ahmed et al 2020a alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 bar or et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 haramoto et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 rimoldi et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 with the first peer reviewed study published by ahmed et al 2020a in australia the successful monitoring of the viral signal has led the netherlands national institute for public health and the environment 2020 australia dalzell 2020 germany pleitgen 2020 and finland yle 2020 to plan and implement national wastewater surveillance programs for sars cov 2 as a viral tracking tool to complement existing public health metrics there are also early and promising indications from several research groups that wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 might be predictive providing earlier warning of community outbreak than current np based pcr diagnostics although studies reported some success in the detection and even quantitation of sars cov 2 rna by rt qpcr in wastewaters over the course of community covid 19 outbreaks poor assay sensitivity and systematic variation represent significant challenges particularly in regions with low covid 19 prevalence bar on et al 2020 michael kordatou et al 2020 orive et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 specifically monitoring in communities with low incidence has demonstrated high pcr ct values and hence variable or unquantifiable data being collected due to very low concentrations of the viral fragments in wastewaters in this regard at least two groups have identified improved sensitivity in solids rich wastewater samples collected from wrrfs in communities with low incidence and prevalence 25 active cases 100 000 population balboa et al 2020 preprint peccia et al 2020 however it has been observed that due to variations both in case numbers and influent wastewater sample data medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 studies have so far reported high day to day variance and noise balboa et al 2020 preprint peccia et al 2020 which is a key challenge in establishing trends and extracting meaningful information from sars cov 2 wastewater sentinel surveillance programs to date this study investigates and optimizes the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater influent solids post grit solids pgs and primary clarified sludge pcs in two municipal wrrfs serving ottawa and gatineau beginning after the height of the epidemic with a period april to may 2020 characterized by decreasing covid 19 incidence and a subsequent period may to june 2020 of low covid 19 prevalence using both rt qpcr and rt droplet digital dd pcr rigorous quality control metrics are applied to compare the detection sensitivity of viral n1 and n2 rna in pgs compared to pcs using two different established primer probe sets furthermore the study tests the human microbiome specific hf183 bacteroides 16s ribosomal rna rrna human 18s rrna and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rna as reliable and robust nucleic acid normalization fecal biomarkers that can be used to control systematic noise associated with variances in wrrf daily operations sampling storage processing and analysis of the samples finally the study compares and correlates biomarker normalized longitudinal data sets of the two municipalities with epidemiological metrics to evaluate the usefulness of sars cov 2 viral measurements in wastewater as a complimentary tool to clinical testing in a community during decreasing and low covid 19 incidence 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the city of ottawa and gatineau wrrfs post grit chamber influent solids and primary clarified sludge samples were collected from the city of ottawa s robert o pickard environmental centre ontario and the city of gatineau quebec water resource recovery facilities wrrfs the two facilities are located across the ottawa river from each other in the national capital region of canada fig 1 the two wrrfs service over 1 3 million people or approximately 3 7 of canada s total population the sewershed of the city of ottawa wrrf services approximately 1 1m people and the sewershed of the city of gatineau wrrf services approximately 280k people ottawa and gatineau wrrfs are designed and operated as conventional activated sludge treatment systems supplementary table 1 the grit chambers of both facilities where a portion of the samples are collected in this study are located toward the front of both wrrf treatment trains and are fed by coarse and fine screened wastewaters the grit chambers of both facilities subsequently feed the primary clarifiers where remaining portion of the samples are collected in this study the hydraulic residence time of the ottawa sewershed ranges from 2 hours to 35 hours with an average residence time of approximately 12 hours in comparison the hydraulic residence time of gatineau s sewershed ranges from 2 hours to 7 hours with an average of approximately 4 hours 2 2 wastewater sampling and analysis 2 2 1 pgs samples fourteen and nine 24 hour composite pgs samples were analyzed from the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs respectively between april 1st and june 30th 2020 clean 250 ml hdpe sampling bottles were sanitized with a 10 bleach solution and then washed with rnase awaytm thermofisher ottawa canada rinsed with deionized water and sealed the pgs samples in this study are collected in the stream exiting the grit chambers these samples have large debris removed via screens as was the dense grit via the grit chamber a bio banked wastewater influent sample from a nearby wrrf collected in august 2019 was utilized as a sars cov 2 negative control supplemental fig s1 250 ml hourly composite samples were collected over a 24 hour period for a total of 6 l using an isco autosampler hoskin scientific burlington canada that collects directly from the exit stream of the grit chamber units at both facilities the samples in the isco autosamplers were maintained at approximately 4 c during sampling with the frequent addition of ice with a maximum recorded temperature of 7 c across the study starting in june the isco autosamplers were linked to refrigerators allowing the samples to be kept at temperatures of approximately 2 c immediately upon collection the harvested samples were transported from the wrrfs to the laboratory in coolers packed on ice and were immediately refrigerated at 4 c for a maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis 2 2 2 pcs samples for the first 55 days of the study between april 1st and june 30th 2020 grab samples of pcs were collected every second week at the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs these sludge samples were harvested from the primary sludge streams in the two facilities at the manifold where the primary clarified sludge that exits all primary clarifiers was mixed into a single stream from day 56 onward with the stronger rna signal detected in pcs samples as compared to pgs samples 24 hour composite pcs samples were collected by plant process technicians every other day at the ottawa facility the 24 hour composite samples collected at the ottawa wrrf were comprised of four grab samples collected every 6 hours upon collection samples were stored on site at the ottawa facility at 4 c in a refrigerator until mixed to form daily 24 hour composite samples and transported on ice to the laboratory the subsequent day all samples were stored at 4 c at the laboratory and processed within 6 hours of arrival samples which could not immediately be analyzed were stored at 4 c for a maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis in the laboratory meanwhile in gatineau an isco autosampler was linked to a refrigerator and was connected to a pcs sampling port the autosampler collected hourly grab samples of 250 ml which were subsequently mixed to form a 24 hour composite sample due to the size differences of the two facilities in this study and the available resources at the two facilities during the covid 19 pandemic in canada the gatineau facility sampling frequency was limited to a maximum of once a week as opposed to every second day as was performed at the larger ottawa facility the 24 hour composite samples were collected and transported on ice to the laboratory as outlined for the ottawa samples 2 2 3 wastewater quality characterization of samples the following pgs and pcs sample wastewater quality constituents were analyzed upon collection biological oxygen demand bod 5210 b apha 2012 chemical oxygen demand cod sm 5220 d apha 2012 total suspended solids volatile suspended solids total solids and total volatile solids tss vss ts vs sm 2540 d e b apha 2012 total ammonia nitrogen tan sm 4500 c apha 1989 2 3 sars cov 2 concentration a preliminary study was first performed on partitioned 24 hour composite pgs samples to identify fractions with sars cov 2 rna positivity fig 2 the 6 l 24 hour composite pgs samples were first settled at 4 c for an hour the supernatant was subsequently decanted and serially filtered through a 1 5 µm glass fiber filter gff followed by a 0 45 µm gf6 mixed cellulose ester mce filter filtrate fraction an eluate fraction was then collected by passing 32 ml of elution buffer 0 05 m kh2po4 1 0 m nacl 0 1 v v triton x 100 ph 9 2 through the spent filters each of the three fractions were subsequently peg concentrated and extracted and analyzed for sars cov 2 rna to concentrate viral particles nucleic acids and proteins 32 ml of pgs or pcs was precipitated with polyethylene glycol peg 8000 at a final concentration of 80 g l and 0 3m g l nacl ph 7 3 and in a final volume of 40 ml comelli et al 2008 petterson et al 2015 samples were then agitated at 4 c on an orbital shaker set at 160 rpm for a period of 12 to 17 hours then centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 45 minutes at 4 c the supernatant was decanted being careful to preserve any pellet samples were then centrifuged a second time at 10 000 x g for another 10 minutes and the remaining supernatant decanted the resulting pcs and pgs pellets were transferred to a new rnase free centrifuge tube and frozen at 80 c until rna extraction 2 4 rna extraction viral rna was extracted from pgs and pcs samples using the rneasy powermicrobiome kit qiagen germantown md with the following deviations from the manufacturer s recommended protocol i 200 mg of sample pellet was added to the initial extraction step in place of 200 µl of liquid sample and ii the optional phenol chloroform mixture addition to the lysis buffer was substituted with trizol ls reagent thermofisher ottawa canada to maximize lysis of cells virion encapsulated fragments and protect rna prior to vortexing and centrifugation the resulting aqueous phase of the lysis procedure was then retained and processed as per the recommended protocol including the on column enzymatic dna removal step rna was eluted in 100 µl of rnase free water 2 5 viral recovery efficiency an important metric in the quantification of viral signal in wastewater is the process recovery efficiency for targets of interest as it facilitates a comparison of results from study to study even if different sample processing or extraction methodologies techniques are used in this study the efficiency of virus recovery following the fractionation peg concentration and rna extraction process was determined by spiking vesicular stomatitis virus vsv hoang et al 2019 into the sample and letting it mix at 4 c for one hour before quantifying the recovered quantities of virus after sample processing spiking samples with a human coronavirus with low pathogenicity such as hcov 229e as a recovery control gundy et al 2009 was desirable but not practical due to the relative difficulty of its procurement in canada at the time of this study and the difficulty of propagating coronaviruses in vitro vsv is an enveloped single stranded negative sense rna virus belonging to the rhabdoviridae family genus vesiculovirus letchworth et al 1999 the rna genomes of both vsv and sars cov 2 are encapsulated by a lipid envelope and their particle sizes are similar with vsv ranging from 70 200 nm cureton et al 2010 and sars cov 2 being approximately 100 nm supplemental fig s2 bar on et al 2020 it was reasoned that these similar biophysical characteristics lipid envelope and particle size would lead both viruses to associate with wastewater matrices and to be precipitated with peg with similar efficiencies to maximize safety of the method vsv was heat inactivated at 55 c for five minutes prior to use supplemental fig s3 recovery efficiency was quantified twice during this study following procedures similar to those outlined in annex g of iso 15216 1 2017 iso 2017 lowther et al 2019 randazzo et al 2020 vsv was quantified via rt ddpcr for both pgs and pcs from triplicate serial dilutions of 5 5 104 5 5 105 5 5 106 and 5 5 107 copies vsv µl of inactivated stock vsv culture spiked into the collected pgs samples and the pcs samples throughout the study quantified quantities were not corrected for process extraction efficiency or for pcr inhibition three pcs and pgs samples were each spiked with 10 µl aliquots of 5 5 104 5 5 105 5 5 106 and 5 5 107 copies µl these samples were directly concentrated extracted and quantified using rt qpcr the probes and primers used are listed in supplemental table s3 the vsv recovery efficiency mean and standard deviation was calculated based on the number of copies quantified using rt qpcr the equation for the calculations is as follows 1 v

for normalization analysis of variance was used to identify biomarkers with low variability and higher temporal consistency the analysis of variance was conducted on 30 pgs and pcs samples over a period of 55 days between april 8th 2020 and june 2nd 2020 the samples were analyzed for the following three internal normalization biomarkers i human microbiome specific hf183 bacteroides 16s ribosomal rrna ii eukaryotic 18s rrna and iii pmmov the three fecal content markers evaluated in this study for normalization of sars cov 2 signal are all specific to humans and are detectable via probe based qpcr the 16s rrna marker is expressed in gut resident hf183 bacteroides and has been previously detected in human feces and wastewater bernhard and field 2000 green et al 2014 18s rrna is expressed in human cells pmmov is a stable plant virus that is endemic in both sweet and hot pepper crops across the world and is shed in human feces following ingestion from pepper containing foods rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 importantly unlike other enteric viruses that could be used as a fecal marker pmmov levels do not depend on active infection 2 7 rt qpcr preliminary testing of samples with the cdc n1 n2 and n3 primer probe sets and the sarbeco e gene primer probe set supplemental table s3 demonstrated best detection and least variance in technical replicates with the cdc n1

at 95 c 10 s then 60 c 30 s respectively serial dilutions of the viral rna standard were run on every 96 well pcr plate to produce standard curves used to quantify the copies of sars cov 2 genes in addition rt ddpcr quantified pooled samples of rna template were serial diluted and utilized to construct standard curves for pmmov normalization biomarker when rna signal was normalized by the concentration of pmmov additionally rt qpcr runs were validated with the use of non template controls ntcs positive controls negative controls of pre covid 19 pandemic wastewater samples and dilutions the limit of detection of the rt qpcr assay was determined for n1 and n2 gene regions by determining the number of copies per reaction which corresponds to a detection rate of 95 5 false negatives as recommended by the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 furthermore samples were discarded if they did not meet the following conditions i standard curves with r2 0 95 ii copies reaction are in linear dynamic range of the curve and iii primer efficiency between 90 130 furthermore sample replicates with values greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean of the triplicates were also identified as possible anomalies in this study and discarded 2 8 rt ddpcr singleplex probe based one step rt ddpcr 1 step rt ddpcr advanced kit for probes bio rad hercules ca was used for absolute quantification

for 30 minutes droplets were then read using a qx200 droplet reader bio rad hercules ca positive droplets were called manually and absolute quantification was performed using quantasoft analysis pro v 1 0 bio rad hercules ca the limit of detection of the rt ddpcr assay was determined for n1 and n2 gene regions by determining the number of copies per reaction which corresponds to a detection rate of 95 5 false negatives as recommended by the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 3 statistical analysis in order to test for significant differences between data sets comparing the detection of sars cov 2 in pgs and pcs samples chi square and fisher s exact test statistical analyses were conducted using graphpad s prism 8 3 software la jolla ca a student s t test was used to test for statistical differences between detection of rna in rt qpcr and rt ddpcr assays for pgs and pcs a student s t test and pearson s correlation analyses were performed to test for significance and the strength of the correlation between rna signal and epidemiological data with a p value of 0 05 or lower signifying significance 4 results discussion 4 1 viral rna recovery efficiency the recovery through the concentration and extraction steps was quantified by spiking samples with serial dilutions of inactivated vsv the percent recoveries for vsv spiked in pgs and pcs were 8 4 3 6 and 9 3 4 9 respectively determined by testing 30 samples the recovery of the surrogate virus through both pcs and pgs concentration and extraction was similar with all spiked in quantities other recent studies investigating surrogate virus recoveries following similar peg concentration reported variable results for various surrogates 6 recovery of murine hepatitis virus mhv ye et al 2016 along with reported recoveries of 33 3 15 6 and 57 of escherichia virus ms2 ms2 by balboa et al 2020 preprint and kumar et al 2020 other concentration methods have also been used such as ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation 20 to 33 5 recovery efficiency of mhv ahmed et al 2020b ye et al 2016 and aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation 30 4 11 0 recovery of mengovirus mgv medema et al 2020 it is important to recognize that each study used slightly different methods and viral surrogates making it difficult to make direct comparisons and generalizations lu et al 2020 michael kordatou et al 2020 each surrogate virus will differ in how it interacts with wastewater and this may also be dependent on the characteristics of the wastewater as well as the properties of the virus fragment that may have very different partitioning degradation characteristics it is unclear yet how effective filtration based concentration techniques perform with high solid samples especially with viruses that are highly associated with solids when analyzing high solids containing samples such as pgs and pcs peg precipitation or other flocculation approaches may be more effective due to an incompatibility of this matrix with ultrafiltration due to possible complication associated with membrane clogging fumian et al 2010 lu et al 2020 the advantages of using pgs and pcs which may have a greater and more consistent rna signal should be balanced against the apparent lower recovery of peg precipitation additional studies are needed to develop and assess appropriate and effective methods and surrogates for analysis of sars cov 2 in wastewaters 4 2 comparison of rt qpcr and rt ddpcr for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna this study tested the detection and quantification of rt ddpcr and rt qpcr for sars cov 2 rna signal in pgs and pcs samples the in vitro transcribed rna was observed to be reliably detected with primer probe rt ddpcr assays to a limit of detection of 5 copies reaction in both n1 and n2 rt ddpcr assays this is consistent with the purported high sensitivity of the digital pcr technology in vitro transcribed viral rna was detected to a limit of detection of 2 copies reaction in both the n1 and n2 rt qpcr assays using the high sensitivity bio rad one step reliance supermix bio rad hercules ca which was unexpected when comparing to the rt ddpcr limit of detection standard curves utilized for the quantification of different rna targets for rt qpcr are as follows n1 slope 3 372 intercept 38 184 r2 0 972 e 97 96 n2 slope 3 179 intercept 37 870 r2 0 954 e 106 32 pmmov slope 2 806 intercept 39 142 r2 0 968 e 127 17 and vsv slope 3 518 intercept 39 846 r2 0 995 e 92 41 the standard curves demonstrate good linearity for rt qpcr in a range between 2 to 60 copies reaction for n1 and n2 1 4 102 to 3 6 104 copies reaction for pmmov and 1 6 100 to 1 6 104 copies reaction for vsv a comparison was performed between the one step rt qpcr and rt ddpcr using the same singleplex n1 probe primer set for the quantification of sars cov 2 in solids rich low concentration sars cov 2 rna signal wastewaters fig 3 six pgs samples and five pcs samples were analyzed using rt qpcr and rt ddpcr all samples were collected from the two cities during the same low incidence periods 60 active cases 100 000 people case number study period allowing the assessment of quantification and degree of variability in samples with low rna concentrations the mean and standard error of the pgs samples analyzed during the same period of low incidence cases are 133 4 9 0 and 167 1 25 6 n1 gene copies 100 µl of extracted rna for rt ddpcr and rt qpcr respectively meanwhile the mean and standard error of the pcs samples are 33 5 5 8 and 130 4 20 8 gene copies 100 µl of extracted rna for rt ddpcr and rt qpcr respectively fig 3 although a significant decrease in detected copies for pcs samples with rt ddpcr is observed it is noted that the coefficient of variation cv for the ddpcr assay 38 4 compared to qpcr 35 7 while the cv for pgs samples for the ddpcr assay is lower 16 5 compared to qpcr 37 5 the difference in quantification of the pcs samples between the n1 rt qpcr and rt ddpcr assays suggests inhibition of the reverse transcription and or polymerase chain reaction of the pcs sample given that this assay partitions the sample volume into approximately 1 nl droplets it s conceivable that the effective concentration of any rt and or pcr inhibitors present in the pcs matrix are markedly increased in contrast rt qpcr is performed in a non partitioned assay volume and may thus be less sensitive to inhibition the apparent inhibition in ddpcr may also be explained by differences in the reagents used for the rt ddpcr and rt qpcr assays the inhibition resistance inhibitor removal of the high sensitivity rt qpcr reagent appears to provide better detection when utilized in pegged sludge matrices quantification of two fold and five fold dilutions of pcs samples was performed and support the theory that rt ddpcr was likely inhibited rt qpcr shows good quantification of diluted samples while rt ddpcr suffered from inhibition these findings contradict the theoretical assumption that rt ddpcr is less prone to inhibition due to relative insensitivity to differences in amplification efficiencies due to its binary all or nothing reporting of amplification salipante and jerome 2020 however at least one report found that undiluted raw wastewater inhibits one step rt ddpcr amplification of pmmov rna to the same degree as the rt qpcr assay rački et al 2014 given that rna in both pgs and pcs samples was at a very low concentration approaching the limits of detection it is highly likely that inhibitors in the pcs matrix are responsible for the decreased sensitivity observed in rt qpcr vs rt ddpcr of note it was also attempted in this study to use a commercially available multiplex rt ddpcr assay that employs primer probe sets amplifying n1 n2 and n3 regions of the viral n rna as well as a human transcript sars cov 2 bio rad however it was determined that the discrimination between positive and negative droplets fluorescence amplitude was poor making quantitative analysis impossible rt ddpcr has a myriad of theoretical advantages such as absolute quantification that is not dependent on calibration curves insensitivity to common pcr inhibitors and the ability to multiplex salipante and jerome 2020 there is a need to explore this further in future studies and to optimize these methods and quantification techniques for wastewater samples however based on the better detection using the current rt qpcr approach this method was utilized for the remainder of this study to quantify sars cov 2 in both pgs and pcs solids from the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs 4 3 detection and variance of sars cov 2 viral rna in pgs and pcs in this study the sensitivity and variability of the rt qpcr assay in pgs and pcs was compared by investigating the percentage of sample replicates with replicates including repeated rna extraction step and pcr quantification samples along with technical triplicates the limit of detection used in the study for rt qpcr assays is described above replicate runs 24 paired pgs and pcs samples for a total of 72 technical replicates each were collected on the same dates across 83 days pcs samples collected and analyzed at the same time as pgs samples over a 3 month period exhibited stronger percent detection for n1 92 7 for pcs compared to 79 2 for pgs p 0 007 and n2 90 6 for pcs compared to 82 3 for pgs p 0 092 fig 4 variance in percent detection of pcs was shown to be similar for all samples with coefficients of variation ranging from 29 1 to 31 7 the decreased sensitivity of sars cov 2 detection in pgs samples could be due to the increased susceptibility of solid particulate matter in this wastewater fraction to daily fluctuations in flowrate and wastewater biochemical characteristics at the wrrfs compared to the sludge samples collected in the primary clarifier stream in addition the pgs samples undergo a laboratory settling step in this study to isolate the settled solids from the liquid fraction of the sample this additional step which is not applied to the pcs samples may also contributes to the lower percent detection of sars cov 2 signal of these samples due to increased holding times and processing times as such the result of this study confirms pcs samples as the high solids samples that demonstrate an elevated frequency of detection of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 rna in municipal wastewaters during decreasing and low incidence of community covid 19 alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 balboa et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 in addition it is noted that the viral rna longitudinal trendline from the pgs samples did not show strong correlation with either the trendline from the pcs samples or municipal epidemiological data further supporting pcs sampling as the more robust basis for community covid 19 monitoring in wastewater solids 4 4 variability of normalization biomarkers a multitude of systematic variations exist in molecular wastewater surveillance that makes it challenging to accurately measure sars cov 2 rna across days months and years these include but are not limited to diurnal variation in plant flow changes in gross proportions of solids sample collection and storage sample processing and sample analysis due to these factors a critical aspect of wastewater epidemiology is sample normalization armanious et al 2016 the necessity to normalize sars cov 2 rna data has also been identified in more recent studies alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 kaplan et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 wu et al 2020 to compare the variability and temporal consistency of biomarkers in this study 8 pcs samples 24 including technical triplicates were analyzed using rt qpcr for all three biomarker gene regions human specific hf183 bacteroides 16s rrna human eukaryotic 18s rrna and pmmov all three tested biomarkers were detected in pcs samples with a relatively high level of expression ct values 30 compared to the incidence of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 fig 5 a while all three biomarker targets were detected in pcs samples it was observed that the distribution of their expression i e quantified through an analysis of variance var in fig 5 of the fecal biomarker pmmov was lower compared to the 16s and 18s biomarkers in pcs samples fig 5a date correlated sars cov 2 ct values are also shown for reference fig 5 the lower variability of pmmov ct variance 1 18 compared to 16s ct variance 5 32 and 18s ct variance 5 12 may be due to the relative toughness and stability of the virus in difficult environments kitajima et al 2018 the lower variability of pmmov detection was also similar to the lower variability of the sars cov 2 n1 and n2 data set furthermore the viral fragments of the pmmov biomarker may preferentially adhere to the solids fraction of wastewaters via electrostatic and or hydrophobic effects armanious et al 2016 additionally in order to quantify the variance of the normalization biomarkers in this study the samples run this comparison were also verified across each surveyed wrrf independently fig 5b the pmmov internal normalization biomarker shows an improved consistency and lower variability maximum change in ct δct 0 01 between the wrrfs compared to 16s δct 1 47 and 18s δct 2 30 which demonstrates a relative steady signal between differing wrrfs due to the consistency of the pmmov fecal biomarker in the pcs samples across 55 days of sampling pmmov was utilized in this study as a sars cov 2 n1 and n2 rna internal control for pcs samples the low variance of pmmov in pcs coupled with the use of pmmov as an internal normalization biomarker was also recently reported by wu et al 2020 it is noted that for the purpose of using pmmov as a normalization factor it was always diluted 1 10 in pure water in order to ensure it remained in the quantifiable range of the pmmov standard curve 4 5 quantification of sars cov 2 viral rna in pcs and correlation with covid 19 case data as pcs was identified as the solids rich sample showing the highest rna detection rate sars cov 2 rna was measured in pcs samples from ottawa and gatineau wrrfs between april 1st and june 30th 2020 this sampling period encompasses a decreasing covid 19 prevalence in two cities peaks of 56 7 and 57 3 confirmed cases 100k inhabitants in ottawa and gatineau respectively as well as an ensuing period of low prevalence characterized by many days with low new daily reported cases 56 7 4 8 and 57 3 10 2 confirmed cases 100k inhabitants in ottawa and gatineau respectively in addition to the technical triplicates of each sample five of the 14 samples in ottawa were re extracted and re quantified via rt qpcr in gatineau four of the 8 samples were re extracted and re quantified via rt qpcr two distinct but complementary normalization approaches were applied to the observed sars cov 2 rna signal to account for variations in wrrf wastewater flow composition and treatment along with temperature time variations in travel and storage along with human errors in the processing of the samples in particular this study normalizes the rna signal for i the wrrf mass flux of solids in the sampled primary clarifier stream and ii the pmmov internal normalization biomarker expression the sars cov 2 viral rna copies l and the normalized viral data are benchmarked against and correlated to epidemiological metrics provided by the ottawa public health agency and the regional public health agency of the city of gatineau three epidemiological data sets based on clinical testing were identified by the local public health agencies as best estimates of covid 19 prevalence in the two cities i daily new cases of covid 19 ii active cases of covid 19 based on an active period of fourteen days and iii percent positive of total daily reported clinical covid 19 tests performed two key factors limitations are noted with respect to these epidemiological data sets shown in this study firstly the testing at the onset of the pandemic march and april 2020 was variable and low in both cities due to limitations in human resources laboratory reagents and testing equipment hence the first four weeks of the twelve week period for which wastewater samples were profiled were subject to variable and lower testing rates per day that likely under reported both the number of new cases and active cases during this period secondly early testing screening was less available to the general population in both cities with testing heavily biased towards hospitalized patients and health care workers this potentially artificially inflates the percent positive data during the first four weeks of the study with the effect on the percent positive being likely lesser than the effect of limited testing on the total case numbers 4 5 1 sars cov 2 rna in pcs and correlation with covid 19 case data the average and standard deviation of technical triplicates and extraction replicates that repeated the concentration extraction and rt qpcr steps shown as error bars in figs 6 and 7 for the longitudinal viral rna data sets in this study are plotted along with a percent positive and seven day floating average percent positive epidemiological data sets due to limited testing during the first four weeks of the longitudinal study percent positive was identified as a potentially useful epidemiological metric of covid 19 prevalence to compare to sars cov 2 rna measurements in wastewater as such this metric is included in figs 6 and 7 to be benchmarked against the measured sars cov 2 signal n1 and n2 rna signal is first expressed in copies l of pcs in this study figs 6a and 7a equivalent volumes of pcs were peg concentrated and rna extracted throughout the sampling period as expected and similar to other studies investigating primary sludge and wastewater solids the raw copies l data sets for the two cities figs 6a and 7a are relatively noisy with no clear trend observed medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the observed concentrations in this study 1 7 103 to 7 8 104 copies l ottawa and 6 6 104 to 3 8 105 copies l gatineau are in agreement with other studies investigating sars cov 2 rna viral signal in pcs concentration ranges of 1 7 106 to 4 6 108 copies l 1 104 to 4 104 copies l and 1 2 104 to 4 0 104 copies l have been reported in pcs by alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 balboa et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 respectively note that these studies all used protocols with peg concentration that are similar to this study although the n1 and n2 rna gene regions show similar longitudinal trends to each other in both the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs figs 6a and 7a the inherent variations in signal results in noise making it difficult to identify real changes in viral signal in particular this is seen in the large amplitudes of the standard deviations of many data points in the longitudinal data sets of ottawa and gatineau the noise in the rna data may be caused by inherent weather induced random variations in wastewater biochemical characteristics solid composition and flowrate e g due to weather changes in daily household water consumption etc as well as potentially significant effects associated with the collection and transport of the samples and rna concentration extraction and analysis the copies l longitudinal data in ottawa and gatineau clearly demonstrate that sars cov 2 quantification in wastewater is inherently noisy and hence normalization of the data should be explored no significant correlation between n1 and n2 at either the ottawa wrrf or the gatineau wrrf is observed across the study time period table 1 strong and significant correlation would have suggested that sars cov 2 rna might be intact in pcs prior to concentration and extraction which is not herein observed in this study critically when comparing either n1 or n2 copies l to each of the epidemiological metrics daily cases active cases and percent positive it appears that in ottawa no correlation exists between the n1 or n2 rna copies l signal and any of the three epidemiological metrics meanwhile in gatineau significant correlations exist between the n1 and n2 copies l signal and epidemiological data sets with the strongest correlations being observed with the number of active cases table 1 4 5 2 mass flux of primary clarified sludge copies sars cov 2 rna per day and correlation with covid 19 case data to correct for systematic variability the first normalization approach applied in this study is to normalize the n1 and n2 rna signal to both the mass of the peg concentrated solids subject to nucleic acid extraction and also the daily mass flux mass of volatile solids vs solids through the primary clarifier stream per day at each wrrf figs 6b and 7b this normalization approach results in units of n1 and n2 copies day as a solids mass flux basis through the wrrf this normalization approach is intended to compensate for variations in solids concentration and flowrate in the primary clarifier stream at the wrrf due to weather effects precipitation and infiltration inflow in the sewers it is noted that no correlation was observed between n1 and n2 rna signal and bod mass flux tss mass flux or influent flow rate at the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs hence normalization of rna signal with these parameters are not herein shown the lack of correlation between rna signal and these parameters in this study are likely due to the sampling location used in this study as primary clarified sludge is less susceptible to influent mass flux and flow rate variations when comparing longitudinal plots in ottawa of copies l fig 6a to copies d fig 6b the variance of the solids mass flux normalized data set of copies d does not appear to have been significantly reduced the systemic noise of the copies l data sets similar findings are observed for the gatineau normalized data fig 7a and b the substantial noise maintained in the solids mass flux normalized data sets of the two cities and the significantly large standard deviations of longitudinal data points indicates that the fluctuations associated with the solids concentration and flowrate in the primary clarifier stream was likely not a dominant source of the inherent variance in the copies l data sets as observed for the copies l data the correlation between the n1 and n2 data sets were not significant for either ottawa or gatineau further the normalization of the n1 and n2 data for solids mass flux at the wrrfs appear to worsen correlations with anticorrelations increasing for all three epidemiological metrics in ottawa and gatineau table 2 this lack of impact when normalizing operational mass flux of solids at the two wrrfs in this study is likely due to the fact that both wrrfs directly control the flow of the primary clarifier stream at their respective facilities hence reducing the variation in the flux of solids and in turn minimizing the impact of this variation in wrrf operation on the n1 and n2 signal thus systematic variation in the data sets are likely associated with the sample collection and storage along with rna concentration extraction and analysis steps performed in the study 4 5 3 pmmov normalized sars cov 2 rna in pcs and correlation with covid 19 case data pmmov is the most abundant human fecal rna virus kitajima et al 2018 and has been previously proposed as a biomarker for fecal contamination in water hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 pmmov has also more recently been used as an internal reference for sars cov 2 in wastewater wu et al 2020 the second normalization approach applied in this study is the division of the rna n1 and n2 copies by pmmov copies due to its low variability and high expression in pcs pmmov was identified as the preferred internal reference of the three tested biomarkers tested in this study pmmov normalization appears to sufficiently reduce background noise associated with systematic variations in the ottawa and gatineau wrrf rna signals that are possibly associated with the collection and transport of the samples along with the rna concentration extraction and analysis steps of pcs rna signal during decreasing and low incidence periods of covid 19 disease in this study figs 6c and 7c in particular the amplitude of the standard deviation associated with each data point in the longitudinal data sets of ottawa and gatineau decreased this increase in precision ultimately allows for greater distinction between low incidence data points hence enabling improved identification of trends in the data sets correlation between the pmmov normalized n1 and n2 signals remained insignificant in ottawa and gatineau table 1 however this normalization approach also outlines strong significant and positive correlations between both the n1 and the n2 gene regions with all three epidemiological data sets in ottawa the strongest correlation between n1 and n2 pmmov normalized rna signal is observed with the 7 day rolling average percent positive epidemiological metric in ottawa although the percent positive data during the first four weeks of the study may be biased towards hospitalized patients and health care worker testing this clinical testing metric in ottawa is identified as the preferred metric by the public health unit of the city for the reasons described above as such decreasing the systematic variation in the data sets via pmmov normalization establishes a modified trend of the rna signal and this trend shows the strongest correlation of the rna signal to city s identified preferred epidemiological metric strong significant and positive correlation is also shown between the n1 pmmov normalized rna signal with the active cases epidemiologic metric in gatineau while the n2 pmmov normalized signal shows moderate significant correlation to the active cases although the pmmov normalized gatineau rna signal data shows agreement with the active cases epidemiological metric results were varied when correlated to daily cases and 7 day rolling average percent positive the strongest correlation observed in this study for the gatineau rna signal and the epidemiological metrics of the city exists between both the n1 and n2 copies l rna signal and the active cases it is also noted that the longitudinal trends in n1 and n2 pmmov signals in gatineau are similar to those in ottawa this is expected as the two cities are geographically close with many inhabitants travelling across bridges between the cities the observed differences in correlations between sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater to clinical testing metrics in the two neighboring cities of this study is illustrative of the challenges associated with interpreting and correlating rna signal acquired from distinct wrrfs to clinical testing metrics acquired from distinct health agencies 5 conclusion this study is the first investigation and detection of sars cov 2 trends in wastewater in canada it identifies primary clarified sludge as a preferred solids rich sample compared to post grit solids for the detection of sars cov 2 signal during decreasing and low incidence of viral load in communities based on the reagents used in this study rt qpcr shows superior quantification of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 gene region signal in primary clarified sludge compared to rt ddpcr finally it is demonstrated that pmmov is a potential effective normalization biomarker for rna signal to reduce noise inherent to the wrrf operation along with the sampling transport and processing of the samples the normalization of n1 and n2 sars cov 2 signal using pmmov enables strong correlation to

17458,in the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent covid 19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health care improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections through measuring trends of rna signal in wastewater systems in this study sars cov 2 viral rna n1 and n2 gene regions are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids pgs and primary clarified sludge pcs in two water resource recovery facilities wrrf serving canada s national capital region i e the city of ottawa on pop 1 1m and the city of gatineau qc pop 280k pcs samples show signal inhibition using rt ddpcr compared to rt qpcr with pgs samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of rna using both assays rt qpcr shows higher frequency of detection of n1 and n2 gene regions in pcs 92 7 90 6 n 6 as compared to pgs samples 79 2 82 3 n 5 sampling of pcs may therefore be an effective approach for sars cov 2 viral quantification especially during periods of declining and low covid 19 incidence in the community the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov is determined to have a less variable rna signal in pcs over a three month period for two wrrfs regardless of environmental conditions compared to bacteroides 16s rrna or human 18s rrna making pmmov a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of sars cov 2 signal pmmov normalized pcs rna

around the world detection of sars cov 2 rna in nasopharyngeal np swab specimens by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr is the standard diagnostic test to confirm covid 19 accurately measuring the prevalence of covid 19 in many countries has been complicated by limited and or biased np testing targeting symptomatic groups and an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infectious period in a significant proportion of cases long et al 2020 pan et al 2020 additional detection tools are thus desirable to mitigate these challenges and provide public health agencies and government s new metrics to help guide their implementation of societal restrictions daughton 2009 hill et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 recent systematic reviews and meta analyses of the current peer reviewed and preprint literature confirm fecal sars cov 2 viral rna detection in roughly half of covid 19 patients gupta et al 2020 parasa et al 2020 moreover a systematic review and meta analysis of sars cov 2 viral rna detection profiles in several different types of covid 19 patient specimens found that positive detection rates were higher in rectal and sputum swabs than in the commonly used np swab bwire et al 2020 these data provide a clear rationale to probe wastewater for sars cov 2 rna medema et al 2020 first reported the detection of sars cov 2 viral rna in wastewater from wrrfs located in seven different cities in the netherlands sars cov 2 viral rna has subsequently been identified and is being monitored at numerous wrrfs around the world ahmed et al 2020a

surveillance programs for sars cov 2 as a viral tracking tool to complement existing public health metrics there are also early and promising indications from several research groups that wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 might be predictive providing earlier warning of community outbreak than current np based pcr diagnostics although studies reported some success in the detection and even

to date this study investigates and optimizes the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater influent solids post grit solids pgs and primary clarified sludge pcs in two municipal wrrfs serving ottawa

prevalence using both rt qpcr and rt droplet digital dd pcr rigorous quality control metrics are applied to compare the detection sensitivity of viral n1 and n2 rna in pgs compared to pcs using two different established primer probe sets furthermore the study tests the human microbiome specific hf183 bacteroides 16s ribosomal rna rrna human 18s rrna and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov rna as reliable and robust nucleic acid normalization fecal biomarkers that can be used to control systematic noise associated with variances in wrrf daily operations sampling storage processing and analysis of the samples finally the study compares and correlates biomarker normalized longitudinal data sets of the two municipalities with epidemiological metrics to evaluate the usefulness of sars cov 2 viral measurements in wastewater as a complimentary tool to clinical testing in a community during decreasing and low covid 19 incidence 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the city of ottawa and gatineau wrrfs post grit chamber influent solids and primary clarified sludge samples were collected from the city of ottawa s robert o pickard environmental centre ontario and the city of gatineau quebec water resource recovery facilities wrrfs the two facilities are located across the ottawa river from each other in the national capital region of canada fig 1 the two wrrfs service over 1 3 million people or approximately 3 7 of canada s total population the sewershed of the city of ottawa wrrf services approximately 1 1m people and the sewershed of the city of gatineau wrrf services approximately 280k people ottawa and gatineau wrrfs are designed and operated as conventional activated sludge treatment systems supplementary table 1 the grit chambers of both facilities where a portion of the samples are collected in this study are located toward the front of both wrrf treatment trains and are fed by coarse and fine screened wastewaters the grit chambers of both facilities subsequently feed the primary clarifiers where remaining portion of the samples are collected in this study the hydraulic residence time of the ottawa sewershed ranges from 2 hours to 35 hours with an average residence time of approximately 12 hours in comparison the hydraulic residence time of gatineau s sewershed ranges from 2 hours to 7 hours with an average of approximately 4 hours 2 2 wastewater sampling and analysis 2 2 1 pgs samples fourteen and nine 24 hour composite pgs samples were analyzed from the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs respectively between april 1st and june 30th 2020 clean 250 ml hdpe sampling bottles were sanitized with a 10 bleach solution and then washed with rnase awaytm thermofisher ottawa canada rinsed with deionized water and sealed the pgs samples in this study are collected in the stream exiting the grit chambers these samples have large debris removed via screens as was the dense grit via the grit chamber a bio banked wastewater influent sample from a nearby wrrf collected in august 2019 was utilized as a sars cov 2 negative control supplemental fig s1 250 ml hourly composite samples were collected over a 24 hour period for a total of 6 l using an isco autosampler hoskin scientific burlington canada that collects directly from the exit stream of the grit chamber units at both facilities the samples in the isco autosamplers were maintained at approximately 4 c during sampling with the frequent addition of ice with a maximum recorded temperature of 7 c across the study starting in june the isco autosamplers were linked to refrigerators allowing the samples to be kept at temperatures of approximately 2 c immediately upon collection the harvested samples were transported from the wrrfs to the laboratory in coolers packed on ice and were immediately refrigerated at 4 c for a maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis 2 2 2 pcs samples for the first 55 days of the study between april 1st and june 30th 2020 grab samples of pcs were collected every second week at the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs these sludge samples were harvested from the primary sludge streams in the two facilities at the manifold where the primary clarified sludge that exits all primary clarifiers was mixed into a single stream from day 56 onward with the stronger rna signal detected in pcs samples as compared to pgs samples 24 hour composite pcs samples were collected by plant process technicians every other day at the ottawa facility the 24 hour composite samples collected at the ottawa wrrf were comprised of four grab samples collected every 6 hours upon collection samples were stored on site at the ottawa facility at 4 c in a refrigerator until mixed to form daily 24 hour composite samples and transported on ice to the laboratory the subsequent day all samples were stored at 4 c at the laboratory and processed within 6 hours of arrival samples which could not immediately be analyzed were stored at 4 c for a maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis in the laboratory meanwhile in gatineau an isco autosampler was linked to a refrigerator and was connected to a pcs sampling port the autosampler collected hourly grab samples of 250 ml which were subsequently mixed to form a 24 hour composite sample due to the size differences of the two facilities in this study and the available resources at the two facilities during the covid 19 pandemic in canada the gatineau facility sampling frequency was limited to a maximum of once a week as opposed to every second day as was performed at the larger ottawa facility the 24 hour composite samples were collected and transported on ice to the laboratory as outlined for the ottawa samples 2 2 3 wastewater quality characterization of samples the following pgs and pcs sample

on partitioned 24 hour composite pgs samples to identify fractions with sars cov 2 rna positivity fig 2 the 6 l 24 hour composite pgs samples were first settled at 4 c for an hour the supernatant was subsequently decanted and serially filtered through a 1 5 µm glass fiber filter gff followed by a 0 45 µm gf6 mixed cellulose ester mce filter filtrate fraction an eluate fraction was then collected by passing 32 ml of elution buffer 0 05 m kh2po4 1 0 m nacl 0 1 v v triton x 100 ph 9 2 through the spent filters each of the three fractions were subsequently peg concentrated and extracted and analyzed for sars cov 2 rna to concentrate viral particles nucleic acids and proteins 32 ml of pgs or pcs was precipitated with polyethylene glycol peg 8000 at a final concentration of 80 g l and 0 3m g l nacl ph 7 3 and in a final volume of 40 ml comelli et al 2008 petterson et al 2015 samples were then agitated at 4 c on an orbital shaker set at 160 rpm for a period of 12 to 17 hours then centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 45 minutes at 4 c the supernatant was decanted being careful to preserve any pellet samples were then centrifuged a second time at 10 000 x g for another 10 minutes and the remaining supernatant decanted the resulting pcs and pgs pellets were transferred to a new rnase free centrifuge tube and frozen at 80 c until rna extraction 2 4 rna extraction viral rna was extracted from pgs and pcs samples using the rneasy powermicrobiome kit qiagen germantown md with the following deviations from the manufacturer s recommended protocol i 200 mg of sample pellet was added to the initial extraction step in place of 200 µl of liquid sample and ii the optional phenol chloroform mixture addition to the lysis buffer was substituted with trizol ls reagent thermofisher ottawa canada to maximize lysis of cells virion encapsulated fragments and protect rna prior to vortexing and centrifugation the resulting aqueous phase of the lysis procedure was then retained and processed as per the recommended protocol including the on column enzymatic dna removal step rna was eluted in 100 µl of rnase free water 2 5 viral recovery efficiency an important metric in the quantification of viral signal in wastewater is the process recovery efficiency for targets of interest as it facilitates a comparison of results from study to study even if different sample processing or extraction methodologies techniques are used in this study the efficiency of virus recovery following the fractionation peg concentration and rna extraction process was determined by spiking vesicular stomatitis virus vsv hoang et al 2019 into the sample and letting it mix at 4 c for one hour before quantifying the recovered quantities of virus after sample processing spiking samples with a human coronavirus with low pathogenicity such as hcov 229e as a recovery control gundy et al 2009 was desirable but not practical due to the relative difficulty of its procurement in canada at the time of this study and the difficulty of propagating coronaviruses in vitro vsv is an enveloped single stranded negative sense rna virus belonging to the rhabdoviridae family genus vesiculovirus letchworth et al 1999 the rna genomes of both vsv and sars cov 2 are encapsulated by a lipid envelope and their particle sizes are similar with vsv ranging from 70 200 nm cureton et al 2010 and sars cov 2 being approximately 100 nm supplemental fig s2 bar on et al 2020 it was reasoned that these similar biophysical characteristics lipid envelope and particle size would lead both viruses to associate with wastewater matrices and to be precipitated with peg with similar efficiencies to maximize safety of the method vsv was heat inactivated at 55 c for five minutes prior to use supplemental fig s3 recovery efficiency was quantified twice during this study following procedures similar to those outlined in annex g of iso 15216 1 2017 iso 2017 lowther et al 2019 randazzo et al 2020 vsv was quantified via rt ddpcr for both pgs and pcs from triplicate serial dilutions of 5 5 104 5 5 105 5 5 106 and 5 5 107 copies vsv µl of inactivated stock vsv culture spiked into the collected pgs samples and the pcs samples throughout the study quantified quantities were not corrected for process extraction efficiency or for pcr inhibition three pcs and pgs samples were each spiked with 10 µl aliquots of 5 5 104 5 5 105 5 5 106 and 5 5 107 copies µl these samples were directly concentrated extracted and quantified using rt qpcr the probes and primers used are listed in supplemental table s3 the vsv recovery efficiency mean and standard deviation was calculated based on the number of copies quantified using rt qpcr the equation for the calculations is as follows 1 v

for normalization analysis of variance was used to identify biomarkers with low variability and higher temporal consistency the analysis of variance was conducted on 30 pgs and pcs samples over a period of 55 days between april 8th 2020 and june 2nd 2020 the samples were analyzed for the following three internal normalization biomarkers i human microbiome specific hf183 bacteroides 16s ribosomal rrna ii eukaryotic 18s rrna and iii pmmov the three fecal content markers evaluated in this study for normalization of sars cov 2 signal are all specific to humans and are detectable via probe based qpcr the 16s rrna marker is expressed in gut resident hf183 bacteroides and has been previously detected in human feces and wastewater bernhard and field 2000 green et al 2014 18s rrna is expressed in human cells pmmov is a stable plant virus that is endemic in both sweet and hot pepper crops across the world and is shed in human feces following ingestion from pepper containing foods rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 importantly unlike other enteric viruses that could be used as a fecal marker pmmov levels do not depend on active infection 2 7 rt qpcr preliminary testing of

addition rt ddpcr quantified pooled samples of rna template were serial diluted and utilized to construct standard curves for pmmov normalization biomarker when rna signal was normalized by the concentration of pmmov additionally rt qpcr runs were validated with the use of non template controls ntcs positive controls negative controls of pre covid 19 pandemic wastewater samples and dilutions the limit of detection of the rt qpcr assay was determined for n1 and n2 gene regions by determining the number of copies per reaction which corresponds to a detection rate of 95 5 false negatives as recommended by the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 furthermore samples were discarded if they did not meet the following conditions i standard curves with r2 0 95 ii copies reaction are in linear dynamic range of the curve and iii primer efficiency between 90 130 furthermore sample replicates with values greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean of the triplicates were also identified

95 5 false negatives as recommended by the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 3 statistical analysis in order to test for significant differences between data sets comparing the detection of sars cov 2 in pgs and pcs samples chi square and fisher s exact test statistical analyses were conducted using graphpad s prism 8 3 software la jolla ca a student s t test was used to test for statistical differences between detection of rna in rt qpcr and rt ddpcr assays for pgs and pcs a student s t test and pearson s correlation analyses were performed to test for significance and the strength of the correlation between rna signal and epidemiological data with a p value of 0 05 or lower signifying significance 4 results discussion 4 1 viral rna recovery efficiency the recovery through the concentration and extraction steps was quantified by spiking samples with serial dilutions of inactivated vsv the percent recoveries for vsv spiked in pgs and pcs were 8 4 3 6 and 9 3 4 9 respectively determined by testing 30 samples the recovery of the surrogate virus through both pcs and pgs concentration and extraction was similar with all spiked in quantities other recent studies investigating surrogate virus recoveries following similar peg concentration reported variable results for various surrogates 6 recovery of murine hepatitis virus mhv ye et al 2016 along with reported recoveries of 33 3 15 6 and 57 of escherichia virus ms2 ms2 by balboa et al 2020 preprint and kumar et al 2020 other concentration methods have also been used such as ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation 20 to 33 5 recovery efficiency of mhv ahmed et al 2020b ye et al 2016 and aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation 30 4 11 0 recovery of mengovirus mgv medema et al 2020 it is important to recognize that each study used slightly different methods and viral surrogates making it difficult to make direct comparisons and generalizations lu et al 2020 michael kordatou et al 2020 each surrogate virus will differ in how it interacts with wastewater and this may also be dependent on the characteristics of the wastewater as well as the properties of the virus fragment that may have very different partitioning degradation characteristics it is unclear yet how effective filtration based concentration techniques perform with high solid samples especially with viruses that are highly associated with solids when analyzing high solids containing samples such as pgs and pcs peg precipitation or other flocculation approaches may be more effective due to an incompatibility of this matrix with ultrafiltration due to possible complication associated with membrane clogging fumian et al 2010 lu et al 2020 the advantages of using pgs and pcs which may have a greater and more consistent rna signal should be balanced against the apparent lower recovery of peg precipitation additional studies are needed to develop and assess appropriate and effective methods and surrogates for analysis of sars cov 2 in wastewaters 4 2 comparison of rt qpcr and rt ddpcr for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 rna this study tested the detection and quantification of rt ddpcr and rt qpcr for sars cov 2 rna signal in pgs and pcs samples the in vitro transcribed rna was observed to be reliably detected with primer probe rt ddpcr assays to a limit of detection of 5 copies reaction in both n1 and n2 rt ddpcr assays this is consistent with the purported high sensitivity of the digital pcr technology in vitro transcribed viral rna was detected to a limit of detection of 2 copies reaction in both the n1 and n2 rt qpcr assays using the high sensitivity bio rad one step reliance supermix bio rad hercules ca which was unexpected when comparing to the rt ddpcr limit of detection standard curves utilized for the quantification of different rna targets for rt qpcr are as follows n1 slope 3 372 intercept 38 184 r2 0 972 e 97 96 n2 slope 3 179 intercept 37 870 r2 0 954 e 106 32 pmmov slope 2 806 intercept 39 142 r2 0 968 e 127 17 and vsv slope 3 518 intercept 39 846 r2 0 995 e 92 41 the standard curves demonstrate good linearity for rt qpcr in a range between 2 to 60 copies reaction for n1 and n2 1 4 102 to 3 6 104 copies reaction for pmmov and 1 6 100 to 1 6 104 copies reaction for vsv a comparison was performed between the one step rt qpcr and rt ddpcr using the same singleplex n1 probe primer set for the quantification of sars cov 2 in solids rich low concentration sars cov 2 rna signal wastewaters fig 3 six pgs samples and five pcs samples were analyzed using rt qpcr and rt ddpcr all samples were collected from the two cities during the same low incidence periods 60 active cases 100 000 people case number study period allowing the assessment of quantification and degree of variability in samples with low rna concentrations the mean and standard error of the pgs samples analyzed during the same period of low incidence cases are 133 4 9 0 and 167 1 25 6 n1 gene copies 100 µl of extracted rna for rt ddpcr and rt qpcr respectively meanwhile the mean and standard error of the pcs samples are 33 5 5 8 and 130 4 20 8 gene copies 100 µl of extracted rna for rt ddpcr and rt qpcr respectively fig 3 although a significant decrease in detected copies for pcs samples with rt ddpcr is observed it is noted that the coefficient of variation cv for the ddpcr assay 38 4 compared to qpcr 35 7 while the cv for pgs samples for the ddpcr assay is lower 16 5 compared to qpcr 37 5 the difference in quantification of the pcs samples between the n1 rt qpcr and rt ddpcr assays suggests inhibition of the reverse transcription and or polymerase chain reaction of the pcs sample given that this assay partitions the sample volume into approximately 1 nl droplets it s conceivable that the effective concentration of any rt and or pcr inhibitors present in the pcs matrix are markedly increased in contrast rt qpcr is performed in a non partitioned assay volume and may thus be less sensitive to inhibition the apparent inhibition in ddpcr may also be explained by differences in the reagents used for the rt ddpcr and rt qpcr assays the inhibition resistance inhibitor removal of the high sensitivity rt qpcr reagent appears to provide better detection when utilized in pegged sludge matrices quantification of two fold and five fold dilutions of pcs samples was performed and support the theory that rt ddpcr was likely inhibited rt qpcr shows good quantification of diluted samples while rt ddpcr suffered from inhibition these findings contradict the theoretical assumption that rt ddpcr is less prone to inhibition due to relative insensitivity to differences in amplification efficiencies due to its binary all or nothing reporting of amplification salipante and jerome 2020 however at least one report found that undiluted raw wastewater inhibits one step rt ddpcr amplification of pmmov rna to the same degree as the rt qpcr assay rački et al 2014 given that rna in both pgs and pcs samples was at a very low concentration approaching the limits of detection it is highly likely that inhibitors in the pcs matrix are responsible for the decreased sensitivity observed in rt qpcr vs rt ddpcr of note it was also attempted in this study to use a commercially available multiplex rt ddpcr assay that employs primer probe sets amplifying n1 n2 and n3 regions of the viral n rna as well as a human transcript sars cov 2 bio rad however it was determined that the discrimination between positive and negative droplets fluorescence amplitude was poor making quantitative analysis impossible rt ddpcr has a myriad of theoretical advantages such as absolute quantification that is not dependent on calibration curves insensitivity to common pcr inhibitors and the ability to multiplex salipante and jerome 2020 there is a need to explore this further in future studies and to optimize these methods and quantification techniques for wastewater samples however based on the better detection using the current rt qpcr approach this method was utilized for the remainder of this study to quantify sars cov 2 in both pgs and pcs solids from the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs 4 3 detection and variance of sars cov 2 viral rna in pgs and pcs in this study the sensitivity and variability of the rt qpcr assay in pgs and pcs was compared by investigating the percentage of sample replicates with replicates including repeated rna extraction step and pcr quantification samples along with technical triplicates the limit of detection used in the study for rt qpcr assays is described above replicate runs 24 paired pgs and pcs samples for a total of 72 technical replicates each were collected on the same dates across 83 days pcs samples collected and analyzed at the same time as pgs samples over a 3 month period exhibited stronger percent detection for n1 92 7 for pcs compared to 79 2 for pgs p 0 007 and n2 90 6 for pcs compared to 82 3 for pgs p 0 092 fig 4 variance in percent detection of pcs was shown to be similar for all samples with coefficients of variation ranging from 29 1 to 31 7 the decreased sensitivity of sars cov 2 detection in pgs samples could be due to the increased susceptibility of solid particulate matter in this wastewater fraction to daily fluctuations in flowrate and wastewater biochemical characteristics at the wrrfs compared to the sludge samples collected in the primary clarifier stream in addition the pgs samples undergo a laboratory settling step in this study to isolate the settled solids from the liquid fraction of the sample this additional step which is not applied to the pcs samples may also contributes to the lower percent detection of sars cov 2 signal of these samples due to increased holding times and processing times as such the result of this study confirms pcs samples as the high solids samples that demonstrate an elevated frequency of detection of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 rna in municipal wastewaters during decreasing and low incidence of community covid 19 alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 balboa et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 in addition it is noted that the viral rna longitudinal trendline from the pgs samples did not show strong correlation with either the trendline from the pcs samples or municipal epidemiological data further supporting pcs sampling as the more robust basis for community covid 19 monitoring in wastewater solids 4 4 variability of normalization biomarkers a multitude of systematic variations exist in molecular wastewater surveillance that makes it challenging to accurately measure sars cov 2 rna across days months and years these include but are not limited to diurnal variation in plant flow changes in gross proportions of solids sample collection and storage sample processing and sample analysis due to these factors a critical aspect of wastewater epidemiology is sample normalization armanious et al 2016 the necessity to normalize sars cov 2 rna data has also been identified in more recent studies alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 kaplan et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 wu et al 2020 to compare the variability and temporal consistency of biomarkers in this study 8 pcs samples 24 including technical triplicates were analyzed using rt qpcr for all three biomarker gene regions human specific hf183 bacteroides 16s rrna human eukaryotic 18s rrna and pmmov all three tested biomarkers were detected in pcs samples with a relatively high level of expression ct values 30 compared to the incidence of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 fig 5 a while all three biomarker targets were detected in pcs samples it was observed that the distribution of their expression i e quantified through an analysis of variance var in fig 5 of the fecal biomarker pmmov was lower compared to the 16s and 18s biomarkers in pcs samples fig 5a date correlated sars cov 2 ct values are also shown for reference fig 5 the lower variability of pmmov ct variance 1 18 compared to 16s ct variance 5 32 and 18s ct variance 5 12 may be due to the relative toughness and stability of the virus in difficult environments kitajima et al 2018 the lower variability of pmmov detection was also similar to the lower variability of the sars cov 2 n1 and n2 data set furthermore the viral fragments of the pmmov biomarker may preferentially adhere to the solids fraction of wastewaters via electrostatic and or hydrophobic effects armanious et al 2016 additionally in order to quantify the variance of the normalization biomarkers in this study the samples run this comparison were also verified across each surveyed wrrf independently fig 5b the pmmov internal normalization biomarker shows an improved consistency and lower variability maximum change in ct δct 0 01 between the wrrfs compared to 16s δct 1 47 and 18s δct 2 30 which demonstrates a relative steady signal between differing wrrfs due to the consistency of the pmmov fecal biomarker in the pcs samples across 55 days of sampling pmmov was utilized in this study as a sars cov 2 n1 and n2 rna internal control for pcs samples the low variance of pmmov in pcs coupled with the use of pmmov as an internal normalization biomarker was also recently reported by wu et al 2020 it is noted that for the purpose of using pmmov as a normalization factor it was always diluted 1 10 in pure water in order to ensure it remained in the quantifiable range of the pmmov standard curve 4 5 quantification of sars cov 2 viral rna in pcs and correlation with covid 19 case data as pcs was identified as the solids rich sample showing the highest rna detection rate sars cov 2 rna was measured in pcs samples from ottawa and gatineau wrrfs between april 1st and june 30th 2020 this sampling period encompasses a decreasing covid 19 prevalence in two cities peaks of 56 7 and 57 3 confirmed cases 100k inhabitants in ottawa and gatineau respectively as well as an ensuing period of low prevalence characterized by many days with low new daily reported cases 56 7 4 8 and 57 3 10 2 confirmed cases 100k inhabitants in ottawa and gatineau respectively in addition to the technical triplicates of each sample five of the 14 samples in ottawa were re extracted and re quantified via rt qpcr in gatineau four of the 8 samples were re extracted and re quantified via rt qpcr two distinct but complementary normalization approaches were applied to the observed sars cov 2 rna signal to account for variations in wrrf wastewater flow composition and treatment along with temperature time variations in travel and storage along with human errors in the processing of the samples in particular this study normalizes the rna signal for i the wrrf mass flux of solids in the sampled primary clarifier stream and ii the pmmov internal normalization biomarker expression the sars cov 2 viral rna copies l and the normalized viral data are benchmarked against and correlated to epidemiological metrics provided by the ottawa public health agency and the regional public health agency of the city of gatineau three epidemiological data sets based on clinical testing were identified by the local public health agencies as best estimates of covid 19 prevalence in the two cities i daily new cases of covid 19 ii active cases of covid 19 based on an active period of fourteen days and iii percent positive of total daily reported clinical covid 19 tests performed two key factors limitations are noted with respect to these epidemiological data sets shown in this study firstly the testing at the onset of the pandemic march and april 2020 was variable and low in both cities due to limitations in human resources laboratory reagents and testing equipment hence the first four weeks of the twelve week period for which wastewater samples were profiled were subject to variable and lower testing rates per day that likely under reported both the number of new cases and active cases during this period secondly early testing screening was less available to the general population in both cities with testing heavily biased towards hospitalized patients and health care workers this potentially artificially inflates the percent positive data during the first four weeks of the study with the effect on the percent positive being likely lesser than the effect of limited testing on the total case numbers 4 5 1 sars cov 2 rna in pcs and correlation with covid 19 case data the average and standard deviation of technical triplicates and extraction replicates that repeated the concentration extraction and rt qpcr steps shown as error bars in figs 6 and 7 for the longitudinal viral rna data sets in this study are plotted along with a percent positive and seven day floating average percent positive epidemiological data sets due to limited testing during the first four weeks of the longitudinal study percent positive was identified as a potentially useful epidemiological metric of covid 19 prevalence to compare to sars cov 2 rna measurements in wastewater as such this metric is included in figs 6 and 7 to be benchmarked against the measured sars cov 2 signal n1 and n2 rna signal is first expressed in copies l of pcs in this study figs 6a and 7a equivalent volumes of pcs were peg concentrated and rna extracted throughout the sampling period as expected and similar to other studies investigating primary sludge and wastewater solids the raw copies l data sets for the two cities figs 6a and 7a are relatively noisy with no clear trend observed medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the observed concentrations in this study 1 7 103 to 7 8 104 copies l ottawa and 6 6 104 to 3 8 105 copies l gatineau are in agreement with other studies investigating sars cov 2 rna viral signal in pcs concentration ranges of 1 7 106 to 4 6 108 copies l 1 104 to 4 104 copies l and 1 2 104 to 4 0 104 copies l have been reported in pcs by alpaslan kocamemi et al 2020 balboa et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 respectively note that these studies all used protocols with peg concentration that are similar to this study although the n1 and n2 rna gene regions show similar longitudinal trends to each other in both the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs figs 6a and 7a the inherent variations in signal results in noise making it difficult to identify real changes in viral signal in particular this is seen in the large amplitudes of the standard deviations of many data points in the longitudinal data sets of ottawa and gatineau the noise in the rna data may be caused by inherent weather induced random variations in wastewater biochemical characteristics solid composition and flowrate e g due to weather changes in daily household water consumption etc as well as potentially significant effects associated with the collection and transport of the samples and rna concentration extraction and analysis the copies l longitudinal data in ottawa and gatineau clearly demonstrate that sars cov 2 quantification in wastewater is inherently noisy and hence normalization of the data should be explored no significant correlation between n1 and n2 at either the ottawa wrrf or the gatineau wrrf is observed across the study time period table 1 strong and significant correlation would have suggested that sars cov 2 rna might be intact in pcs prior to concentration and extraction which is not herein observed in this study critically when comparing either n1 or n2 copies l to each of the epidemiological metrics daily cases active cases and percent positive it appears that in ottawa no correlation exists between the n1 or n2 rna copies l signal and any of the three epidemiological metrics meanwhile in gatineau significant correlations exist between the n1 and n2 copies l signal and epidemiological data sets with the strongest correlations being observed with the number of active cases table 1 4 5 2 mass flux of primary clarified sludge copies sars cov 2 rna per day and correlation with covid 19 case data to correct for systematic variability the first normalization approach applied in this study is to normalize the n1 and n2 rna signal to both the mass of the peg concentrated solids subject to nucleic acid extraction and also the daily mass flux mass of volatile solids vs solids through the primary clarifier stream per day at each wrrf figs 6b and 7b this normalization approach results in units of n1 and n2 copies day as a solids mass flux basis through the wrrf this normalization approach is intended to compensate for variations in solids concentration and flowrate in the primary clarifier stream at the wrrf due to weather effects precipitation and infiltration inflow in the sewers it is noted that no correlation was observed between n1 and n2 rna signal and bod mass flux tss mass flux or influent flow rate at the ottawa and gatineau wrrfs hence normalization of rna signal with these parameters are not herein shown the lack of correlation between rna signal and these parameters in this study are likely due to the sampling location used in this study as primary clarified sludge is less susceptible to influent mass flux and flow rate variations when comparing longitudinal plots in ottawa of copies l fig 6a to copies d fig 6b the variance of the solids mass flux normalized data set of copies d does not appear to have been significantly reduced the systemic noise of the copies l data sets similar findings are observed for the gatineau normalized data fig 7a and b the substantial noise maintained in the solids mass flux normalized data sets of the two cities and the significantly large standard deviations of longitudinal data points indicates that the fluctuations associated with the solids concentration and flowrate in the primary clarifier stream was likely not a dominant source of the inherent variance in the copies l data sets as observed for the copies l data the correlation between the n1 and n2 data sets were not significant for either ottawa or gatineau further the normalization of the n1 and n2 data for solids mass flux at the wrrfs appear to worsen correlations with anticorrelations increasing for all three epidemiological metrics in ottawa and gatineau table 2 this lack of impact when normalizing operational mass flux of solids at the two wrrfs in this study is likely due to the fact that both wrrfs directly control the flow of the primary clarifier stream at their respective facilities hence reducing the variation in the flux of solids and in turn minimizing the impact of this variation in wrrf operation on the n1 and n2 signal thus systematic variation in the data sets are likely associated with the sample collection and storage along with rna concentration extraction and analysis steps performed in the study 4 5 3 pmmov normalized sars cov 2 rna in pcs and correlation with covid 19 case data pmmov is the most abundant human fecal rna virus kitajima et al 2018 and has been previously proposed as a biomarker for fecal contamination in water hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 pmmov has also more recently been used as an internal reference for sars cov 2 in wastewater wu et al 2020 the second normalization approach applied in this study is the division of the rna n1 and n2 copies by pmmov copies due to its low variability and high expression in pcs pmmov was identified as the preferred internal reference of the three tested biomarkers tested in this study pmmov normalization appears to sufficiently reduce background noise associated with systematic variations in the ottawa and gatineau wrrf rna signals that are possibly associated with the collection and transport of the samples along with the rna concentration extraction and analysis steps of pcs rna signal during decreasing and low incidence periods of covid 19 disease in this study figs 6c and 7c in particular the amplitude of the standard deviation associated with each data point in the longitudinal data sets of ottawa and gatineau decreased this increase in precision ultimately allows for greater distinction between low incidence data points hence enabling improved identification of trends in the data sets correlation between the pmmov normalized n1 and n2 signals remained insignificant in ottawa and gatineau table 1 however this normalization approach also outlines strong significant and positive correlations between both the n1 and the n2 gene regions with all three epidemiological data sets in ottawa the strongest correlation between n1 and n2 pmmov normalized rna signal is observed with the 7 day rolling average percent positive epidemiological metric in ottawa although the percent positive data during the first four weeks of the study may be biased towards hospitalized patients and health care worker testing this clinical testing metric in ottawa is identified as the preferred metric by the public health unit of the city for the reasons described above as such decreasing the systematic variation in the data sets via pmmov normalization establishes a modified trend of the rna signal and this trend shows the strongest correlation of the rna signal to city s identified preferred epidemiological metric strong significant and positive correlation is also shown between the n1 pmmov normalized rna signal with the active cases epidemiologic metric in gatineau while the n2 pmmov normalized signal shows moderate significant correlation to the active cases although the pmmov normalized gatineau rna signal data shows agreement with the active cases epidemiological metric results were varied when correlated to daily cases and 7 day rolling average percent positive the strongest correlation observed in this study for the gatineau rna signal and the epidemiological metrics of the city exists between both the n1 and n2 copies l rna signal and the active cases it is also noted that the longitudinal trends in n1 and n2 pmmov signals in gatineau are similar to those in ottawa this is expected as the two cities are geographically close with many inhabitants travelling across bridges between the cities the observed differences in correlations between sars cov 2 rna signal in wastewater to clinical testing metrics in the two neighboring cities of this study is illustrative of the challenges associated with interpreting and correlating rna signal acquired from distinct wrrfs to clinical testing metrics acquired from distinct health agencies 5 conclusion this study is the first investigation and detection of sars cov 2 trends in wastewater in canada it identifies primary clarified sludge as a preferred solids rich sample compared to post grit solids for the detection of sars cov 2 signal during decreasing and low incidence of viral load in communities based on the reagents used in this study rt qpcr shows superior quantification of sars cov 2 n1 and n2 gene region signal in primary clarified sludge compared to rt ddpcr finally it is demonstrated that pmmov is a potential effective normalization biomarker for rna signal to reduce noise inherent to the wrrf operation along with the sampling transport and processing of the samples the normalization of n1 and n2 sars cov 2 signal using pmmov enables strong correlation to

17459,microplastics have been detected in various environments yet the differences between microplastics in different environments are still largely unknown scientists have proposed the concept of the microplastic cycle but the evidence for the movement of microplastics between different environments is still scarce by screening the literature and extracting information we obtained microplastic data from 709 sampling sites in freshwater seawater freshwater sediment sea sediment and soil in china based on the similarity between microplastics and biological communities here we propose the concept of a microplastic community and examine the differences links and diversity of microplastic communities in different environments wilcoxon sign ranks test kruskal wallis test and analysis of similarities anosim showed that there were significant differences in abundance proportion of small microplastics and community composition shape color and polymer types of microplastics in different environments the mantel test showed that there were significant correlations between microplastic community composition in different environments network analysis based on community similarity further confirmed the links between microplastic communities the distance decay models revealed that the links weakened with the increase of geographic distance suggesting that sampling sites with closed geographical locations had similar pollution sources and more easily to migrate or exchange microplastics the microplastic diversity integrated index mdii was established based on the diversity of microplastic shape color and polymer types and its indication of the number of microplastic pollution sources was verified by the statistical fitting relationship between the number of industrial pollution sources and mdii our study provides new insight into the differences and links between microplastics in different environments which contributes to the microplastic risk assessment and demonstrates the microplastic cycle the establishment of the microplastic diversity integrated index could be used in source analysis of microplastics graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction microplastics plastics with a particle size 5mm have attracted widespread attention around the world in recent years rillig and lehmann 2020 microplastics mainly originate from direct manufacturing i e primary microplastics wang et al 2019c and the weathering and fragmentation of larger plastics in the environment i e secondary microplastics julienne et al 2019 microplastics are challenging to degrade and persist in the environment sun et al 2020a the toxic effects of microplastics on animals including fish akhbarizadeh et al 2018 ding et al 2018 shellfish ding et al 2020a snails song et al 2019 earthworms jiang et al 2020a and even their impact on microorganisms wang et al 2020b li et al 2020a have been confirmed microplastics can also accumulate in plants sun et al 2020b since microplastics can be transferred step by step along the food chain wong et al 2020 they may eventually threaten human health rochman et al 2013 blettler et al 2018 besides due to their large specific surface area and hydrophobicity microplastics can efficiently adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals zhou et al 2019 turner et al 2020 pahs sharma et al 2020 and pesticides wang et al 2020c from the environment thus forming synergystic contamination and exacerbating the negative impacts on the exposed organisms and the ecosystem zhou et al 2020b microplastics exist almost anywhere on the earth including the marine ecosystem gewert et al 2017 isobe et al 2017 jiang et al 2020b freshwater systems yonkos et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and terrestrial ecosystems rillig and lehmann 2020 sarker et al 2020 wong et al 2020 the intake of microplastics by aquatic and soil organisms can be affected by the shape and color of microplastics xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a moreover microplastics made of different polymer types have different degrees of risk to organisms and the environment xu et al 2018 peng et al 2018 li et al 2020b understanding the differences of microplastics in different environments would be helpful for us to better evaluate the risks of microplastics but much remains to be done in this area similar to the global biogeochemical cycles the microplastic cycle refers to the movement of microplastics between different abiotic and biotic ecosystem compartments bank and hansson 2019 rochman and hoellein 2020 scientists have asked questions about the microplastic cycle for example what are the sources of microplastics and how do microplastics move between different environments rochman and hoellein 2020 additionally the ocean plastics charter has also called for collaborating on research on the sources and fate of plastics g7 4f 2018 however at present research on microplastics mostly focuses on their abundances characteristics or ecotoxicity rillig and lehmann 2020 little is known about the movement and exchange of microplastics between different environments and source analysis of microplastics is still in a preliminary stage microplastics of various colors shapes and polymer types accumulate together in the environment similar to a biological community wang et al 2019b so here we regard these as microplastic communities and study the differences links and diversity of the communities in different environments due to the vast differences in pollution exposure and physiochemical properties of the different environments we first hypothesized that the community composition of microplastics would be significantly different among different environments based on the concept of the microplastic cycle we made a second hypothesis that there are links between microplastic communities in different environments and the closer the geographic distance the more similar the community composition will be since the shape color and polymer types of microplastics do not change significantly in the short term after being discharged into the environment we speculated that when the shape color or polymer types of microplastics are more diverse they might have more sources hence we made a third hypothesis that a diversity index of microplastics could indicate the number of pollution sources the objectives of this study were 1 to find the differences in the composition of microplastics between different environments thus providing a basis for the risk assessment of microplastics 2 to provide direct evidence for the microplastic cycle by studying microplastics links between different environments and different sites and 3 to establish a microplastic diversity index and verify its usefulness as an indicator of microplastic pollution sources 2 methods 2 1 data search five main storage reservoirs of microplastics namely freshwater fw freshwater sediment fs seawater sw sea sediment ss and soil mainly farm soil s were taken as research objects to study the differences and relationships of microplastics in different environments air is also a reservoir of microplastics but the studies on air microplastics are still few in order to ensure the universality and reliability of the research results we did not take the air environment into consideration in this study a literature search was carried out to list all the available peer reviewed journal articles published before may 2020 which considered the microplastics collected from the above five environments the databases web of science and elsevier were used for this search and non english articles were excluded the literature was screened through the following criteria 1 a field investigation of microplastic in at least one of the five environments fw fs sw ss and s 2 for the literature on microplastics abundance the microplastics abundances in sediment or soil were measured in terms of items per kilogram of dry sample or could be converted into items per kilogram of dry sample and those in water were measured in terms of items per cubic meter or could be converted into items per cubic meter 3 data for at least one characteristic color shape or polymer type was reported 4 the research was carried out in china since we tried to establish indices that could indicate pollution sources this made it easier for us to obtain pollution source data after selecting the articles we checked the citations in the reference lists of these articles again until no further related articles could be found finally we obtained 39 studies containing microplastics data from 709 sampling sites fw 283 sw 105 s 88 fs 115 ss 118 fig 1 2 2 extraction and processing of main data for the selected studies the following information was extracted longitude and latitude of sampling sites microplastic abundances particle size distribution proportion of various colors proportion of various shapes and proportion of various polymers not all studies contain all the above information but at least one of the colors shapes or polymers needed to be available after extracting the information we processed the data as follows 1 the dimension was unified as items m 3 water or items kg 1 dry sediment or soil 2 the particle sizes of the microplastics were classified as 1mm and 1 5mm and the proportion of small microplastics 1mm to all i e 5mm was counted and studied 3 the shape types of the microplastics were divided into fiber fragment film and others including microbead pellet and foam 4 the colors were divided into six categories namely white black blue transparent red and others 5 polymer types were divided into eleven types including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyamide pa polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polycarbonate pc polyethersulfone pes polyethylene terephthalate pet polyacrylonite pan rayon and others when the data in the literature could not be directly obtained through tables and other forms but were displayed in the form of figures the software imagej was used for physical measurement the data involved in this research are shown in supplementary information table s1 s2 fig s1 s13 2 3 data analysis and establishment of indices wilcoxon and kruskal wallis tests were used to compare the differences of microplastic abundance and size among different environments based on the relative abundance of microplastic color shape and polymer types microplastic communities were regarded to study the differences and links of microplastic pollution between different environments analysis of similarities anosim was performed to verify the statistical differences in the composition of microplastic communities in different environments linear discriminant analysis lda was used to reduce the dimensions of the data and the first two axes were plotted to visually observe the differences in the composition of microplastic communities between different environments linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to find the characteristic microplastic types with significant differences between different environments the mantel test was used to explore the correlation of microplastic communities between different environments similarity between samples was calculated based on the bray curtis distance similarity 1 bray curtis for the links between the samples by calculating the similarity of the microplastic composition between all possible pairs of samples the data with a similarity greater than 0 5 was selected and the similarity matrix of the microplastic composition between the samples was constructed and visualized on a network graph the distance decay model was established to explore the effect of increasing geographic distance on the similarity of microplastic community nekola and white 1999 yang et al 2020 we calculated the simpson diversity index simpson 1949 for microplastics of different shapes different colors and different polymers namely simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer furthermore the linear regression model was carried out between each of the two pairs of the three to test the reliability of pollution source traceability of microplastic diversity moreover we proposed a microplastic diversity integrated index mdii based on three diversity indices simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer of the microplastics to reflect the microplastic community composition and to indicate the number of pollution sources to test the source indicative function of mdii we applied linear regression analysis between the mdii of microplastic communities in freshwater ecosystems and the number of industrial pollution sources of the cities they located the number of pollution sources was obtained from the list of pollution sources published on the official website of each city s ecological environmental protection bureau we counted the number of total pollution sources water pollution sources air pollution sources and soil pollution sources since the pollution source data was released on a city by city basis we regarded each city as a large microplastic community we averaged the relative abundance of microplastics at all sampling sites in this city and then calculated the mdii of this large microplastic community the calculation formula of mdii is as follows m d i i simpson shape simpson color simpson polymer 1 3 similar to the simpson index mdii is between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 0 the lower the diversity of microplastics data analyses and plotting were performed in r version 4 0 0 using packages vegan mass ggplot2 and corrplot the distribution map in fig 1 was plotted in arcgis version 10 6 the network relationship graph was drawn in gephi version 0 9 2 lefse was analyzed at http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy 3 results 3 1 general information of microplastics in different environments significant differences exist in the abundance of microplastics in different environments fig 2 a the abundance of microplastics in freshwater average 6829 items m 3 was much higher than that in seawater average 1320 items m 3 wilcoxon p 0 0001 the abundance of microplastics in soil average 2e5 items kg 1 was significantly higher than in freshwater sediments average 436 items kg 1 and in sea sediments average 487 items kg 1 kruskal wallis p 0 0001 as shown in fig 2b microplastics with particle sizes less than 1 mm accounted for the majority and the proportion of small particle sized microplastics in seawater average 48 was significantly lower than in the other four environments average fw 74 fs 78 s 72 ss 79 kruskal wallis p 0 0001 the distribution of shape color and polymer types of microplastics are shown in fig 2c 2d and 2e respectively overall the proportions of various shapes of microplastics in the five environments were seen in descending order as follows fiber 61 fragment 26 film 7 others 5 in each environment fiber fw 60 sw 59 fs 52 ss 78 s 57 and fragment fw 23 sw 35 fs 26 ss 18 s 30 were still the main microplastic shapes the color distribution of microplastics in the five environments in descending order was as follows transparent 32 black 22 blue 15 white 11 red 7 the color distribution of microplastics varied greatly in different environments but transparent was still the main color of microplastics in each environment fw 27 sw 57 fs 26 ss 31 s 19 pp and pe were the two main polymer types both in general pp 23 pe 26 and in each environment pp range from 12 to 29 pe range from 18 to 38 3 2 differences of microplastic communities in different environments anosim fig 3 a showed that the differences in the composition of microplastic communities in different environments were significantly greater than the differences in different sites within the same environment r 0 152 p 0 001 the first two axes of the lda explain 42 53 and 34 03 respectively of the microplastic community s variance in the five environments it can be seen from fig 3b that sw and s were significantly different from the other communities but the three communities of fw fs and ss were not clearly distinguished on the ld1 and ld2 axes lefse was used to find the significantly discriminant microplastic types including shape color and polymer in each environment threshold on the logarithmic lda score for discriminative features was set to 4 4 to ensure that each environment had at least one characteristic microplastic type we found that based on the relative abundance there were significantly more transparent microplastics in sw more blue microplastics in ss more black pp and pe microplastics in s more white microplastics in fw and finally more pet and ps in fs these microplastic types were the characteristic types in their respective environments fig 3c 3 3 links between microplastic communities the mantel test was used to examine the relationships among the microplastic communities in the five environments and the results are shown in fig 4 a there were significant positive associations r values were between 0 28 and 0 63 between microplastic communities in different environments except for the p value of fs and s was 0 072 all other p values were less than 0 05 in order to study the association of the microplastic communities among various sites we calculated the similarity between microplastic communities based on bray curtis distance and the similarity value was between 0 and 1 based on the community similarity we drew a community relationship network fig 4b each node in fig 4b represents a microplastic community sample if the similarity between the two samples is greater than 0 5 a connection line is drawn between the two microplastic communities that is an edge in the network the size of the node indicates the number of edges connected with it it can be seen from fig 4b that there were complex links between the microplastic communities in various sampling sites the 259 nodes form 21976 sides and the average degree of the network was 169 699 that is to say on average each microplastic community had a similarity greater than 0 5 with the other 169 699 microplastic communities a geographic distance and community similarity community similarity was represented by 1 bray curtis dissimilarity distance were calculated between each pair of microplastic communities and a total of 9510 pairs of relationships were generated and then the distance decay linear models were run to examine the effects of geographic distances on the links among the microplastic communities as shown in fig 5 overall there were significant distance decay relationships for microplastic community similarity in the five environments r2 0 297 p 0 0001 for each environment the distance decay models in fw fs sw and ss passed the statistical test and had a good fitting relationship r2 ranged from 0 151 0 431 p 0 0001 but the distance decay relationship of the microplastic communities in soil was relatively weak p 0 051 the slopes of the distance decay models of the microplastic in each environment were in descending order as follows showing the rate at which similarity decays with distance s 5 743e 7 ss 1 487e 7 fs 1 186e 7 sw 1 116e 7 fw 9 234e 8 this result showed that the geographic location had significant effects on the microplastic community composition and the similarity between microplastic communities decreased with increasing geographic distance 3 4 the establishment and verification of the mdii as an indicator of pollution sources in order to illustrate the reliability of using microplastic community diversity to indicate the number of pollution sources we tested the relationships among the diversity of microplastic shape color and polymer type as shown in fig 6 significantly positive correlations exist among simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer r2 ranged from 0 215 to 0 249 p 0 001 a comprehensive diversity index the microplastic diversity integrated index mdii was established to reflect the complexity of microplastics in the environment and indicate the condition of pollution sources based on the three simpson indices simpson shape simpson color simpson polymer linear regression models between the mdii values of the microplastic communities in the freshwater ecosystems and the number of pollution sources including total sources of pollution water pollution sources air pollution sources and soil pollution sources in the cities were applied to verify the ability of mdii to indicate the number of pollution sources fig 7 as presumed there were well fitted linear relationships between mdii and the number of pollution sources r2 ranged from 0 255 to 0 486 p value of water pollution source number mdii linear model was less than 0 1 and p values of the other three models were less than 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 differences of microplastic communities in different environments the first scientific hypothesis of this study was verified there were significant differences of microplastics in different environments including seawater sea sediments freshwater freshwater sediments and soils which were manifested in the differences of abundance proportion of small microplastics and community composition shape color and polymer types freshwater ecosystems the major sources of seawater microplastics eerkes medrano et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 were more easily and directly affected by various pollution sources and human activities rachman 2018 therefore the concentration of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystem was significantly higher than that in the seawater ecosystem in addition the volume of the ocean was much larger than that of any freshwater ecosystem resulting in the rapid dilution of microplastics discharged into seawater which was also an important reason for the lower concentration of microplastics in the seawater we found that the abundance of microplastics in soil was significantly higher than that in freshwater sediments and seawater sediments most of the soil samples involved in this study were farm soil and the other parts were woodland and vacant land the main reasons for the significantly high concentration of microplastics in soil might be as follows extensive application of sewage sludge in farmland zubris and richards 2005 the fragmentation and weathering of plastic film plasticulture domestic garbage plastic litter and plastic items in landfills rachman 2018 and wastewater irrigation sarker et al 2020 as small microplastics are more likely to accumulate in organisms feng et al 2020 it is generally believed that the smaller the particle size of microplastics the higher the harm to the ecosystem gebhardt and forster 2018 the proportion of microplastics with small particle size 1 mm in seawater is significantly lower than that in the other four environments fw fs ss and s the reason might be that seawater ecosystem has less promotion effect on the decomposition or the fragmentation of microplastics this also makes the risk of microplastics lower in the seawater ecosystem than in the other four environments li et al 2019b li et al 2020a less mechanical wear and limited uv penetration might be the main reason for the low degradation of microplastics in seawater wang et al 2017a erni cassola et al 2019 the significant differences in microplastic community composition shape color and polymer types in different environments suggest corresponding differences in the main pollution sources faced by those environments for example the breaking and weathering of fishing lines and nets could produce a large amount of transparent microplastics di and wang 2018 and intensive fishing activities in coastal areas could be why transparent microplastic was the representative microplastic type in seawater the significant amount of black microplastics in soil might come from automobile tire wear ding et al 2020b while the significant amount of pp and pe in soil is likely caused by the widespread use of plastic films in tillage ramos et al 2015 liu et al 2018 4 2 links between microplastic communities the significant positive correlation between the microplastic community composition matrices in different environments and the complex microplastic community similarity network of microplastic communities in various sampling sites supported our second scientific hypothesis that there were close associations between microplastic communities these associations also indicated the movement of microplastics between different large compartments including freshwater ecosystems such as rivers marine ecosystems and terrestrial habitats rillig and lehmann 2020 providing direct evidence for the concept of the microplastic cycle bank and hansson 2019 rochman and hoellein 2020 the main reasons for the correlation of the microplastic composition matrix in the five environments in this study might be firstly shared pollution sources or similar pollution sources could result in similar microplastic compositions wang et al 2019b secondly the microplastics in the water body could sink to sediment and sediments were both sinks and sources of microplastics wang et al 2019a li et al 2020a su et al 2020 thirdly irrigation could cause microplastics in freshwater bodies such as river water to enter and stay in farmland soil lastly freshwater bodies such as rivers were important microplastic sources for the marine ecosystem eerkes medrano et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 it is worth noting that the mantel test based on sample similarity used to test the correlation of microplastic composition matrix in our study might have potential for source analysis of microplastics the distance decay relationship of microplastics composition similarity showed that the links between microplastic communities weaken with the increase of geographic distance this suggested that firstly the sampling sites close to each other had similar pollution sources even shared the same sources secondly the microplastic communication including migration and exchange was more likely to occur between the sampling sites close to each other such as being transported by wildlife like earthworms rillig et al 2017 rachman 2018 and being transferred by dry and wet e g rain snow deposition from the atmosphere dris et al 2016 rochman and hoellein 2020 4 3 reliability of mdii as an indicator of the number of pollution sources many studies have speculated about the pollution sources of microplastics via the color shape or polymer types of the microplastics ó briain et al 2020 li et al 2020a it has also been suggested that rich colors represent a large number of sources zhu et al 2020 and diverse shapes and polymer types of microplastics indicate a wide range of sources wang et al 2019b therefore the relationship of the microplastic diversity to the number of pollution sources is credible the remarkable linear positive correlation among color diversity shape diversity and polymer type diversity of microplastics verified the reliability of using the diversity index as an indicator of pollution sources integrating the three diversity indices the mdii was established to reflect the diversity of microplastic community and to indicate the complexity of the pollution sources studying freshwater ecosystems is the suitable for elucidating the sources of microplastic pollution because these ecosystems are exposed directly to pollution sources in cities and directly receive the treated and untreated urban and industrial wastes rachman 2018 moreover industrial emissions were usually the main sources of microplastic in freshwater lechner et al 2014 therefore we used the mdii of the microplastic communities in freshwater ecosystem and the number of industrial pollution sources in the city to verify the ability of mdii to indicate the number of pollution sources the statistically significant fits between them validated our third hypothesis the diversity index of microplastics could indicate the number of pollution sources in fact both the number and the distribution uniformity of microplastic types were considered in the calculation process of mdii so in addition to the number of pollution sources the mdii of a microplastic community is also affected by the distance from the pollution source and the pollution source s emission intensity therefore when the mdii value of microplastics in a specific place is very high we can speculate that there are multiple microplastics pollution sources in the place and the contributions of each source or the most essential sources are equivalent in contrast when the mdii value is very low in addition to having few pollution sources another reason is that one or a few sources make a dominant contribution to the area thus leading to a decrease in the uniformity of microplastics previous studies have also tried to calculate the diversity of microplastics and to speculate on the pollution sources of microplastics wang et al 2019b zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 calculated the polymer richness and diversity of microplastics by using the polymer types of microplastics wang et al 2019b divided microplastics into ten categories through literature review and based on this calculated the diversity of microplastics to reflect the complexity of microplastics pollution sources they all affirmed the indicative function of microplastic diversity on microplastic pollution sources however they did not fully consider the characteristics of microplastics and the source indicative function of the index has not been tested in this study the color shape and polymer information of microplastics were comprehensively considered when establishing the diversity index and the indicative function of microplastic diversity on pollution sources was fully verified since that the research on source analysis of microplastics has just started rochman and hoellein 2020 the mdii index may make important contributions to subsequent extensive source analysis 4 4 limitations and perspectives although we have tried to make our data and results rigorous and reliable limitations remain firstly due to the begnning of research on microplastics and the inconsistent sampling methods of microplastics at present we did not take the uniform minimum detection limit of microplastics as a criterion for screening data secondly although air is also a reservoir of microplastics there is still too little research on air microplastics to get a universal conclusion so we did not regard the air microplastics as one of the research objects in this study finally the microplastic diversity index established in this study can indicate the number of pollution sources the pollution sources here only refer to the pollution sources discharging few kinds of microplastics in the future it is urgent to develop a unified microplastic research method and air microplastics need to be widely studied the microplastic diversity integrated index we proposed is welcome to be widely tested and more source analysis of microplastics is needed 5 conclusion by integrating and analyzing research data on microplastics in five environments freshwater seawater freshwater sediment sea sediment and soil we found that there were significant differences in microplastics in different environments which were manifested in abundance proportion of small particle size microplastics shape composition color composition and polymer composition moreover the mantel test showed significant positive associations between microplastics composition in different environments and network analysis further confirmed the links between microplastic communities both in different sampling sites and in different environments furthermore the distance decay models showed that these links weakened with increasing geographic distance the significant positive correlations among the diversity indices of shape color and polymer types provided the prerequisite for indicating the number of pollution sources through the diversity of microplastics a comprehensive index the microplastic diversity integrated index mdii was established based on the simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer indices to reflect the diversity of microplastics and to indicate the number of microplastic pollution sources the statistical fitting relationship between the number of industrial pollution sources and mdii verified the ability of mdii to indicate the number of pollution sources our study fills the research gap in the difference of microplastic assemblies in different environments and provides a basis for the risk assessment of microplastics our research on the links between microplastics in different environments provides evidence for the microplastic cycle and the establishment of mdii contributes to the source analysis of microplastics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

confirmed the links between microplastic communities the distance decay models revealed that the links weakened with the increase of geographic distance suggesting that sampling sites with closed geographical locations had similar pollution sources and more easily to migrate or exchange microplastics the microplastic diversity integrated index mdii was established based on the diversity of microplastic shape color and polymer types and its indication of the number of microplastic pollution sources was verified by the statistical fitting relationship between the number of industrial pollution sources and mdii our study provides new insight into the differences and links between microplastics in different environments which contributes to the microplastic risk assessment and

2020 sarker et al 2020 wong et al 2020 the intake of microplastics by aquatic and soil organisms can be affected by the shape and color of microplastics xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a moreover microplastics made of different polymer types have different degrees of risk to organisms and the environment xu et al 2018 peng et al 2018 li et al 2020b understanding the differences of microplastics in different environments would be helpful for us to better evaluate the risks of microplastics but much remains to be done in this area similar to the global biogeochemical cycles the microplastic cycle refers to the movement of microplastics between different abiotic and biotic ecosystem compartments bank and hansson 2019 rochman and hoellein 2020 scientists have asked questions about the microplastic cycle for example what are the sources of microplastics and how do microplastics move between different environments rochman and hoellein 2020 additionally the ocean plastics charter has also called for collaborating on research on the sources and fate of plastics g7 4f 2018 however at present research on microplastics mostly focuses on their abundances characteristics or ecotoxicity rillig and lehmann 2020 little is known about the movement and exchange of microplastics between different environments and source analysis of microplastics is still in a preliminary stage microplastics of various colors shapes and polymer types accumulate together in the environment similar to a biological community wang et al 2019b so here we regard these as microplastic communities and study the differences links and diversity of the communities in different environments due to the vast differences in pollution exposure and physiochemical properties of the different environments we first hypothesized that the community composition of microplastics would be significantly different among different environments based on the concept of the microplastic cycle we made a second hypothesis that there are links between microplastic communities in different environments and the closer the geographic distance the more similar the community composition will be since the shape color and polymer types of microplastics do not change significantly in the short term after being discharged into the environment we speculated that when the shape color or polymer types of microplastics are more diverse they might have more sources hence we made a third hypothesis that a diversity index of microplastics could indicate the number of pollution sources the objectives of this study were 1 to find the differences in the composition of microplastics between different environments thus providing a basis for the risk assessment of microplastics 2 to provide direct evidence for the microplastic cycle by studying microplastics links between different environments and different sites and 3 to establish a microplastic diversity index and verify its usefulness as an indicator of microplastic pollution sources 2 methods 2 1 data search five main storage reservoirs of microplastics namely freshwater fw freshwater sediment fs seawater sw sea sediment ss and soil mainly farm soil s were taken as research objects to study the differences and relationships of microplastics in different environments air is also a reservoir of microplastics but the studies on air microplastics are still few in order to ensure the universality and reliability of the research results we did not take the air environment into consideration in this study a literature search was carried out to list all the available peer reviewed journal articles published before may 2020 which considered the microplastics collected from the above five environments the databases web of science and elsevier were used for this search and non english articles were excluded the literature was screened through the following criteria 1 a field investigation of microplastic in at least one of the five environments fw fs sw ss and s 2 for the literature on microplastics abundance the microplastics abundances in sediment or soil were measured in terms of items per kilogram of dry sample or could be converted into items per kilogram of dry sample and those in water were measured in terms of items per cubic meter or could be converted into items per cubic meter 3 data for at least one characteristic color shape or polymer type was reported 4 the research was carried out in china since we tried to establish indices that could indicate pollution sources this made it easier for us to obtain pollution source data after selecting the articles we checked the citations in the reference lists of these articles again until no further related articles could be found finally we obtained 39 studies containing microplastics data from 709 sampling sites fw 283 sw 105 s 88 fs 115 ss 118 fig 1 2 2 extraction and processing of main data for the selected studies the following information was extracted longitude and latitude of sampling sites microplastic abundances particle size distribution proportion of various colors proportion of various shapes and proportion of various polymers not all studies contain all the above information but at least one of the colors shapes or polymers needed to be available after extracting the information we processed the data as follows 1 the dimension was unified as items m 3 water or items kg 1 dry sediment or soil 2 the particle sizes of the microplastics were classified as 1mm and 1 5mm and the proportion of small microplastics 1mm to all i e 5mm was counted and studied 3 the shape types of the microplastics were divided into fiber fragment film and others including microbead pellet and foam 4 the colors were divided into six categories namely white black blue transparent red and others 5 polymer types were divided into eleven types including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyamide pa polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polycarbonate pc polyethersulfone pes polyethylene terephthalate pet polyacrylonite pan rayon and others when the data in the literature could not be directly obtained through tables and other forms but were displayed in the form of figures the software imagej was used for physical measurement the data involved in this research are shown in supplementary information table s1 s2 fig s1 s13 2 3 data analysis and establishment of indices wilcoxon and kruskal wallis tests were used to compare the differences of microplastic abundance and size among different environments based on the relative abundance of microplastic color shape and polymer types microplastic communities were regarded to study the differences and links of microplastic pollution between different environments analysis of similarities anosim was performed to verify the statistical differences in the composition of microplastic communities in different environments linear discriminant analysis lda was used to reduce the dimensions of the data and the first two axes were plotted to visually observe the differences in the composition of microplastic communities between different environments linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to find the characteristic microplastic types with significant differences between different environments the mantel test was used to explore the correlation of microplastic communities between different environments similarity between samples was calculated based on the bray curtis distance similarity 1 bray curtis for the links between the samples by calculating the similarity of the microplastic composition between all possible pairs of samples the data with a similarity greater than 0 5 was selected and the similarity matrix of the microplastic composition between the samples was constructed and visualized on a network graph the distance decay model was established to explore the effect of increasing geographic distance on the similarity of microplastic community nekola and white 1999 yang et al 2020 we calculated the simpson diversity index simpson 1949 for microplastics of different shapes different colors and different polymers namely simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer furthermore the linear regression model was carried out between each of the two pairs of the three to test the reliability of pollution source traceability of microplastic diversity moreover we proposed a microplastic diversity integrated index mdii based on three diversity indices simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer of the microplastics to reflect the microplastic community composition and to indicate the number of pollution sources to test the source indicative function of mdii we applied linear regression analysis between the mdii of microplastic communities in freshwater ecosystems and the number of industrial pollution sources of the cities they located the number of pollution sources was obtained from the list of pollution sources published on the official website of each city s ecological environmental protection bureau we counted the number of total pollution sources water pollution sources air pollution sources and soil pollution sources since the pollution source data was released on a city by city basis we regarded each city as a large microplastic community we averaged the relative abundance of microplastics at all sampling sites in this city and then calculated the mdii of this large microplastic community the calculation formula of mdii is as follows m d i i simpson shape simpson color simpson polymer 1 3 similar to the simpson index mdii is between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 0 the lower the diversity of microplastics data analyses and plotting were performed in r version 4 0 0 using packages vegan mass ggplot2 and corrplot the distribution map in fig 1 was plotted in arcgis version 10 6 the network relationship graph was drawn in gephi version 0 9 2 lefse was analyzed at http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy 3 results 3 1 general information of microplastics in different environments significant differences exist in the abundance of microplastics in different environments fig 2 a the abundance of microplastics in freshwater average 6829 items m 3 was much higher than that in seawater average 1320 items m 3 wilcoxon p 0 0001 the abundance of microplastics in soil average 2e5 items kg 1 was significantly higher than in freshwater sediments average 436 items kg 1 and in sea sediments average 487 items kg 1 kruskal wallis p 0 0001 as shown in fig 2b microplastics with particle sizes less than 1 mm accounted for the majority and the proportion of small particle sized microplastics in seawater average 48 was significantly lower than in the other four environments average fw 74 fs 78 s 72 ss 79 kruskal wallis p 0 0001 the distribution of shape color and polymer types of microplastics are shown in fig 2c 2d and 2e respectively overall the proportions of various shapes of microplastics in the five environments were seen in descending order as follows fiber 61 fragment 26 film 7 others 5 in each environment fiber fw 60 sw 59 fs 52 ss 78 s 57 and fragment fw 23 sw 35 fs 26 ss 18 s 30 were still the main microplastic shapes the color distribution of microplastics in the five environments in descending order was as follows transparent 32 black 22 blue 15 white 11 red 7 the color distribution of microplastics varied greatly in different environments but transparent was still the main color of microplastics in each environment fw 27 sw 57 fs 26 ss 31 s 19 pp and pe were the two main polymer types both in general pp 23 pe 26 and in each environment pp range from 12 to 29 pe range from 18 to 38 3 2 differences of microplastic communities in different environments anosim fig 3 a showed that the differences in the composition of microplastic communities in different environments were significantly greater than the differences in different sites within the same environment r 0 152 p 0 001 the first two axes of the lda explain 42 53 and 34 03 respectively of the microplastic community s variance in the five environments it can be seen from fig 3b that sw and s were significantly different from the other communities but the three communities of fw fs and ss were not clearly distinguished on the ld1 and ld2 axes lefse was used to find the significantly discriminant microplastic types including shape color and polymer in each environment threshold on the logarithmic lda score for discriminative features was set to 4 4 to ensure that each environment had at least one characteristic microplastic type we found that based on the relative abundance there were significantly more transparent microplastics in sw more blue microplastics in ss more black pp and pe microplastics in s more white microplastics in fw and finally more pet and ps in fs these microplastic types were the characteristic types in their respective environments fig 3c 3 3 links between microplastic communities the mantel test was used to examine the relationships among the microplastic communities in the five environments and the results are shown in fig 4 a there were significant positive associations r values were between 0 28 and 0 63 between microplastic communities in different environments except for the p value of fs and s was 0 072 all other p values were less than 0 05 in order to study the association of the microplastic communities among various sites we calculated the similarity between microplastic communities based on bray curtis distance and the similarity value was between 0 and 1 based on the community similarity we drew a community relationship network fig 4b each node in fig 4b represents a microplastic community sample if the similarity between the two samples is greater than 0 5 a connection line is drawn between the two microplastic communities that is an edge in the network the size of the node indicates the number of edges connected with it it can be seen from fig 4b that there were complex links between the microplastic communities in various sampling sites the 259 nodes form 21976 sides and the average degree of the network was 169 699 that is to say on average each microplastic community had a similarity greater than 0 5 with the other 169 699 microplastic communities a geographic distance and community similarity community similarity was represented by 1 bray curtis dissimilarity distance were calculated between each pair of microplastic communities and a total of 9510 pairs of relationships were generated and then the distance decay linear models were run to examine the effects of geographic distances on the links among the microplastic communities as shown in fig 5 overall there were significant distance decay relationships for microplastic community similarity in the five environments r2 0 297 p 0 0001 for each environment the distance decay models in fw fs sw and ss passed the statistical test and had a good fitting relationship r2 ranged from 0 151 0 431 p 0 0001 but the distance decay relationship of the microplastic communities in soil was relatively weak p 0 051 the slopes of the distance decay models of the microplastic in each environment were in descending order as follows showing the rate at which similarity decays with distance s 5 743e 7 ss 1 487e 7 fs 1 186e 7 sw 1 116e 7 fw 9 234e 8 this result showed that the geographic location had significant effects on the microplastic community composition and the similarity between microplastic communities decreased with increasing geographic distance 3 4 the establishment and verification of the mdii as an indicator of pollution sources in order to illustrate the reliability of using microplastic community diversity to indicate the number of pollution sources we tested the relationships among the diversity of microplastic shape color and polymer type as shown in fig 6 significantly positive correlations exist among simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer r2 ranged from 0 215 to 0 249 p 0 001 a comprehensive diversity index the microplastic diversity integrated index mdii was established to reflect the complexity of microplastics in the environment and indicate the condition of pollution sources based on the three simpson indices simpson shape simpson color simpson polymer linear regression models between the mdii values of the microplastic communities in the freshwater ecosystems and the number of pollution sources including total sources of pollution water pollution sources air pollution sources and soil pollution sources in the cities were applied to verify the ability of mdii to indicate the number of pollution sources fig 7 as presumed there were well fitted linear relationships between mdii and the number of pollution sources r2 ranged from 0 255 to 0 486 p value of water pollution source number mdii linear model was less than 0 1 and p values of the other three models were less than 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 differences of microplastic communities in different environments the first scientific hypothesis of this study was verified there were significant differences of microplastics in different environments including seawater sea sediments freshwater freshwater sediments and soils which were manifested in the differences of abundance proportion of small microplastics and community composition shape color and polymer types freshwater ecosystems the major sources of seawater microplastics eerkes medrano et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 were more easily and directly affected by various pollution sources and human activities rachman 2018 therefore the concentration of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystem was significantly higher than that in the seawater ecosystem in addition the volume of the ocean was much larger than that of any freshwater ecosystem resulting in the rapid dilution of microplastics discharged into seawater which was also an important reason for the lower concentration of microplastics in the seawater we found that the abundance of microplastics in soil was significantly higher than that in freshwater sediments and seawater sediments most of the soil samples involved in this study were farm soil and the other parts were woodland and vacant land the main reasons for the significantly high concentration of microplastics in soil might be as follows extensive application of sewage sludge in farmland zubris and richards 2005 the fragmentation and weathering of plastic film plasticulture domestic garbage plastic litter and plastic items in landfills rachman 2018 and wastewater irrigation sarker et al 2020 as small microplastics are more likely to accumulate in organisms feng et al 2020 it is generally believed that the smaller the particle size of microplastics the higher the harm to the ecosystem gebhardt and forster 2018 the proportion of microplastics with small particle size 1 mm in seawater is significantly lower than that in the other four environments fw fs ss and s the reason might be that seawater ecosystem has less promotion effect on the decomposition or the fragmentation of microplastics this also makes the risk of microplastics lower in the seawater ecosystem than in the other four environments li et al 2019b li et al 2020a less mechanical wear and limited uv penetration might be the main reason for the low degradation of microplastics in seawater wang et al 2017a erni cassola et al 2019 the significant differences in microplastic community composition shape color and polymer types in different environments suggest corresponding differences in the main pollution sources faced by those environments for example the breaking and weathering of fishing lines and nets could produce a large amount of transparent microplastics di and wang 2018 and intensive fishing activities in coastal areas could be why transparent microplastic was the representative microplastic type in seawater the significant amount of black microplastics in soil might come from automobile tire wear ding et al 2020b while the significant amount of pp and pe in soil is likely caused by the widespread use of plastic films in tillage ramos et al 2015 liu et al 2018 4 2 links between microplastic communities the significant positive correlation between the microplastic community composition matrices in different environments and the complex microplastic community similarity network of microplastic communities in various sampling sites supported our second scientific hypothesis that there were close associations between microplastic communities these associations also indicated the movement of microplastics between different large compartments including freshwater ecosystems such as rivers marine ecosystems and terrestrial habitats rillig and lehmann 2020 providing direct evidence for the concept of the microplastic cycle bank and hansson 2019 rochman and hoellein 2020 the main reasons for the correlation of the microplastic composition matrix in the five environments in this study might be firstly shared pollution sources or similar pollution sources could result in similar microplastic compositions wang et al 2019b secondly the microplastics in the water body could sink to sediment and sediments were both sinks and sources of microplastics wang et al 2019a li et al 2020a su et al 2020 thirdly irrigation could cause microplastics in freshwater bodies such as river water to enter and stay in farmland soil lastly freshwater bodies such as rivers were important microplastic sources for the marine ecosystem eerkes medrano et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 it is worth noting that the mantel test based on sample similarity used to test the correlation of microplastic composition matrix in our study might have potential for source analysis of microplastics the distance decay relationship of microplastics composition similarity showed that the links between microplastic communities weaken with the increase of geographic distance this suggested that firstly the sampling sites close to each other had similar pollution sources even shared the same sources secondly the microplastic communication including migration and exchange was more likely to occur between the sampling sites close to each other such as being transported by wildlife like earthworms rillig et al 2017 rachman 2018 and being transferred by dry and wet e g rain snow deposition from the atmosphere dris et al 2016 rochman and hoellein 2020 4 3 reliability of mdii as an indicator of the number of pollution sources many studies have speculated about the pollution sources of microplastics via the color shape or polymer types of the microplastics ó briain et al 2020 li et al 2020a it has also been suggested that rich colors represent a large number of sources zhu et al 2020 and diverse shapes and polymer types of microplastics indicate a wide range of sources wang et al 2019b therefore the relationship of the microplastic diversity to the number of pollution sources is credible the remarkable linear positive correlation among color diversity shape diversity and polymer type diversity of microplastics verified the reliability of using the diversity index as an indicator of pollution sources integrating the three diversity indices the mdii was established to reflect the diversity of microplastic community and to indicate the complexity of the pollution sources studying freshwater ecosystems is the suitable for elucidating the sources of microplastic pollution because these ecosystems are exposed directly to pollution sources in cities and directly receive the treated and untreated urban and industrial wastes rachman 2018 moreover industrial emissions were usually the main sources of microplastic in freshwater lechner et al 2014 therefore we used the mdii of the microplastic communities in freshwater ecosystem and the number of industrial pollution sources in the city to verify the ability of mdii to indicate the number of pollution sources the statistically significant fits between them validated our third hypothesis the diversity index of microplastics could indicate the number of pollution sources in fact both the number and the distribution uniformity of microplastic types were considered in the calculation process of mdii so in addition to the number of pollution sources the mdii of a microplastic community is also affected by the distance from the pollution source and the pollution source s emission intensity therefore when the mdii value of microplastics in a specific place is very high we can speculate that there are multiple microplastics pollution sources in the place and the contributions of each source or the most essential sources are equivalent in contrast when the mdii value is very low in addition to having few pollution sources another reason is that one or a few sources make a dominant contribution to the area thus leading to a decrease in the uniformity of microplastics previous studies have also tried to calculate the diversity of microplastics and to speculate on the pollution sources of microplastics wang et al 2019b zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 calculated the polymer richness and diversity of microplastics by using the polymer types of microplastics wang et al 2019b divided microplastics into ten categories through literature review and based on this calculated the diversity of microplastics to reflect the complexity of microplastics pollution sources they all affirmed the indicative function of microplastic diversity on microplastic pollution sources however they did not fully consider the characteristics of microplastics and the source indicative function of the index has not been tested in this study the color shape and polymer information of microplastics were comprehensively considered when establishing the diversity index and the indicative function of microplastic diversity on pollution sources was fully verified since that the research on source analysis of microplastics has just started rochman and hoellein 2020 the mdii index may make important contributions to subsequent extensive source analysis 4 4 limitations and perspectives although we have tried to make our data and results rigorous and reliable limitations remain firstly due to the begnning of research on microplastics and the inconsistent sampling methods of microplastics at present we did not take the uniform minimum detection limit of microplastics as a criterion for screening data secondly although air is also a reservoir of microplastics there is still too little research on air microplastics to get a universal conclusion so we did not regard the air microplastics as one of the research objects in this study finally the microplastic diversity index established in this study can indicate the number of pollution sources the pollution sources here only refer to the pollution sources discharging few kinds of microplastics in the future it is urgent to develop a unified microplastic research method and air microplastics need to be widely studied the microplastic diversity integrated index we proposed is welcome to be widely tested and more source analysis of microplastics is needed 5 conclusion by integrating and analyzing research data on microplastics in five environments freshwater seawater freshwater sediment sea sediment and soil we found that there were significant differences in microplastics in different environments which were manifested in abundance proportion of small particle size microplastics shape composition color composition and polymer composition moreover the mantel test showed significant positive associations between microplastics composition in different environments and network analysis further confirmed the links between microplastic communities both in different sampling sites and in different environments furthermore the distance decay models showed that these links weakened with increasing geographic distance the significant positive correlations among the diversity indices of shape color and polymer types provided the prerequisite for indicating the number of pollution sources through the diversity of microplastics a comprehensive index the microplastic diversity integrated index mdii was established based on the simpson shape simpson color and simpson polymer indices to reflect the diversity of microplastics and to indicate the number of microplastic pollution sources the statistical fitting relationship between the number of industrial pollution sources and mdii verified the ability of mdii to indicate the number of pollution sources our study fills the research gap in the difference of microplastic assemblies in different environments and provides a basis for the risk assessment of microplastics our research on the links between microplastics in different environments provides evidence for the microplastic cycle and the establishment of mdii contributes to the source analysis of microplastics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
