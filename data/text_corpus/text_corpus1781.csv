8905,flood irrigation is widely applied in harvested croplands of arid regions and can be classified as autumn winter irrigation ai depending on the time of application due to its high water consumption real time monitoring of the ai extent is crucial to improve its scheduling we proposed a remote sensing based long short term memory lstm model for near real time monitoring of ai extent at sub pixel scale the model loosely coupled modis data with sentinel 2 data to solve the mixed pixel issue of modis data and calibrated sentinel 2 thresholds for ai identification by a random forest rf module to extract large scale reference data with high temporal frequencies the variable importance estimated by rf is used as a reference for feature screening in the lstm model as sentinel 2 images are not available daily lstm models trained with incomplete sequences were validated using multiple validation approaches the model was applied to the hetao irrigation district the largest irrigation district in arid region of china and delivered reasonable performance with coefficient of determination of over 0 82 and mean absolute error of around 10 7 classification of irrigation patterns using simulated time series of irrigation area fractions revealed eight different irrigation patterns from 2010 to 2020 in the study region results indicate that the maximum fraction of ai area upstream is closely related to the cropland distribution pattern the ai patterns changed significantly over the 11 years with a more pronounced reduction in irrigation duration for individual pixels in the downstream area these changes are associated with two important land policies implemented in many regions of china land consolidation and land transfer the proposed model demonstrates the potential for near real time monitoring of autumn irrigation extent within large irrigation districts which can aid in ai scheduling and provide insight into irrigation patterns and practices

introduction autumn winter irrigation ai or flood irrigation in harvested croplands is widely applied in late autumn to early winter in arid regions such as the hetao irrigation district hid in northwest china li et al 2012 ai is effective to leach excess soil salt increase soil moisture regulate soil temperature loosen the soil and or reduce cropland pests chang et al 2019 feng et al 2005 negri et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 to achieve these purposes large areas of cropland need to be irrigated with large amounts of water gao et al 2015 consequently pieces of surface water ponding form and last for several days after ai which has a great influence on water cycling energy transfer and salt transport processes in the irrigation district wu et al 2019 wen et al 2023 the extent timing and amount of ai are influenced by many factors and vary with year and irrigation district the conflict between water conservation policy in large irrigation districts and soil salinization control practice makes the ai problem more complex although the local irrigation management authority has a general ai plan the ai application depends highly on farmers desire for ai and irrigation water availability ren et al 2016 in recent years irrigation costs climate change and changes in cropping patterns have introduced uncertainties about whether and when farmers irrigate in autumn ren et al 2017 li et al 2022 therefore timely information about where when and how much ai is applied will benefit both hydrological studies and irrigation management in irrigation management practices this ai information helps irrigation administrations to improve irrigation schedules which is crucial for rational water allocation and control of soil salinization bwambale et al 2022 furthermore these pieces of information are fundamental inputs to agro hydrological models for irrigation districts which is essential to quantify the impact of ai on soil moisture soil salinity and crop growth lu et al 2019 wen et al 2022 2023 in practice information about irrigation including ai is generally obtained from statistical results of different levels of irrigation administrations where detailed spatiotemporal information on irrigation application is normally unavailable as an alternative satellite remote sensing has proven to be a valuable data source to extract detailed irrigation information at large scales both during crop growth karthikeyan et al 2020 and ai after crop harvest qian et al 2022 specifically optical remote sensing is highly effective in determining irrigation extent by identifying differences in the spectral indices of irrigated and non irrigated cropland ozdogan et al 2010 yao et al 2022 due to advances in the spatial resolution of optical remote sensing the precision of irrigation mapping during the crop growing season has improved significantly which has increased from 500 m pervez et al 2014 using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to 30 m using landsat xie et al 2019 and even to 10 m using sentinel 2 zurqani et al 2021 despite the notable progress in identifying irrigation during the crop growing season identifying autumn irrigation remains rare qian et al 2022 the primary challenge in identifying autumn irrigation lies in the need for high temporal resolution remote sensing data as the surface water ponding caused by irrigation typically lasts for only a few days current identification methods primarily rely on modis data with daily temporal resolution wang et al 2021 qian et al 2022 however the moderate spatial resolution of modis can lead to significant uncertainties in precise mapping of smaller irrigated lands pervez et al 2014 to overcome this limitation researchers have proposed using multi sensor data such as combining sentinel 2 landsat and modis data to provide complementary information that can be used to improve the accuracy of irrigation identification dao et al 2019 xiao et al 2022 for example qian et al 2022 used sentinel 2 data to assess the accuracy of modis based ai detection but the mixed pixel issue remained unsolved another option is to use spatiotemporal fusion models to spatially downscale the modis imagery chen et al 2018a however their usage is generally restricted to small areas short periods and low temporal resolutions due to the high computational requirements fuentes et al 2019 therefore an alternative approach is to estimate autumn irrigation area fractions aiafs in in each modis pixel from the corresponding sentinel 2 data this approach can ameliorate the mixed pixel issue of modis and is more suitable for addressing long term large scale and less location specific problems liu et al 2018 the goal of real time monitoring of irrigation extent can be achieved by continuously observing changes in the aiaf for each pixel across the irrigation district the basis to accurately acquire aiafs in a modis pixel from sentinel 2 images is to classify sentinel 2 pixels into ai and non ai pixels thenkabail et al 2007 the use of water indices and thresholds is a common classification method because ai lands are similar to small and shallow water bodies the classification accuracy depends on the optimal threshold value which can be determined manually or using automated methods casal 2022 automated methods are more suitable for classifications that need to be performed at large spatial scales and frequent time intervals however automated methods based on image segmentation such as the otsu thresholding method otsu et al 1979 are not suitable for ai classification due to the lack of distinct spectral contrast between small wetlands and autumn irrigated lands ludwig et al 2019 and the difficulty in forming a bimodal probability density distribution in the early ai period automated methods based on statistical area data calibration xie and lark 2021 do not have these limitations but require all pixels to have feature values for discrimination due to the revisit cycle of 2 5 days for sentinel 2 and cloud issues many ai lands were not presented in the limited sentinel 2 images consequently the availability of directly calculated aiafs is restricted to a finite number of dates and regions and the statistical ai area cannot be used directly to calibrate the automated methods this therefore calls for a novel approach to use statistical data to set thresholds for water surface identification at irrigation district scale in case of insufficient images to estimate daily aiafs at irrigation district scale it is necessary to develop a regression relationship between available aiaf data and daily modis series long short term memory lstm network in the field of deep learning has already been widely used to handle time series data van houdt et al 2020 it can address sequence to sequence regression problems and is therefore well suited to capture the ai dynamic currently the application of lstm models to irrigation related problems is still in its infancy which is mainly used to simulate yield cao et al 2021 groundwater table zhang et al 2018 and evapotranspiration yin et al 2020 to support irrigation management these studies can be further classified into station scale sequence to sequence regression yin et al 2020 and pixel scale sequence to one regression cao et al 2021 however the problem of daily aiafs estimation is the pixel scale sequence to sequence regression problem since individual field or pixel based monitoring helps to understand how changes in ai extent respond to changes in management and environment jeong et al 2022 the desired regression model should have a stronger spatial temporal generalization and can be applied across pixels with different attributes main objective of this study is to propose a novel model for near real time nrt monitoring of the evolution of ai extent at sub pixel scale which is applied to five sub irrigation districts of the hid nrt is defined here as a lag of no more than one day from the time of irrigation application to the time of being monitored shen et al 2019 this work overcomes several key challenges in mapping aiaf series including accurate extraction of aiafs from sentinel 2 data based on automatically calibrated thresholds by indirectly using statistical ai area and the random forest rf algorithm and screening features as lstm input based on the variable importance calculated by rf so that the lstm model can better handle time series regression problems besides nrt monitoring of irrigation extent we also divided different ai patterns in hid according to the irrigation procedure curves of different years which will help to further understand the irrigation practices in different areas 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid located upstream of the yellow river fig 1 is the largest irrigation district in arid region of china it is characterized by scarce precipitation and strong potential evaporation due to its arid to semi arid continental climate therefore irrigation is critical for agriculture in hid the whole hid is composed of five sub irrigation districts wulanbuhe wlbh jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and wulate wlt from southwest to northeast fig 1 the hid is about 1 189 million ha of which 62 is irrigated cropland mainly cultivated with corn sunflower and wheat because of the special household contract responsibility system for farmland use in china agricultural land is divided into pieces of small household farms resulting in fragmented cropping patterns in hid ren et al 2016 meanwhile cultivation field management and irrigation vary greatly among different crops and years ren et al 2016 therefore multiple irrigation water use patterns may exist simultaneously even at small scales the groundwater table depth varies greatly from 0 5 m to 3 0 m annually resulting in frequent water salt exchanges between soil and groundwater and consequently soil salinization in many parts of the hid therefore a large amount of ai is required to leach soil salt and increase soil water storage in the hid which accounts for approximately 1 3 of the total irrigation water diversion lu et al 2019 consequently ai is one of the main factors affecting soil moisture soil salinity and groundwater table in the hid 2 2 data and preprocessing data used in this study mainly include modis data from 2010 to 2020 and sentinel 2 data from 2016 to 2020 land use maps in 2010 and 2020 statistical ai area for different sub irrigation districts from 2010 to 2020 and field survey data in 2019 and 2020 remote sensing data include the modis surface reflectance product mod09ga and the sentinel 2 toa top of atmosphere reflectance product the mod09ga has spatial and temporal resolutions of 463 m and 1 day respectively which is available from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov meanwhile sentinel 2 has spatial and temporal resolutions of 10 60 m and 2 5 days respectively and can be downloaded from gee google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 because the surface reflectance data of sentinel 2 is available for a very limited time on gee we used toa data that has been widely used in detecting surface water inundation du et al 2016 seaton et al 2020 qian et al 2022 we retained the original projection of the modis images to avoid loss of information chen et al 2016 and the sentinel 2 images were reprojected to the same as the modis images the sentinel 2 images were resampled to a suitable resolution that both approximates the original resolution and facilitates subsequent aiaf calculations for modis for both modis and sentinel 2 images clouds cloud shadows and snow were masked an adaptive weighted savitzky golay s g filter and a moving average with a window size of three days were applied to the modis band index series to reduce noise and smooth the curves weights of bands indices on different days were assigned based on quality control parameters of the mod09ga products qian et al 2022 globeland30 http globallandcover com is a high precision global land cover product developed by ministry of natural resources of china which was used to generate land use maps of the hid for 2010 and 2020 fig 2 a and b the globeland30 has a high cropland mapping precision in the hid qian et al 2022 and is therefore suitable for aiaf simulation statistical ai area for different sub irrigation districts from 2010 to 2020 was obtained from the water resources development center of hetao irrigation district and the bayannur institute of water conservancy research field surveys were conducted on october 19 24 in 2019 and october 21 25 in 2020 to collect sampling points for validation the survey fields are classified into autumn irrigation land ail and non autumn irrigation land nail nail can be subdivided into fields that were not irrigated up to the surveying day nails and during the whole ai period nailp each survey field was pinpointed by recording the latitude and longitude of the four vertices using a juno sa handheld computer with gnss global navigation satellite system trimble usa due to the sentinel 2 revisit cycle and cloud issues only one or two sentinel 2 images are available during a sampling period and only about a dozen images are available in the whole ai period from late september to middle november moreover these images may not cover the whole study region therefore not all sampling points can be used for validation as shown in fig 2 c and d 58 589 ail sampling points and 45 457 nails sampling points are available for validation in 2019 2020 respectively the total number of ail nails sentinel 2 pixels extracted from sampling points in 2019 and 2020 are 2593 2683 and 72550 152684 respectively 3 methodology the nrt monitoring of ai extent includes two core modules fig 3 i e one rf module to simulate the final aiafs faiafs and one lstm module to simulate the aiaf time series the first module uses the rf algorithm due to its satisfactory performance in regression models masiliūnas et al 2021 and its ability to handle high dimensional and multi collinear variables xie and lark 2021 it is used to select suitable ai thresholds for sentinel 2 images to extract reference data at a large scale and high frequency and to identify important features for the lstm module the second module uses the lstm algorithm as it can capture complex time dependencies of the sequence and is easier to train and scale than other recurrent neural networks yin et al 2020 it aims to obtain a well performing model for nrt aiaf simulations same as qian et al 2022 all the croplands and grasslands in 2010 and 2020 land use maps in the north of the flood bank of the yellow river were taken as potential croplands all pixels with the area fraction of potential cropland greater than zero were used for further detection of ai events the simulation was conducted on each sub irrigation district since sub districts have different soil textures landscape characteristics cropping patterns and locations that can lead to different irrigation decisions 3 1 brief introductions to rf and lstm network 3 1 1 rf the rf is an ensemble model consisting of multiple decision trees classification and regression trees cart breiman 2001 which is widely used to solve classification and regression problems the rf approach involves three main steps 1 training sets generation the training set for each decision tree is generated using the bootstrapping method 2 decision trees generation for each decision tree a subset of features is randomly selected as splitting features for each internal node and the nodes are split using the best splitting feature and cutting point that can locally maximize the gini index according to the selected features the branches of each tree are not pruned back 3 results generation the final output is obtained using a majority vote scheme for classification problems or an average of the outputs of all decision trees for regression problems 3 1 2 lstm network the lstm network hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is an improved application of recurrent neural networks that can handle long term dependencies an lstm network has two main layers where the sequence input layer feeds sequence data into the network and the lstm layer learns long term dependencies of sequence data and time series between time steps the lstm layer consists of two types of states the cell state and the hidden or output state the cell state carries the information along with all the timestamps long term memory while the hidden state carries information from the immediately previous step short term memory the layer adds information to or removes information from the cell state at each time step by using three multiplicative gates forget gate input gate and output gate they work with the cell candidate to update the current state of the cell formulations of the lstm structure are given by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 fig 4 the matrices of input weights w recurrent weights r and bias of each component b for the lstm network are concatenated as follows 1 w w i w f w g w o r r i r f r g r o b b i b f b g b o where subscripts i f g and o refer to the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate respectively the cell state at time step t is given by 2 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where ct f t i t and g t are cell state forget gate input gate and cell candidate at time step t respectively and refers to the hadamard product element wise multiplication of vectors the hidden state at time step t is given by 3 h t o t σ c c t where h t o t and σ c denote the hidden state and output gate at time step t and state activation function respectively this study uses the hyperbolic tangent function tanh as the state activation function the components at time step t are described by 4 i t σ g w i x t r i h t 1 b i 5 f t σ g w f x t r f h t 1 b f 6 g t σ c w g x t r g h t 1 b g 7 o t σ g w o x t r o h t 1 b o where x t is the input vector at time step t and σ g denotes the gate activation function this study uses the sigmoid function σ x 1 e x 1 as the gate activation function finally the output at time step t y t can be obtained from 8 y t σ g w y h t b y 3 2 rf model development qian et al 2022 found that multi band water index mbwi wang et al 2018 performed better for ai detection using modis data which was also chosen for ai detection using sentinel 2 data in this study however the thresholding method used in qian et al 2022 for modis data does not apply to sentinel 2 data because sentinel 2 data are not available on a daily scale therefore an appropriate model is required to select the appropriate threshold for sentinel 2 data here we used the statistical ai area to calibrate the threshold through a serial rf module faiafs at modis pixels with sentinel 2 data can be estimated using a specified threshold for sentinel 2 mbwi mbwist which are then used to train the rf regression model for each sub irrigation district the trained rf models are then used to estimate the faiafs at modis pixels and ai areas in the sub irrigation district the optimal threshold for each sub irrigation district is finally calibrated based on statistical ai area in the calibration period 3 2 1 input features four groups of features including temporal features spectral features land use and land cover lulc features and soil texture features were considered in the regression model table c1 temporal features were extracted from the modis mbwi and ndvi time series according to qian et al 2022 five characteristic points divide the curve into different characteristic periods in the mbwi curve filtered by an adaptive weighted savitzky golay filter fig 5 point a represents the valley of the smoothed mbwi curve before ai points b and d represent the threshold value of modis data mbwimt in the increasing and decreasing segments of the mbwi curve after ai point c represents peak value of the smoothed mbwi curve and point e represents the first valley of the smoothed mbwi curve after ai mbwimt was calibrated for each sub irrigation district in qian et al 2022 using the statistical ai area the dates and mbwi values of points a b and c were used as temporal features excluding the date of point b which is not available for some pixels details about the method to determine points a and c can be found in appendix a in addition the mbwi values of the filtered curve without moving average need to be considered because the three day moving average may miss the accurate aiaf information the date of point c and the filtered mbwi values on its previous and next days were selected considering that the antecedent moisture conditions also affect the detection of actual aiaf the maximum minimum mean and standard deviation of mbwi values from august 1 to september 10 were calculated as representative of the antecedent moisture conditions for each pixel and used as input features for the rf model this period contains the last irrigation of the crop growth period and precedes the autumn irrigation besides crop phenology information is a strong indicator of crop types that influence ai schedule feng et al 2005 and we extracted the start of season sos end of season eos and the maximum ndvi from ndvi time series chen et al 2018b during the growing season before ai as input features for the rf model spectral features are the band index values except mbwi associated with point c including the commonly used normalized difference water index ndwi vegetation index drought index and built up index as well as green band table b1 land use features are land cover fractions of modis pixels where the fractions of water bodies impervious surfaces bare land and potential cropland are mainly considered water bodies and impervious surfaces also have high water index values which can be easily confused with the ai phenomenon wang et al 2018 bare land and vegetation in a pixel result in decreased water index values of the mixed pixel the potential cropland fraction in a pixel indicates the maximum possible ai fraction since land use maps are only available for 2010 and 2020 they do not adequately cover the years between 2010 and 2020 we created annual land cover fraction maps based on the two existing land use products by using a simple index threshold method see appendix b for details soil texture features were obtained from the harmonized world soil database with a scale of 1 1 000 000 within china the information about fractions of clay sand and silt along with soil salinity of the topsoil was used finally 34 input features table c1 were chosen which were resampled to the modis resolution for further use 3 2 2 assumption and sample generation data sparsity is a major challenge for mapping irrigation area fractions since regression favors the mean it is difficult for regression models to accurately predict 0 and 100 fractions masiliūnas et al 2021 therefore only pixels with non zero cropland fractions can be used as model input moreover aiaf was calculated as the ratio of irrigated area to total pixel area rather than to cropland area to reduce the probability of 100 fraction samples were selected by assuming that faiaf corresponds to the aiaf of the peak point c in the mbwi curve according to qian et al 2022 the mbwi curve can reflect the aiaf dynamics in segment ac of the curve fig 5 irrigation continues to be applied within the pixel under consideration although parts of the irrigated fields may no longer be wet during ac period that they cannot be identified as irrigated land their areas are negligible this is because it takes a long time from the start of irrigation to the complete drying of the ground therefore only fields that were irrigated early and with shallower water are likely to dry up the irrigation stops in segment cd of the curve therefore point c is assumed to correspond to the final and maximum aiaf moreover this assumption is also a special case of the assumption in the linear spectral mixture model singer and mccord 1979 that the reflectance of an individual pixel is linearly related to its endmember reflectance because mbwi is a linear combination of multiple bands reflectance therefore an increase in the aiaf will lead to an increase in mbwi value and maximum aiaf faiaf corresponds to the peak mbwi this assumption will be further validated in the following analysis consequently pixels that have sentinel 2 data on the corresponding date of point c were selected as the samples based on the spatial relationship between modis and sentinel 2 pixels aiaf of the sample was calculated by the number of sentinel 2 pixels that are irrigated at a modis pixel by comparing the mbwi value of sentinel 2 with the threshold mbwist 3 2 3 model calibration accuracy assessment and variable importance we used a fixed mbwist for each sub irrigation district from 2016 to 2020 because the application of fixed thresholds to water indices remains an effective method for delineating aquatic ecosystems borro et al 2014 lefebvre et al 2019 statistical ai area data from 2016 to 2020 consistent with the years with available sentinel 2 data were used to calibrate mbwist and those from 2010 to 2015 for validation the identified ai areas from qian et al 2022 were used to calibrate the model of wlt because the statistical data from 2016 to 2020 for wlt was incongruent with other years stratified random sampling method with a 4 1 ratio was used to obtain the training and testing datasets during the initial calibration round these divided samples were then used in the subsequent calibration process to ensure that sample selection does not affect the calibration mbwist corresponding to the minimum mean absolute relative error mare between the simulated and statistical area in the calibration period was selected and applied to the validation period it is necessary to determine whether the differences in mare of different rfs are due to different parameters thresholds or associated with poor simulation of the rfs themselves therefore the accuracies of different rfs for aiaf simulation during training and testing periods should be compared which were assessed using three metrics including coefficient of determination r 2 aiaf root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae between simulated and reference aiafs eqs 9 12 additionally the sentinel 2 ai distribution maps generated under the calibrated mbwist were also validated against field sampling points using overall accuracy oa eq 13 specifically ail was used to validate the distributions of ai corresponding to the sampling dates whereas nails was used to validate the distributions of ai up to the sampling dates 9 mare 1 t m 1 t s sim m s ref m s ref m 10 r 2

sample i n is the total number of samples aiaf sim and aiaf ref are the average values of simulated and reference aiafs for n samples n ail and n nails are the number of correctly classified points for ail and nails n is the total number of all samples variable importance was calculated by permutated variable importance measure pvim breiman 2001 to identify the relative contribution of input features to regression accuracy pvim is one of the most widely used variable importance measures to date it measures the importance of a feature by calculating the average reduction in oob out of bag accuracy after randomly permuting the feature across all decision trees the more decrease in oob accuracy the more important the feature is we specified the interaction test to account for predictor interactions and identify important variables in cases when there are variables that have relatively fewer distinct values or there are many irrelevant variables loh 2002 3 3 lstm model development 3 3 1 model settings the input features for lstm were mainly selected from the top ranked features in terms of pvim calculated by the above rf model to estimate daily aiaf features corresponding to the date of point c were replaced with the features corresponding to the day of irrigation besides three other principles were also considered in selecting the input features first although correlated variables provide important complementary information that facilitates model learning it can also lead to multicollinearity that biases the variable importance metrics molnar 2019 it has been shown that multicollinearity affects only the specific independent variables that are correlated frost 2019 therefore when selecting features feature importance by group can be evaluated first xie et al 2019 followed by intra group features that may be correlated to each other second features associated with dates or time intervals need to be retained the revisit cycle of sentinel 2 and cloud cover make the sample series have missing values at irregular time intervals the ability of lstm to construct regression models directly on incomplete data can be enhanced by adding features about the time intervals between missing values weerakody et al 2021 third features whose values are only available at the end of the irrigation period are removed to achieve the goal of nrt simulation aiaf series of the samples were calculated by dividing the number of sentinel pixels whose mbwi values are above the calibrated mbwist by the total number of sentinel pixels within each modis pixel for dates with sentinel 2 data samples with a time series length greater than or equal to 3 for jfz and 2 for other sub irrigation districts and with at least one positive aiaf were chosen as representative samples since a large number of samples are required for the training of lstm models cao et al 2021 similar to the rf model all samples were divided into training and testing datasets in a 4 1 ratio using stratified random sampling the lstm model was trained from the training datasets using adam optimizer and further tested with testing datasets 3 3 2 accuracy assessment the model is validated from two aspects one is the training and testing accuracies of the model trained with incomplete sequence input feature vector concatenation matrix corresponding to the dates when sentinel 2 data is available and the second is the validation results of feeding complete sequence input daily continuous feature vector concatenation matrix into the model the complete sequence input is fed into the model to simulate daily aiaf time series of each pixel in different years we compared the aiaf extracted by sentinel 2 with the aiaf of the same date in the complete aiaf time series using r 2 aiaf rmse and mae to demonstrate the ability of the model to handle incomplete sequence input additionally the last value of aiaf time series as faiaf is also compared with the reference values extracted by sentinel 2 and the results of rf model simulation and the calculated ai area is also compared with the statistical ai area 3 4 classification of autumn irrigation patterns the complete aiaf time series at pixel scale obtained from lstm simulations are classified to identify different ai patterns the classification features include faiaf irrigation duration irrigation concentration and the period of irrigation concentration irrigation concentration is measured by irrigation frequency from the start of ai to cumulative aiaf reaching 75 faiaf and the interval between irrigations less frequent and shorter irrigation intervals represent more concentrated irrigation the period of irrigation concentration is defined as the number of days from the start of irrigation to the occurrence of the first second third largest daily aiafs divided by the length of entire time series k means cluster mcqueen 1967 was applied to principal components of the feature variables extracted using principal component analysis vidal et al 2016 for the automatic identification of different irrigation patterns 4 results 4 1 performance of rf model for faiaf simulation 4 1 1 threshold estimation quality of training samples and accuracy assessment based on the sample generation rule 2971 6831 3810 3643 and 2671 samples were generated in wlbh jfz yj yc and wlt respectively fig 6 shows that mbwist has less influence on the training and testing accuracies of the rf model compared to the reference data extracted from sentinel 2 indicating that the rf model accuracy has little effect on the selection of mbwist from performance metrics of the models corresponding to the calibrated mbwist values shown in table 1 the calibrated model performs well in each sub irrigation district with mae less than 11 and r 2 aiaf more than 0 80 during the testing period for all sub irrigation districts it can also be found from table 1 that calibrated thresholds for sentinel 2 mbwist is generally equal to or slightly greater than those for modis mbwimt in the same sub irrigation district because the smaller pixel size of sentinel 2 makes it more likely to be pure water or bare soil pixel however the differences between mbwist and mbwimt are small which is mainly caused by different feature variables used in modis and sentinel 2 classification modis uses the maximum mbwi value which is mainly used for detecting deeper water bodies sentinel 2 on the other hand uses mbwi values for a specified date to detect all water bodies including very shallow ones another reason for the difference in thresholds is that sentinel 2 uses toa reflectance while modis uses surface reflectance by comparing the ai area calculated using faiaf with statistical data mares for the validation period from 2010 to 2015 ranged from 2 66 to 12 7 with an average value of 8 62 for the five sub irrigation districts table 2 the obtained results suggest a good performance for faiaf simulation in hid the mare for jfz is significantly lower than other sub irrigation districts which may be caused by the large ai area in jfz the mare for wlbh is the greatest but it is less than 10 and acceptable fragmented cropland large areas of sandy soils and the abrupt appearance and disappearance of lakes in recent years in wlbh wang et al 2020 have made the precision simulation of ai area more difficult in wlbh as compared with other sub irrigation districts overall the mares ranged from 4 1 to 9 6 in different sub irrigation districts from 2010 to 2020 therefore the trained rf model can be applied to simulate faiaf with satisfactory accuracy the overall accuracies of ai distribution maps derived from sentinel 2 using the calibrated mbwist values are greater than 98 across different sub irrigation districts table 3 against sampling points due to sentinel 2 revisit cycles and cloud issues only a few distribution maps were validated however since the sampling points were distributed evenly throughout the irrigation district and were marked against the boundaries of irrigated and non irrigated fields the high accuracy validation results demonstrate the ability of sentinel 2 to extract ai information accurately 4 1 2 variable importance generally there are similarities in the variable importance rankings for each sub irrigation district with a significant overlap in the top ranked variables fig 7 fractions of cropland fcrop and impervious surfaces fimp are usually the most important variables the fraction of cropland determines the upper limit of faiaf and is even directly related to the fraction of irrigation in hid to some extent notably fractions of cropland appear to play a more important role in wlbh jfz and yj than in yc and wlt which is mainly caused by the difference in cropping patterns in yc and wlt where a higher proportion of sunflowers are planted wen et al 2019 the fraction of cropland is not as significant as in other sub irrigation districts because sunflowers are rarely autumn irrigated in the previous year impervious surfaces also have high water index values which may be confused with the ai phenomenon although water bodies can cause the same problem they are of less importance this is mainly because cropland borders more on urban rural areas and therefore impervious surfaces dominate over water bodies in the mixed pixels we studied soil texture variables are of little significance for all sub irrigation districts most likely because their coarser spatial resolution 1000 m fails to capture detailed ai information at smaller cropland scale the mbwi of point c was found to be the most significant temporal and spectral feature for all sub irrigation districts this suggests that mbwi is more effective than other water indices e g ndwi42 and ndwi46 in estimating aiaf although the higher correlation between these indices makes their relative importance difficult to quantify conclusively the remaining spectral and temporal features play low to moderate roles with little spatial variability most features contribute less to the regression of wlbh and wlt indicating the complexity in estimating aiaf in these two sub irrigation districts and the necessity of combining modis derived and other features to obtain better regression results 4 2 performance of lstm network for aiaf time series simulation according to the principles described in section 3 3 1 approximately ten features were selected for the lstm model for each sub irrigation district table c2 the hyperparameters of the lstm used are also shown in table c2 the aiaf time series simulation for four randomly selected pixels in each sub irrigation district are depicted in fig 8 qualitative assessment showed that the simulated time series can well reflect the general trend of the actual aiaf time series and can capture the key turning point however it can be noticed that the model tends to slightly underestimate high values and overestimate low values thus produces smooth predictions with less variation compared to the actual irrigation patterns the quantitative results of lstm model accuracies for each sub irrigation district are shown in table 4 the results show that accuracy metrics between the simulation and reference aiafs extracted from sentinel 2 in all sub irrigation districts during training and testing periods are all in satisfactory range with r 2 aiaf of more than 0 82 rmse of less than 14 and mae of less than 13 the average mae for all sub irrigation districts during the testing period is 10 7 this suggests that lstm model has the potential to monitor ai dynamics the model accuracy of jfz is slightly lower than other sub irrigation districts because the sequences of samples put into the lstm model of jfz are longer and therefore the time dependence between the series is more complicated the simulation from complete input was validated using the same reference data as used in the testing period for the lstm model the results show that accuracy is slightly decreased for wlbh yc and wlt compared with that in the model testing period this suggests that the model accuracy is affected by incomplete input training which is expected since it is a data based regression model however the decrease in accuracy is within an acceptable range the mae is still around 10 and the highest mae is 12 75 table 4 the model accuracy varies the least for jfz because the sequence length of its training samples is longer and therefore closer to the complete sequences from the comparisons of simulated faiaf values simulated with rf and lstm network models their coefficients of determination are all greater than 0 92 for wlbh jfz yc and wlt while slightly lower 0 86 for yj these results indicate that these two models are in good agreement to simulate faiaf however according to the comparisons with sentinel 2 reference data the rf model provides more accurate simulations of faiafs table 5 than lstm where the r 2 aiaf and rmse for the lstm model are ranging from 0 77 to 0 85 and 14 07 16 72 respectively meanwhile we can also obtain the ai area calculated by faiaf derived from lstm simulation so far we have obtained the ai area calculated using three models i e threshold based model qian et al 2022 rf model and lstm model overall a good agreement is observed across all sub irrigation districts in different years for the three models where no model significantly over and or underestimated the ai area compared with statistics through zero crossing linear regression table 5 the rf model gives the highest coefficients of determination from 0 94 to 1 00 between simulated and statistical ai area r 2 s followed by the threshold based model r 2 s from 0 93 to 1 00 these two models give similar results across all sub irrigation districts in different years however the lstm model has lower accuracy in estimating irrigated area during small water diversion years besides the lstm model itself another possible reason for such results is that both the threshold based model and the rf model are generated through statistical based optimization while the lstm is not the overall accuracy assessment results show that the lstm model trained with incomplete sequences is capable of acquiring accurate and comprehensive information about aiaf dynamics 4 3 assumption validation the above method assumes that aiaf is essentially rising until point c and no longer rising after it i e aiaf at point c is the faiaf the assumption is considered valid if the difference between aiaf corresponding to point c and the maximum value of simulated aiaf series is within 2 because of inherent fluctuations in the model simulation to verify this assumption we extended the length of simulated sequence to three days after point c to get faiaf we calculated the proportion of pixels in each sub irrigation district that did not meet the assumption p the mean difference md between the aiaf of point c and the maximum aiaf for pixels that did not meet the assumption and the product of p and md serror which are used to quantify the error introduced by using statistical ai area to calibrate mbwist table 6 it is observed that the proportion of pixels satisfying the assumption 1 p across each sub irrigation district is mostly above 80 while the md and serror values are approximately 5 0 and less than 1 respectively therefore the results show that the assumption is approximately valid and subsequent calibration of mbwist with statistical ai area is feasible 4 4 autumn irrigation trends in hid 4 4 1 spatial temporal distribution of final autumn irrigation area fraction the rf model produced annual faiaf maps from 2010 to 2020 across the hid fig 9 faiaf maps showed similar distribution patterns to the ai extent maps of qian et al 2022 but it provided more pixels with low irrigation fractions that are easily ignored when using a simple threshold based model to classify a pixel into irrigated non irrigated one the annual faiaf distribution maps revealed the characteristics and areal trends of ai in sub irrigation districts across time faiaf is manually divided into four levels by the quartiles i e low 0 25 medium low 25 50 medium high 50 75 and high 75 100 the cropland distribution pattern has a significant influence on the proportion of faiaf at each level for the upstream sub irrigation districts the low level faiaf is more than 60 for wlbh fig 10 due to its fragmented cropland distribution pattern surrounded by desert fig 2 in contrast the medium high and above levels of faiaf in jfz exceeds 60 because of its highly concentrated cropland especially corn that requires ai the proportion of faiaf across the whole hid at each level showed no significant change from 2010 to 2020 with an average of 38 19 21 and 22 for the four levels respectively however the proportion of low level faiaf in jfz and yc showed an increasing trend in recent years which may be caused by the increase in sunflower planting area in jfz and yc in recent years wen et al 2019 4 4 2 spatial temporal distribution of autumn irrigation patterns the ai patterns in hid were finally classified into eight classes based on the elbow criterion syakur et al 2018 and the comparison of classification results for different classification numbers the mean values of the feature variables of the eight classes varied in wide ranges table 7 according to the mean values faiaf can be divided into three categories i e high medium and low both the duration and irrigation concentration can be divided into two categories i e long and short durations and concentrated and scattered irrigations the concentration time can be divided into four categories i e early early and late medium and late and late therefore the eight classes represent eight categories of irrigation patterns given in detail in table 7 fig 11 depicts the distribution of ai patterns in hid irrigation patterns were mainly influenced by the local irrigation systems and agricultural management practices thus there was no obvious spatial distribution pattern however a concentrated pattern dominates because the suitable time for ai application is after crop harvest in general wlbh is dominated by lsce and llsel patterns jfz by hlce and hsce patterns yj by hlce and lsce patterns yc by lsce pattern and wlt by lsce and lscl patterns in recent years there have been significant changes in irrigation patterns fig 12 the area of sc short concentrated pattern tends to increase while that of lc long concentrated tends to decrease except in 2015 due to the construction of water projects liu 2017 and significant changes in cropping patterns wen et al 2019 the regions with significant changes in ai patterns are mainly concentrated downstream of the hid including wlt eastern and southern yc and northern yj the change in irrigation patterns is strongly linked to the advancement of land policy reform in china overall the detailed dynamic irrigation patterns shown in maps can help in better water management practices in hid 5 discussion in this study we proposed a model that can monitor nrt changes in flood irrigation extent at the sub pixel scale over a large irrigation district the model includes two main modules which use rf and lstm algorithms to achieve the goals of extracting large scale training samples and simulating aiaf time series in nrt respectively in general the proposed model performs well in each of the five sub irrigation districts of hid however the model also has some drawbacks that need to be improved in further studies there are two main drawbacks to the rf module first we used a threshold method to automatically extract reference information at large scale and frequent time scale which were used as training samples in the rf model the rf algorithm is combined with the common calibration process to calibrate the thresholds mbwist given the image incompleteness a static threshold was used to allow the model to be used in multi years especially for years regions without sentinel 2 records as well as to achieve near real time simulations in all subsequent years this may result in some loss of model accuracy ludwig et al 2019 but our results show that the accuracy is satisfactory second correlations exist between the feature variables of the model as in many other irrigated land identification models deines et al 2019 multicollinearity reduces the capacity of the model to identify independent variables that are statistically significant and weakens the data interpretability of the model although regression remains robust for these correlations molnar 2019 however there is still no relatively perfect way to deal with this problem frost 2019 moreover the influence of correlation on variable importance can be complex some studies concluded that correlation tends to rank the correlated variables higher strobl et al 2007 zhang and yang 2020 while others argued that the importance of associated features decreases when a correlated feature is added because the importance is split between correlated features molnar 2019 variable importance ranking fig 7 shows that none of the spectral features stand out in importance although they are indispensable for the model this could be attributed to the splitting of importance among highly correlated spectral features in summary the variable importance ranking results highlight some promising features that may be useful for ai detection in large scale or data scarce regions in the lstm module the main weakness is the problems inherent to the model itself for example lstm model tends to generate smoothed simulations fig 8 as other regression methods which results in a lower variation range compared to actual ai patterns nguyen and bae 2020 moreover multi step regression with a standard lstm model is subject to error accumulation zhang et al 2021 which can explain why the lstm model is not as effective as rf for faiafs simulations table 5 last but not least the lstm model as with any deep learning model has a data intensive nature that may limit its use in data scarce problems tian et al 2021 the lack of sentinel 2 reference data in this study makes the lstm model learn insufficient information during the training process although we increased the number of samples by reducing the requirements for sample sequence length the quality of samples may deteriorate li et al 2021 the model can be further improved with more sentinel 2 reference data accumulated in the future allowing the lstm model to learn more from more learning samples the model can provide us with daily inundation extent that can be used as input to the agro hydrological models facilitating our understanding of the hydrological processes influenced by ai especially the lateral groundwater flow that is an important channel for water and salt exchange between irrigated and non irrigated lands wen et al 2022 this is important for the determination of water conservation intensity and control of salinity levels ren et al 2016 in addition this model can be applied to other studies that require real time monitoring of inundation extent such as monitoring of flood hazards extent and agricultural managed aquifer recharge extent ganot and dahlke 2021 these studies rely heavily on detecting surface water bodies that are usually large scale and short term similar to those formed by ai sakamoto et al 2007 the present model can address the problem of suboptimal representation of the instantaneous distribution of floods provided by modis only mohammadi et al 2017 irrigation patterns classified by features extracted from aiaf time series revealed some new patterns of ai in hid the significant changes in irrigation patterns in hid over recent years provided evidence for the implementation of land consolidation policy and land transfer policy the land consolidation project of hid was launched by an agreement signed by the provincial government and the ministry of finance of china in january 2008 meanwhile orderly land transfer has been supported and encouraged on all scales since 2008 in china xu et al 2018 land consolidation forms more rational landholdings by rearranging fragmented land plots and their ownership while land transfer to large professional operators can promote moderate scale rural land management furthermore land consolidation can promote the transfer of land management rights jiang et al 2022 as it allows larger areas of highly productive land to be used together these two policies have resulted in more concentrated crop distribution patterns and led to a gradual change in irrigation water use from scattered small scale and sloppy to concentrated large scale and specialized moreover they are of greater importance for downstream areas because the cropland downstream was initially more uneven and disorganized last but not least significant changes in ai patterns can have an impact on groundwater tables and water salt transport from irrigated land to non irrigated lands therefore cropping patterns and ai patterns should be given priority when implementing water saving measures that have requirements for groundwater table and soil salinization control 6 conclusions this study addressed the scientific and practical needs to monitor autumn irrigation extent in near real time at an appropriate spatial resolution which helps to capture irrigation dynamics and water use and thus develop dynamic irrigation schedules and assess associated environmental issues to address the gaps in knowledge and data we applied two models including lstm models and rf models the lstm model was applied to irrigation monitoring and to solve the problem of mixed pixels of modis data by loosely coupling modis with sentinel 2 data the rf module was used to solve the problem caused by incomplete image series and to select features for the lstm model the model performance was tested with reference data at pixel scale r 2 aiaf over 0 82 mae around 10 7 and statistical ai area at sub irrigation district scale r 2 s of 0 84 0 99 respectively indicating that the model precision was satisfactory we generated annual faiaf distributions as well as annual ai pattern distributions based on simulated aiaf time series classifications from 2010 to 2020 based on these 11 years of data we found that for the upstream of irrigation district faifa is closely related to the cropland distribution pattern meanwhile we found an increase in areas with short duration and concentrated irrigation and a decrease in areas with long duration and concentrated irrigation the regions with significant changes in ai patterns are mainly concentrated downstream of the hid changes in irrigation patterns reflect the effect of two important land policies land consolidation and land transfer implemented in china and can have a significant impact on the groundwater table and water salt redistribution between irrigated non irrigated fields finally the model is temporally applicable to other years and expected to perform better with more sentinel 2 data accumulation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

curve to determine point c in the mbwi curve fig 5 qian et al 2022 provided detailed instructions for pixels with maximum mbwi value exceeding mbwimt while for pixels with maximum mbwi value smaller than mbwimt point c is taken as the peak point of the curve the determination of point a is also divided into two cases depending on whether maximum mbwi value exceeds mbwimt or not the difference between the two cases is the choice of the reference point i e point b has to be selected if mbwimt is exceeded otherwise point c has to be selected once a reference point is fixed point a can be determined by finding the first point from the reference point such that it satisfies the following specified conditions 1 the mbwi value of the point needs to be less than or equal to the average mbwi value from august 1 to september 10 and the distance between the point and the reference point is less than 40 days 2 if the point satisfying 1 does not exist the mbwi value of the point needs to be less than or equal to the maximum mbwi value from august 1 to september 10 3 if the above two conditions still fail to find point a then if the mbwi value on september 10 is less than the mbwi value of point b point a will be designated as the point on september 10 otherwise point a is considered to overlap with point b appendix b land use mapping and statistics of land cover fractions the main steps for land cover fractions calculation are 1 completing approximate land use maps from 2011 to 2019 based on the globeland30 datasets in 2010 and 2020 and modis derived indices 2 calculating the area ratios of five land cover types i e potential cropland other vegetation types bare land impervious surfaces and water bodies contained in each modis pixel based on the spatial correspondence between modis and land use maps given the desire for a simple fast and accurate method of completing land use maps for multiple years we assumed that the merged extent of a land use type in globeland30 in 2010 and 2020 represents the full extent to which the land use type may change between 2010 and 2020 in addition we only consider when a pixel in the merged extent of a particular land use type becomes and stops becoming that particular land use type and do not consider that pixel becoming any other land use type this may result in the calculated area fractions of various land use types not summing to one but this does not have much effect on the simulation in the rf model since the relative magnitudes of the values are still meaningful commonly used indices with stable thresholds were selected for different land use types indices underlined in table b1 for bare land we assume that one pixel is no longer bare land when its average ndvi value from august 1 to september 10 is greater than 0 2 spadoni et al 2020 and remains a bare land pixel otherwise for impervious surfaces it was assumed that the process of impervious surface transformation was irreversible therefore the pixel is considered a permanently impervious surface pixel since the year when the normalized difference built up index ndbi value is greater than 0 zha et al 2003 for water bodies since water surfaces are highly susceptible to precipitation and human activities and can appear and disappear abruptly wang et al 2020 we only care about the average ndwi46 value of the pixels from august 1 to september 10 if it is less than 0 it is considered a water pixel xu 2006 for potential cropland the combined extent of cropland and grassland in land use for the years 2010 and 2020 is considered to be the potential cropland extent and its fraction is treated as a constant the lack of distinction between grassland and cropland has little effect on the result as grassland will not be autumn irrigated forest and shrubland are used to calculate other vegetation cover fractions after obtaining rough land use maps for the 11 years the 30 m resolution land use maps were resampled to be suitable for fraction calculations and the corresponding window of modis to land use maps was identified according to their geolocations the fraction of each of the five land cover types within each modis pixel was calculated separately appendix c input features for the rf and lstm models tables c1 and c2 list input features for the rf model and input features and hyperparameters for the

8905,flood irrigation is widely applied in harvested croplands of arid regions and can be classified as autumn winter irrigation ai depending on the time of application due to its high water consumption real time monitoring of the ai extent is crucial to improve its scheduling we proposed a remote sensing based long short term memory lstm model for near real time monitoring of ai extent at sub pixel scale the model loosely coupled modis data with sentinel 2 data to solve the mixed pixel issue of modis data and calibrated sentinel 2 thresholds for ai identification by a random forest rf module to extract large scale reference data with high temporal frequencies the variable importance estimated by rf is used as a reference for feature screening in the lstm model as sentinel 2 images are not available daily lstm models trained with incomplete sequences were validated using multiple validation approaches the model was applied to the hetao irrigation district the largest irrigation district in arid region of china and delivered reasonable performance with coefficient of determination of over 0 82 and mean absolute error of around 10 7 classification of irrigation patterns using simulated time series of irrigation area fractions revealed eight different irrigation patterns from 2010 to 2020 in the study region results indicate that the maximum fraction of ai area upstream is closely related to the cropland distribution pattern the ai patterns changed significantly over the 11 years with a more pronounced reduction in irrigation duration for individual pixels in the downstream area these changes are associated with two important land policies implemented in many regions of china land consolidation and land transfer the proposed model demonstrates the potential for near real time monitoring of autumn irrigation extent within large irrigation districts which can aid in ai scheduling and provide insight into irrigation patterns and practices keywords flood irrigation irrigation area fraction transient water bodies sub pixel algorithm long short term memory network random forest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction autumn winter irrigation ai or flood irrigation in harvested croplands is widely applied in late autumn to early winter in arid regions such as the hetao irrigation district hid in northwest china li et al 2012 ai is effective to leach excess soil salt increase soil moisture regulate soil temperature loosen the soil and or reduce cropland pests chang et al 2019 feng et al 2005 negri et al 2020 xiong et al 2021 to achieve these purposes large areas of cropland need to be irrigated with large amounts of water gao et al 2015 consequently pieces of surface water ponding form and last for several days after ai which has a great influence on water cycling energy transfer and salt transport processes in the irrigation district wu et al 2019 wen et al 2023 the extent timing and amount of ai are influenced by many factors and vary with year and irrigation district the conflict between water conservation policy in large irrigation districts and soil salinization control practice makes the ai problem more complex although the local irrigation management authority has a general ai plan the ai application depends highly on farmers desire for ai and irrigation water availability ren et al 2016 in recent years irrigation costs climate change and changes in cropping patterns have introduced uncertainties about whether and when farmers irrigate in autumn ren et al 2017 li et al 2022 therefore timely information about where when and how much ai is applied will benefit both hydrological studies and irrigation management in irrigation management practices this ai information helps irrigation administrations to improve irrigation schedules which is crucial for rational water allocation and control of soil salinization bwambale et al 2022 furthermore these pieces of information are fundamental inputs to agro hydrological models for irrigation districts which is essential to quantify the impact of ai on soil moisture soil salinity and crop growth lu et al 2019 wen et al 2022 2023 in practice information about irrigation including ai is generally obtained from statistical results of different levels of irrigation administrations where detailed spatiotemporal information on irrigation application is normally unavailable as an alternative satellite remote sensing has proven to be a valuable data source to extract detailed irrigation information at large scales both during crop growth karthikeyan et al 2020 and ai after crop harvest qian et al 2022 specifically optical remote sensing is highly effective in determining irrigation extent by identifying differences in the spectral indices of irrigated and non irrigated cropland ozdogan et al 2010 yao et al 2022 due to advances in the spatial resolution of optical remote sensing the precision of irrigation mapping during the crop growing season has improved significantly which has increased from 500 m pervez et al 2014 using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to 30 m using landsat xie et al 2019 and even to 10 m using sentinel 2 zurqani et al 2021 despite the notable progress in identifying irrigation during the crop growing season identifying autumn irrigation remains rare qian et al 2022 the primary challenge in identifying autumn irrigation lies in the need for high temporal resolution remote sensing data as the surface water ponding caused by irrigation typically lasts for only a few days current identification methods primarily rely on modis data with daily temporal resolution wang et al 2021 qian et al 2022 however the moderate spatial resolution of modis can lead to significant uncertainties in precise mapping of smaller irrigated lands pervez et al 2014 to overcome this limitation researchers have proposed using multi sensor data such as combining sentinel 2 landsat and modis data to provide complementary information that can be used to improve the accuracy of irrigation identification dao et al 2019 xiao et al 2022 for example qian et al 2022 used sentinel 2 data to assess the accuracy of modis based ai detection but the mixed pixel issue remained unsolved another option is to use spatiotemporal fusion models to spatially downscale the modis imagery chen et al 2018a however their usage is generally restricted to small areas short periods and low temporal resolutions due to the high computational requirements fuentes et al 2019 therefore an alternative approach is to estimate autumn irrigation area fractions aiafs in in each modis pixel from the corresponding sentinel 2 data this approach can ameliorate the mixed pixel issue of modis and is more suitable for addressing long term large scale and less location specific problems liu et al 2018 the goal of real time monitoring of irrigation extent can be achieved by continuously observing changes in the aiaf for each pixel across the irrigation district the basis to accurately acquire aiafs in a modis pixel from sentinel 2 images is to classify sentinel 2 pixels into ai and non ai pixels thenkabail et al 2007 the use of water indices and thresholds is a common classification method because ai lands are similar to small and shallow water bodies the classification accuracy depends on the optimal threshold value which can be determined manually or using automated methods casal 2022 automated methods are more suitable for classifications that need to be performed at large spatial scales and frequent time intervals however automated methods based on image segmentation such as the otsu thresholding method otsu et al 1979 are not suitable for ai classification due to the lack of distinct spectral contrast between small wetlands and autumn irrigated lands ludwig et al 2019 and the difficulty in forming a bimodal probability density distribution in the early ai period automated methods based on statistical area data calibration xie and lark 2021 do not have these limitations but require all pixels to have feature values for discrimination due to the revisit cycle of 2 5 days for sentinel 2 and cloud issues many ai lands were not presented in the limited sentinel 2 images consequently the availability of directly calculated aiafs is restricted to a finite number of dates and regions and the statistical ai area cannot be used directly to calibrate the automated methods this therefore calls for a novel approach to use statistical data to set thresholds for water surface identification at irrigation district scale in case of insufficient images to estimate daily aiafs at irrigation district scale it is necessary to develop a regression relationship between available aiaf data and daily modis series long short term memory lstm network in the field of deep learning has already been widely used to handle time series data van houdt et al 2020 it can address sequence to sequence regression problems and is therefore well suited to capture the ai dynamic currently the application of lstm models to irrigation related problems is still in its infancy which is mainly used to simulate yield cao et al 2021 groundwater table zhang et al 2018 and evapotranspiration yin et al 2020 to support irrigation management these studies can be further classified into station scale sequence to sequence regression yin et al 2020 and pixel scale sequence to one regression cao et al 2021 however the problem of daily aiafs estimation is the pixel scale sequence to sequence regression problem since individual field or pixel based monitoring helps to understand how changes in ai extent respond to changes in management and environment jeong et al 2022 the desired regression model should have a stronger spatial temporal generalization and can be applied across pixels with different attributes main objective of this study is to propose a novel model for near real time nrt monitoring of the evolution of ai extent at sub pixel scale which is applied to five sub irrigation districts of the hid nrt is defined here as a lag of no more than one day from the time of irrigation application to the time of being monitored shen et al 2019 this work overcomes several key challenges in mapping aiaf series including accurate extraction of aiafs from sentinel 2 data based on automatically calibrated thresholds by indirectly using statistical ai area and the random forest rf algorithm and screening features as lstm input based on the variable importance calculated by rf so that the lstm model can better handle time series regression problems besides nrt monitoring of irrigation extent we also divided different ai patterns in hid according to the irrigation procedure curves of different years which will help to further understand the irrigation practices in different areas 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid located upstream of the yellow river fig 1 is the largest irrigation district in arid region of china it is characterized by scarce precipitation and strong potential evaporation due to its arid to semi arid continental climate therefore irrigation is critical for agriculture in hid the whole hid is composed of five sub irrigation districts wulanbuhe wlbh jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and wulate wlt from southwest to northeast fig 1 the hid is about 1 189 million ha of which 62 is irrigated cropland mainly cultivated with corn sunflower and wheat because of the special household contract responsibility system for farmland use in china agricultural land is divided into pieces of small household farms resulting in fragmented cropping patterns in hid ren et al 2016 meanwhile cultivation field management and irrigation vary greatly among different crops and years ren et al 2016 therefore multiple irrigation water use patterns may exist simultaneously even at small scales the groundwater table depth varies greatly from 0 5 m to 3 0 m annually resulting in frequent water salt exchanges between soil and groundwater and consequently soil salinization in many parts of the hid therefore a large amount of ai is required to leach soil salt and increase soil water storage in the hid which accounts for approximately 1 3 of the total irrigation water diversion lu et al 2019 consequently ai is one of the main factors affecting soil moisture soil salinity and groundwater table in the hid 2 2 data and preprocessing data used in this study mainly include modis data from 2010 to 2020 and sentinel 2 data from 2016 to 2020 land use maps in 2010 and 2020 statistical ai area for different sub irrigation districts from 2010 to 2020 and field survey data in 2019 and 2020 remote sensing data include the modis surface reflectance product mod09ga and the sentinel 2 toa top of atmosphere reflectance product the mod09ga has spatial and temporal resolutions of 463 m and 1 day respectively which is available from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov meanwhile sentinel 2 has spatial and temporal resolutions of 10 60 m and 2 5 days respectively and can be downloaded from gee google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 because the surface reflectance data of sentinel 2 is available for a very limited time on gee we used toa data that has been widely used in detecting surface water inundation du et al 2016 seaton et al 2020 qian et al 2022 we retained the original projection of the modis images to avoid loss of information chen et al 2016 and the sentinel 2 images were reprojected to the same as the modis images the sentinel 2 images were resampled to a suitable resolution that both approximates the original resolution and facilitates subsequent aiaf calculations for modis for both modis and sentinel 2 images clouds cloud shadows and snow were masked an adaptive weighted savitzky golay s g filter and a moving average with a window size of three days were applied to the modis band index series to reduce noise and smooth the curves weights of bands indices on different days were assigned based on quality control parameters of the mod09ga products qian et al 2022 globeland30 http globallandcover com is a high precision global land cover product developed by ministry of natural resources of china which was used to generate land use maps of the hid for 2010 and 2020 fig 2 a and b the globeland30 has a high cropland mapping precision in the hid qian et al 2022 and is therefore suitable for aiaf simulation statistical ai area for different sub irrigation districts from 2010 to 2020 was obtained from the water resources development center of hetao irrigation district and the bayannur institute of water conservancy research field surveys were conducted on october 19 24 in 2019 and october 21 25 in 2020 to collect sampling points for validation the survey fields are classified into autumn irrigation land ail and non autumn irrigation land nail nail can be subdivided into fields that were not irrigated up to the surveying day nails and during the whole ai period nailp each survey field was pinpointed by recording the latitude and longitude of the four vertices using a juno sa handheld computer with gnss global navigation satellite system trimble usa due to the sentinel 2 revisit cycle and cloud issues only one or two sentinel 2 images are available during a sampling period and only about a dozen images are available in the whole ai period from late september to middle november moreover these images may not cover the whole study region therefore not all sampling points can be used for validation as shown in fig 2 c and d 58 589 ail sampling points and 45 457 nails sampling points are available for validation in 2019 2020 respectively the total number of ail nails sentinel 2 pixels extracted from sampling points in 2019 and 2020 are 2593 2683 and 72550 152684 respectively 3 methodology the nrt monitoring of ai extent includes two core modules fig 3 i e one rf module to simulate the final aiafs faiafs and one lstm module to simulate the aiaf time series the first module uses the rf algorithm due to its satisfactory performance in regression models masiliūnas et al 2021 and its ability to handle high dimensional and multi collinear variables xie and lark 2021 it is used to select suitable ai thresholds for sentinel 2 images to extract reference data at a large scale and high frequency and to identify important features for the lstm module the second module uses the lstm algorithm as it can capture complex time dependencies of the sequence and is easier to train and scale than other recurrent neural networks yin et al 2020 it aims to obtain a well performing model for nrt aiaf simulations same as qian et al 2022 all the croplands and grasslands in 2010 and 2020 land use maps in the north of the flood bank of the yellow river were taken as potential croplands all pixels with the area fraction of potential cropland greater than zero were used for further detection of ai events the simulation was conducted on each sub irrigation district since sub districts have different soil textures landscape characteristics cropping patterns and locations that can lead to different irrigation decisions 3 1 brief introductions to rf and lstm network 3 1 1 rf the rf is an ensemble model consisting of multiple decision trees classification and regression trees cart breiman 2001 which is widely used to solve classification and regression problems the rf approach involves three main steps 1 training sets generation the training set for each decision tree is generated using the bootstrapping method 2 decision trees generation for each decision tree a subset of features is randomly selected as splitting features for each internal node and the nodes are split using the best splitting feature and cutting point that can locally maximize the gini index according to the selected features the branches of each tree are not pruned back 3 results generation the final output is obtained using a majority vote scheme for classification problems or an average of the outputs of all decision trees for regression problems 3 1 2 lstm network the lstm network hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is an improved application of recurrent neural networks that can handle long term dependencies an lstm network has two main layers where the sequence input layer feeds sequence data into the network and the lstm layer learns long term dependencies of sequence data and time series between time steps the lstm layer consists of two types of states the cell state and the hidden or output state the cell state carries the information along with all the timestamps long term memory while the hidden state carries information from the immediately previous step short term memory the layer adds information to or removes information from the cell state at each time step by using three multiplicative gates forget gate input gate and output gate they work with the cell candidate to update the current state of the cell formulations of the lstm structure are given by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 fig 4 the matrices of input weights w recurrent weights r and bias of each component b for the lstm network are concatenated as follows 1 w w i w f w g w o r r i r f r g r o b b i b f b g b o where subscripts i f g and o refer to the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate respectively the cell state at time step t is given by 2 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where ct f t i t and g t are cell state forget gate input gate and cell candidate at time step t respectively and refers to the hadamard product element wise multiplication of vectors the hidden state at time step t is given by 3 h t o t σ c c t where h t o t and σ c denote the hidden state and output gate at time step t and state activation function respectively this study uses the hyperbolic tangent function tanh as the state activation function the components at time step t are described by 4 i t σ g w i x t r i h t 1 b i 5 f t σ g w f x t r f h t 1 b f 6 g t σ c w g x t r g h t 1 b g 7 o t σ g w o x t r o h t 1 b o where x t is the input vector at time step t and σ g denotes the gate activation function this study uses the sigmoid function σ x 1 e x 1 as the gate activation function finally the output at time step t y t can be obtained from 8 y t σ g w y h t b y 3 2 rf model development qian et al 2022 found that multi band water index mbwi wang et al 2018 performed better for ai detection using modis data which was also chosen for ai detection using sentinel 2 data in this study however the thresholding method used in qian et al 2022 for modis data does not apply to sentinel 2 data because sentinel 2 data are not available on a daily scale therefore an appropriate model is required to select the appropriate threshold for sentinel 2 data here we used the statistical ai area to calibrate the threshold through a serial rf module faiafs at modis pixels with sentinel 2 data can be estimated using a specified threshold for sentinel 2 mbwi mbwist which are then used to train the rf regression model for each sub irrigation district the trained rf models are then used to estimate the faiafs at modis pixels and ai areas in the sub irrigation district the optimal threshold for each sub irrigation district is finally calibrated based on statistical ai area in the calibration period 3 2 1 input features four groups of features including temporal features spectral features land use and land cover lulc features and soil texture features were considered in the regression model table c1 temporal features were extracted from the modis mbwi and ndvi time series according to qian et al 2022 five characteristic points divide the curve into different characteristic periods in the mbwi curve filtered by an adaptive weighted savitzky golay filter fig 5 point a represents the valley of the smoothed mbwi curve before ai points b and d represent the threshold value of modis data mbwimt in the increasing and decreasing segments of the mbwi curve after ai point c represents peak value of the smoothed mbwi curve and point e represents the first valley of the smoothed mbwi curve after ai mbwimt was calibrated for each sub irrigation district in qian et al 2022 using the statistical ai area the dates and mbwi values of points a b and c were used as temporal features excluding the date of point b which is not available for some pixels details about the method to determine points a and c can be found in appendix a in addition the mbwi values of the filtered curve without moving average need to be considered because the three day moving average may miss the accurate aiaf information the date of point c and the filtered mbwi values on its previous and next days were selected considering that the antecedent moisture conditions also affect the detection of actual aiaf the maximum minimum mean and standard deviation of mbwi values from august 1 to september 10 were calculated as representative of the antecedent moisture conditions for each pixel and used as input features for the rf model this period contains the last irrigation of the crop growth period and precedes the autumn irrigation besides crop phenology information is a strong indicator of crop types that influence ai schedule feng et al 2005 and we extracted the start of season sos end of season eos and the maximum ndvi from ndvi time series chen et al 2018b during the growing season before ai as input features for the rf model spectral features are the band index values except mbwi associated with point c including the commonly used normalized difference water index ndwi vegetation index drought index and built up index as well as green band table b1 land use features are land cover fractions of modis pixels where the fractions of water bodies impervious surfaces bare land and potential cropland are mainly considered water bodies and impervious surfaces also have high water index values which can be easily confused with the ai phenomenon wang et al 2018 bare land and vegetation in a pixel result in decreased water index values of the mixed pixel the potential cropland fraction in a pixel indicates the maximum possible ai fraction since land use maps are only available for 2010 and 2020 they do not adequately cover the years between 2010 and 2020 we created annual land cover fraction maps based on the two existing land use products by using a simple index threshold method see appendix b for details soil texture features were obtained from the harmonized world soil database with a scale of 1 1 000 000 within china the information about fractions of clay sand and silt along with soil salinity of the topsoil was used finally 34 input features table c1 were chosen which were resampled to the modis resolution for further use 3 2 2 assumption and sample generation data sparsity is a major challenge for mapping irrigation area fractions since regression favors the mean it is difficult for regression models to accurately predict 0 and 100 fractions masiliūnas et al 2021 therefore only pixels with non zero cropland fractions can be used as model input moreover aiaf was calculated as the ratio of irrigated area to total pixel area rather than to cropland area to reduce the probability of 100 fraction samples were selected by assuming that faiaf corresponds to the aiaf of the peak point c in the mbwi curve according to qian et al 2022 the mbwi curve can reflect the aiaf dynamics in segment ac of the curve fig 5 irrigation continues to be applied within the pixel under consideration although parts of the irrigated fields may no longer be wet during ac period that they cannot be identified as irrigated land their areas are negligible this is because it takes a long time from the start of irrigation to the complete drying of the ground therefore only fields that were irrigated early and with shallower water are likely to dry up the irrigation stops in segment cd of the curve therefore point c is assumed to correspond to the final and maximum aiaf moreover this assumption is also a special case of the assumption in the linear spectral mixture model singer and mccord 1979 that the reflectance of an individual pixel is linearly related to its endmember reflectance because mbwi is a linear combination of multiple bands reflectance therefore an increase in the aiaf will lead to an increase in mbwi value and maximum aiaf faiaf corresponds to the peak mbwi this assumption will be further validated in the following analysis consequently pixels that have sentinel 2 data on the corresponding date of point c were selected as the samples based on the spatial relationship between modis and sentinel 2 pixels aiaf of the sample was calculated by the number of sentinel 2 pixels that are irrigated at a modis pixel by comparing the mbwi value of sentinel 2 with the threshold mbwist 3 2 3 model calibration accuracy assessment and variable importance we used a fixed mbwist for each sub irrigation district from 2016 to 2020 because the application of fixed thresholds to water indices remains an effective method for delineating aquatic ecosystems borro et al 2014 lefebvre et al 2019 statistical ai area data from 2016 to 2020 consistent with the years with available sentinel 2 data were used to calibrate mbwist and those from 2010 to 2015 for validation the identified ai areas from qian et al 2022 were used to calibrate the model of wlt because the statistical data from 2016 to 2020 for wlt was incongruent with other years stratified random sampling method with a 4 1 ratio was used to obtain the training and testing datasets during the initial calibration round these divided samples were then used in the subsequent calibration process to ensure that sample selection does not affect the calibration mbwist corresponding to the minimum mean absolute relative error mare between the simulated and statistical area in the calibration period was selected and applied to the validation period it is necessary to determine whether the differences in mare of different rfs are due to different parameters thresholds or associated with poor simulation of the rfs themselves therefore the accuracies of different rfs for aiaf simulation during training and testing periods should be compared which were assessed using three metrics including coefficient of determination r 2 aiaf root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae between simulated and reference aiafs eqs 9 12 additionally the sentinel 2 ai distribution maps generated under the calibrated mbwist were also validated against field sampling points using overall accuracy oa eq 13 specifically ail was used to validate the distributions of ai corresponding to the sampling dates whereas nails was used to validate the distributions of ai up to the sampling dates 9 mare 1 t m 1 t s sim m s ref m s ref m 10 r 2

sample i n is the total number of samples aiaf sim and aiaf ref are the average values of simulated and reference aiafs for n samples n ail and n nails are the number of correctly classified points for ail and nails n is the total number of all samples variable importance was calculated by permutated variable importance measure pvim breiman 2001 to identify the relative contribution of input features to regression accuracy pvim is one of the most widely used variable importance measures to date it measures the importance of a feature by calculating the average reduction in oob out of bag accuracy after randomly permuting the feature across all decision trees the more decrease in oob accuracy the more important the feature is we specified the interaction test to account for predictor interactions and identify important variables in cases when there are variables that have relatively fewer distinct values or there are many irrelevant variables loh 2002 3 3 lstm model development 3 3 1 model settings the input features for lstm were mainly selected from the top ranked features in terms of pvim calculated by the above rf model to estimate daily aiaf features corresponding to the date of point c were replaced with the features corresponding to the day of irrigation besides three other principles were also considered in selecting the input features first although correlated variables provide important complementary information that facilitates model learning it can also lead to multicollinearity that biases the variable importance metrics molnar 2019 it has been shown that multicollinearity affects only the specific independent variables that are correlated frost 2019 therefore when selecting features feature importance by group can be evaluated first xie et al 2019 followed by intra group features that may be correlated to each other second features associated with dates or time intervals need to be retained the revisit cycle of sentinel 2 and cloud cover make the sample series have missing values at irregular time intervals the ability of lstm to construct regression models directly on incomplete data can be enhanced by adding features about the time intervals between missing values weerakody et al 2021 third features whose values are only available at the end of the irrigation period are removed to achieve the goal of nrt simulation aiaf series of the samples were calculated by dividing the number of sentinel pixels whose mbwi values are above the calibrated mbwist by the total number of sentinel pixels within each modis pixel for dates with sentinel 2 data samples with a time series length greater than or equal to 3 for jfz and 2 for other sub irrigation districts and with at least one positive aiaf were chosen as representative samples since a large number of samples are required for the training of lstm models cao et al 2021 similar to the rf model all samples were divided into training and testing datasets in a 4 1 ratio using stratified random sampling the lstm model was trained from the training datasets using adam optimizer and further tested with testing datasets 3 3 2 accuracy assessment the model is validated from two aspects one is the training and testing accuracies of the model trained with incomplete sequence input feature vector concatenation matrix corresponding to the dates when sentinel 2 data is available and the second is the validation results of feeding complete sequence input daily continuous feature vector concatenation matrix into the model the complete sequence input is fed into the model to simulate daily aiaf time series of each pixel in different years we compared the aiaf extracted by sentinel 2 with the aiaf of the same date in the complete aiaf time series using r 2 aiaf rmse and mae to demonstrate the ability of the model to handle incomplete sequence input additionally the last value of aiaf time series as faiaf is also compared with the reference values extracted by sentinel 2 and the results of rf model simulation and the calculated ai area is also compared with the statistical ai area 3 4 classification of autumn irrigation patterns the complete aiaf time series at pixel scale obtained from lstm simulations are classified to identify different ai patterns the classification features include faiaf irrigation duration irrigation concentration and the period of irrigation concentration irrigation concentration is measured by irrigation frequency from the start of ai to cumulative aiaf reaching 75 faiaf and the interval between irrigations less frequent and shorter irrigation intervals represent more concentrated irrigation the period of irrigation concentration is defined as the number of days from the start of irrigation to the occurrence of the first second third largest daily aiafs divided by the length of entire time series k means cluster mcqueen 1967 was applied to principal components of the feature variables extracted using principal component analysis vidal et al 2016 for the automatic identification of different irrigation patterns 4 results 4 1 performance of rf model for faiaf simulation 4 1 1 threshold estimation quality of training samples and accuracy assessment based on the sample generation rule 2971 6831 3810 3643 and 2671 samples were generated in wlbh jfz yj yc and wlt respectively fig 6 shows that mbwist has less influence on the training and testing accuracies of the rf model compared to the reference data extracted from sentinel 2 indicating that the rf model accuracy has little effect on the selection of mbwist from performance metrics of the models corresponding to the calibrated mbwist values shown in table 1 the calibrated model performs well in each sub irrigation district with mae less than 11 and r 2 aiaf more than 0 80 during the testing period for all sub irrigation districts it can also be found from table 1 that calibrated thresholds for sentinel 2 mbwist is generally equal to or slightly greater than those for modis mbwimt in the same sub irrigation district because the smaller pixel size of sentinel 2 makes it more likely to be pure water or bare soil pixel however the differences between mbwist and mbwimt are small which is mainly caused by different feature variables used in modis and sentinel 2 classification modis uses the maximum mbwi value which is mainly used for detecting deeper water bodies sentinel 2 on the other hand uses mbwi values for a specified date to detect all water bodies including very shallow ones another reason for the difference in thresholds is that sentinel 2 uses toa reflectance while modis uses surface reflectance by comparing the ai area calculated using faiaf with statistical data mares for the validation period from 2010 to 2015 ranged from 2 66 to 12 7 with an average value of 8 62 for the five sub irrigation districts table 2 the obtained results suggest a good performance for faiaf simulation in hid the mare for jfz is significantly lower than other sub irrigation districts which may be caused by the large ai area in jfz the mare for wlbh is the greatest but it is less than 10 and acceptable fragmented cropland large areas of sandy soils and the abrupt appearance and disappearance of lakes in recent years in wlbh wang et al 2020 have made the precision simulation of ai area more difficult in wlbh as compared with other sub irrigation districts overall the mares ranged from 4 1 to 9 6 in different sub irrigation districts from 2010 to 2020 therefore the trained rf model can be applied to simulate faiaf with satisfactory accuracy the overall accuracies of ai distribution maps derived from sentinel 2 using the calibrated mbwist values are greater than 98 across different sub irrigation districts table 3 against sampling points due to sentinel 2 revisit cycles and cloud issues only a few distribution maps were validated however since the sampling points were distributed evenly throughout the irrigation district and were marked against the boundaries of irrigated and non irrigated fields the high accuracy validation results demonstrate the ability of sentinel 2 to extract ai information accurately 4 1 2 variable importance generally there are similarities in the variable importance rankings for each sub irrigation district with a significant overlap in the top ranked variables fig 7 fractions of cropland fcrop and impervious surfaces fimp are usually the most important variables the fraction of cropland determines the upper limit of faiaf and is even directly related to the fraction of irrigation in hid to some extent notably fractions of cropland appear to play a more important role in wlbh jfz and yj than in yc and wlt which is mainly caused by the difference in cropping patterns in yc and wlt where a higher proportion of sunflowers are planted wen et al 2019 the fraction of cropland is not as significant as in other sub irrigation districts because sunflowers are rarely autumn irrigated in the previous year impervious surfaces also have high water index values which may be confused with the ai phenomenon although water bodies can cause the same problem they are of less importance this is mainly because cropland borders more on urban rural areas and therefore impervious surfaces dominate over water bodies in the mixed pixels we studied soil texture variables are of little significance for all sub irrigation districts most likely because their coarser spatial resolution 1000 m fails to capture detailed ai information at smaller cropland scale the mbwi of point c was found to be the most significant temporal and spectral feature for all sub irrigation districts this suggests that mbwi is more effective than other water indices e g ndwi42 and ndwi46 in estimating aiaf although the higher correlation between these indices makes their relative importance difficult to quantify conclusively the remaining spectral and temporal features play low to moderate roles with little spatial variability most features contribute less to the regression of wlbh and wlt indicating the complexity in estimating aiaf in these two sub irrigation districts and the necessity of combining modis derived and other features to obtain better regression results 4 2 performance of lstm network for aiaf time series simulation according to the principles described in section 3 3 1 approximately ten features were selected for the lstm model for each sub irrigation district table c2 the hyperparameters of the lstm used are also shown in table c2 the aiaf time series simulation for four randomly selected pixels in each sub irrigation district are depicted in fig 8 qualitative assessment showed that the simulated time series can well reflect the general trend of the actual aiaf time series and can capture the key turning point however it can be noticed that the model tends to slightly underestimate high values and overestimate low values thus produces smooth predictions with less variation compared to the actual irrigation patterns the quantitative results of lstm model accuracies for each sub irrigation district are shown in table 4 the results show that accuracy metrics between the simulation and reference aiafs extracted from sentinel 2 in all sub irrigation districts during training and testing periods are all in satisfactory range with r 2 aiaf of more than 0 82 rmse of less than 14 and mae of less than 13 the average mae for all sub irrigation districts during the testing period is 10 7 this suggests that lstm model has the potential to monitor ai dynamics the model accuracy of jfz is slightly lower than other sub irrigation districts because the sequences of samples put into the lstm model of jfz are longer and therefore the time dependence between the series is more complicated the simulation from complete input was validated using the same reference data as used in the testing period for the lstm model the results show that accuracy is slightly decreased for wlbh yc and wlt compared with that in the model testing period this suggests that the model accuracy is affected by incomplete input training which is expected since it is a data based regression model however the decrease in accuracy is within an acceptable range the mae is still around 10 and the highest mae is 12 75 table 4 the model accuracy varies the least for jfz because the sequence length of its training samples is longer and therefore closer to the complete sequences from the comparisons of simulated faiaf values simulated with rf and lstm network models their coefficients of determination are all greater than 0 92 for wlbh jfz yc and wlt while slightly lower 0 86 for yj these results indicate that these two models are in good agreement to simulate faiaf however according to the comparisons with sentinel 2 reference data the rf model provides more accurate simulations of faiafs table 5 than lstm where the r 2 aiaf and rmse for the lstm model are ranging from 0 77 to 0 85 and 14 07 16 72 respectively meanwhile we can also obtain the ai area calculated by faiaf derived from lstm simulation so far we have obtained the ai area calculated using three models i e threshold based model qian et al 2022 rf model and lstm model overall a good agreement is observed across all sub irrigation districts in different years for the three models where no model significantly over and or underestimated the ai area compared with statistics through zero crossing linear regression table 5 the rf model gives the highest coefficients of determination from 0 94 to 1 00 between simulated and statistical ai area r 2 s followed by the threshold based model r 2 s from 0 93 to 1 00 these two models give similar results across all sub irrigation districts in different years however the lstm model has lower accuracy in estimating irrigated area during small water diversion years besides the lstm model itself another possible reason for such results is that both the threshold based model and the rf model are generated through statistical based optimization while the lstm is not the overall accuracy assessment results show that the lstm model trained with incomplete sequences is capable of acquiring accurate and comprehensive information about aiaf dynamics 4 3 assumption validation the above method assumes that aiaf is essentially rising until point c and no longer rising after it i e aiaf at point c is the faiaf the assumption is considered valid if the difference between aiaf corresponding to point c and the maximum value of simulated aiaf series is within 2 because of inherent fluctuations in the model simulation to verify this assumption we extended the length of simulated sequence to three days after point c to get faiaf we calculated the proportion of pixels in each sub irrigation district that did not meet the assumption p the mean difference md between the aiaf of point c and the maximum aiaf for pixels that did not meet the assumption and the product of p and md serror which are used to quantify the error introduced by using statistical ai area to calibrate mbwist table 6 it is observed that the proportion of pixels satisfying the assumption 1 p across each sub irrigation district is mostly above 80 while the md and serror values are approximately 5 0 and less than 1 respectively therefore the results show that the assumption is approximately valid and subsequent calibration of mbwist with statistical ai area is feasible 4 4 autumn irrigation trends in hid 4 4 1 spatial temporal distribution of final autumn irrigation area fraction the rf model produced annual faiaf maps from 2010 to 2020 across the hid fig 9 faiaf maps showed similar distribution patterns to the ai extent maps of qian et al 2022 but it provided more pixels with low irrigation fractions that are easily ignored when using a simple threshold based model to classify a pixel into irrigated non irrigated one the annual faiaf distribution maps revealed the characteristics and areal trends of ai in sub irrigation districts across time faiaf is manually divided into four levels by the quartiles i e low 0 25 medium low 25 50 medium high 50 75 and high 75 100 the cropland distribution pattern has a significant influence on the proportion of faiaf at each level for the upstream sub irrigation districts the low level faiaf is more than 60 for wlbh fig 10 due to its fragmented cropland distribution pattern surrounded by desert fig 2 in contrast the medium high and above levels of faiaf in jfz exceeds 60 because of its highly concentrated cropland especially corn that requires ai the proportion of faiaf across the whole hid at each level showed no significant change from 2010 to 2020 with an average of 38 19 21 and 22 for the four levels respectively however the proportion of low level faiaf in jfz and yc showed an increasing trend in recent years which may be caused by the increase in sunflower planting area in jfz and yc in recent years wen et al 2019 4 4 2 spatial temporal distribution of autumn irrigation patterns the ai patterns in hid were finally classified into eight classes based on the elbow criterion syakur et al 2018 and the comparison of classification results for different classification numbers the mean values of the feature variables of the eight classes varied in wide ranges table 7 according to the mean values faiaf can be divided into three categories i e high medium and low both the duration and irrigation concentration can be divided into two categories i e long and short durations and concentrated and scattered irrigations the concentration time can be divided into four categories i e early early and late medium and late and late therefore the eight classes represent eight categories of irrigation patterns given in detail in table 7 fig 11 depicts the distribution of ai patterns in hid irrigation patterns were mainly influenced by the local irrigation systems and agricultural management practices thus there was no obvious spatial distribution pattern however a concentrated pattern dominates because the suitable time for ai application is after crop harvest in general wlbh is dominated by lsce and llsel patterns jfz by hlce and hsce patterns yj by hlce and lsce patterns yc by lsce pattern and wlt by lsce and lscl patterns in recent years there have been significant changes in irrigation patterns fig 12 the area of sc short concentrated pattern tends to increase while that of lc long concentrated tends to decrease except in 2015 due to the construction of water projects liu 2017 and significant changes in cropping patterns wen et al 2019 the regions with significant changes in ai patterns are mainly concentrated downstream of the hid including wlt eastern and southern yc and northern yj the change in irrigation patterns is strongly linked to the advancement of land policy reform in china overall the detailed dynamic irrigation patterns shown in maps can help in better water management practices in hid 5 discussion in this study we proposed a model that can monitor nrt changes in flood irrigation extent at the sub pixel scale over a large irrigation district the model includes two main modules which use rf and lstm algorithms to achieve the goals of extracting large scale training samples and simulating aiaf time series in nrt respectively in general the proposed model performs well in each of the five sub irrigation districts of hid however the model also has some drawbacks that need to be improved in further studies there are two main drawbacks to the rf module first we used a threshold method to automatically extract reference information at large scale and frequent time scale which were used as training samples in the rf model the rf algorithm is combined with the common calibration process to calibrate the thresholds mbwist given the image incompleteness a static threshold was used to allow the model to be used in multi years especially for years regions without sentinel 2 records as well as to achieve near real time simulations in all subsequent years this may result in some loss of model accuracy ludwig et al 2019 but our results show that the accuracy is satisfactory second correlations exist between the feature variables of the model as in many other irrigated land identification models deines et al 2019 multicollinearity reduces the capacity of the model to identify independent variables that are statistically significant and weakens the data interpretability of the model although regression remains robust for these correlations molnar 2019 however there is still no relatively perfect way to deal with this problem frost 2019 moreover the influence of correlation on variable importance can be complex some studies concluded that correlation tends to rank the correlated variables higher strobl et al 2007 zhang and yang 2020 while others argued that the importance of associated features decreases when a correlated feature is added because the importance is split between correlated features molnar 2019 variable importance ranking fig 7 shows that none of the spectral features stand out in importance although they are indispensable for the model this could be attributed to the splitting of importance among highly correlated spectral features in summary the variable importance ranking results highlight some promising features that may be useful for ai detection in large scale or data scarce regions in the lstm module the main weakness is the problems inherent to the model itself for example lstm model tends to generate smoothed simulations fig 8 as other regression methods which results in a lower variation range compared to actual ai patterns nguyen and bae 2020 moreover multi step regression with a standard lstm model is subject to error accumulation zhang et al 2021 which can explain why the lstm model is not as effective as rf for faiafs simulations table 5 last but not least the lstm model as with any deep learning model has a data intensive nature that may limit its use in data scarce problems tian et al 2021 the lack of sentinel 2 reference data in this study makes the lstm model learn insufficient information during the training process although we increased the number of samples by reducing the requirements for sample sequence length the quality of samples may deteriorate li et al 2021 the model can be further improved with more sentinel 2 reference data accumulated in the future allowing the lstm model to learn more from more learning samples the model can provide us with daily inundation extent that can be used as input to the agro hydrological models facilitating our understanding of the hydrological processes influenced by ai especially the lateral groundwater flow that is an important channel for water and salt exchange between irrigated and non irrigated lands wen et al 2022 this is important for the determination of water conservation intensity and control of salinity levels ren et al 2016 in addition this model can be applied to other studies that require real time monitoring of inundation extent such as monitoring of flood hazards extent and agricultural managed aquifer recharge extent ganot and dahlke 2021 these studies rely heavily on detecting surface water bodies that are usually large scale and short term similar to those formed by ai sakamoto et al 2007 the present model can address the problem of suboptimal representation of the instantaneous distribution of floods provided by modis only mohammadi et al 2017 irrigation patterns classified by features extracted from aiaf time series revealed some new patterns of ai in hid the significant changes in irrigation patterns in hid over recent years provided evidence for the implementation of land consolidation policy and land transfer policy the land consolidation project of hid was launched by an agreement signed by the provincial government and the ministry of finance of china in january 2008 meanwhile orderly land transfer has been supported and encouraged on all scales since 2008 in china xu et al 2018 land consolidation forms more rational landholdings by rearranging fragmented land plots and their ownership while land transfer to large professional operators can promote moderate scale rural land management furthermore land consolidation can promote the transfer of land management rights jiang et al 2022 as it allows larger areas of highly productive land to be used together these two policies have resulted in more concentrated crop distribution patterns and led to a gradual change in irrigation water use from scattered small scale and sloppy to concentrated large scale and specialized moreover they are of greater importance for downstream areas because the cropland downstream was initially more uneven and disorganized last but not least significant changes in ai patterns can have an impact on groundwater tables and water salt transport from irrigated land to non irrigated lands therefore cropping patterns and ai patterns should be given priority when implementing water saving measures that have requirements for groundwater table and soil salinization control 6 conclusions this study addressed the scientific and practical needs to monitor autumn irrigation extent in near real time at an appropriate spatial resolution which helps to capture irrigation dynamics and water use and thus develop dynamic irrigation schedules and assess associated environmental issues to address the gaps in knowledge and data we applied two models including lstm models and rf models the lstm model was applied to irrigation monitoring and to solve the problem of mixed pixels of modis data by loosely coupling modis with sentinel 2 data the rf module was used to solve the problem caused by incomplete image series and to select features for the lstm model the model performance was tested with reference data at pixel scale r 2 aiaf over 0 82 mae around 10 7 and statistical ai area at sub irrigation district scale r 2 s of 0 84 0 99 respectively indicating that the model precision was satisfactory we generated annual faiaf distributions as well as annual ai pattern distributions based on simulated aiaf time series classifications from 2010 to 2020 based on these 11 years of data we found that for the upstream of irrigation district faifa is closely related to the cropland distribution pattern meanwhile we found an increase in areas with short duration and concentrated irrigation and a decrease in areas with long duration and concentrated irrigation the regions with significant changes in ai patterns are mainly concentrated downstream of the hid changes in irrigation patterns reflect the effect of two important land policies land consolidation and land transfer implemented in china and can have a significant impact on the groundwater table and water salt redistribution between irrigated non irrigated fields finally the model is temporally applicable to other years and

curve to determine point c in the mbwi curve fig 5 qian et al 2022 provided detailed instructions for pixels with maximum mbwi value exceeding mbwimt while for pixels with maximum mbwi value smaller than mbwimt point c is taken as the peak point of the curve the determination of point a is also divided into two cases depending on whether maximum mbwi value exceeds mbwimt or not the difference between the two cases is the choice of the reference point i e point b has to be selected if mbwimt is exceeded otherwise point c has to be selected once a reference point is fixed point a can be determined by finding the first point from the reference point such that it satisfies the following specified conditions 1 the mbwi value of the point needs to be less than or equal to the average mbwi value from august 1 to september 10 and the distance between the point and the reference point is less than 40 days 2 if the point satisfying 1 does not exist the mbwi value of the point needs to be less than or equal to the maximum mbwi value from august 1 to september 10 3 if the above two conditions still fail to find point a then if the mbwi value on september 10 is less than the mbwi value of point b point a will be designated as the point on september 10 otherwise point a is considered to overlap with point b appendix b land use mapping and statistics of land cover fractions the main steps for land cover fractions calculation are 1 completing approximate land use maps from 2011 to 2019 based on the globeland30 datasets in 2010 and 2020 and modis derived indices 2 calculating the area ratios of five land cover types i e potential cropland other vegetation types bare land impervious surfaces and water bodies contained in each modis pixel based on the spatial correspondence between modis and land use maps given the desire for a simple fast and accurate method of completing land use maps for multiple years we assumed that the merged extent of a land use type in globeland30 in 2010 and 2020 represents the full extent to which the land use type may change between 2010 and 2020 in addition we only consider when a pixel in the merged extent of a particular land use type becomes and stops becoming that particular land use type and do not consider that pixel becoming any other land use type this may result in the calculated area fractions of various land use types not summing to one but this does not have much effect on the simulation in the rf model since the relative magnitudes of the values are still meaningful commonly used indices with stable thresholds were selected for different land use types indices underlined in table b1 for bare land we assume that one pixel is no longer bare land when its average ndvi value from august 1 to september 10 is greater than 0 2 spadoni et al 2020 and remains a bare land pixel otherwise for impervious surfaces it was assumed that the process of impervious surface transformation was irreversible therefore the pixel is considered a permanently impervious surface pixel since the year when the normalized difference built up index ndbi value is greater than 0 zha et al 2003 for water bodies since water surfaces are highly susceptible to precipitation and human activities and can appear and disappear abruptly wang et al 2020 we only care about the average ndwi46 value of the pixels from august 1 to september 10 if it is less than 0 it is considered a water pixel xu 2006 for potential cropland the combined extent of cropland and grassland in land use for the years 2010 and 2020 is considered to be the potential cropland extent and its fraction is treated as a constant the lack of distinction between grassland and cropland has little effect on the result as grassland will not be autumn irrigated forest and shrubland are used to calculate other vegetation cover fractions after obtaining rough land use maps for the 11 years the 30 m resolution land use maps were resampled to be suitable for fraction calculations and the corresponding window of modis to land use maps was identified according to their geolocations the fraction of each of the five land cover types within each modis pixel was calculated separately appendix c input features for the rf and lstm models tables c1 and c2 list input features for the rf model and input features and hyperparameters for the

8906,greenhouse crops production has been improved by co2 enrichment commercially the impact of a threshold level of elevated co2 e co2 on the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii фpsii chlorophyll fluorescence parameter which is linked to crop yield crop growth and fruit quality is still uncertain many previous studies cultivated c3 crops under 550 700 µmol mol 1 not beyond this range hence tomato plants were grown under ambient co2 a co2 500 µmol mol 1 and e co2 700 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 named as ec700 ec850 and ec1000 respectively under uniform environmental conditions for two growing seasons to investigate the response of фpsii along with four photosynthetically active radiation intensities and plant growth to continuous co2 concentration co2 under four constant par intensities during autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 the order of mean фpsii values under e co2 were explored as ec700 ec1000 ec850 a co2 and ec700 ec850 ec1000 a co2 respectively the optimum total fruit yield was stimulated under ec700 by 74 04 and 55 86 during autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 respectively as compared to a co2 the results showed that water use efficiency related to yield wuey were enhanced by reducing the stomatal conductance under e co2 as compared to a co2 optimum wuey was enhanced by 55 91 210 87 under ec700 compared to a co2 the principal component analysis showed strong correlation of фpsii with plant height yield and water use efficiency in autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 lai in spring summer 2021 weak correlation with stem diamter in autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 indicated the strong effect of фpsii on plant growth and yield under e co2 the ec1000 in autumn winter 2020 and ec700 in spring summer 2021 were found more influential by the analytic hierarchy process to get optimum crop production no significant difference between the ranking scores of ec1000 and ec700 during autumn winter 2020 was found thus the overall optimum impact of e co2 on tomato growth was explored under ec700 the findings of this study are beneficial to greenhouses crops production commercially and could be used as

µmol mol 1 by the end of this century pachauri et al 2014 the variation in co2 will impact the crop productivity by affecting plant photosynthesis and carbon metabolism may attain the future and present food supply demand raised by increasing world s population munaweera et al 2022 rehman et al 2022 numerous researchers focused on photosynthetic efficiency because of its importance as a predictor of crop growth and yield it is revealed that e co2 influenced the photosynthesis rate and yield under adequate water and nutrients condition nomura et al 2021 which enhanced plant growth above ground biomass and yield abideen et al 2022 garcia et al 2023 the crop specific threshold e co2 need to be identified under sub tropical condition to get optimum photosynthesis rate the response of chlorophyll fluoresce parameter need to be quantified as predictor of plant growth and yield under future predicted co2 therefore it is essential to analysis the impact of future predicted co2 on effective quantum yield and consequently on plant growth and yield for sustainable agriculture under changing climate chlorophyll fluorescence technology has been used to investigate the distribution of excitation energy inside the photosynthetic apparatus and explore photosynthesis mechanism regulation and adopted as an indicator for assessing plant growth responses stefanov et al 2022 because of the reduction in carbon constraint increased co2 improves photosynthetic efficiency enhances the supply of photo assimilates hong et al 2022 maschler et al 2022 and higher net leaf photosynthesis a rise in co2 has contributed to enhance crop growth and productivity in many field or chamber experiments allen et al 2020 dutta et al 2022 it is also claimed that when the crop was subjected to long term e co2 during the growth season it could modify the photosynthetic capacity of the crop and the stimulation impact on photosynthesis may not last adachi et al 2014 cai et al 2018 at late growth stage photosynthetic adaptation to e co2 i e down regulation or lower enhancement of photosynthesis might reduce the influence of e co2 on crop productivity wang et al 2020 effective quantum yield a rapid way to study plant photochemical status and is a good indicator of environmental change consequences such as e co2 effects on photosynthetic process kalaji et al 2017 most of previous studies reported the variations in photochemical efficiency response under different e co2 ahmadi et al 2021 yang et al 2023 subsequently the growth and yield of crops were varied under different e co2 in different crops such as tomatoes du et al 2023 hao et al 2020 yang et al 2020 cucumbers namizaki et al 2022 rice hu et al 2022 wheat fitzgerald et al 2022 lenka et al 2021 and maize ripley et al 2022

mol 1 of e co2 karim et al 2020 and by 125 under 700 µmol mol 1 of e co2 mamatha et al 2014 which indicates the tomato yield variations at two different co2 levels under 60 µmol mol 1 higher co2 than ambient rice yield was increased by 11 4 19 7 compared to a co2 wang et al 2019 most of the researchers conducted experiment under a single level of e co2 e g 550 850 or 900 µmol mol 1 etc to investigate the response of crops to e co2 which is limitation to identify the threshold level of e co2 under predicted co2 scenarios pörtner et al 2022 like approximately 95 of plant species on earth tomatoes have c3 photosynthetic pathway academy 2022 tomatoes grow in greenhouses screen houses and open fields china is one of the world s leading tomato producers producing 50 55 million metric tons and accounting for 6 82 of all tomatoes grown globally fao 2016 crops grown in open fields will be affected directly by changing climate protected crops in comparison protected crops such as tomatoes

measured variables on e co2 by the spss statistics software version 18 0 ibm electronics and the tukey post hoc test was used to find a significant difference among treatments 3 results 3 1 meteorology of controlled environmental chamber heating cooling systems and desiccation systems were used to maintain the air temperature t a and relative humidity rh respectively inside the chambers the daily mean controlled t a and rh within the cec during aw and ss with controlled upper limits t a 30 rh 80 and lower limits t a 18 rh 30 are shown in fig 3 the average t a and rh were 23 3 c and 67 for aw and 24 5 c and 79 for ss in the cec respectively rh was reliant on t a t a levels were low until nearly 70 dat and rh responded directly with high levels because of low t a and solar radiation after 70 dat rh responded in inversely proportional to t a throughout both growing seasons the growth rate of many organisms is controlled by temperature which was considered the main factor influencing plant growth especially during the initial growth stage the concept related to heat ways or temperature more than base temperature 26 of tomatoes was introduced in the form of accumulative degree days add at ten days intervals in fig 4 the values of add were obtained differently during the initial growth period of tomato plants in the aw and ss the add was observed higher during initial growth stage of aw than the ss the higher accumulative degree days for ten days intervals directly affected the plant growth indicators plant height stem diameter and lai biomass yield and water use efficiency it might influence fruit quality of tomato by affecting the physiology and morphology of plants the main objective in designing the controlled environment chambers cecs was to maintain uniform co2 gradients within the cecs the actual real time data of co2 for each treatment based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change pcr 8 5 scenario of future predicted co2 in cecs are shown in fig 5 the data showed the uniformity of co2 concentration within the set range in cecs the range of designed treatments of ec1000 ec850 ec700 and ambient were maintained within 50 µmol mol 1 40 µmol mol 1 30 µmol mol 1 and 20 µmol mol 1 respectively mean values of co2 are demonstrated according to designed treatments by the dotted line the data points above and below the designed treatments were recorded and distributed uniformly as shown in fig 5 the designed treatments for both growing seasons were set and recorded with the same pattern for aw and ss the par μmol m 2 s 1 significantly affected the chlorophyll fluorescence of tomato plants it is essential to record the actual range of par values in the cecs to set the treatments of par for the investigation of e co2 effects on chlorophyll fluorescence under set par intensities during the growing period the maximum daily par parmax inside the cecs showed more than 97 5 from 9 00 15 00 for controlling factors it is essential to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters with constant par intensity as parmax was observed from 12 00 and 13 00 which accounted for 65 days during the entire growing period as a result the distribution of par intensity at six time intervals 9 00 10 00 10 00 11 00 11 00 12 00 12 00 13 00 13 00 14 00 and 14 00 15 00 during the entire growth period was investigated to confirm which par intensity should be chosen to determine the фpsii as shown in fig 6 from 9 00 11 00 and 13 00 15 00 the par was usually 100 500 μmol m 2 s 1 the par distribution phase with the most extensive range appeared from 12 00 13 00 however broad par intensity within 100 500 μmol m 2 s 1 range at 11 00 12 00 and 12 00 13 00 time intervals was revealed during the growth stage the par intensity was mainly distributed between 100 and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 and the pulses of light intensity were selected with the observed par range to analysis the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii data 3 2 impact of par and e co2 on physiology a rapid light curve was used to record the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii фpsii responses under four par intensities 125 190 285 and 420 μmol m 2 s 1 in each treatment of co2 concentration applied par intensities were selected based on recorded par intensity 100 and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 in chamber during entire growth period the responses of фpsii under e co2 and imposed light intensity are shown in fig 7 the order of mean values of фpsii was identified as ec700 ec1000 ec850 a co2 during aw and ec700 ec850 ec1000 a co2 during ss season under the four constant par intensities the optimum response of фpsii was explored under ec700 at constant light intensities for both growing seasons under super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 the фpsii responded negatively for both seasons compared to ec700 which indicated that the growth of tomatoes might decline by applying super e co2 as compared to ec700 as shown in fig 7 a and b the variation range of фpsii under ec700 was narrowed with the increasing par intensity during both growing seasons the minimum deviation of фpsii was observed under ec700 which indicated the more stable status of фpsii under ec700 as compared to other co2 enrichment treatments the фpsii was enhanced under ec700 as compared as a co2 by 17 06 18 45 and 8 25 14 34 the range of improvement in percentage was obtained at four par intensities in aw and ss respectively at optimal level among the co2 enrichment treatments leaf chlorophyll content chl during two growing seasons are shown in table 2 the ec850 affected chl significantly p 0 05 in aw in contrast ec1000 and ec700 influenced significantly p 0 05 in ss the chl enhanced by 7 39 10 53 and 9 32 in aw and 7 96 1 61 7 15 in ss under ec1000 ec850 and ec700 respectively 3 3 impact of e co2 on morphology plant height stem diameter and lai are integral components of plant growth all e co2 treatments improved plant height stem diameter and lai compared to a co2 for both growing seasons throughout the measuring periods as shown in fig 8 the pattern of plant height responses was obtained as фpsii pattern in the ss plant height was enhanced under e co2 by increasing values of фpsii in aw plant height was boosted under ec1000 flowering and fruiting stages of aw in contrast of фpsii because of high add in vegetation stage the maximum growth of stem diameter and lai was observed under ec1000 due to the buffer effect against high temperature during aw as shown in fig 8 c and e and under ec850 throughout ss except lai during vegetation and flowering stage that was responded under ec700 at optimum level as shown in fig 8 d and f plant height stem dimeter and lai increased under super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 owning to high add showing that super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 enhanced the plant s resilient ability to negative impact of high add on plant height stem diameter and lai as shown in fig 7 a c and e the super e co2 slowed the plant growth as compared to ec700 under appropriate t a 20 26 as seen by diminishing trends in plant height stem diameter and lai under ec1000 as compared to ec700 during ss growing season this suggests that super e co2 was not acceptable for plant growth at an appropriate t a the plant growth indicators plant height stem diamter and lai was responded as фpsii under e co2 in aw and ss the variation in lai and stem diameter were caused by the translocation of photosynthate to plant height 3 4 yield total dry weight water use efficiency and fruit quality total fruit yield yt total dry weight dwt and water use efficiency wuey during two growing seasons are illustrated in fig 9 the yt responded at its maximum level under ec700 as compared to a co2 as shown in fig 9 a on the contrary the dwt responded at its lowest under ec700 to a co2 during both growing seasons as explained in fig 9 b these findings revealed that under ec700 the plant s cellulose transferability to fruit was improved to its optimum level the wuey exhibited at the maximum level in both seasons as plants were exposed to ec700 as demonstrated in fig 9 c under super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 a deceleration tendency of yt and wuey was noticed the significant differences p 0 05 were not observed for yt and wuey under ec700 compared to ec850 and ec1000 in ss the yt and wuey were responded parallel to the responses of фpsii under e co2 in aw and ss which indicated that фpsii directly influenced the yt and wuey under e co2 the yt increased by 74 04 38 22 and 53 33 in aw and 55 86 53 92 and 29 23 in ss under ec700 ec850 and ec1000 as compared to a co2 the e co2 had no significant effect on total soluble solids tss for both seasons as shown in fig 10 a it was observed that e co2 had a significant impact on lycopene content lp as illustrated in fig 10 b the most effective response of lp was detected under ec700 during both growing seasons the significant differences p 0 05 in titratable acidity ta of tomatoes grown under different treatments were detected during both growing seasons as demonstrated in fig 10 c the potential of hydrogen ph of tomatoes did not response significantly p 0 05 under e co2 as compared to a co2 during both growing seasons as described in fig 10 d 3 5 pca analysis and analytical hierarchy process principal component analysis summarized the experimental results of plant responses against multiple e co2 principal component 1 pc 1 and principal component 2 pc 2 were extracted from the experimental data set based on kaiser rule as shown in fig 11 a i because the first two principal components explained 94 02 variance of experimental data for aw as shown fig 11 a the strong correlation was found among фpsii plant height yield wuey tss under multiple e co2 as these parameters were distributed in the first quadrant of biplot the stem diameter lai dwt and titratable acid along with ec1000 existed in the fourth quadrant of biplot indicated that these parameters were affected the most by ec1000 the closeness of stem dimeter lai and dwt indicated the highly correlation among them furthermore pc 2 illustrated the tomato lycopene content and was found on the top half of the biplot plot implying that lycopene content levels increased as plants were exposed to ec700 because loading score of lycopene content and ec700 were found very close to each other as compared to other treatments the a co2 and ph were loading in the third quadrant of biplot indicated that ph was not affected by e co2 in aw first two principal components explained 89 58 of the variation in the experimental results against multiple e co2 in ss the loading scores distribution of the фpsii plant height stem diameter lai yield wuey and tss along with ec700 e co2 were loaded on right side of pc 1 as shown in fig 12 a indicated the optimum influence of ec700 on plant height stem diameter lai yield wuey and tss through фpsii as mediator the ph dwt were affected by ec1000 the most due to closeness of loading scores the loading score of ec850 was near to origin of biplot indicated the less influence of ec850 on parameters as compared to ec700 titratable acid was not influenced by e co2 in ss so a co2 and titratable acid existed in second quadrant of biplot the seasonal variations of loading scores were observed among the фpsii plant height stem diameter lai yield wuey chl tss lycopene content ph titratable acid and dwt against multiple e co2 as shown in figs 11 and 12 the variation of accumulative degree days as shown in fig 4 of tomatoes growing seasons was main reason of loading scores variability of plant parametric responses in aw and ss the impact of ec1000 on plant height stem diameter and lai was observed higher in aw than ss because of high values of accumulative degree days the local weights of the paired wise matrix for each parameter are illustrated in fig 13 a the ahp ranked values was observed as ec1000 ec700 ec850 a co2 for aw while ec700 ec850 ec1000 a co2 for ss as shown in fig 13 b and c the super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 shows top ranking at ec1000 in the aw the ahp ranking score of ec1000 was only 1 0 higher than ec700 it was observed because of high air temperature during the initial growth stage of the aw which reduced the negative impact of high air temperature at super e co2 it indicated that super e co2 behaved as a heat stress buffer stimulating the most significant plant growth fitzgerald et al 2016 this study also found a high temperature during the initial growth stage of the aw season the plant s growth was accelerated under ec1000 compared to ec700 due to super e co2 effect against high add according to ahp the threshold level of co2 at 700 µmol mol 1 was found and recommended for commercial greenhouses for optimum plant growth and yield 4 discussion the present study aimed to assess the effect of e co2 on фpsii morphology yield water use efficiency and fruit quality under a controlled environment фpsii was adopted extensively to indicate light use efficiency in plants by researchers baker and rosenqvist 2004 in this study the values of фpsii varied with par which is similar to previous studies zhang et al 2022 the фpsii was affected by e co2 which was linked to plant growth and production jiang et al 2012 and considered a tool to monitor the physiological status of crops kalaji et al 2016 the level of co2 determined the effects of co2 enrichment on primary photochemistry photoprotective mechanisms and carbon fixation ability moderate co2 levels were advantageous because they alleviated the inorganic carbon constraint increasing carbon fixation and biomass production chekanov et al 2017 in this study фpsii was affected by e co2 fig 7 the variation in the pattern at super elevation of co2 was observed during both growing seasons because of add differences several studies reported that e co2 beyond certain thresholds adversely affected photosynthesis through down regulation photosynthesis robredo et al 2010 salvucci et al 2004 in our study фpsii declined after ec700 in both growing seasons plant growth elements consisting of plant height stem diameter and lai were improved by e co2 fig 8 consistently previous studies reported that tomato plant height stem diameter and lai were enhanced under single elevation of e co2 700 600 1500 and 1000 1500 µmol mol 1 and responded with varied increasing rate with respect to a co2 higashide et al 2015 karim et al 2020 rangaswamy et al 2021 in current study the allocation of photosynthates carbohydrates into other relevant growth components resulted in growth elements variation it was claimed that tomato plant height was higher at 550 µmol mol 1 than at 700 µmol mol 1 co2 while leaf area was lower at 550 µmol mol 1 than at 700 µmol mol 1 mamatha et al 2014 on other aspects the greatest gladiolus height was found under ec700 compared to ec900 indicated that e co2 increased up to a certain level beyond that level tended to decline kadam et al 2012 in the current study a similar occurrence was seen during the ss with a diminishing tendency for plant height stem diameter and lai under ec1000 and ec850 it mean that the plants growth slowed down under super e co2 and plants growth pattern was observed as фpsii under different levels of co2 in ss in our study seasonal variation was observed in plant growth indicator because of difference of add it was reported that e co2 worked as a heat buffer stimulating the most substantial wheat growth fitzgerald et al 2016 the effect of a single e co2 on plant yield and quality was studied extensively burkey et al 2012 fang et al 2019 in general e co2 increased crop yield kang et al 2002 myers et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 by promoting leaf photosynthesis ainsworth and long 2005 our research found the optimum yield under ec700 according to the literatures the e co2 boosted the production by increasing total biomass and facilitating biomass translocation to fruits dong et al 2016 luomala et al 2007 it is claimed by previous studies that total dry weight of tomatoes was enhanced by 9 56 67 and 11 24 leaf 48 stem under 800 720 and 590 µmol mol 1 respectively compared to a co2 juan et al 2007a 2007b pazzagli et al 2016 yang et al 2020 previous studies claimed that high e co2 had adverse effects on plant development through a process known as down regulation of photosynthesis zheng et al 2019 super elevation of co2 reduced yield of wheat by 22 25 as compared to threshold e co2 bugbee et al 1994 grotenhuis and bugbee 1997 high e co2 reduced the concentrations of most mineral nutrients in plant tissues and it might create cause of reduction in plant growth and yield gojon et al 2023 the mechanism in declining the pant growth and yield under high e co2 as compared to threshold e co2 need more investigation tomato is one of the most water demanding vegetable crops in protective cultivation and need to supply water throughout the growing period liu et al 2023 elevation of co2 enhanced the tomato growth under water shortage and saved the water indicating the suitable water saving factor with proper plant growth and yield in the arid region of china chen et al 2022 du et al 2023 the plants conserved water and enhanced the water productivity by decreasing stomatal conductance wullschleger et al 2002 and increasing the photosynthesis activities under e co2 significantly du et al 2022a 2022b liu et al 2019 yang et al 2022 consequently photosynthates translocation motivated yield and fresh biomass which improved the wuey mamatha et al 2014 yan et al 2017 elevation co2 enhanced the root length which increased the plant s ability to extract the water and nutrients from soil for the plant growth and yield du et al 2023 water losses were reduced because of lower stomatal conductance under e co2 du et al 2022a 2022b wuey was enhanced by e co2 during both seasons in our study earlier studies reported that wue was enhanced 18 3 when tomato plants were exposed to e co2 800 µmol mol 1 liu et al 2019 wue was enhanced by 8 4 under 800 µmol mol 1 elevated co2 yang et al 2020 the current study found varied response of fruit quality under e co2 our findings are consistent with earlier investigations as lycopene content levels increased by 53 and 52 when exposed to e co2 at 800 and 700 µmol mol 1 respectively hao et al 2020 helyes et al 2011 increased under 800 900 µmol mol 1 zhang et al 2014 as compared a co2 reduced by 9 3 at ec700 as compared to 550 µmol mol 1 mamatha et al 2014 furthermore tss and titration acid in cherry tomato was increased by 7 2 and 0 4 respectively at 1000 1500 µmol mol 1 as compared to a co2 karim et al 2020 a cause to improve tss was reported as soluble sugar was found in leaves which might be translocated into fruit enhancing fruit tss dong et al 2018 a recent study found that e co2 enhances the tomato plant s ability to uptake potassium for fruits and increasing phosphorus utilization efficiency that in turn might improve the lycopene content juan et al 2007a 2007b the response of fruit quality to e co2 is complex and merits further investigation the seasonal variation of co2 influence on plant growth indicators were occurred because add interactions of e co2 with plant growth indicators yt wuey and fruit quality were explained by the current study were found similar to other researchers as the positive relation explored between e co2 and photochemistry gutiérrez et al 2009 e co2 and yield broberg et al 2019 and e co2 and water use efficiency kellner et al 2017 but limited to show the trend of influence on growth indicators yield and wuey by continues co2 because of single elevation of co2 level ahp was employed to choose the threshold e co2 to enhance the plant growth yt wuey and fruit quality for the commercial greenhouses the findings of the current study showed that ec1000 is the first ranked as adequate e co2 during aw because the buffering effect of e co2 against high add which improved plant growth the ec1000 ahp ranking score was just 1 higher than ec700 exclusive results of plant growth yt wuey and fruit quality recommended suitable co2 for optimum production of tomato for commercial greenhouses is 700 µmol mol 1 5 conclusions in conclusion the study of two planting seasons indicated the effect of co2 elevation to be favorable for tomato crop growth with yield and wuey advantage over ambient the optimum tomato growth indicators фpsii plant height stem diameter lai and dwt yield and wuey were obtained under 700 µmol mol 1 in the protected cultivation future atmospheric co2 more than 700 µmol mol 1 might slow tomato growth the maximum translocation of photosynthates to fruits was observed under 700 µmol mol 1 the study clearly showed the strong or weak correlation of фpsii with plant height stem diameter lai dwt yield wuey and fruit quality by pca indicated that фpsii might be considered as a predictor of plant growth and yield this study provided valuable information to understand the photosynthesis status coupled with plant growth and

8906,greenhouse crops production has been improved by co2 enrichment commercially the impact of a threshold level of elevated co2 e co2 on the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii фpsii chlorophyll fluorescence parameter which is linked to crop yield crop growth and fruit quality is still uncertain many previous studies cultivated c3 crops under 550 700 µmol mol 1 not beyond this range hence tomato plants were grown under ambient co2 a co2 500 µmol mol 1 and e co2 700 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 named as ec700 ec850 and ec1000 respectively under uniform environmental conditions for two growing seasons to investigate the response of фpsii along with four photosynthetically active radiation intensities and plant growth to continuous co2 concentration co2 under four constant par intensities during autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 the order of mean фpsii values under e co2 were explored as ec700 ec1000 ec850 a co2 and ec700 ec850 ec1000 a co2 respectively the optimum total fruit yield was stimulated under ec700 by 74 04 and 55 86 during autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 respectively as compared to a co2 the results showed that water use efficiency related to yield wuey were enhanced by reducing the stomatal conductance under e co2 as compared to a co2 optimum wuey was enhanced by 55 91 210 87 under ec700 compared to a co2 the principal

diamter in autumn winter 2020 and spring summer 2021 indicated the strong effect of фpsii on plant growth and yield under e co2 the ec1000 in autumn winter 2020 and ec700 in spring summer 2021 were found more influential by the analytic hierarchy process to get optimum crop production no significant difference between the ranking scores of ec1000 and ec700 during autumn winter 2020 was found thus the overall optimum impact of e co2 on tomato growth was explored under ec700 the findings of this study are beneficial to greenhouses crops production commercially and could be used as

present food supply demand raised by increasing world s population munaweera et al 2022 rehman et al 2022 numerous researchers focused on photosynthetic efficiency because of its importance as a predictor of crop growth and yield it is revealed that e co2 influenced the photosynthesis rate and yield under adequate water and nutrients condition nomura et al 2021 which enhanced plant growth above ground biomass and yield abideen et al 2022 garcia et al 2023 the crop specific threshold e co2 need to be identified under sub tropical condition to get optimum photosynthesis rate the response

effective quantum yield and consequently on plant growth and yield for sustainable agriculture under changing climate chlorophyll fluorescence technology has been used to investigate the distribution of excitation energy inside the photosynthetic apparatus and explore photosynthesis mechanism regulation and adopted as an indicator for assessing plant growth responses stefanov et al 2022 because of the reduction in carbon constraint increased co2 improves photosynthetic efficiency enhances the supply of photo assimilates hong et al 2022 maschler et al 2022 and higher net leaf photosynthesis a rise in co2 has contributed to enhance crop growth and productivity in many field or chamber experiments allen et al 2020 dutta et al 2022 it is also claimed that when the crop was subjected to long term e co2 during the growth season it could modify the photosynthetic capacity of the crop and the stimulation impact on photosynthesis may not last adachi et al 2014 cai et al 2018 at late growth stage photosynthetic adaptation to e co2 i e down regulation or lower enhancement of photosynthesis might reduce the influence of e co2 on crop productivity wang et al 2020 effective quantum yield a

significantly affected the chlorophyll fluorescence of tomato plants it is essential to record the actual range of par values in the cecs to set the treatments of par for the investigation of e co2 effects on chlorophyll fluorescence under set par intensities during the growing period the maximum daily par parmax inside the cecs showed more than 97 5 from 9 00 15 00 for controlling factors it is essential to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters with constant par intensity as parmax was observed from 12 00 and 13 00 which accounted for 65 days during the entire growing period as a result the distribution of par intensity at six time intervals 9 00 10 00 10 00 11 00 11 00 12 00 12 00 13 00 13 00 14 00 and 14 00 15 00 during the entire growth period was investigated to confirm which par intensity should be chosen to determine the фpsii as shown in fig 6 from 9 00 11 00 and 13 00 15 00 the par was usually 100 500 μmol m 2 s 1 the par distribution phase with the most extensive range appeared from 12 00 13 00 however broad par intensity within 100 500 μmol m 2 s 1 range at 11 00 12 00 and 12 00 13 00 time intervals was revealed during the growth stage the par intensity was mainly distributed between 100 and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 and the pulses of light intensity were selected with the observed par range to analysis the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii data 3 2 impact of par and e co2 on physiology a rapid light curve was used to record the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii фpsii responses under four par intensities 125 190 285 and 420 μmol m 2 s 1 in each treatment of co2 concentration applied par intensities were selected based on recorded par intensity 100 and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 in chamber during entire growth period the responses of фpsii under e co2 and imposed light intensity are shown in fig 7 the order of mean values of фpsii was identified as ec700 ec1000 ec850 a co2 during aw and ec700 ec850 ec1000 a co2 during ss season under the four constant par intensities the optimum response of фpsii was explored under ec700 at constant light intensities for both growing seasons under super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 the фpsii responded negatively for both seasons compared to ec700 which indicated that the growth of tomatoes might decline by applying super e co2 as compared to ec700 as shown in fig 7 a and b the variation range of фpsii under ec700 was narrowed with the increasing par intensity during both growing seasons the minimum deviation of фpsii was observed under ec700 which indicated the more stable status of фpsii under ec700 as compared to other co2 enrichment treatments the фpsii was enhanced under ec700 as compared as a co2 by 17 06 18 45 and 8 25 14 34 the range of improvement in percentage was obtained at four par intensities in aw and ss respectively at optimal level among the co2 enrichment treatments leaf chlorophyll content chl during two growing seasons are shown in table 2 the ec850 affected chl significantly p 0 05 in aw in contrast ec1000 and ec700 influenced significantly p 0 05 in ss the chl enhanced by 7 39 10 53 and 9 32 in aw and 7 96 1 61 7 15 in ss under ec1000 ec850 and ec700 respectively 3 3 impact of e co2 on morphology plant height stem diameter and lai are integral components of plant growth all e co2 treatments improved plant height stem diameter and lai compared to a co2 for both growing seasons throughout the measuring periods as shown in fig 8 the pattern of plant height responses was obtained as фpsii pattern in the ss plant height was enhanced under e co2 by increasing values of фpsii in aw plant height was boosted under ec1000 flowering and fruiting stages of aw in contrast of фpsii because of high add in vegetation stage the maximum growth of stem diameter and lai was observed under ec1000 due to the buffer effect against high temperature during aw as shown in fig 8 c and e and under ec850 throughout ss except lai during vegetation and flowering stage that was responded under ec700 at optimum level as shown in fig 8 d and f plant height stem dimeter and lai increased under super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 owning to high add showing that super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 enhanced the plant s resilient ability to negative impact of high add on plant height stem diameter and lai as shown in fig 7 a c and e the super e co2 slowed the plant growth as compared to ec700 under appropriate t a 20 26 as seen by diminishing trends in plant height stem diameter and lai under ec1000 as compared to ec700 during ss growing season this suggests that super e co2 was not acceptable for plant growth at an appropriate t a the plant growth indicators plant height stem diamter and lai was responded as фpsii under e co2 in aw and ss the variation in lai and stem diameter were caused by the translocation of photosynthate to plant height 3 4 yield total dry weight water use efficiency and fruit quality total fruit yield yt total dry weight dwt and water use efficiency wuey during two growing seasons are illustrated in fig 9 the yt responded at its maximum level under ec700 as compared to a co2 as shown in fig 9 a on the contrary the dwt responded at its lowest under ec700 to a co2 during both growing seasons as explained in fig 9 b these findings revealed that under ec700 the plant s cellulose transferability to fruit was improved to its optimum level the wuey exhibited at the maximum level in both seasons as plants were exposed to ec700 as demonstrated in fig 9 c under super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 a deceleration tendency of yt and wuey was noticed the significant differences p 0 05 were not observed for yt and wuey under ec700 compared to ec850 and ec1000 in ss the yt and wuey were responded parallel to the responses of фpsii under e co2 in aw and ss which indicated that фpsii directly influenced the yt and wuey under e co2 the yt increased by 74 04 38 22 and 53 33 in aw and 55 86 53 92 and 29 23 in ss under ec700 ec850 and ec1000 as compared to a co2 the e co2 had no significant effect on total soluble solids tss for both seasons as shown in fig 10 a it was observed that e co2 had a significant impact on lycopene content lp as illustrated in fig 10 b the most effective response of lp was detected under ec700 during both growing seasons the significant differences p 0 05 in titratable acidity ta of tomatoes grown under different treatments were detected during both growing seasons as demonstrated in fig 10 c the potential of hydrogen ph of tomatoes did not response significantly p 0 05 under e co2 as compared to a co2 during both growing seasons as described in fig 10 d 3 5 pca analysis and analytical hierarchy process principal component analysis summarized the experimental results of plant responses against multiple e co2 principal component 1 pc 1 and principal component 2 pc 2 were extracted from the experimental data set based on kaiser rule as shown in fig 11 a i because the first two principal components explained 94 02 variance of experimental data for aw as shown fig 11 a the strong correlation was found among фpsii plant height yield wuey tss under multiple e co2 as these parameters were distributed in the first quadrant of biplot the stem diameter lai dwt and titratable acid along with ec1000 existed in the fourth quadrant of biplot indicated that these parameters were affected the most by ec1000 the closeness of stem dimeter lai and dwt indicated the highly correlation among them furthermore pc 2 illustrated the tomato lycopene content and was found on the top half of the biplot plot implying that lycopene content levels increased as plants were exposed to ec700 because loading score of lycopene content and ec700 were found very close to each other as compared to other treatments the a co2 and ph were loading in the third quadrant of biplot indicated that ph was not affected by e co2 in aw first two principal components explained 89 58 of the variation in the experimental results against multiple e co2 in ss the loading scores distribution of the фpsii plant height stem diameter lai yield wuey and tss along with ec700 e co2 were loaded on right side of pc 1 as shown in fig 12 a indicated the optimum influence of ec700 on plant height stem diameter lai yield wuey and tss through фpsii as mediator the ph dwt were affected by ec1000 the most due to closeness of loading scores the loading score of ec850 was near to origin of biplot indicated the less influence of ec850 on parameters as compared to ec700 titratable acid was not influenced by e co2 in ss so a co2 and titratable acid existed in second quadrant of biplot the seasonal variations of loading scores were observed among the фpsii plant height stem diameter lai yield wuey chl tss lycopene content ph titratable acid and dwt against multiple e co2 as shown in figs 11 and 12 the variation of accumulative degree days as shown in fig 4 of tomatoes growing seasons was main reason of loading scores variability of plant parametric responses in aw and ss the impact of ec1000 on plant height stem diameter and lai was observed higher in aw than ss because of high values of accumulative degree days the local weights of the paired wise matrix for each parameter are illustrated in fig 13 a the ahp ranked values was observed as ec1000 ec700 ec850 a co2 for aw while ec700 ec850 ec1000 a co2 for ss as shown in fig 13 b and c the super e co2 850 and 1000 µmol mol 1 shows top ranking at ec1000 in the aw the ahp ranking score of ec1000 was only 1 0 higher than ec700 it was observed because of high air temperature during the initial growth stage of the aw which reduced the negative impact of high air temperature at super e co2 it indicated that super e co2 behaved as a heat stress buffer stimulating the most significant plant growth fitzgerald et al 2016 this study also found a high temperature during the initial growth stage of the aw season the plant s growth was accelerated under ec1000 compared to ec700 due to super e co2 effect against high add according to ahp the threshold level of co2 at 700 µmol mol 1 was found and recommended for commercial greenhouses for optimum plant growth and yield 4 discussion the present study aimed to assess the effect of e co2 on фpsii morphology yield water use efficiency and fruit quality under a controlled environment фpsii was adopted extensively to indicate light use efficiency in plants by researchers baker and rosenqvist 2004 in this study the values of фpsii varied with par which is similar to previous studies zhang et al 2022 the фpsii was affected by e co2 which was linked to plant growth and production jiang et al 2012 and considered a tool to monitor the physiological status of crops kalaji et al 2016 the level of co2 determined the effects of co2 enrichment on primary photochemistry photoprotective mechanisms and carbon fixation ability moderate co2 levels were advantageous because they alleviated the inorganic carbon constraint increasing carbon fixation and biomass production chekanov et al 2017 in this study фpsii was affected by e co2 fig 7 the variation in the pattern at super elevation of co2 was observed during both growing seasons because of add differences several studies reported that e co2 beyond certain thresholds adversely affected photosynthesis through down regulation photosynthesis robredo et al 2010 salvucci et al 2004 in our study фpsii declined after ec700 in both growing seasons plant growth elements consisting of plant height stem diameter and lai were improved by e co2 fig 8 consistently previous studies reported that tomato plant height stem diameter and lai were enhanced under single elevation of e co2 700 600 1500 and 1000 1500 µmol mol 1 and responded with varied increasing rate with respect to a co2 higashide et al 2015 karim et al 2020 rangaswamy et al 2021 in current study the allocation of photosynthates carbohydrates into other relevant growth components resulted in growth elements variation it was claimed that tomato plant height was higher at 550 µmol mol 1 than at 700 µmol mol 1 co2 while leaf area was lower at 550 µmol mol 1 than at 700 µmol mol 1 mamatha et al 2014 on other aspects the greatest gladiolus height was found under ec700 compared to ec900 indicated that e co2 increased up to a certain level beyond that level tended to decline kadam et al 2012 in the current study a similar occurrence was seen during the ss with a diminishing tendency for plant height stem diameter and lai under ec1000 and ec850 it mean that the plants growth slowed down under super e co2 and plants growth pattern was observed as фpsii under different levels of co2 in ss in our study seasonal variation was observed in plant growth indicator because of difference of add it was reported that e co2 worked as a heat buffer stimulating the most substantial wheat growth fitzgerald et al 2016 the effect of a single e co2 on plant yield and quality was studied extensively burkey et al 2012 fang et al 2019 in general e co2 increased crop yield kang et al 2002 myers et al 2014 pazzagli et al 2016 by promoting leaf photosynthesis ainsworth and long 2005 our research found the optimum yield under ec700 according to the literatures the e co2 boosted the production by increasing total biomass and facilitating biomass translocation to fruits dong et al 2016 luomala et al 2007 it is claimed by previous studies that total dry weight of tomatoes was enhanced by 9 56 67 and 11 24 leaf 48 stem under 800 720 and 590 µmol mol 1 respectively compared to a co2 juan et al 2007a 2007b pazzagli et al 2016 yang et al 2020 previous studies claimed that high e co2 had adverse effects on plant development through a process known as down regulation of photosynthesis zheng et al 2019 super elevation of co2 reduced yield of wheat by 22 25 as compared to threshold e co2 bugbee et al 1994 grotenhuis and bugbee 1997 high e co2 reduced the concentrations of most mineral nutrients in plant tissues and it might create cause of reduction in plant growth and yield gojon et al 2023 the mechanism in declining the pant growth and yield under high e co2 as compared to threshold e co2 need more investigation tomato is one of the most water demanding vegetable crops in protective cultivation and need to supply water throughout the growing period liu et al 2023 elevation of co2 enhanced the tomato growth under water shortage and saved the water indicating the suitable water saving factor with proper plant growth and yield in the arid region of china chen et al 2022 du et al 2023 the plants conserved water and enhanced the water productivity by decreasing stomatal conductance wullschleger et al 2002 and increasing the photosynthesis activities under e co2 significantly du et al 2022a 2022b liu et al 2019 yang et al 2022 consequently photosynthates translocation motivated yield and fresh biomass which improved the wuey mamatha et al 2014 yan et al 2017 elevation co2 enhanced the root length which increased the plant s ability to extract the water and nutrients from soil for the plant growth and yield du et al 2023 water losses were reduced because of lower stomatal conductance under e co2 du et al 2022a 2022b wuey was enhanced by e co2 during both seasons in our study earlier studies reported that wue was enhanced 18 3 when tomato plants were exposed to e co2 800 µmol mol 1 liu et al 2019 wue was enhanced by 8 4 under 800 µmol mol 1 elevated co2 yang et al 2020 the current study found varied response of fruit quality under e co2 our findings are consistent with earlier investigations as lycopene content levels increased by 53 and 52 when exposed to e co2 at 800 and 700 µmol mol 1 respectively hao et al 2020 helyes et al 2011 increased under 800 900 µmol mol 1 zhang et al 2014 as compared a co2 reduced by 9 3 at ec700 as compared to 550 µmol mol 1 mamatha et al 2014 furthermore tss and titration acid in cherry tomato was increased by 7 2 and 0 4 respectively at 1000 1500 µmol mol 1 as compared to a co2 karim et al 2020 a cause to improve tss was reported as soluble sugar was found in leaves which might be translocated into fruit enhancing fruit tss dong et al 2018 a recent study found that e co2 enhances the tomato plant s ability to uptake potassium for fruits and increasing phosphorus utilization efficiency that in turn might improve the lycopene content juan et al 2007a 2007b the response of fruit quality to e co2 is complex and merits further investigation the seasonal variation of co2 influence on plant growth indicators were occurred because add interactions of e co2 with plant growth indicators yt wuey and fruit quality were explained by the current study were found similar to other researchers as the positive relation explored between e co2 and photochemistry gutiérrez et al 2009 e co2 and yield broberg et al 2019 and e co2 and water use efficiency kellner et al 2017 but limited to show the trend of influence on growth indicators yield and wuey by continues co2 because of single elevation of co2 level ahp was employed to choose the threshold e co2 to enhance the plant growth yt wuey and fruit quality for the commercial greenhouses the findings of the current study showed that ec1000 is the first ranked as adequate e co2 during aw because the buffering effect of e co2 against high add which improved plant growth the ec1000 ahp ranking score was just 1 higher than ec700 exclusive results of plant growth yt wuey and fruit quality recommended suitable co2 for optimum production of tomato for commercial greenhouses is 700 µmol mol 1 5 conclusions in conclusion the study of two planting seasons indicated the effect of co2 elevation to be favorable for tomato crop growth with yield and wuey advantage over ambient the optimum tomato growth indicators фpsii plant height stem diameter lai and dwt yield and wuey were obtained under 700 µmol mol 1 in the protected cultivation future atmospheric co2 more than 700 µmol mol 1 might slow tomato growth the maximum translocation of photosynthates to fruits was observed under 700 µmol mol 1 the study clearly showed the strong or weak correlation of фpsii with plant height stem diameter lai dwt yield wuey and fruit quality by pca indicated that фpsii might be considered as a predictor of plant growth and yield this study provided valuable information to understand the photosynthesis status coupled with plant growth and yield against multiple e co2 which can be used as references for crop climatic modeling and optimum crop production in protected cultivation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

8907,in the era of water scarcity and severe droughts the accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is crucial for the efficient management of water resources understanding hydrological and ecological processes and comprehending the relationships between the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere et is a complex phenomenon influenced by a set of biophysical and environmental factors its estimation becomes more complicated in heterogeneous environments demanding detailed data and accurate model calibration combining remote sensing imagery and machine learning ml models has provided a considerable capacity for estimating et which relaxes a number of assumptions and requires less data than traditional approaches satellite imagery provides influential variables for et estimation using ml models nevertheless a growing number of ml models and emerging satellite imagery has opened up a wide and complex potential before researchers while previous studies have reviewed physical based methods for et estimation this paper offers a recent decade review of the progress challenges and opportunities provided by the rs and ml models for the et estimation and future outlook keywords flux towers land surface temperature surface energy balance water resources management data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 background evapotranspiration et is considered a key component in the hydrological cycle and a fundamental factor in irrigation crop yield etsimation forestry and environmental management ferreira et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 zhang et al 2010 which consumes about 50 of net irradiation and returns 70 of total precipitation to the atmosphere guo et al 2017 lu et al 2017 pan et al 2018 pan et al 2015 shen et al 2013 et directly links energy balance to water balance a connection that depends on available water energy and vapor pressure dong et al 2020 sarkar and sarkar 2018 the accurate estimation of et is crucial for understanding hydrological and ecological processes allen et al 2005 detecting and mitigating agricultural drought and managing water resources anderson et al 2007 teuling et al 2009 et estimation is also necessary for the study of climatic events i e drought and understanding the relationships between the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere systems orth and destouni 2018 fig 1 shows various components of et and the factors that can be obtained from remote sensing rs data as input for machine learning models et combines the two distinct processes allen et al 1998 dalton 1802 in which water is lost from the soil surface and leaves through evaporation and transpiration respectively hamon 1961 during evaporation liquid water usually evaporates from surfaces such as lakes rivers soils and wet vegetation and the energy required for this task is provided by solar radiation overall evaporation is affected by irradiation air temperature humidity and wind speed gao et al 2017 liu et al 2020 transpiration is a process by which liquid water in plants is released through small holes in the leaves called stomata transpiration is controlled by climatic circumstances soil moisture and physiology and the plant s structure changes in non climatic factors such as increased atmospheric co2 land cover and nitrogen deposition also act as effective stimulants of transpiration gedney et al 2006 mao et al 2015 pan et al 2018 sumner 2001 the processes of evaporation and transpiration can occur together in certain conditions they are difficult to separate monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 as a complex physical phenomenon et involves several nonlinear processes jovic et al 2018 each dominated by several factors granata 2019 we deal with three types of et namely actual et eta potential et etp and reference et et0 eta is considered the sum of soil and vegetation evaporation and vegetation transpiration wang and dickinson 2012 and is controlled by factors such as vegetation type fractional vegetation cover fvc phonological cycle soil type soil moisture irrigation and drainage meteorological conditions and water management in croplands i e maintaining soil moisture and irrigation management allen et al 1998 etp refers to the maximum possible amount of et considering the climatic and meteorological conditions assuming complete vegetation cover in the absence of any limiting factor such as soil moisture nutrients pests or disease thornthwaite 1948 the concept of et0 is the same as etp except that it is used for a specific plant type grass 0 12 m high surface resistance 70 s m and albedo coefficient 0 23 that indicates the evaporating power of the atmosphere merely as a function of climatic parameters jensen and haise 1963 2 approaches to estimating evapotranspiration in recent decades a variety of approaches for et estimation have been proposed and they can be divided into the two general categories of point comprising direct and indirect and regional methods fig 2 direct point methods comprise lysimeter soil moisture changes the bowen ratio scintillometry eddy covariance sap flow etc zhang et al 2014 lysimeter used for the direct measurement of et with no assumptions holmes 1984 can provide the most accurate estimation of et and be used as a benchmark for the calibration of other methods anapalli et al 2016 x liu et al 2017 however this method is expensive hard to work and associated with environmental degradation baiamonte and motisi 2020 fan et al 2018 kisi et al 2015 organization 2008 scanlon et al 1997 as a result some indirect methods such as experimental and quasi experimental equations have been developed in which et is estimated by considering the influential factors almorox et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 based on the equations and parameters indirect methods can be divided into six groups aerodynamics energy balance experimental evaporators hybrid and miscellaneous here we will briefly describe the standard methods the penman and penman monteith pm methods are two hybrid models that can estimate et in different climatic zones with high accuracy based on energy balance and aerodynamic laws allen et al 1998 feng et al 2017 the food and agriculture organization fao calibrated the pm equation with lysimeters across the world for all climatic conditions the resulting method fao56 pm is a benchmark for the accurate assessment and calibration of other models allen et al 1998 sumner and jacobs 2005 traore et al 2010 the penman monteith etp and fao56 pm are methods used to estimate et0 maroufpoor et al 2020 and require a comprehensive set of meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed atmospheric pressure ea and soil heat flux g the construction and maintenance of meteorological stations that collect this data are costly even for developed countries hence it is not always possible to find places where all these requirements are met chu et al 2017 especially in developing countries that rarely provide reliable data on wind speed and solar radiation for consecutive years bellido jiménez et al 2021 de paola and giugni 2013 eccel 2012 therefore researchers have sought alternative techniques for achieving an acceptable et estimation with minimum data experimental models present a solution to this issue and can be divided into four groups based on the required input i models based on mass transfer dalton 1802 dracos 1980 mahringer 1970 meyer 1926 penman and keen 1948 trabert 1896 ii models based on solar reflection rs abtew 1996 irmak et al 2003 makkink 1957 priestley and taylor 1972 taylor 2001 iii temperature based models hargreaves and samani 1985 hargreaves et al 1985 and iv hybrid models which combine the previous three methods and take various parameters such as sunlight air temperature and relative humidity as input alexandris and kerkides 2003 doorenbos 1977 valiantzas john 2013 experimental methods for et estimation are used only at the field or catchment scale and are not generalizable for other regions moreover their calibration is time and space dependent islam and alam 2021 kisi et al 2015 most meteorological stations around the world are located in non agricultural environments with dry and bare soil surfaces and or concrete surfaces et0 estimates may cause errors due to increases in maximum and minimum air temperatures or low dew point temperature shelton 1987 point methods can provide et measurements on a local scale but the direct measurement of et on a global scale is impossible as dense global coverage by such instruments is neither available nor feasible 3 objectives since the advent of earth observation technology in 1957 notably the tiros meteorological satellite series since 1960 and the landsat series since 1972 tatem et al 2008 a variety of methods have been developed for the spatiotemporal estimation of et at regional and global scales chen and liu 2020 however rs data cannot provide a direct estimation of surface et instead they estimate the retrievable surface parameters associated with et such as surface temperature vegetation indices and soil moisture fisher et al 2008 jung et al 2010 miralles et al 2011 ryu et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 numerous rs based models have been developed to estimate et at the regional scale the equations are based on various theoretical hypotheses such as energy balance canopy conduction and monin obukhov similarity theory these models can be divided into four groups the first group consists of single source surface energy balance models such as seb ball et al 1987 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebs su 2002 and metric allen et al 2007 three source models tseb norman et al 1995 alexi anderson et al 1997 and disalexi norman et al 2000 were developed based on surface energy budgets and work well to estimate et however their dependency on aerodynamic and surface resistances necessitates some important variables such as wind speed or vapor pressure deficit vpd which are usually not retrievable through rs data the second group comprises models based on pm and priestley taylor cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 peng et al 2019 yao et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 the pm equation considers all major factors that influence et but estimating surface resistance gs which is a key parameter in pm for the et estimation remains a challenge jiang et al 2016 for this reason priestley taylor models ignore aerodynamic and surface resistance the third group consists of empirical vegetation index land surface temperature lst also known as triangle trapezoidal models including tefm carlson et al 1995 goward et al 1985 jiang and islam 1999 price 1984 tim moran et al 1996 s sebi roerink et al 2000 ttefm nishida et al 2003 ttme long and singh 2012 htem yang et al 2013 eteml yang et al 2015 sebe4s merlin et al 2014 tdtm minacapilli et al 2016 and esvep tang and li 2017a tang and li 2017b tang and li 2017c these models rely on surface temperature measurements to estimate et which are ineffective in providing continuous et using satellite data often influenced by clouds and places where the heat flux is noticeably small such as areas with dense vegetation chen and liu 2020 the fourth group of rs based models for estimating et incorporates data driven models divided into experimental or semi experimental jung et al 2009 jung et al 2010 tramontana et al 2016 wang et al 2007 and statistical models which estimate eta by establishing an experimental relationship between rs meteorological hydrological and eta variables such as flux observations zhao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that physical models and analytical methods are not more accurate than simple experimental and statistical approaches kalma et al 2008 et varies noticeably over space and time mainly because of the spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface the complex climatic conditions near the surface and the dynamic variability of the water and heat transfer process however physical methods alone cannot take all these factors into account the use of data driven models to estimate et has increased rapidly in recent years because of their ability to identify complex relationships machine learning ml methods require no previous knowledge or assumptions and handle complex relationships many researchers have used ml models to integrate ground observations rs and climatic data to estimate local and global et despite the considerable advances in rs technology and progress in ml models no review to date has focused on the results of using ml and rs data to estimate et in the latest decade moreover most related papers have examined physical based methods chen and liu 2020 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 therefore this paper examines the role of ml and rs in et estimation from different aspects in section 4 different types of input data their sources and their advantages and disadvantages are presented section 5 describes basics of ml models in terms of their features and application in et estimation finally the future perspective of using ml in et estimation is presented in section 6 4 input data to estimate actual evapotranspiration accurate identification and selection of input data is key to developing an ml model hence one should always consider the input data in terms of availability and relevance variables affecting et include climatic factors maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity duration and intensity of solar radiation soil properties soil moisture crop type agricultural practices soil texture and plant properties plant type growth stage leaf shape total water potential within the leaf allen et al 1998 primary data can be obtained predominantly from two sources namely ground observation and rs data maeda et al 2011 these two datasets act as complementary sources to increase the accuracy of et estimation in the following we will first describe the ground data and then provide the details of rs data more comprehensively to collect ground based data we can use weather stations flux towers and global databases such as glam glass and gldas and the main rs sensors that have been highly considered by the researchers for et estimation are modis landsat avhrr noaa grace and sentinel series in that order 4 1 ground based data fig 3 provides a complete list of ground based data used for et estimation the most important parameters that can be used along with rs indices to boost the accuracy of et estimation are net radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation while air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation can be obtained from weather stations and their flux towers some parameters such as precipitation directly and rn indirectly could be obtained from satellite data and global databases such as glam glass and gldas sunlight the et energy source varies depending on time of day and latitude allen et al 1998 not all the energy available at earth s surface is consumed by et a portion of it increases air temperature and some of it penetrates the soil solar radiation absorbed into the atmosphere and reflected from the earth s surface increases air temperature transmits noticeable heat from the surrounding air to the plant and controls the intensity of et rosenberg et al 1983 the difference between water vapor pressure at the surface and in the atmosphere is the main factor of water vapor transfer and depends mainly on wind and air turbulence fletcher et al 2007 so wind speed and relative humidity are the main influential factors of et furthermore precipitation affects the rate of et by increasing soil moisture and decreasing air temperature influential factors of et vary over different regions the annual variability of et is attributed mainly to changes in temperature precipitation and solar shortwave radiation pan et al 2020 liu et al 2022 investigated the effects of climate change water fluctuations and vegetation conditions on et variation worldwide and identified temperature as the essential determinant of et in most regions ueyama et al 2014 and jang et al 2021 identified net radiation as the essential meteorological variable in estimating eta nevertheless wind speed plays a vital role in the rate of et reduction because of annual changes in wind speed in most regions ignoring this factor introduces error in et estimation mcvicar et al 2012 sheffield wood and roderick 2012 cui et al 2021 kim et al 2020 observed that relative humidity lst and air temperature make up about 70 of the influential factors of et variation heat transfer between the land surfaces and atmosphere is the main regulator of the transfer of water vapor from the soil and vegetation to the atmosphere batra et al 2006 relative humidity is directly related to vpd es ea lst and air temperature can affect relative humidity kim et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 ground data can be obtained from synoptic meteorological stations and the fluxnet network the last three decades have seen the launch of fluxnet towers to meet the demand for terrestrial data pastorello et al 2020 fluxnet tower sites are located mostly in north america europe and asia while some are available in south america oceania and africa different types of data can be obtained from the fluxnet database the main advantage of ground observation data is that it is ready to use without any preprocessing steps chia et al 2020 however the use of such data also has disadvantages for example meteorological station measurements only show the conditions of the tower and its proximity baldocchi 2008 yang et al 2006 and setting up and maintaining these stations are costly ultimately the uncertainties of the et obtained from the fluxnet networks are not widely measured because they are commonly used as reference data mueller et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 xia et al 2016 in addition the flux towers are not spatially well distributed and this heterogeneous distribution leads to significant uncertainties in et estimation at both regional and global scales li et al 2018 4 2 remote sensing data as stated above rs satellites cannot directly provide the rate of et rather rs data such as lst vegetation indices and surface albedo are used to estimate et at the pixel level fig 4 presents a set of pertinent variables related to geographic region climatic and vegetation conditions which affect the estimation of et and can be retrieved via rs satellites a description of rs variables is presented below in order of their frequency in the literature 4 2 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndvi provides a quantitative estimate of biomass vegetation health and growth rouse et al 1973 and evaluates vegetation status by measuring the difference between the near infrared reflective zone and red absorption zone portions of electromagnetic radiation ndvi varies from 1 to 1 the closer the value is to 1 the higher the density the healthier the circumstances and in general the better the vegetation conditions will be ndvi is directly related to photosynthetic capacity and thus energy uptake of plant canopies gamon et al 1995 grace et al 2007 it is also sensitive to the background soil atmospheric conditions cloudiness and leaf canopy shades which requires appropriate consideration xue and su 2017 ndvi provides essential information about the exposed surface in the atmosphere for the photosynthesis kamble et al 2013 xia et al 2014 found a strong positive correlation between ndvi and et which indicates the importance of ndvi for et estimation and can well show the roughness properties of vegetation ndvi has been introduced as the most crucial index with other parameters to increase the accuracy of et estimation bachour et al 2014 carter and liang 2019 chen et al 2013 ke et al 2016 li et al 2018 pan et al 2020 wang et al 2017 ndvi changes with vegetation moisture gonzalo martin et al 2017 and is more sensitive during the initial period of plant growth however at the peak time of greenness it is saturated and cannot accurately describe the plant s growth status hao et al 2022 nevertheless using ndvi in combination with other indices increases the accuracy of et estimation carter and liang 2019 for example filgueiras et al 2020 found that because of the limitations of both simple ratio sr and ndvi using them together increased the model accuracy and robustness 4 2 2 land surface temperature lst lst is a critically important factor in the physical processes of surface energy and water balance and a direct driving force in the exchange of long wave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes at the surface atmosphere interface liu et al 2006 lst has severe spatial and temporal variations because of the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics such as vegetation topography and soil liu et al 2006 therefore the accurate estimation of lst requires measurements with accurate spatiotemporal sampling due to the complexity of lst ground based measurements cannot practically provide a large scale estimation li et al 2013 the alternative is thermal infrared data which is related to lst through the radiation transfer equation lst retrieval from rs data dates back to the 1970 s mcmillin 1975 currently lst data can be obtained with an appropriate temporal resolution by various sensors and different algorithms however it has a coarser spatial resolution compared to other spectral bands hence it is often downscaled using axillary data 4 2 3 photosynthetic active radiation par photosynthesis converts sunlight into sugar which is a key component in vegetation performance par refers to the range of 400 700 nm solar radiation that can be measured by vegetation canopy at photosynthesis in μmol m 2 s 1 xie et al 2010 fractional par fpar is a unitless ratio that varies from 0 to 1 and points to the fraction of incoming solar radiation in the range of 400 700 nm absorbed by the vegetation canopy yang et al 2014 it is a key indicator of water energy and carbon balance churkina and running 1998 it is also an important factor in the evaluation of ecosystem services climate models net primary production and crop yield estimation models sellers et al 1996 with the highest effect in calculating stomatal resistance rs zhao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 identified par as the most important variable affecting et as 44 6 of the world s semi arid regions are significantly affected by par enhanced vegetation index evi and par were also identified as two important factors for the weekly estimation of et and a simple evi par model was suggested to monitor et for large scale areas wagle et al 2017 4 2 4 leaf area index lai defined as one way green leaf area per unit area of land alton 2016 lai is used as a critical indicator of vegetation development to describe land evaporation photosynthesis and carbon sequestration boussetta et al 2013 lai is often indicated using a look up table which depends on vegetation and season however global rs based lai data has recently become available and it can be used to estimate et fang et al 2019 studied different methods for retrieving lai bachour et al 2014 showed that reference et could be estimated with high accuracy using ndvi lai and ml techniques there is a strong correlation between lai and the crop coefficient curve kc derived from satellite data which can be used to extract daily kc maps das et al 2020 pasqualotto et al 2019 it should be noted that the accuracy of lai is affected by leaf shading especially for tall and dense forests and shaded leaves that are not saturated with light which leads to scattered sunlight conditions and then further to a higher fraction of fpar in the shady areas of the leaves xu et al 2019 4 2 5 enhanced vegetation index evi evi is an optimized vegetation index intended to amplify the vegetation signal in areas with high biomass by separating the canopy background signal and reducing the atmosphere effects jiang et al 2008 it reduces the adverse effects of environmental factors such as atmosphere and background soil while ndvi is sensitive to chlorophyll evi is more sensitive to changes in the canopy structure including lai canopy type and plant physiology evi also incorporates a blue band measurement in addition to the red and near infrared bands used in ndvi which can provide a more accurate assessment of vegetation health in certain situations yu et al 2020 identified evi and climatic variables as the best predictor of et changes yang et al 2006 considered evi to be more important for predicting et than lst or land cover given a higher temporal resolution evi could significantly increase the accuracy of regional and continental et estimates 4 2 6 surface albedo in rs meteorological and atmospheric sciences the concept of albedo is closely related to the energy balance duffie et al 2020 liu and jordan 1963 park and park 2016 philander 2008 has provided a popular definition of albedo albedo is derived from the latin word albus meaning white albedo is the amount of sunlight of all wavelengths reflected from an object or substance the more reflected light there is the brighter the object s color will be albedo usually refers to the whole spectrum of solar radiation or just the visible part the visible albedo of natural surfaces varies from a minimum of 0 04 for deep water to 0 8 for fresh snow or thick clouds gueymard et al 2019 many surfaces increase albedo as the solar apex angle increases albedo is an important element for lst estimation pang et al 2021 4 2 7 soil adjusted vegetation index savi because ndvi is not sensitive to the soil background huete 1988 developed the savi index which ranges from 0 to 1 and contains a soil coefficient this index is often used in arid areas where vegetation is sparse major et al 1990 savi uses a soil reflection correction factor to minimize the effects of soil background in practice coefficients are determined according to the local environmental conditions in dense environments the coefficient is close to 1 indicating that the soil background does not affect vegetation information extraction this ideal condition is rarely found in natural environments and can be used only in cases of high canopy density whereas it is about 0 5 in most common environmental conditions a savi soil coefficient near 0 means that the savi value is identical to ndvi 4 2 8 digital elevation model dem digital elevation model dem is a globally available data representing continuous topographic information bhushan et al 2021 dem is represented by an array of square cells pixels showing a height value for each location and can be obtained from contour lines topographic maps field surveys photogrammetric techniques radar interferometry and laser altimeters arun 2013 dem can be useful for estimating and analyzing et by providing information on the topography i e slope and aspect which can influence solar radiation wind speed hydrology and microclimatic conditions of the terrain in their study khanal et al 2021 showed that the accurate estimation of et depends on crop pattern climate and dem ignoring these variables will significantly reduce the model s accuracy 4 2 9 normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 proposed the normalized difference water index ndwi in 1996 which separates water and moisture by measuring the difference between near infrared which absorbs water highly and green which reflects more bands ndwi ranges from 1 to 1 higher values are attributed to the high water content or water level while a lower value is a sign of drought conditions or a non water level gao 1996 while ndwi has been less used by researchers and has not shown a significant improvement in et estimation inclusion of a parameter to indicate water availability is critical particularly in arid areas 4 2 10 land use and land cover lulc lulc maps show different types of natural cover land cover or modified for human use land use for example forests pastures farmland lakes and wetlands lulc shows the functional relationship between land climate and soil which provides biophysical insights into the environment and the drivers of change andrew et al 2014 grekousis et al 2015 townshend et al 2012 the rate of et in different lulc types is different due to the different emicivity coefficients difference in surface resistance stomatal resistance in vegetation interaction between the lulc type and climatic variables the abovementioned indices were selected based on their frequency in the reviewed papers however other indices such as tws msavi ndmi nir swir and ndgi have also been used to estimate et and have increased the modeling accuracy 5 machine learning models over the years using ml models to estimate et has increased ml models have been shown to be competitive or to perform better than physical and experimental methods our review has shown that more than 30 learning models have been used for et estimation in the following and based on fig 5 we will describe the most frequently used models including rf 30 cases svm 25 cases and ann 17 cases a full list of reviewed papers including their used model data type study area and temporal resolution is provided in the supplementary material it should be noted that the ml models have been used for a variety of purposes in the chain of et estimation such as data preparation reyes rojas et al 2021 downscaling ke et al 2016 li et al 2021 combining the output of different methods hao et al 2021 shang et al 2021 hao et al 2022 temporal gap filling cui et al 2021 estimation of input for the physical methods peng et al 2022 combination of different satellite images to increase the spatiotemporal accuracy xu et al 2018 and handling cloudy pixels 5 1 random forest rf rf is a non linear tree based model constructed from a base learner called classification and regression tree cart which is implemented numerous times cart is sensitive to minor changes in the input data and a completely different tree structure might be produced for this reason the model is re implemented many times and the average of the repetitions makes a robust and more stable prediction iteration of cart is possible through bootstrap sampling which means sampling with replacement rf assumes no assumption on data distribution nor sensitive to the noisy outlier and missing data and can learn complex patterns for predicting unseen data it is computationally effecient and powerful when fed with a high quality and pertinent dataset while the rf is a relatively simple model that is easy to implement and interpret it can suffer from overfitting if the number of trees is too high or if the input variables are highly correlated rf has been shown to be effective for et estimation at basin level hu et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 and has outperformed most learning models in the reviewed papers dias et al 2021 reyes rojas et al 2021 showed that the rf model had the best overall performance in estimating eta compared to other models this model also performed better than the svm bai et al 2021 hao et al 2021 pan et al 2020 and more complex models such as dnn and cnn hu et al 2021 peng et al 2022 in addition douna et al 2021 showed that the rf model which uses lai and lst can predict more accurate et values than those obtained from the modis product 5 2 support vector machine svm svm is a supervised ml algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks it has shown a good performance in the literature especially in low data environments in this model each sample is plotted in an n dimensional space number of features or independent variables separated by a line plane or hyperplane vapnik 1999 for better separation the given samples are usually mapped using a selected kernel to a higher space the most popular kernels are sigmoid linear rbf and polynomial svm is highly effective in handling both linear and nonlinear regression problems noisy datasets and outliers and has a regularization parameter that allows for controlling the complexity of the model which helps to avoid overfitting svm however requires appropriate hyperparameter tuning which can be a challenging task it can be computationally expensive especially when working with large datasets difficult to interpret and understand the model and sensitive to the choice of kernel function similar to other ml models svm creates functional relationships between et and explanatory variables while ignoring explicit biophysical mechanisms mosre and suárez 2021 and it is more suitable for the short term prediction of et kaheil et al 2008 yang et al 2006 trained svm based on ameriflux data to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of et for the united states from 2000 to 2002 liu et al 2018 explained 71 85 of the et changes on earth s surface using only five indicators average daily temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and ndvi as input data for the svm using svm m liu et al 2017 x liu et al 2017 with ten inputs in 242 global sites could explain 60 80 of et variations 5 3 artificial neural network ann to date anns with different architectures have been developed and applied in various disciplines the learning process in anns is done by introducing some random weights and then optimizing the weights to minimize the prediction error one of the most common neural network s type is the multilayer perceptron ann is usually consisting of three layers an input layer a processing layer and an output layer which is not sensitive to the distribution of input data rosenblatt 1958 anns can learn and adapt from data which makes them powerful for prediction they can handle large and noisy datasets and effectively model complex nonlinear relationships between variables making them effective in solving complex problems however anns are highly complex less interpretable prone to overfitting require significant computational power and memory resources and require a large amount of data to train which can be time consuming and expensive for estimating et the ann model performed better than the terra modis pet on the korean peninsula jang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 reported that the ann based hybrid model performed better than the rf and svm models with higher accuracy and broader applications 6 conclusion and future direction advances in rs technology have facilitated the continuous monitoring of biophysical variables affecting et estimation xia et al 2014 physics based models can maintain energy balance but require experimental estimation of some parameters such as surface resistance and determining hot and cold pixels which is challenging for large scale studies or a global scale ml models on the other hand have reduced uncertainties and yielded more accurate predictions as can be seen in fig 6 the trend of using ml models has been increasing over recent years the number of papers published has increased sharply in 2020 and 2021 confirming the importance and efficiency of these methods applying ml methods in et estimation can be summarized in the following two sections algorithms and data the success of ml methods in estimating et relies heavily on the choice of predictors for example the predominant role of vegetation change in controlling global et changes has been widely reported over the past few decades while other factors such as co2 concentration precipitation and downward radiation continue to play essential roles in et estimation svm and anns are considerably affected by redundant variables while the rf shows moderate degradation in performance kuhn and johnson 2013 shafizadeh moghadam 2021 some models such as the rf are fast to implement while other models such as anns take longer time by increasing the study area and influential factors the ml models might be time consuming mainly when parameter tuning is considered and input data come from the high resolution satellite imagery parameter optimization known as hyperparameter tuning is another factor influencing the success of ml methods however setting the model s parameters usually depends on user experience and the nature of the input data if the parameters are not adequately adjusted reliable results cannot be achieved additionally ml models may struggle with extrapolation meaning that they may not be able to generalize well beyond the data they were trained on ml models may perform comparably or even better than complex physical methods particularly for the large scale studies but they do not have the interpretability that physical models do none of the ml models are comprehensive and depending on the environment and data each has its pros and cons it should be noted that single ml models may perform comparably or even better than combined models or separate physical models depending on the input data model type extreme values etc however to get the best results in situations where we deal with a complex phenomenon it is better to use ensemble models that yield more stable results ensemble modeling combines the strengths of different mechanisms of ml and statistical models and reduces uncertainty in addition to ensemble modeling using deep learning methods have been widely used in recent years in different fields future studies should examine the limitations and accuracy of et estimation using deep learning models and rs data both for the local and large scale studies further the accuracy of ml models depends on the quality of satellite and terrestrial data and the representativeness of the samples there are several uncertainties associated with rs data some of these uncertainties include sensor noise cloud cover atmospheric interferences shadows limitations in spatiotemporal resolution and satellite viewing angle satellites with a higher temporal resolution usually have a lower spatial resolution combining different sensors is necessary to obtain higher frequencies and better spatial resolution in agricultural applications for example a modis resolution of 1 km is not desirable and may cause significant errors in et estimation thus we can look for ways to downscale with the ml models or adopt image fusion approaches such as the combined use of modis and landsat or sentinel 2 geographically most studies have been conducted in china the united states and european countries because of the presence of fluxnet towers and reliable data for model validation in those areas nonetheless et estimation in arid and semi arid regions such as africa south asia the middle east australia and the arctic is very important and climate problems and water crises are evident in these areas fig 7 therefore the development of fluxnet towers in these areas is reasonably necessary because ml models require large amounts of quality data to train effectively if the data is biased or incomplete then the model may not be able to generate accurate predictions hence other ground based et observations and fluxnet towers in arid and semi arid regions can reduce uncertainty of et estimation when using the fluxnet quality of the data and accuracy of the measurements should be considered because fluxnet data are affected by changes in the vegetation cover or lulc difference in processing and analysis of data type of instrumentation measuring height wind direction speed atmospheric stability

8907,in the era of water scarcity and severe droughts the accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is crucial for the efficient management of water resources understanding hydrological and ecological processes and comprehending the relationships between the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere et is a complex phenomenon influenced by a set of biophysical and environmental factors its estimation becomes more complicated in heterogeneous environments demanding detailed data and accurate model calibration combining remote sensing imagery and machine learning ml models has provided a considerable capacity for estimating et which relaxes a number of assumptions and requires less data than traditional approaches satellite imagery provides influential variables for et estimation using ml models nevertheless a growing number of ml models and emerging satellite imagery has opened up a wide and complex potential before researchers while previous studies have reviewed physical based methods for et estimation this paper offers a recent decade review of the progress challenges and opportunities provided by the rs and ml models for the et estimation and future outlook keywords flux towers land surface temperature surface energy balance water resources management data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 background evapotranspiration et is considered a key component in the hydrological cycle and a fundamental factor in irrigation crop yield etsimation forestry and environmental management ferreira et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2020

teuling et al 2009 et estimation is also necessary for the study of climatic events i e drought and understanding the relationships between the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere systems orth and destouni 2018 fig 1 shows various components of et and the factors that can be obtained from remote sensing rs data as input for machine learning models et combines the two distinct processes allen et al 1998 dalton 1802 in which water is lost from the soil surface and leaves through evaporation and transpiration respectively hamon 1961 during evaporation liquid water usually evaporates from surfaces such as lakes rivers soils and wet vegetation and the energy required for this task is provided by solar radiation overall evaporation is affected by irradiation air temperature humidity and wind speed gao et al 2017 liu et al 2020 transpiration is a process by which liquid water in plants is released through small holes in the leaves called stomata transpiration is controlled by climatic circumstances soil moisture and physiology and the plant s structure changes in non climatic factors such as increased atmospheric co2 land cover and nitrogen deposition also act as effective stimulants of transpiration gedney et al 2006 mao et al 2015 pan et al 2018 sumner 2001 the processes of evaporation and transpiration can occur together in certain conditions they are difficult to separate monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 as a complex physical phenomenon et involves several nonlinear processes jovic et al 2018 each dominated by several factors granata 2019 we deal with three types of et namely actual et eta potential et etp and reference et et0 eta is considered the sum of soil and vegetation evaporation and vegetation transpiration wang and dickinson 2012 and is controlled by factors such as vegetation type fractional vegetation cover fvc phonological cycle soil type soil moisture irrigation and drainage meteorological conditions and water management in croplands i e maintaining soil moisture and irrigation management allen et al 1998 etp refers to the maximum possible amount of et considering the climatic and meteorological conditions assuming complete vegetation cover in the absence of any limiting factor such as soil moisture nutrients pests or disease thornthwaite 1948 the concept of et0 is the same as etp except that it is used for a specific plant type grass 0 12 m high surface resistance 70 s m and albedo coefficient 0 23 that indicates the evaporating power of the atmosphere merely as a function of climatic parameters jensen and haise 1963 2 approaches to estimating evapotranspiration in recent decades a variety of approaches for et estimation have been proposed and they can be divided into the two general categories of point comprising direct and indirect and regional methods fig 2 direct point methods comprise lysimeter soil moisture changes the bowen ratio scintillometry eddy covariance sap flow etc zhang et al 2014 lysimeter used for the direct measurement of et with no assumptions holmes 1984 can provide the most accurate estimation of et and be used as a benchmark for the calibration of other methods anapalli et al 2016 x liu et al 2017 however this method is expensive hard to work and associated with environmental degradation baiamonte and motisi 2020 fan et al 2018 kisi et al 2015 organization 2008 scanlon et al 1997 as a result some indirect methods such as experimental and quasi experimental equations have been developed in which et is estimated by considering the influential factors almorox et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 based on the equations and parameters indirect methods can be divided into six groups aerodynamics energy balance experimental evaporators hybrid and miscellaneous here we will briefly describe the standard methods the penman and penman monteith pm methods are two hybrid models that can estimate et in different climatic zones with high accuracy based on energy balance and aerodynamic laws allen et al 1998 feng et al 2017 the food and agriculture organization fao calibrated the pm equation with lysimeters across the world for all climatic conditions the resulting method fao56 pm is a benchmark for the accurate assessment and calibration of other models allen et al 1998 sumner and jacobs 2005 traore et al 2010 the penman monteith etp and fao56 pm are methods used to estimate et0 maroufpoor et al 2020 and require a comprehensive set of meteorological data including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed atmospheric pressure ea and soil heat flux g the construction and maintenance of meteorological stations that collect this data are costly even for developed countries hence it is not always possible to find places where all these requirements are met chu et al 2017 especially in developing countries that rarely provide reliable data on wind speed and solar radiation for consecutive years bellido jiménez et al 2021 de paola and giugni 2013 eccel 2012 therefore researchers have sought alternative techniques for achieving an acceptable et estimation with minimum data experimental models present a solution to this issue and can be divided into four groups based on the required input i models based on mass transfer dalton 1802 dracos 1980 mahringer 1970 meyer 1926 penman and keen 1948 trabert 1896 ii models based on solar reflection rs abtew 1996 irmak et al 2003 makkink 1957 priestley and taylor 1972 taylor 2001 iii temperature based models hargreaves and samani 1985 hargreaves et al 1985 and iv hybrid models which combine the previous three methods and take various parameters such as sunlight air temperature and relative humidity as input alexandris and kerkides 2003 doorenbos 1977 valiantzas john 2013 experimental methods for et estimation are used only at the field or catchment scale and are not generalizable for other regions moreover their calibration is time and space dependent islam and alam 2021 kisi et al 2015 most meteorological stations around the world are located in non agricultural environments with dry and bare soil surfaces and or concrete surfaces et0 estimates may cause errors due to increases in maximum and minimum air temperatures or low dew point temperature shelton 1987 point methods can provide et measurements on a local scale but the direct measurement of et on a global scale is impossible as dense global coverage by such instruments is neither available nor feasible 3 objectives since the advent of earth observation technology in 1957 notably the tiros meteorological satellite series since 1960 and the landsat series since 1972 tatem et al 2008 a variety of methods have been developed for the spatiotemporal estimation of et at regional and global scales chen and liu 2020 however rs data cannot provide a direct estimation of surface et instead they estimate the retrievable surface parameters associated with et such as surface temperature vegetation indices and soil moisture fisher et al 2008 jung et al 2010 miralles et al 2011 ryu et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 numerous rs based models have been developed to estimate et at the regional scale the equations are based on various theoretical hypotheses such as energy balance canopy conduction and monin obukhov similarity theory these models can be divided into four groups the first group consists of single source surface energy balance models such as seb ball et al 1987 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebs su 2002 and metric allen et al 2007 three source models tseb norman et al 1995 alexi anderson et al 1997 and disalexi norman et al 2000 were developed based on surface energy budgets and work well to estimate et however their dependency on aerodynamic and surface resistances necessitates some important variables such as wind speed or vapor pressure deficit vpd which are usually not retrievable through rs data the second group comprises models based on pm and priestley taylor cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 peng et al 2019 yao et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 the pm equation considers all major factors that influence et but estimating surface resistance gs which is a key parameter in pm for the et estimation remains a challenge jiang et al 2016 for this reason priestley taylor models ignore aerodynamic and surface resistance the third group consists of empirical vegetation index land surface temperature lst also known as triangle trapezoidal models including tefm carlson et al 1995 goward et al 1985 jiang and islam 1999 price 1984 tim moran et al 1996 s sebi roerink et al 2000 ttefm nishida et al 2003 ttme long and singh 2012 htem yang et al 2013 eteml yang et al 2015 sebe4s merlin et al 2014 tdtm minacapilli et al 2016 and esvep tang and li 2017a tang and li 2017b tang and li 2017c these models rely on surface temperature measurements to estimate et which are ineffective in providing continuous et using satellite data often influenced by clouds and places where the heat flux is noticeably small such as areas with dense vegetation chen and liu 2020 the fourth group of rs based models for estimating et incorporates data driven models divided into experimental or semi experimental jung et al 2009 jung et al 2010 tramontana et al 2016 wang et al 2007 and statistical models which estimate eta by establishing an experimental relationship between rs meteorological hydrological and eta variables such as flux observations zhao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that physical models and analytical methods are not more accurate than simple experimental and statistical approaches kalma et al 2008 et varies noticeably over space and time mainly because of the spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface the complex climatic conditions near the surface and the dynamic variability of the water and heat transfer process however physical methods alone cannot take all these factors into account the use of data driven models to estimate et has increased rapidly in recent years because of their ability to identify complex relationships machine learning ml methods require no previous knowledge or assumptions and handle complex relationships many researchers have used ml models to integrate ground observations rs and climatic data to estimate local and global et despite the considerable advances in rs technology and progress in ml models no review to date has focused on the results of using ml and rs data to estimate et in the latest decade moreover most related papers have examined physical based methods chen and liu 2020 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 therefore this paper examines the role of ml and rs in et estimation from different aspects in section 4 different types of input data their sources and their advantages and disadvantages are presented section 5 describes basics of ml models in terms of their features and application in et estimation finally the future perspective of using ml in et estimation is presented in section 6 4 input data to estimate actual evapotranspiration accurate identification and selection of input data is key to developing an ml model hence one should always consider the input data in terms of availability and relevance variables affecting et include climatic factors maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity duration and intensity of solar radiation soil properties soil moisture crop type agricultural practices soil texture and plant properties plant type growth stage leaf shape total water potential within the leaf allen et al 1998 primary data can be obtained predominantly from two sources namely ground observation and rs data maeda et al 2011 these two datasets act as complementary sources to increase the accuracy of et estimation in the following we will first describe the ground data and then provide the details of rs data more comprehensively to collect ground based data we can use weather stations flux towers and global databases such as glam glass and gldas and the main rs sensors that have been highly considered by the researchers for et estimation are modis landsat avhrr noaa grace and sentinel series in that order 4 1 ground based data fig 3 provides a complete list of ground based data used for et estimation the most important parameters that can be used along with rs indices to boost the accuracy of et estimation are net radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation while air temperature wind speed relative humidity and precipitation can be obtained from weather stations and their flux towers some parameters such as precipitation directly and rn indirectly could be obtained from satellite data and global databases such as glam glass and gldas sunlight the et energy source varies depending on time of day and latitude allen et al 1998 not all the energy available at earth s surface is consumed by et a portion of it increases air temperature and some of it penetrates the soil solar radiation absorbed into the atmosphere and reflected from the earth s surface increases air temperature transmits noticeable heat from the surrounding air to the plant and controls the intensity of et rosenberg et al 1983 the difference between water vapor pressure at the surface and in the atmosphere is the main factor of water vapor transfer and depends mainly on wind and air turbulence fletcher et al 2007 so wind speed and relative humidity are the main influential factors of et furthermore precipitation affects the rate of et by increasing soil moisture and decreasing air temperature influential factors of et vary over different regions the annual variability of et is attributed mainly to changes in temperature precipitation and solar shortwave radiation pan et al 2020 liu et al 2022 investigated the effects of climate change water fluctuations and vegetation conditions on et variation worldwide and identified temperature as the essential determinant of et in most regions ueyama et al 2014 and jang et al 2021 identified net radiation as the essential meteorological variable in estimating eta nevertheless wind speed plays a vital role in the rate of et reduction because of annual changes in wind speed in most regions ignoring this factor introduces error in et estimation mcvicar et al 2012 sheffield wood and roderick 2012 cui et al 2021 kim et al 2020 observed that relative humidity lst and air temperature make up about 70 of the influential factors of et variation heat transfer between the land surfaces and atmosphere is the main regulator of the transfer of water vapor from the soil and vegetation to the atmosphere batra et al 2006 relative humidity is directly related to vpd es ea lst and air temperature can affect relative humidity kim et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 ground data can be obtained from synoptic meteorological stations and the fluxnet network the last three decades have seen the launch of fluxnet towers to meet the demand for terrestrial data pastorello et al 2020 fluxnet tower sites are located mostly in north america europe and asia while some are available in south america oceania and africa different types of data can be obtained from the fluxnet database the main advantage of ground observation data is that it is ready to use without any preprocessing steps chia et al 2020 however the use of such data also has disadvantages for example meteorological station measurements only show the conditions of the tower and its proximity baldocchi 2008 yang et al 2006 and setting up and maintaining these stations are costly ultimately the uncertainties of the et obtained from the fluxnet networks are not widely measured because they are commonly used as reference data mueller et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 xia et al 2016 in addition the flux towers are not spatially well distributed and this heterogeneous distribution leads to significant uncertainties in et estimation at both regional and global scales li et al 2018 4 2 remote sensing data as stated above rs satellites cannot directly provide the rate of et rather rs data such as lst vegetation indices and surface albedo are used to estimate et at the pixel level fig 4 presents a set of pertinent variables related to geographic region climatic and vegetation conditions which affect the estimation of et and can be retrieved via rs satellites a description of rs variables is presented below in order of their frequency in the literature 4 2 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi ndvi provides a quantitative estimate of biomass vegetation health and growth rouse et al 1973 and evaluates vegetation status by measuring the difference between the near infrared reflective zone and red absorption zone portions of electromagnetic radiation ndvi varies from 1 to 1 the closer the value is to 1 the higher the density the healthier the circumstances and in general the better the vegetation conditions will be ndvi is directly related to photosynthetic capacity and thus energy uptake of plant canopies gamon et al 1995 grace et al 2007 it is also sensitive to the background soil atmospheric conditions cloudiness and leaf canopy shades which requires appropriate consideration xue and su 2017 ndvi provides essential information about the exposed surface in the atmosphere for the photosynthesis kamble et al 2013 xia et al 2014 found a strong positive correlation between ndvi and et which indicates the importance of ndvi for et estimation and can well show the roughness properties of vegetation ndvi has been introduced as the most crucial index with other parameters to increase the accuracy of et estimation bachour et al 2014 carter and liang 2019 chen et al 2013 ke et al 2016 li et al 2018 pan et al 2020 wang et al 2017 ndvi changes with vegetation moisture gonzalo martin et al 2017 and is more sensitive during the initial period of plant growth however at the peak time of greenness it is saturated and cannot accurately describe the plant s growth status hao et al 2022 nevertheless using ndvi in combination with other indices increases the accuracy of et estimation carter and liang 2019 for example filgueiras et al 2020 found that because of the limitations of both simple ratio sr and ndvi using them together increased the model accuracy and robustness 4 2 2 land surface temperature lst lst is a critically important factor in the physical processes of surface energy and water balance and a direct driving force in the exchange of long wave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes at the surface atmosphere interface liu et al 2006 lst has severe spatial and temporal variations because of the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics such as vegetation topography and soil liu et al 2006 therefore the accurate estimation of lst requires measurements with accurate spatiotemporal sampling due to the complexity of lst ground based measurements cannot practically provide a large scale estimation li et al 2013 the alternative is thermal infrared data which is related to lst through the radiation transfer equation lst retrieval from rs data dates back to the 1970 s mcmillin 1975 currently lst data can be obtained with an appropriate temporal resolution by various sensors and different algorithms however it has a coarser spatial resolution compared to other spectral bands hence it is often downscaled using axillary data 4 2 3 photosynthetic active radiation par photosynthesis converts sunlight into sugar which is a key component in vegetation performance par refers to the range of 400 700 nm solar radiation that can be measured by vegetation canopy at photosynthesis in μmol m 2 s 1 xie et al 2010 fractional par fpar is a unitless ratio that varies from 0 to 1 and points to the fraction of incoming solar radiation in the range of 400 700 nm absorbed by the vegetation canopy yang et al 2014 it is a key indicator of water energy and carbon balance churkina and running 1998 it is also an important factor in the evaluation of ecosystem services climate models net primary production and crop yield estimation models sellers et al 1996 with the highest effect in calculating stomatal resistance rs zhao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 identified par as the most important variable affecting et as 44 6 of the world s semi arid regions are significantly affected by par enhanced vegetation index evi and par were also identified as two important factors for the weekly estimation of et and a simple evi par model was suggested to monitor et for large scale areas wagle et al 2017 4 2 4 leaf area index lai defined as one way green leaf area per unit area of land alton 2016 lai is used as a critical indicator of vegetation development to describe land evaporation photosynthesis and carbon sequestration boussetta et al 2013 lai is often indicated using a look up table which depends on vegetation and season however global rs based lai data has recently become available and it can be used to estimate et fang et al 2019 studied different methods for retrieving lai bachour et al 2014 showed that reference et could be estimated with high accuracy using ndvi lai and ml techniques there is a strong correlation between lai and the crop coefficient curve kc derived from satellite data which can be used to extract daily kc maps das et al 2020 pasqualotto et al 2019 it should be noted that the accuracy of lai is affected by leaf shading especially for tall and dense forests and shaded leaves that are not saturated with light which leads to scattered sunlight conditions and then further to a higher fraction of fpar in the shady areas of the leaves xu et al 2019 4 2 5 enhanced vegetation index evi evi is an optimized vegetation index intended to amplify the vegetation signal in areas with high biomass by separating the canopy background signal and reducing the atmosphere effects jiang et al 2008 it reduces the adverse effects of environmental factors such as atmosphere and background soil while ndvi is sensitive to chlorophyll evi is more sensitive to changes in the canopy structure including lai canopy type and plant physiology evi also incorporates a blue band measurement in addition to the red and near infrared bands used in ndvi which can provide a more accurate assessment of vegetation health in certain situations yu et al 2020 identified evi and climatic variables as the best predictor of et changes yang et al 2006 considered evi to be more important for predicting et than lst or land cover given a higher temporal resolution evi could significantly increase the accuracy of regional and continental et estimates 4 2 6 surface albedo in rs meteorological and atmospheric sciences the concept of albedo is closely related to the energy balance duffie et al 2020 liu and jordan 1963 park and park 2016 philander 2008 has provided a popular definition of albedo albedo is derived from the latin word albus meaning white albedo is the amount of sunlight of all wavelengths reflected from an object or substance the more reflected light there is the brighter the object s color will be albedo usually refers to the whole spectrum of solar radiation or just the visible part the visible albedo of natural surfaces varies from a minimum of 0 04 for deep water to 0 8 for fresh snow or thick clouds gueymard et al 2019 many surfaces increase albedo as the solar apex angle increases albedo is an important element for lst estimation pang et al 2021 4 2 7 soil adjusted vegetation index savi because ndvi is not sensitive to the soil background huete 1988 developed the savi index which ranges from 0 to 1 and contains a soil coefficient this index is often used in arid areas where vegetation is sparse major et al 1990 savi uses a soil reflection correction factor to minimize the effects of soil background in practice coefficients are determined according to the local environmental conditions in dense environments the coefficient is close to 1 indicating that the soil background does not affect vegetation information extraction this ideal condition is rarely found in natural environments and can be used only in cases of high canopy density whereas it is about 0 5 in most common environmental conditions a savi soil coefficient near 0 means that the savi value is identical to ndvi 4 2 8 digital elevation model dem digital elevation model dem is a globally available data representing continuous topographic information bhushan et al 2021 dem is represented by an array of square cells pixels showing a height value for each location and can be obtained from contour lines topographic maps field surveys photogrammetric techniques radar interferometry and laser altimeters arun 2013 dem can be useful for estimating and analyzing et by providing information on the topography i e slope and aspect which can influence solar radiation wind speed hydrology and microclimatic conditions of the terrain in their study khanal et al 2021 showed that the accurate estimation of et depends on crop pattern climate and dem ignoring these variables will significantly reduce the model s accuracy 4 2 9 normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 proposed the normalized difference water index ndwi in 1996 which separates water and moisture by measuring the difference between near infrared which absorbs water highly and green which reflects more bands ndwi ranges from 1 to 1 higher values are attributed to the high water content or water level while a lower value is a sign of drought conditions or a non water level gao 1996 while ndwi has been less used by researchers and has not shown a significant improvement in et estimation inclusion of a parameter to indicate water availability is critical particularly in arid areas 4 2 10 land use and land cover lulc lulc maps show different types of natural cover land cover or modified for human use land use for example forests pastures farmland lakes and wetlands lulc shows the functional relationship between land climate and soil which provides biophysical insights into the environment and the drivers of change andrew et al 2014 grekousis et al 2015 townshend et al 2012 the rate of et in different lulc types is different due to the different emicivity coefficients difference in surface resistance stomatal resistance in vegetation interaction between the lulc type and climatic variables the abovementioned indices were selected based on their frequency in the reviewed papers however other indices such as tws msavi ndmi nir swir and ndgi have also been used to estimate et and have increased the modeling accuracy 5 machine learning models over the years using ml models to estimate et has increased ml models have been shown to be competitive or to perform better than physical and experimental methods our review has shown that more than 30 learning models have been used for et estimation in the following and based on fig 5 we will describe the most frequently used models including rf 30 cases svm 25 cases and ann 17 cases a full list of reviewed papers including their used model data type study area and temporal resolution is provided in the supplementary material it should be noted that the ml models have been used for a variety of purposes in the chain of et estimation such as data preparation reyes rojas et al 2021 downscaling ke et al 2016 li et al 2021 combining the output of different methods hao et al 2021 shang et al 2021 hao et al 2022 temporal gap filling cui et al 2021 estimation of input for the physical methods peng et al 2022 combination of different satellite images to increase the spatiotemporal accuracy xu et al 2018 and handling cloudy pixels 5 1 random forest rf rf is a non linear tree based model constructed from a base learner called classification and regression tree cart which is implemented numerous times cart is sensitive to minor changes in the input data and a completely different tree structure might be produced for this reason the model is re implemented many times and the average of the repetitions makes a robust and more stable prediction iteration of cart is possible through bootstrap sampling which means sampling with replacement rf assumes no assumption on data distribution nor sensitive to the noisy outlier and missing data and can learn complex patterns for predicting unseen data it is computationally effecient and powerful when fed with a high quality and pertinent dataset while the rf is a relatively simple model that is easy to implement and interpret it can suffer from overfitting if the number of trees is too high or if the input variables are highly correlated rf has been shown to be effective for et estimation at basin level hu et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 and has outperformed most learning models in the reviewed papers dias et al 2021 reyes rojas et al 2021 showed that the rf model had the best overall performance in estimating eta compared to other models this model also performed better than the svm bai et al 2021 hao et al 2021 pan et al 2020 and more complex models such as dnn and cnn hu et al 2021 peng et al 2022 in addition douna et al 2021 showed that the rf model which uses lai and lst can predict more accurate et values than those obtained from the modis product 5 2 support vector machine svm svm is a supervised ml algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks it has shown a good performance in the literature especially in low data environments in this model each sample is plotted in an n dimensional space number of features or independent variables separated by a line plane or hyperplane vapnik 1999 for better separation the given samples are usually mapped using a selected kernel to a higher space the most popular kernels are sigmoid linear rbf and polynomial svm is highly effective in handling both linear and nonlinear regression problems noisy datasets and outliers and has a regularization parameter that allows for controlling the complexity of the model which helps to avoid overfitting svm however requires appropriate hyperparameter tuning which can be a challenging task it can be computationally expensive especially when working with large datasets difficult to interpret and understand the model and sensitive to the choice of kernel function similar to other ml models svm creates functional relationships between et and explanatory variables while ignoring explicit biophysical mechanisms mosre and suárez 2021 and it is more suitable for the short term prediction of et kaheil et al 2008 yang et al 2006 trained svm based on ameriflux data to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of et for the united states from 2000 to 2002 liu et al 2018 explained 71 85 of the et changes on earth s surface using only five indicators average daily temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and ndvi as input data for the svm using svm m liu et al 2017 x liu et al 2017 with ten inputs in 242 global sites could explain 60 80 of et variations 5 3 artificial neural network ann to date anns with different architectures have been developed and applied in various disciplines the learning process in anns is done by introducing some random weights and then optimizing the weights to minimize the prediction error one of the most common neural network s type is the multilayer perceptron ann is usually consisting of three layers an input layer a processing layer and an output layer which is not sensitive to the distribution of input data rosenblatt 1958 anns can learn and adapt from data which makes them powerful for prediction they can handle large and noisy datasets and effectively model complex nonlinear relationships between variables making them effective in solving complex problems however anns are highly complex less interpretable prone to overfitting require significant computational power and memory resources and require a large amount of data to train which can be time consuming and expensive for estimating et the ann model performed better than the terra modis pet on the korean peninsula jang et al 2021 liu et al 2021 reported that the ann based hybrid model performed better than the rf and svm models with higher accuracy and broader applications 6 conclusion and future direction advances in rs technology have facilitated the continuous monitoring of biophysical variables affecting et estimation xia et al 2014 physics based models can maintain energy balance but require experimental estimation of some parameters such as surface resistance and determining hot and cold pixels which is challenging for large scale studies or a global scale ml models on the other hand have reduced uncertainties and yielded more accurate predictions as can be seen in fig 6 the trend of using ml models has been increasing over recent years the number of papers published has increased sharply in 2020 and 2021 confirming the importance and efficiency of these methods applying ml methods in et estimation can be summarized in the following two sections algorithms and data the success of ml methods in estimating et relies heavily on the choice of predictors for example the predominant role of vegetation change in controlling global et changes has been widely reported over the past few decades while other factors such as co2 concentration precipitation and downward radiation continue to play essential roles in et estimation svm and anns are considerably affected by redundant variables while the rf shows moderate degradation in performance kuhn and johnson 2013 shafizadeh moghadam 2021 some models such as the rf are fast to implement while other models such as anns take longer time by increasing the study area and influential factors the ml models might be time consuming mainly when parameter tuning is considered and input data come from the high resolution satellite imagery parameter optimization known as hyperparameter tuning is another factor influencing the success of ml methods however setting the model s parameters usually depends on user experience and the nature of the input data if the parameters are not adequately adjusted reliable results cannot be achieved additionally ml models may struggle with extrapolation meaning that they may not be able to generalize well beyond the data they were trained on ml models may perform comparably or even better than complex physical methods particularly for the large scale studies but they do not have the interpretability that physical models do none of the ml models are comprehensive and depending on the environment and data each has its pros and cons it should be noted that single ml models may perform comparably or even better than combined models or separate physical models depending on the input data model type extreme values etc however to get the best results in situations where we deal with a complex phenomenon it is better to use ensemble models that yield more stable results ensemble modeling combines the strengths of different mechanisms of ml and statistical models and reduces uncertainty in addition to ensemble modeling using deep learning methods have been widely used in recent years in different fields future studies should examine the limitations and accuracy of et estimation using deep learning models and rs data both for the local and large scale studies further the accuracy of ml models depends on the quality of satellite and terrestrial data and the representativeness of the samples there are several uncertainties associated with rs data some of these uncertainties include sensor noise cloud cover atmospheric interferences shadows limitations in spatiotemporal resolution and satellite viewing angle satellites with a higher temporal resolution usually have a lower spatial resolution combining different sensors is necessary to obtain higher frequencies and better spatial resolution in agricultural applications for example a modis resolution of 1 km is not desirable and may cause significant errors in et estimation thus we can look for ways to downscale with the ml models or adopt image fusion approaches such as the combined use of modis and landsat or sentinel 2 geographically most studies have been conducted in china the united states and european countries because of the presence of fluxnet towers and reliable data for model validation in those areas nonetheless et estimation in arid and semi arid regions such as africa south asia the middle east australia and the arctic is very important and climate problems and water crises are evident in these areas fig 7 therefore the development of fluxnet towers in these areas is reasonably necessary because ml models require large amounts of quality data to train effectively if the data is biased or incomplete then the model may not be able to generate accurate predictions hence other ground based et observations and fluxnet towers in arid and semi arid regions can reduce uncertainty of et estimation when using the fluxnet quality of the data and accuracy of the measurements should be considered because fluxnet data are affected by changes in the vegetation cover or lulc difference in processing and analysis of data type of instrumentation measuring height wind direction speed atmospheric stability

8908,irrigated areas face new pressing challenges due to escalating energy costs for pumping increasing cost of seeds fertilizers and agrochemicals volatility of agricultural commodities pressure of environmental regulations water scarcity and mounting cost of irrigation infrastructure investments at the same time from the technical standpoint farmers can chose from a wide array of irrigation design and operation alternatives for collective and on farm systems with variable effects on crop yield and profitability these factors are often subjected to quick changes complicating decision making simulation models have proven useful to support decision making in irrigation infrastructure water energy use crop agronomy and soil management in this research new capacities of the ador simulation software are reported targeting comprehensive analyses of irrigation modernization the model implements additional on farm irrigation methods low pressure solid set center pivot and drip irrigation crop intensification double cropping in the same season and crop response to different on farm irrigation management options timing and frequency model performance was verified using a set of theoretical case studies finally the model was applied to the optimization of irrigation design and management water and energy in the bardenas xi project of northeastern spain water application in center pivot and drip irrigation were simulated using a normal distribution characterized by a user defined distribution uniformity in center pivot the application depth was randomized in every irrigation event reproducing the random nature of wind disturbances in drip irrigation the application depth followed the same random distribution in all irrigation events reproducing the deterministic effect of manufacturing and hydraulic variability according to the literature the effect of irrigation timing was treated differently for two key sprinkler irrigated crops corn and alfalfa differences in water application and crop yield between on farm methods resulted in different gross and net income in the bardenas xi project irrigation performance indicators showed different patterns of inter annual variability deep percolation was strongly affected by the amount of seasonal precipitation and by distribution uniformity indicators at the plot level were strongly determined by the on farm irrigation method the soil type and the crop in the conditions of bardenas xi the design option without pumping station was the most adequate natural pressure proved sufficient for a combination of low pressure sprinkler irrigation pivot and drip irrigation methods distributed throughout the irrigated area escalating energy costs emphasize the need for careful assessment of pumping requirements at the design phase of irrigation projects keywords on farm irrigation methods irrigation modernization collective irrigation networks water use efficiency energy use efficiency low pressure sprinkler simulation models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is expected to continue modifying water supply and demand over the world for instance the united states has increased water demand in the last years particularly in the western states this has raised uncertainty about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the west schaible et al 2010 in 2007 the australian government launched the national plan for water security package almost 6 billion over ten years the plan set out to modernize irrigation infrastructure both on and off farm targeting water conservation khan et al 2010 reported that this plan would lead to more efﬁcient productive and proﬁtable water use with a view to maintaining the value of irrigated production in the face of declining water availability in europe the problem of water scarcity is particularly relevant in mediterranean countries such as spain italy or greece in these countries as is commonly the case in semiarid regions agriculture is the sector obtaining the largest share of water use uncertainty in water supplies will further constrain already over allocated water resources and will increase competition among agricultural municipal industrial and ecological uses smith et al 2007 increasing competition underlines the importance of efficient use of irrigation water developing capacities to apply irrigation water at the time in the amount and in the way needed to meet consumptive use requirements for each crop and at each growth stage in the xxi century national irrigation modernization plans mapama and mapama 2002 2010 were launched by the spanish government to address irrigation project deficiencies water scarcity problems water eu directives and changes in social structure these plans took advantage of new information and communication technologies playán et al 2018 in addition most spanish regional governments designed and applied their own irrigation modernization plans also addressing european regulations a new plan to improve the efficiency and sustainability of irrigated areas has been deployed in the framework of the post covid recovery and resilience plan of the european union boe 2021 both obsolete and recently modernized irrigated areas face new pressing challenges among them the escalating costs of energy and other agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers the price volatility of agricultural commodities the pressure of environmental regulations and the mounting interests rates that increase the payback cost of investments in irrigation modernization these challenges are currently threatening the economic viability of many irrigated areas the wide array of irrigation design and operation alternatives for collective and on farm systems their effect on crop yield and their water and energy requirements complicated decision making all these concerns stress the need for adequate management at all irrigation levels in order to obtain full benefit from public and private investments in irrigation modernization simulation models have proven useful to support decision making in irrigation infrastructure water energy use crop agronomy and soil management when planning future crops farmers also need to decide between on farm irrigation methods and need to install designs optimized for their local conditions irrigation management requires frequent tactical decision making simulation models and sensing platforms using a variety of information sources are increasingly used to support these decisions in each irrigation method zapata et al 2009 presented an early version of ador simulation a software combining capacities for the simulation of solid set sprinkler irrigation crop water requirements and yield in irrigation districts zapata et al 2013 presented the experimental application of a version of this software applied to real time irrigation control in a solid set sprinkler irrigated maize farm the model was based on available daily local reference evapotranspiration et0 data obtained via internet local sensors pressure and discharge at the farm inlet temperature and wind speed and simulation of irrigation application variability and the soil crop water balance the main contribution of this research was the explicit consideration of both space and time variability hydraulic hydrological meteorological and agronomical for irrigation decision making leading to optimum crop yield and water use efficiency miranda et al 2005 also working on solid sets and using sensor based irrigation decision making proposed to install a controller at each irrigation management unit each controller would be programmed to process the information received from three soil water potential swp sensors when two of the sensors indicated that the swp reached a user defined threshold the management allowable depletion the irrigation controller would open the valve triggering irrigation of the management unit irrigation would continue until two of the three soil sensors would indicate that the swp exceeds the threshold this development was based on the hypothesis that three soil sensors adequately characterize soil water spatial variability mainly resulting from random wind speed and direction a key limiting factor of this solution is the investment and maintenance costs of the programmer the sensors and the wireless communication network in solid set sprinkler irrigated areas an irrigation management unit is a sector within a plot for instance in the ebro valley of spain the average number of sectors per plot is around 8 ranging from 1 to 12 stambouli et al 2014 as a consequence 24 swp sensors 8 programmers and a communication network would be required to control irrigation in an average local solid set farm the analysis of different sources of variability of water application in center pivot and linear move sprinkler irrigation machines has led to the implementation of site specific water application devices sadler et al 2005 peters and evett 2008 chávez et al 2010a b variable rate application was obtained by adjusting the machine travel speed multiple times during an irrigation event and or implementing on off cycles and or variable flow at the sprinklers king and kincaid 2004 the long term maintenance requirements of such systems remains a challenge however as in solid sets the cost of the required software hardware ranging from 2000 for a system monitor to over 20 000 for the control of individual sprinklers zhu et al 2018 can limit its adoption for on farm drip irrigation sensing networks with wireless communications governed by an algorithm have been the most researched option for irrigation decision making fernández et al 2008 casadesús et al 2012 domínguez niño et al 2020 these systems are usually associated to cash crops fruits and vegetables the control equipment necessary to manage the variability of water application in small homogeneous management zones is now commercially available such systems could become complex when controlling large commercial farms with heterogeneous soils and significant variability in pressure and irrigation equipment the investment and maintenance costs of the distributed sensors required to measure soil water crop status and irrigation performance could limit the widespread adoption of this technology finally the algorithms integrating sensor data for decision making face relevant challenges for the site specific application of water nutrients and pesticides zhu et al 2018 the irrigated land of the ebro valley in aragon is mainly devoted to field crops around 86 of the total followed by horticultural crops 14 particularly fruit orchards zapata et al 2020 one of the effects of irrigation modernization in the 21st century has been the increase in the acreage of double cropping in some areas reaching 35 of the area zapata et al 2020 field crops are strongly associated to solid set and center pivot irrigation corn with wettable crop leaves and alfalfa with non wettable crop leaves respond differently to the irrigation time within the day being the wettability of leaves a critical trait for interception water losses and determining yield in solid set irrigation system the wind is the key factor affecting wind drift and evaporation losses wdel playán et al 2005 ortiz et al 2009 and irrigation uniformity tarjuelo et al 1999 dechmi et al 2003 in many windy areas of the world and in the ebro valley in particular the wind is higher during the daytime than during nighttime martínez cob et al 2010 therefore daytime irrigation results in higher wdel and lower uniformity than nighttime irrigation playán et al 2005 cavero et al 2008 microclimatic changes last for up to 2 3 h after a sprinkler irrigation event robinson 1970 tolk et al 1995 playán et al 2005 martínez cob et al 2008 these changes cause a decrease in crop transpiration and canopy temperature martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 which is greater in daytime irrigation than in nighttime irrigation cavero et al 2009 solid set sprinkler daytime irrigation of maize in a mediterranean climate has been reported to decrease grain yield by 5 13 as compared to nighttime irrigation urrego pereira a et al 2013 and b according to these authors the decrease in grain yield is due to the lower uniformity of irrigation and the lower photosynthetic activity during daytime irrigation the reduction in photosynthetic activity is related to the high wettability of the maize leaf which reduces co2 exchange and to the decrease in air and vegetation temperature below the optimal for maize photosynthetic activity urrego pereira et al 2013b in the case of alfalfa daytime sprinkler irrigation does not reduce photosynthesis urrego pereira et al 2013b because the maximum temperature to reduce transpiration is not reached and the alfalfa leaf is not wettable the water intercepted by leaves during irrigation quickly slips and falls to the ground without affecting co2 exchange cavero et al 2016 concluded that in alfalfa there are no forage yield or quality differences between daytime and nighttime sprinkler irrigation when integrated in a collective irrigation network on farm irrigation decision making should take into account the constraints imposed by the shared infrastructure pipeline network and in some cases pumping station recent research efforts to combine hydrologic and economic optimization are based on models for water and energy allocation accounting for crops soils meteorology and infrastructure management mannocchi and todisco 2006 alizadeh and mousavi 2013 banihabib and shabestari 2017 zapata et al 2017 these days investing in digital infrastructure and forecasting management tools may be more productive than investing in additional physical infrastructure ilich et al 2020 loureiro et al 2023 addressed the importance of optimizing energy consumption for collective network sustainability in portuguese irrigation districts different approaches to reduce the energy dependence of irrigation systems have been presented in the literature the optimization of irrigation facilities such as pumping stations and collective pressurized networks rodríguez díaz et al 2009 moreno et al 2010 fernández garcía et al 2013 belaud et al 2020 and recently the use of renewable energies photovoltaics and wind in irrigated projects campana et al 2015 narvarte et al 2019 naval and yusta 2022 have proven useful and cost effective additional solutions such as the reduction of energy requirements at the farm level by reducing the working pressure at the sprinkler nozzles have been experimentally demonstrated robles et al 2017 zapata et al 2018 these authors performed a field experiment in a maize crop comparing two working pressures at the sprinkler nozzle 300 kpa standard and 200 kpa low pressure they did not find statistical differences in maize yield between the pressure treatments when irrigating with the same amount of water and at the same time recent model developments in ador simulation zapata et al 2017 coupled network hydraulics to a comprehensive analysis of water use crop yield and economic profitability in solid set sprinkler irrigated areas for advanced design and management the general objective of this research is to progress in the expansion of model capacities to simulate modernization in real areas the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to simulate additional on farm irrigation methods center pivot and drip irrigation 2 to simulate crop intensification with the possibility of double cropping in the same plot and season 3 to simulate the crop response to different management options irrigation time within the day irrigation duration and standard vs low pressure sprinkler irrigation 4 to verify and illustrate model performance using a variety of theoretical case studies and 5 to apply the expanded simulation tool to a real irrigation project optimizing irrigation design and the management of water and energy 2 materials and methods 2 1 the ador simulation software of irrigated areas description and improvements 2 1 1 the ador simulation tool this simulation tool started with the development of ador sprinkler dechmi et al 2004a playán et al 2006 for the on farm solid set sprinkler irrigation method dechmi et al 2004a and b presented the coupling between on farm solid set irrigation and maize crop growth ador crop zapata et al 2009 presented a new development of the tool that simulates seasonal irrigation in irrigation districts equipped with solid sets this version did not explicitly consider pipeline hydraulics in the connection between the on farm irrigation systems and the collective network the model was used to develop an automatic controller for sprinkler irrigation zapata et al 2013 which was validated in the conditions of the ebro valley north eastern spain zapata et al 2017 presented progress in the ador tool for the simulation of solid set sprinkler irrigated areas using collective pressurized networks hydraulics for water supply to farms fig 1 presents the different modules of the simulation software a short description of the ador simulation modules follows 1 the epanet module rossman 2000 simulates the collective pressurized network this module is coupled to the rest of ador modules fig 1a for bidirectional communication epanet receives information on open closed network hydrants and determines the pressure and discharge at each open network hydrant a semi hourly time step is used for this process the hydraulic design of the collective network in epanet is required 2 the on farm irrigation module ador sprinkler simulates solid set sprinkler irrigation a variety of sprinkler configurations can be simulated by selecting the sprinkler type the nozzle size principal and auxiliary nozzles the working pressure at the nozzle s the meteorology and the sprinkler layout sprinkler spacing along the sprinkler lines and between lines rectangular on triangular arrangement the spatial distribution of irrigation water within a sprinkler spacing and a number of irrigation performance indicators are retrieved from a database containing results from a previously calibrated and validated on farm simulation model robles et al 2019 a farm is typically divided into sequentially irrigated sectors following a pre established order as presented in fig 1b a sprinkler spacing is used to simulate water distribution in each sector using the ador sprinkler module fig 1c ballistic theory is applied to simulate drop dynamics and to determine irrigation depth at 25 simulation points uniformly distributed within the sprinkler spacing fig 1d simulations are performed at a semi hourly time step even if an irrigation event lasts for hours to use the current meteorological variables conditioning uniformity and wind drift and evaporation losses wdel 3 ador crop a soil water balance is performed at each of the 25 points in the sprinkler spacing representing each sector to simulate soil water and crop yield reduction from its maximum value fig 1d a variety of crops have been implemented in ador crop zapata et al 2017 but only one crop can be simulated at a plot in an irrigation season soil depth and its water holding capacity whc are required to perform soil water balance irrigation requirements are determined from crop water status at the sector and plot level using a daily time step 4 the ador decision module performs irrigation decision making in all plots of the study area ador decision selects the plots to be irrigated taking into account their water stress zapata et al 2017 and a series of user defined limitations such as crop water status network hydraulics electricity restrictions for pumping and environmental or irrigation performance requirements ador decision is run at a semi hourly time step to fulfill both crop water requirements and the user defined limitations in a context of time variable meteorology network occupation and electricity costs fig 1 presents the new developments of the ador simulation software which are presented in this paper these include improvements in ador sprinkler new on farm irrigation methods the ador pivot and ador drip modules extended simulation capacities in ador crop two consecutive crops in the same plot and season and improved on farm irrigation management practices the effect of irrigation frequency and timing on crop development and irrigation water losses 2 1 2 ador sprinkler enlarging the sprinkler simulation results database the sprinkler simulation module has been improved by extending the database of sprinkler irrigation simulation cases impact sprinklers working at low pressure 200 kpa have been made available for additional sprinkler manufacturers and nozzle sizes 5 2 mm main nozzle and 2 5 mm auxiliary nozzle the combination of low pressure 200 kpa these nozzle diameters and usual sprinkler spacings 18 18 m results in an adequate pluviometry for solid set irrigation systems about 5 2 mm h and permits to moderate pumping costs 2 1 3 ador pivot new module the implementation of center pivot sprinkler irrigation started with a classification based on the angle covered by the machine full circle pivot fc or partial circle pivot pc the following variables have been implemented in ador pivot to characterize the hardware and the operation of the machine 1 angle covered by the irrigation machine 360º for a pivot fc and between 0 and 360º for the pivot pc 2 gross irrigation depth gid in mm h 1 the irrigation depth emitted by the pivot machine when operated at 100 speed i e when the outermost pivot tower does not stop 3 irrigation period the time it takes for the pivot to cover its angle when operating at 100 speed expressed in h round 1 4 irrigated area the effective area irrigated by the pivot expressed in hectares 5 experimental distribution uniformity of the low quarter dulq this variable is user defined and can be obtained from ad hoc experimentation or from the literature evans et al 1995 6 pressure at the nozzle the designed working pressure of the center pivot sprinkler package expressed in kpa and established by the pressure regulators installed just upstream from each spray sprinkler 7 direction of rotation fc pivots have one direction of rotation clockwise while pc pivots sequentially irrigate clockwise and counterclockwise 8 current angle the location angle of the pivot span at a given time expressed in degrees it always starts at 0º and increases to reach the total irrigated angle at that time it starts again if the pivot is fc and it changes the direction of rotation decreasing the angle if the pivot is pc 9 control angle the total irrigated area of a pivot is represented by five control radii fig 1e dividing the area in five homogeneous portions and locating a control radius at the middle of each section a control angles is the angle where each control radius is located each control radius has twenty five simulation points fig 1f homogenously distributed along the radius length at each point irrigation depth and crop development are simulated when the pivot passes over one of the control angles irrigation is simulated in its 25 simulation points the net irrigation depth nid mm h 1 at each point is determined using the pivot gid variable 2 in this list and two irrigation performance indexes wind drift and evaporation losses wdel and distribution uniformity dulq wdel are estimated using the empirical equation presented in eq 1 playán et al 2005 wdel are used in eq 2 to determine the average net irrigation depth nid mm h 1 at every simulation point 1 wdel 2 1 1 91 u 0 231 t 2 nid gid 100 wdel 100 with u the wind speed in m s 1 and t the temperature in celsius degrees to assign the net irrigation depth at each simulation point a normal distribution with a known average nid and standard deviation sd is applied eqs 3 and 4 the sd is determined from nid and dulq through the coefficient of variation cv assuming a random distribution of pivot water application the variability in net irrigation depth is randomly assigned in every irrigation event to the twenty five simulation points this procedure permits the integration of the random wind disturbance into the distribution of irrigation water in pivot irrigation machines 3 cv 100 1 du lq 100 1 1 27 4 sd nid cv 100 wind speed has been recognized as the meteorological variable with the largest effect on wdel and dulq in solid set sprinkler irrigation however the effect of wind speed on dulq in center pivot irrigation systems is much lower than in solid sets playán et al 2005 ouazaa et al 2016 the key hypothesis in this module is that the dulq of a pivot irrigated plot does not change with meteorology while wdel varies with wind speed and air temperature the value of nid resulting from a constant dulq and a variable wdel is randomized in every irrigation event we assume that this variability is randomly generated by the wind given the small distance separating spray sprinklers typically about 3 m much smaller than their irrigated radius therefore the nid mm h 1 of a certain point in a pivot irrigated plot will be different in every irrigation event these assumptions are supported by the findings of ouazaa et al 2016 who pointed out differences between 0 5 and 3 on radial heermann and hein uniformity coefficient for irrigation events performed by a center pivot under wind speed from 1 0 to 4 7 m s 1 2 1 4 ador drip new module this module fig 1 g h and i uses the following variables to represent a drip irrigated field 1 the distance between the lateral lines m 2 the distance between the drippers in the laterals m 3 the nominal flow discharge of the drippers l h 1 4 the nominal working pressure of the dripper kpa and 5 the experimental dulq this variable is user defined and can be obtained from ad hoc experimentation or from the literature burt 2004 twenty five simulation points are considered in each drip irrigated field as in the case of center pivot irrigation the variability in net irrigation depth is obtained by applying a normal distribution model with known average nid and standard deviation sd eqs 3 and 4 in the drip irrigation case the spatial distribution of nid is random but it is the same in all irrigation events making an important difference with the center pivot case since the only sources of variability considered in this case are the design of the irrigation system and the variability in the fabrication of the emitters therefore the nid mm h 1 of a certain simulation point in a drip irrigated plot will be the same in all irrigation events 2 1 5 ador crop extension to two consecutive crops per season the ador crop module was updated to simulate two consecutive crops in the same season double cropping four such schemes have been considered in this research barley maize barley sunflower peas maize and peas sunflower the selection of these cropping schemes responds to their current representativeness in the ebro river basin irrigated area the frequency of double cropping has increased in some modernized irrigation areas due to the possibilities of the new automated irrigation systems and to the necessity of increasing net income to payback the investment in irrigation equipment and in some cases the energy costs to simulate a double cropping scheme the seeding date of the second crop is not user controlled but determined by the harvest date of the first crop in turn the harvest date of the first crop is controlled by the completion of the thermal time target eq 5 5 thermal time k seed senescence tk tb tk tc with tb the basal temperature ºc and tk the daily average air temperature ºc the soil water content at the beginning of the second crop is inherited from the first crop the soil water content at harvest of the first crop ador crop provides a number of agronomic hydrologic and economic parameters individually determined for each crop and for both successive crops when adequate irrigation efficiency was seasonally determined as the ratio between net irrigation depth and gross irrigation depth 2 1 6 sprinkler irrigation management irrigation frequency and timing in solid set and center pivot sprinkler systems irrigation frequency affects the wetting drying events of the leaves and consequently interception water losses previous research works martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 urrego pereira a et al 2013 and b reported that interception losses depend on crop architecture being leaf wettability a critical trait corn with wettable crop leaves and alfalfa with non wettable crop leaves respond differently to the intercepted water the ador simulation release presented by zapata et al 2017 considers wdel but does not consider interception losses in the current model release interception losses have been incorporated martínez cob et al 2008 conducted a detailed study in maize using weighing lysimeters these authors concluded that net interception losses i e consumptive losses due to interception amounted to 0 5 mm in daytime irrigation and between 0 1 and 0 3 mm in nighttime irrigation stambouli et al 2013 following the same methodology as martínez cob et al 2008 but in an alfalfa crop proposed similar values 0 5 mm for daytime irrigation and between 0 1 and 0 28 mm for nighttime irrigation these developments have made it possible to integrate interception losses into ador crop the irrigation timing daytime vs nighttime irrigation can also affect crop transpiration microclimatic changes originate during sprinkler irrigation and can last for up to 2 3 h causing a decrease in transpiration and vegetation cover temperature martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 which are more significant in daytime than in nighttime irrigation cavero et al 2009 in daytime irrigation there are differences in photosynthetic activity and yield between wettable and non wettable leaves the high wettability of the maize leaf reduces co2 exchange and at the same time the microclimatic changes reduce the air and vegetation cover temperature below the optimum for the photosynthetic activity of maize urrego pereira et al 2013b during nighttime irrigation since transpiration is practically null there are no differences between wettable or non wettable leaves for alfalfa with non wettable leaves stomata are not plugged by the sheet of irrigation water and the temperature is not below optimum therefore this crop follows its normal transpiration processes during daytime irrigation cavero et al 2016 the effect of irrigation timing has been treated differently in the model for corn and alfalfa the reduction of the photosynthetic activity during maize daytime irrigation has been indirectly incorporated in ador crop since this simplified model does not simulate photosynthetic processes following the results of martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 and cavero et al 2016 when maize is daytime irrigated a reduction in the thermal time governing crop development is introduced this reduction is proportional to the duration of the irrigation event the thermal time of alfalfa was not modified for the rest of simulated crops in ador crop the differential response between daytime and nighttime irrigation was not implemented either in this case due to the absence of experimental data in the literature incorporating this effect is very important in the ebro valley due to the prevalence of maize in most crop rotations 2 2 application of the updated ador simulation model to a theoretical problem 2 2 1 general characteristics of the study area fig 2 presents the layout of the collective pressurized irrigation network of the theoretical problem as defined in epanet the network has seven hydrants from h1 to h7 all with the same nominal flow rate 48 l s 1 each hydrant irrigates a 30 ha farm the considered on farm irrigation systems include pivot fc machines a theoretical dulq of 85 has been selected to simulate irrigation water distribution this value represents modern center pivots with high design standards equipped with suitable sprinkler nozzle packages and pressure regulators dukes et al 2006 ouazaa et al 2016 adequately operated and maintained pivot pc machines the theoretical dulq was 85 equal to pivot fc machines solid set sprinkler irrigation the sprinkler layout is triangular with 18 m between lines and 18 m between sprinklers impact sprinklers have main and auxiliary nozzles with diameters of 4 4 and 2 4 mm respectively surface drip irrigation for fruit orchards drip o the drip layout has larger spacing than that for field crops the spacing is user selected and adapted to the layout of the trees in the orchard a theoretical dulq of 90 has been selected for this problem the value corresponds to adequately designed and maintained systems burt 2004 styles et al 2008 subsurface drip irrigation for field crops drip ss the drip layout has spacings of 0 75 m between drip lines and 0 5 m between drippers a theoretical dulq of 90 was selected as in the previous drip system the agrometeorological data of the grañén siar network station for the 2014 irrigation season was used in this problem the soils of the plots were considered homogenous with an average depth of 1 00 m and a moderate soil water holding capacity swhc of 107 mm m 1 four case studies were simulated from cs1 to cs4 fig 2b summarizes the characteristics and the objective of each variant cs1 simulates the irrigation of four plots with maize crops with different on farm methods pivot fc h1 pivot pc of 180º h3 solid set h4 and drip ss h6 the case study evaluates the new model developments related with on farm irrigation fig 1e and g cs2 similar to cs1 but using double cropping barley followed by short cycle maize in all plots the case study evaluates the new model developments related with double cropping fig 1d and i cs3 simulates that all hydrants of the collective network are cropped with maize this case compares two solid set sprinkler design and management cases standard pressure 300 kpa versus low pressure 200 kpa network operation requires pressures at the pumping station of 40 m and 30 m to irrigate at 300 and 200 kpa respectively the only difference required in the on farm irrigation design is the nozzle diameters the standard pressure implements sprinklers equipped with 4 4 mm and 2 4 mm nozzles while the low pressure implements sprinklers equipped with 5 2 mm and 2 5 mm nozzles cs4 the seven plots are equipped with solid set irrigation systems and cultivate maize the effects of irrigation management duration and timing on yield gross irrigation depth interception losses and net income were analyzed simulations were performed for two soil types the original one as described above and a second one with higher depth and water holding capacity 1 40 m and 180 mm respectively in all cases hydrologic seasonal gross irrigation irrigation efficiency seasonal distribution uniformity seasonal water losses agronomic crop yield and economic gross and net income indicators were determined and compared 2 3 application of the updated ador simulation model to a real problem 2 3 1 general characteristics of the study area this problem involves a recently formed water users association wua on a previously dry farmed area of 931 ha which is being transformed to pressurized irrigation with sprinkler and drip irrigation methods this wua named bardenas xi belongs to the bardenas project in the aragón autonomous community and the zaragoza province of spain fig 3a and b crop water requirements were determined using data from the ejea de los caballeros station of the siar agrometeorological network located 7 km west of the study area the analyzed data set covers the period 2004 2018 15 years of daily and semi hourly meteorological data a soil sampling campaign was performed in january 2019 to determine soil physics properties of interest for irrigation the 1 50 000 geologic map of spain igme 2015 was overlapped with the map of the study area to determine the sampling locations the points selected for soil sampling resulted from the litho stratigraphic distribution of the study area a total of 13 points were sampled from p3 to p15 in fig 3c an auger was used to obtain 0 30 m samples to a maximum depth of 1 20 m soil samples were analyzed at the laboratory following the methodology proposed by the soil survey field and laboratory methods manual 2014 for stoniness as a percentage soil water content at field capacity fc and at permanent wilting point pwp were determined using pressure plates set at 33 and 1500 kpa respectively the soil bulk density was obtained from a study performed nearby lecina et al 2004 assigning values of 1 40 and 1 52 mg m 3 for lower river valley and upper platform soils respectively the swhc mm m 1 was obtained for each sample from stoniness fc pwp and bulk density porta et al 2003 table 1 presents the classification ranges for this variable soil depth was classified in four classes lower than 0 60 m 0 60 0 90 m 0 90 1 20 m and higher than 1 20 m these classes will be referred to as shallow moderate deep and very depth respectively the combination of swhc and soil depth was used to define the soil types of the study area the network design used in the construction project aimed to supply irrigation water to a predefined cropping pattern 25 alfalfa 10 fruit orchards peach trees 18 sunflower 32 maize 5 vineyard and 10 wheat the key design question at this wua is whether to pump irrigation water 2 3 2 collective network design without pumping station the designed network starts at an elevated reservoir providing natural pressure to the 52 network hydrants supplying water to the irrigated plots this option results in different pressures at the hydrants from higher than 400 kpa to lower than 250 kpa these differences are mainly due to differences in hydrant elevation within the irrigated land the difference between the highest and the lowest hydrant was 68 m on farm irrigation systems were assigned as a function of the available pressure at the hydrant plots with pressure at the hydrant larger than 400 kpa were equipped with solid set sprinkler using standard pressure at the sprinkler nozzles 300 kpa plots with pressure at the hydrant between 400 and 300 kpa were equipped with solid set sprinkler using low pressure at the sprinkler nozzles 200 kpa plots with pressure at the hydrant between 300 and 200 kpa were equipped with center pivots finally plots with pressure at the hydrant equal to or lower than 200 kpa were equipped with drip irrigation a relationship between the crop and the on farm irrigation method was established horticultural crops and orchards used drip irrigation while field crops used any sprinkler irrigation system solid set or center pivot 2 3 3 collective network design with pumping station a pumping station was designed to ensure a minimum pressure of 400 kpa at all hydrants the pumping station added a supplementary pressure of 180 kpa to natural pressure a total power of 350 kw was required at the pumping station in 2019 the electricity tariff adequate for this pumping station was the 3 1 tariff with three periods for both power and energy costs the three periods off peak base and peak were associated to cheap medium and expensive electricity respectively the timing and the power price of the different periods were regulated by the spanish law boe 2018 the energy price of the different periods was not regulated and was obtained from neighboring wuas zapata et al 2017 the description of each tariff period considered in this study was as follows 1 the off peak period runs from 0 00 8 00 on working days and from 0 00 18 00 on weekends and national holidays the power cost is 8 368 kw 1 year 1 and the energy price is 0 078 kwh 1 2 the base period runs from 8 00 10 00 and from 16 00 24 00 on working days and from 18 00 24 00 on weekends and national holidays from april to october both included the power cost is 36 491 kw 1 year 1 and the energy cost is 0 097 kwh 1 3 the peak period runs from 10 00 16 00 from april to october both included the power cost is 59 173 kw 1 year 1 and the energy cost is 0 106 kwh 1 the payback of the investment cost and the maintenance of the pumping station should also be included when computing net income for this design option the annual payback was estimated at 50 ha 1 and year in agreement with observations of similar systems in the ebro valley 2 3 4 analyses performed at the studied wua in a first step ador simulation was applied to the bardenas xi pressurized network and the abovementioned cropping pattern for the multiannual meteorological data set hydrologic agronomic and economic performance indicators were obtained in a second step comparisons were established between network designs with and without the pumping station originally the collective network was designed without pumping station the only difference with the previous simulation in the wua was the cropping pattern a new crop distribution was introduced only including field crops 25 maize 25 alfalfa 10 wheat and 40 double cropping of peas and maize differences in annual irrigation and crop performance indicators induced by differences in on farm irrigation methods soils and crops were assessed using mean comparisons the interaction between explicative variables can be relevant and is not always intuitive for instance vineyards and fruit orchards are only irrigated by drip irrigation while field crops are irrigated by different on farm methods box plots were used to facilitate this analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 application of ador simulation to a theoretical problem the ador simulation tool was applied to the five case studies described in fig 2 with the aim of illustrating the capacity of the software to contribute to the design and management of collective pressurized wuas 3 1 1 maize and pressurized irrigation systems cs1 the simulated irrigation depth irrigation performance indexes maize yield and gross and net income are presented in fig 4 for each on farm irrigation method the seasonal irrigation depth of the irrigation methods presented in decreasing order was solid set pivot fc pivot pc and drip ss fig 4a deep percolation losses wdel and total losses are presented in fig 4b the most significant losses were observed in the solid set method center pivot irrigation obtained the lowest deep percolation losses and the highest seasonal distribution uniformity 98 due to the complete random spatial distribution of irrigation water drip irrigation had zero wdel since in this method water is directly applied to the soil regarding total water losses the irrigation methods can be decreasingly ordered as solid set pivot fc pivot pc and drip ss fig 4b differences between pivot methods full circle and partial circle were very low and could be considered similar in this cs the large total losses of the solid set method explain its large seasonal irrigation depth fig 4a in comparison with the other on farm methods surface drip has some evaporative losses from the wet bare soil surface and even subsurface drip does because some water moves to the surface by capillary action however these processes have not been considered in this research because there are not sufficient experimental data in the literature and because the magnitude of losses is expected to be low fig 4c shows how on demand irrigation adequately irrigated maize in all irrigation methods obtaining relative yields of 96 98 the design of this case study ensures that differences in irrigation depth irrigation losses and economic income are almost completely due to the on farm method seasonal actual evapotranspiration etactual presented minor differences between on farm methods fig 4c mostly due to small differences in maize seeding date between plots differences in gross and net income between on farm methods were also minor since the operation of the collective network operation does not require energy for pumping fig 4d differences in income only accounted for differences in yield and the cost of irrigation water 3 1 2 on farm irrigation systems and crop intensification validation and comparison cs2 the only difference between cs1 and cs2 is that in this case the four plots are double cropped with barley followed by short cycle maize irrigation depth losses et and income were larger for cs2 than for cs1 in all irrigation methods since cs2 is more intensive than cs1 fig 5 comparisons between on farm methods are quite similar to cs1 with small differences in cs2 the lowest seasonal irrigation depth was obtained for pivot pc fig 5a due to its high seasonal irrigation uniformity 99 and its moderate total losses fig 5b as in cs1 the lowest deep percolation losses were found in pivot systems pivot pc and pivot fc this is related to their high seasonal dulq 99 and 98 respectively the largest deep percolation losses were obtained for drip ss 25 mm followed by solid set 24 mm these losses resulted from seasonal dulq of 90 and 91 respectively the effect of seasonal dulq on deep percolation is remarkable solid set systems showed the largest wdel and total irrigation losses since drip ss has null wdel and the lowest total losses fig 5b cs2 presented high crop yields and similar values of etactual fig 5c for all the studied methods differences in crop yield between on farm methods amounted to 3 and 4 for barley and maize respectively in all on farm methods the yield of the second crop was reduced from 7 to 11 from maximum for pivot fc and drip ss respectively the parameters describing the thermal time for maize as a second crop were calibrated in a different meteorological area within the ebro valley a shorter cycle maize variety would probably have obtained a lower yield reduction differences in gross and net income between on farm methods account for differences in gross irrigation and yield fig 5d pivot fc showed slightly larger gross and net income for this intensive cropping pattern than the other irrigation methods minor differences were found between the other irrigation methods results highlight the important effect of a small yield decrease on net income in this case a slightly larger yield reduction was observed for the second crop with drip ss the effect of differences in water use between irrigation methods on net income was small because no energy and no cost was required for water application in cs2 cs2 results validate the use of different on farm irrigation methods under double cropping further efforts are required to adjust the thermal time parameters of short cycle maize to different meteorological areas in the ebro valley if water application requires energy for pumping the electric cost will primarily affect net income for the different irrigation methods 3 1 3 standard vs low pressure in solid set irrigation cs3 case study 3 compares standard and low pressure sprinkler solid set irrigation with different nozzle configurations leading to a similar sprinkler discharge about 1650 l h 1 and irrigation application rate about 5 2 mm h when operated at 300 and 200 kpa the difference in nozzle pressures induces a difference in pressure requirements at the collective network inlet which is 100 kpa higher for standard pressure than for low pressure table 2 presents a set of irrigation and yield performance variables for both working pressures average values for the total irrigated area and differences between working pressures are presented simulated results reveal that differences in almost all analyzed variables are very low lower than 3 for all variables except for the deep percolation which reached 6 differences are quite similar to those reported by robles et al 2017 and zapata et al 2018 who presented experimental comparisons of maize under both working pressures robles et al 2017 reported differences of 10 in seasonal christiansen uniformity coefficient and no differences in yield zapata et al 2018 explained that maize canopy partitioning reduces the differences in irrigation performance indexes between the pressure treatments explaining why differences in grain yield between pressures were not found these authors indicated that caution should be used when measuring sprinkler irrigation performance above tall canopies since the elevation of the catch cans and the crop canopy partitioning affect performance estimations the corrections proposed by these authors were included in the crop simulation model which produced adequate yield estimates 3 1 4 effect of irrigation frequency and timing on simulation results cs4 different solid set irrigation duration and timing daytime or nighttime were evaluated in case study 4 under two soil types as described above the model generates an irrigation schedule based on soil water balance but the user can control the irrigation duration per irrigation event different durations were tested from 1 to 4 h with a time step of 1 h the shorter the irrigation event the higher the irrigation frequency additionally different irrigation timing arrangements were simulated for maize on demand daytime or nighttime and only nighttime irrigation fig 6 presents the average seasonal irrigation depth interception losses and yield for the different subcases as the irrigation duration increased and frequency decreased the seasonal irrigation depth increased for the soil with moderate water holding capacity fig 6a for the soil with high water holding capacity fig 6d the seasonal irrigation depth remained constant for irrigation durations equal to or larger than 2 h event 1 these differences are mainly related to deep percolation losses which drastically increased with long irrigations 4 h event 1 in soils with moderate water holding capacity on demand irrigation of maize resulted in slightly larger seasonal irrigation depth than nighttime irrigation for soils with moderate water holding capacity fig 6a in the soil with high water holding capacity the irrigation duration had less impact on irrigation depth fig 6d interception losses drastically decreased with the increase in irrigation duration fig 6b and e the number of wetting drying events decreased as the duration of irrigation events increased therefore interception losses were severely reduced soil characteristics and irrigation timing daytime or nighttime showed no effect on interception losses irrigation durations exceeding 2 h event 1 showed a slight effect on maize yield particularly for the soil with high water holding capacity fig 6f irrigation timing had a moderate effect on yield for the soil with moderate water holding capacity fig 7c and practically no effect for the soil with high water holding capacity fig 6f in soils with moderate water holding capacity an optimum irrigation duration 2 3 h event 1 could be identified fig 6c these results also suggest that there is not a general irrigation strategy regarding these variables and that specific analyses are required for each physical environment soils meteorology and irrigation structures collective irrigation networks and pumping stations 3 2 application of ador simulation to a real problem the bardenas xi wua the average annual precipitation of the time series was 405 mm with an inter annual coefficient of variation cv of 25 the highest annual precipitation was 636 mm in 2018 wettest year and the lowest precipitation was 238 mm in 2005 driest year monthly precipitation showed a large variability during the study years april was the wettest month average precipitation of 56 mm while august was the driest one average precipitation of 16 mm august presented the highest inter annual precipitation variability with a cv of 126 while october was the month with the lowest variability of precipitation the average annual reference evapotranspiration et0 was 1271 mm with a low inter annual coefficient of variation 4 6 the highest annual et0 was 1365 mm in 2012 while the lowest was 1167 mm in 2008 the irrigated area can be classified as moderately windy martínez cob et al 2008 the average annual wind speed was 2 9 m s 1 with an inter annual cv of 7 february was the windiest month on record with an average wind speed of 3 4 m s 1 september was the least windy month with an average of 2 5 m s 1 the average monthly wind speed was equal to or larger than 2 5 m s 1 in the twelve months of the year the windiest year was 2010 with an annual average of 3 3 m s 1 while the least windy year was 2008 with an annual average of 2 5 m s 1 like in other windy areas of the ebro river basin the windiest hours were the central hours of the day from 12 to 16 gmt and the least windy period was the nighttime from 20 to 6 gmt the thirteen soil samples fig 3c were processed at the laboratory to determine swhc the average swhc was 152 mm m 1 with 83 mm m 1 being the lowest value p5 fig 3c and 236 mm m 1 being the highest p6 fig 3c in general low swhc values were found in soils with the lowest depth the spatial distribution of the eight soil types is presented in fig 7a plots with a soil sample were assigned their measured value plots without a soil sample were assigned the same value than their geological class as previously reported the geological map was used to determine the number and location of soil samples to characterize the different geological classes in fig 7a intense red color presents soils with moderate depth and swhc while intense green presents soils with high depth and swhc the combination of swhc and soil depth and its percentage of representativeness in the area is presented in table 3 eight soil types are represented in the study area deep soils with moderate high and very high swhc are the most common with 20 6 15 7 and 21 of the total area respectively the soil types with lowest representativeness are deep soils with low swhc with 5 6 of the area followed by soils with moderate depth and high swhc with 6 2 of the area crop spatial distribution was randomly attributed respecting the crop pattern percentages accounted for during the design of the collective network only vineyard plots were manually assigned since vineyards were cultivated before the irrigation project after crop attribution the percentage of the different crops was 24 alfalfa 11 fruit orchards peach trees 16 sunflower 34 maize 6 vineyards and 9 wheat fig 7b presents the simulated crop distribution small differences between the simulated crop distribution and the cropping pattern considered in the project design are due to the area of the individual plots the collective network of the bardenas xi wua irrigates 931 ha supplied by 50 hydrants fig 7c the average area irrigated per hydrant is 17 9 ha with a maximum of 56 6 ha for hydrant 140 and a minimum of 0 8 ha for hydrant 113 the total number of irrigation sectors is 510 each plot has an average of 10 2 sectors being 11 sectors per plot the largest and most common arrangement 41 hydrants have 11 sectors the largest hydrant discharge is 84 9 l s 1 while the lowest is 15 l s 1 the pipes of the collective network have a total length of 17 684 m with diameters ranging from 115 to 1000 mm the reservoir is located at the south of the irrigated area at an elevation of 421 m a s l 27 m above the highest hydrant 222 and 85 m above the lowest hydrant 112 as reported in the previous section the on farm irrigation method was assigned as a function of the available pressure the most common on farm irrigation methods fig 4c were solid set sprinkler irrigation at standard pressure solid set 300 with 281 ha 30 of the total area and solid set at low pressure solid set 200 with 275 ha 30 drip irrigation for fruit orchards drip o irrigates 158 ha 17 and drip irrigation for field crops drip ss covers 52 ha 6 pivot full circle pivot fc irrigated 116 ha 12 while pivot partial circle pivot pc irrigated 49 ha 5 3 2 1 simulating the meteorological data series for the current design the meteorological variability of the analyzed data series induced a slight effect on total etc with an average value of 789 mm and an inter annual cv of 3 6 table 4 the average precipitation was 404 mm with an inter annual cv of 25 the average precipitation during the cropping season was 226 mm with a cv of 35 table 4 the simulated gross irrigation depth showed an inter annual average of 710 mm and a cv of 13 the irrigation performance indicators showed different degrees of inter annual variability seasonal dulq showed the smallest inter annual differences with an average value of 89 1 and a cv of 0 9 the irrigation efficiency ie showed an average value of 86 6 and a cv of 1 2 seasonal wdel and deep percolation losses showed annual averages of 79 9 mm and 54 2 mm both with moderate and strong inter annual variability 16 4 and 56 respectively the inter annual variability of these variables was due to the meteorological variability the moderate inter annual variability of wdel was mainly attributed to wind speed differences during irrigation yearly deep percolation was strongly affected by precipitation with a pearson correlation coefficient pcc of 0 53 and a high significance p value 0 0001 the largest values of deep percolation were found in 2004 and 2018 with average values of 125 and 121 mm respectively however in these years the values of ie were above the annual average 86 8 and 87 5 respectively both years had the highest precipitation annual and during the crop season moreover both years showed intense precipitation events at the beginning of the crop season 90 and 144 mm respectively lasting for 6 7 days these intense precipitation events during periods of low crop water requirements can explain the high values of deep percolation and the moderate effect on ie in these years deep percolation was largely due to excess of precipitation instead of over irrigation the on farm irrigation method had a determinant effect on irrigation performance indicators it had an important effect on dulq although the variability between irrigation methods was moderate with a cv of 6 2 the comparison of means indicates that dulq are statistically different the largest values of dulq were obtained for center pivots while the lowest values were obtained for solid set 200 the variability of ie between irrigation methods was also moderate cv of 8 5 but the comparison of means again confirmed the statistical differences p value 2 2 10 6 differences in wdel and deep percolation between irrigation methods were very high with cvs of 62 and 44 respectively the largest values of wdel and deep percolation losses were obtained for solid sets solid set 300 showed the largest wdel 113 mm while solid set 200 showed the largest deep percolation 75 mm drip irrigation showed average deep percolation losses 49 and 52 mm for drip and drip ss respectively and null wdel pivots showed moderate wdel 64 and 53 mm for pivot fc and pivot pc respectively and low deep percolation losses 16 and 13 mm respectively soil physics had an important effect on deep percolation losses particularly when combined with on farm irrigation methods such as solid set and drip the largest values of deep percolation losses were obtained for soils with moderate depth and swhc s2 93 3 mm and for deep soils with a low swhc s1 70 6 mm the first soil type had a moderate representativeness 14 6 of the total area table 3 and was only present in plots equipped with solid set or drip irrigation methods the second type had a low representativeness 5 6 of the total area table 3 and was only drip irrigated since deep percolation is a key component of ie soil type also affected ie and contributed to explain its variability crops also induced effects on irrigation indicators because of their association with on farm methods and because irrigation depth depends on crop evapotranspiration the coefficient of variation between crops was low for dulq 1 3 moderate for ie 8 6 and high for deep percolation and wdel 45 6 and 61 2 respectively these coefficients of variation are quite similar to those found for the on farm irrigation methods annual irrigation performance at plot level was related to three categorical variables soil type irrigation method and crop a box plot fig 8 was used to analyze these interactions alfalfa and maize plots present the largest number of combinations of irrigation methods and soil types 10 and 12 respectively dulq and ie showed a moderate data spread and low skewness the irrigation method had the most significant effect on both indicators with crops and soils showing moderate ie or low effects dulq wdel showed a larger spread due to the effect of wind speed and low skewness again the irrigation method had more effect than the crop moderate to low effect and the soil type very low effect deep percolation showed the largest spread skewness and number of outliers underlining the abovementioned effect of precipitation variability the irrigation method and the soil type showed important effects on deep percolation fig 9 maps the inter annual average of plot deep percolation ie wdel and dulq the cv of these average indicators was moderate for dulq 5 3 and ie 8 1 and high for wdel 59 7 and deep percolation 61 8 the comparison of fig 9a with fig 7a permits to relate the plots with low deep percolation losses with the soils with adequate hydraulic characteristics plots with very high ie were with drip irrigated fig 7d while plots with low ie and high wdel were solid set irrigated when analyzing the spatial variability of dulq fig 9d the irrigation method is the key variable all considered methods can attain high uniformities although some of them are sensitive to meteorology and to irrigation management practices this is the case of solid sets whose uniformity is strongly affected by wind speed the highest uniformity was attained by pivot irrigation machines followed by drip irrigation this is due to the random and systematic treatment of irrigation depth used for the simulation of pivot and drip irrigation respectively in pivot irrigation machines the random effect of the wind resulted in a seasonal dulq higher than the input provided to the model however in the case of drip irrigation the seasonal dulq was equal to the input provided to the model 3 2 2 comparison between network designs with and without pumping station the introduction of the pumping station introduces relevant differences in irrigation performance energy costs and investment costs thus affecting the income produced by irrigated agriculture at the bardenas xi wua differences in irrigation performance indicators between design options and crops are presented in fig 10 ie and wdel were almost equal for both design options with average differences of 0 4 and 0 5 mm respectively dulq and deep percolation showed larger average differences of 3 7 and 6 mm respectively the average difference in gross irrigation depth was quite moderate 1 1 larger for the option without pumping station these results are in agreement with those published by robles et al 2017 and zapata et al 2018 these authors compared irrigation and crop performance indicators on an experimental irrigated maize plot under standard and low pressure 300 and 200 kpa respectively they concluded that the differences in uniformity had no effect on gross irrigation requirements and grain yield electricity costs were null for the design option without pumping station and amounted to an average cost of 84 ha 1 yr 1 for the design with pumping station the maximum annual electricity cost occurred in 2005 with 137 ha 1 yr 1 while the minimum occurred in 2018 and amounted to 41 ha 1 yr 1 inter annual differences were related to crop water requirements being 2005 a dry year and 2018 a wet year fig 11 presents the annual average net income for both design options the average difference is 134 ha 1 yr 1 with a maximum of 187 and a minimum of 91 ha 1 yr 1 again for 2005 and 2018 respectively the design option without pumping station is the most adequate in the bardenas xi wua natural pressure has proven sufficient for low pressure sprinkler irrigation pivot and drip irrigation methods the escalating energy costs emphasize the need for careful assessment of pumping requirements at the design phase of irrigation projects low pressure solid set sprinkler irrigation was completely independent of energy costs without hurting the irrigation performance indicators 4 conclusions 1 center pivot sprinkler irrigation was introduced in the model using the angle covered by the machine and a normal distribution of irrigation depth derived from a user defined dulq the random water application depth in each irrigation event adequately represented the variability induced by the wind drip irrigation was also introduced in the model using random water application but using the same water application pattern in all irrigation events the selected approaches satisfactorily simulated the irrigation methods 2 double cropping simulation adequately reproduced the development of both crops however this crop scheme will require further research efforts to adjust the thermal time parameters of short cycle maize to different meteorological areas in the ebro valley 3 the effect of irrigation timing was successfully implemented in the model it has been treated differently in the model for corn and alfalfa interception losses and the adjustment of thermal time were implemented for wettable leaf crops maize while only interception losses were implemented for non wettable leaf crops alfalfa 4 a general irrigation strategy was not found for irrigation timing and duration specific analyses are required for each physical environment soils meteorology and irrigation structures collective irrigation networks and pumping stations 5 the simulated irrigation performance indicators at the bardenas xi wua showed different degrees of inter annual variability deep percolation was strongly affected by the amount of seasonal precipitation and dulq 6 irrigation performance indicators at the plot level were strongly dependent on the on farm irrigation method the crop and the soil type 7 the design option without pumping station was the most adequate at the bardenas xi wua natural pressure has proven sufficient for low pressure sprinkler irrigation pivot and drip irrigation methods the escalating energy costs emphasize the need for

8908,irrigated areas face new pressing challenges due to escalating energy costs for pumping increasing cost of seeds fertilizers and agrochemicals volatility of agricultural commodities pressure of environmental regulations water scarcity and mounting cost of irrigation infrastructure investments at the same time from the technical standpoint farmers can chose from a wide array of irrigation design and operation alternatives for collective and on farm systems with variable effects on crop yield and profitability these factors are often subjected to quick changes complicating decision making simulation models have proven useful to support decision making in irrigation infrastructure water energy use crop agronomy and soil management in this research new capacities of the ador simulation software are reported targeting comprehensive analyses of irrigation modernization the model implements additional on farm irrigation methods low pressure solid set center pivot and drip irrigation crop intensification double cropping in the same season and crop response to different on farm irrigation management options timing and frequency model performance was verified using a set of theoretical case studies finally the model was applied to the optimization of irrigation design and management water and energy in the bardenas xi project of northeastern spain water application in center pivot and drip irrigation were simulated using a normal distribution characterized by a user defined distribution uniformity in center pivot the application depth was randomized in every irrigation event reproducing the random nature of wind disturbances in drip irrigation the application depth followed the same random distribution in all irrigation events reproducing the deterministic effect of manufacturing and hydraulic variability according to the literature the effect of irrigation timing was treated differently for two key sprinkler irrigated crops corn and alfalfa differences in water application and crop yield between on farm methods resulted in different gross and net income in the bardenas xi project irrigation performance indicators showed different patterns of inter annual variability deep percolation was strongly affected by the amount of seasonal precipitation and by distribution uniformity indicators at the plot level were strongly determined by the on farm irrigation method the soil type and the crop in the conditions of bardenas xi the design option without pumping station was the most adequate natural pressure proved sufficient for a combination of low pressure sprinkler irrigation pivot and drip irrigation methods distributed throughout the irrigated area escalating energy costs emphasize the need for careful assessment of pumping requirements at the design phase of irrigation projects keywords on farm irrigation methods irrigation modernization collective irrigation networks water use efficiency energy use efficiency low pressure sprinkler simulation models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is expected to continue modifying water supply and demand over the world for instance the united states has increased water demand in the last years particularly in the western states this has raised uncertainty about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the west schaible et al 2010 in 2007 the australian government launched the national plan for water security package almost 6 billion over ten years the plan set out to modernize irrigation infrastructure both on and off farm targeting water conservation khan et al 2010 reported that this plan would lead to more efﬁcient productive and proﬁtable water use with a view to maintaining the value of irrigated production in the face of declining water availability in europe the problem of water scarcity is particularly relevant in mediterranean countries such as spain italy or greece in these countries as is commonly the case in semiarid regions agriculture is the sector obtaining the largest share of water use uncertainty in water supplies will further constrain already over allocated water resources and will increase competition among agricultural municipal industrial and ecological uses smith et al 2007 increasing competition underlines the importance of efficient use of irrigation water developing capacities to apply irrigation water at the time in the amount and in the way needed to meet consumptive use requirements for each crop and at each growth stage in the xxi century national irrigation modernization plans mapama and mapama 2002 2010 were launched by the spanish government to address irrigation project deficiencies water scarcity problems water eu directives and changes in social structure these plans took advantage of new information and communication technologies playán et al 2018 in addition most spanish regional governments designed and applied their own irrigation modernization plans also addressing european regulations a new plan to improve the efficiency and sustainability of irrigated areas has been deployed in the framework of the post covid recovery and resilience plan of the european union boe 2021 both obsolete and recently modernized irrigated areas face new pressing challenges among them the escalating costs of energy and other agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers the price volatility of agricultural commodities the pressure of environmental regulations and the mounting interests rates that increase the payback cost of investments in irrigation modernization these challenges are currently threatening the economic viability of many irrigated areas the wide array of irrigation design and operation alternatives for collective and on farm systems their effect on crop yield and their water and energy requirements complicated decision making all these concerns stress the need for adequate management at all irrigation levels in order to obtain full benefit from public and private investments in irrigation modernization simulation models have proven useful to support decision making in irrigation infrastructure water energy use crop agronomy and soil management when planning future crops farmers also need to decide between on farm irrigation methods and need to install designs optimized for their local conditions irrigation management requires frequent tactical decision making simulation models and sensing platforms using a variety of information sources are increasingly used to support these decisions in each irrigation method zapata et al 2009 presented an early version of ador simulation a software combining capacities for the simulation of solid set sprinkler irrigation crop water requirements and yield in irrigation districts zapata et al 2013 presented the experimental application of a version of this software applied to real time irrigation control in a solid set sprinkler irrigated maize farm the model was based on available daily local reference evapotranspiration et0 data obtained via internet local sensors pressure and discharge at the farm inlet temperature and wind speed and simulation of irrigation application variability and the soil crop water balance the main contribution of this research was the explicit consideration of both space and time variability hydraulic hydrological meteorological and agronomical for irrigation decision making leading to optimum crop yield and water use efficiency miranda et al 2005 also working on solid sets and using sensor based irrigation decision making proposed to install a controller at each irrigation management unit each controller would be programmed to process the information received from three soil water potential swp sensors when two of the sensors indicated that the swp reached a user defined threshold the management allowable depletion the irrigation controller would open the valve triggering irrigation of the management unit irrigation would continue until two of the three soil sensors would indicate that the swp exceeds the threshold this development was based on the hypothesis that three soil sensors adequately characterize soil water spatial variability mainly resulting from random wind speed and direction a key limiting factor of this solution is the investment and maintenance costs of the programmer the sensors and the wireless communication network in solid set sprinkler irrigated areas an irrigation management unit is a sector within a plot for instance in the ebro valley of spain the average number of sectors per plot is around 8 ranging from 1 to 12 stambouli et al 2014 as a consequence 24 swp sensors 8 programmers and a communication network would be required to control irrigation in an average local solid set farm the analysis of different sources of variability of water application in center pivot and linear move sprinkler irrigation machines has led to the implementation of site specific water application devices sadler et al 2005 peters and evett 2008 chávez et al 2010a b variable rate application was obtained by adjusting the machine travel speed multiple times during an irrigation event and or implementing on off cycles and or variable flow at the sprinklers king and kincaid 2004 the long term maintenance requirements of such systems remains a challenge however as in solid sets the cost of the required software hardware ranging from 2000 for a system monitor to over 20 000 for the control of individual sprinklers zhu et al 2018 can limit its adoption for on farm drip irrigation sensing networks with wireless communications governed by an algorithm have been the most researched option for irrigation decision making fernández et al 2008 casadesús et al 2012 domínguez niño et al 2020 these systems are usually associated to cash crops fruits and vegetables the control equipment necessary to manage the variability of water application in small homogeneous management zones is now commercially available such systems could become complex when controlling large commercial farms with heterogeneous soils and significant variability in pressure and irrigation equipment the investment and maintenance costs of the distributed sensors required to measure soil water crop status and irrigation performance could limit the widespread adoption of this technology finally the algorithms integrating sensor data for decision making face relevant challenges for the site specific application of water nutrients and pesticides zhu et al 2018 the irrigated land of the ebro valley in aragon is mainly devoted to field crops around 86 of the total followed by horticultural crops 14 particularly fruit orchards zapata et al 2020 one of the effects of irrigation modernization in the 21st century has been the increase in the acreage of double cropping in some areas reaching 35 of the area zapata et al 2020 field crops are strongly associated to solid set and center pivot irrigation corn with wettable crop leaves and alfalfa with non wettable crop leaves respond differently to the irrigation time within the day being the wettability of leaves a critical trait for interception water losses and determining yield in solid set irrigation system the wind is the key factor affecting wind drift and evaporation losses wdel playán et al 2005 ortiz et al 2009 and irrigation uniformity tarjuelo et al 1999 dechmi et al 2003 in many windy areas of the world and in the ebro valley in particular the wind is higher during the daytime than during nighttime martínez cob et al 2010 therefore daytime irrigation results in higher wdel and lower uniformity than nighttime irrigation playán et al 2005 cavero et al 2008 microclimatic changes last for up to 2 3 h after a sprinkler irrigation event robinson 1970 tolk et al 1995 playán et al 2005 martínez cob et al 2008 these changes cause a decrease in crop transpiration and canopy temperature martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 which is greater in daytime irrigation than in nighttime irrigation cavero et al 2009 solid set sprinkler daytime irrigation of maize in a mediterranean climate has been reported to decrease grain yield by 5 13 as compared to nighttime irrigation urrego pereira a et al 2013 and b according to these authors the decrease in grain yield is due to the lower uniformity of irrigation and the lower photosynthetic activity during daytime irrigation the reduction in photosynthetic activity is related to the high wettability of the maize leaf which reduces co2 exchange and to the decrease in air and vegetation temperature below the optimal for maize photosynthetic activity urrego pereira et al 2013b in the case of alfalfa daytime sprinkler irrigation does not reduce photosynthesis urrego pereira et al 2013b because the maximum temperature to reduce transpiration is not reached and the alfalfa leaf is not wettable the water intercepted by leaves during irrigation quickly slips and falls to the ground without affecting co2 exchange cavero et al 2016 concluded that in alfalfa there are no forage yield or quality differences between daytime and nighttime sprinkler irrigation when integrated in a collective irrigation network on farm irrigation decision making should take into account the constraints imposed by the shared infrastructure pipeline network and in some cases pumping station recent research efforts to combine hydrologic and economic optimization are based on models for water and energy allocation accounting for crops soils meteorology and infrastructure management mannocchi and todisco 2006 alizadeh and mousavi 2013 banihabib and shabestari 2017 zapata et al 2017 these days investing in digital infrastructure and forecasting management tools may be more productive than investing in additional physical infrastructure ilich et al 2020 loureiro et al 2023 addressed the importance of optimizing energy consumption for collective network sustainability in portuguese irrigation districts different approaches to reduce the energy dependence of irrigation systems have been presented in the literature the optimization of irrigation facilities such as pumping stations and collective pressurized networks rodríguez díaz et al 2009 moreno et al 2010 fernández garcía et al 2013 belaud et al 2020 and recently the use of renewable energies photovoltaics and wind in irrigated projects campana et al 2015 narvarte et al 2019 naval and yusta 2022 have proven useful and cost effective additional solutions such as the reduction of energy requirements at the farm level by reducing the working pressure at the sprinkler nozzles have been experimentally demonstrated robles et al 2017 zapata et al 2018 these authors performed a field experiment in a maize crop comparing two working pressures at the sprinkler nozzle 300 kpa standard and 200 kpa low pressure they did not find statistical differences in maize yield between the pressure treatments when irrigating with the same amount of water and at the same time recent model developments in ador simulation zapata et al 2017 coupled network hydraulics to a comprehensive analysis of water use crop yield and economic profitability in solid set sprinkler irrigated areas for advanced design and management the general objective of this research is to progress in the expansion of model capacities to simulate modernization in real areas the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to simulate additional on farm irrigation methods center pivot and drip irrigation 2 to simulate crop intensification with the possibility of double cropping in the same plot and season 3 to simulate the crop response to different management options irrigation time within the day irrigation duration and standard vs low pressure sprinkler irrigation 4 to verify and illustrate model performance using a variety of theoretical case studies and 5 to apply the expanded simulation tool to a real irrigation project optimizing irrigation design and the management of water and energy 2 materials and methods 2 1 the ador simulation software of irrigated areas description and improvements 2 1 1 the ador simulation tool this simulation tool started with the development of ador sprinkler dechmi et al 2004a playán et al 2006 for the on farm solid set sprinkler irrigation method dechmi et al 2004a and b presented the coupling between on farm solid set irrigation and maize crop growth ador crop zapata et al 2009 presented a new development of the tool that simulates seasonal irrigation in irrigation districts equipped with solid sets this version did not explicitly consider pipeline hydraulics in the connection between the on farm irrigation systems and the collective network the model was used to develop an automatic controller for sprinkler irrigation zapata et al 2013 which was validated in the conditions of the ebro valley north eastern spain zapata et al 2017 presented progress in the ador tool for the simulation of solid set sprinkler irrigated areas using collective pressurized networks hydraulics for water supply to farms fig 1 presents the different modules of the simulation software a short description of the ador simulation modules follows 1 the epanet module rossman 2000 simulates the collective pressurized network this module is coupled to the rest of ador modules fig 1a for bidirectional communication epanet receives information on open closed network hydrants and determines the pressure and discharge at each open network hydrant a semi hourly time step is used for this process the hydraulic design of the collective network in epanet is required 2 the on farm irrigation module ador sprinkler simulates solid set sprinkler irrigation a variety of sprinkler configurations can be simulated by selecting the sprinkler type the nozzle size principal and auxiliary nozzles the working pressure at the nozzle s the meteorology and the sprinkler layout sprinkler spacing along the sprinkler lines and between lines rectangular on triangular arrangement the spatial distribution of irrigation water within a sprinkler spacing and a number of irrigation performance indicators are retrieved from a database containing results from a previously calibrated and validated on farm simulation model robles et al 2019 a farm is typically divided into sequentially irrigated sectors following a pre established order as presented in fig 1b a sprinkler spacing is used to simulate water distribution in each sector using the ador sprinkler module fig 1c ballistic theory is applied to simulate drop dynamics and to determine irrigation depth at 25 simulation points uniformly distributed within the sprinkler spacing fig 1d simulations are performed at a semi hourly time step even if an irrigation event lasts for hours to use the current meteorological variables conditioning uniformity and wind drift and evaporation losses wdel 3 ador crop a soil water balance is performed at each of the 25 points in the sprinkler spacing representing each sector to simulate soil water and crop yield reduction from its maximum value fig 1d a variety of crops have been implemented in ador crop zapata et al 2017 but only one crop can be simulated at a plot in an irrigation season soil depth and its water holding capacity whc are required to perform soil water balance irrigation requirements are determined from crop water status at the sector and plot level using a daily time step 4 the ador decision module performs irrigation decision making in all plots of the study area ador decision selects the plots to be irrigated taking into account their water stress zapata et al 2017 and a series of user defined limitations such as crop water status network hydraulics electricity restrictions for pumping and environmental or irrigation performance requirements ador decision is run at a semi hourly time step to fulfill both crop water requirements and the user defined limitations in a context of time variable meteorology network occupation and electricity costs fig 1 presents the new developments of the ador simulation software which are presented in this paper these include improvements in ador sprinkler new on farm irrigation methods the ador pivot and ador drip modules extended simulation capacities in ador crop two consecutive crops in the same plot and season and improved on farm irrigation management practices the effect of irrigation frequency and timing on crop development and irrigation water losses 2 1 2 ador sprinkler enlarging the sprinkler simulation results database the sprinkler simulation module has been improved by extending the database of sprinkler irrigation simulation cases impact sprinklers working at low pressure 200 kpa have been made available for additional sprinkler manufacturers and nozzle sizes 5 2 mm main nozzle and 2 5 mm auxiliary nozzle the combination of low pressure 200 kpa these nozzle diameters and usual sprinkler spacings 18 18 m results in an adequate pluviometry for solid set irrigation systems about 5 2 mm h and permits to moderate pumping costs 2 1 3 ador pivot new module the implementation of center pivot sprinkler irrigation started with a classification based on the angle covered by the machine full circle pivot fc or partial circle pivot pc the following variables have been implemented in ador pivot to characterize the hardware and the operation of the machine 1 angle covered by the irrigation machine 360º for a pivot fc and between 0 and 360º for the pivot pc 2 gross irrigation depth gid in mm h 1 the irrigation depth emitted by the pivot machine when operated at 100 speed i e when the outermost pivot tower does not stop 3 irrigation period the time it takes for the pivot to cover its angle when operating at 100 speed expressed in h round 1 4 irrigated area the effective area irrigated by the pivot expressed in hectares 5 experimental distribution uniformity of the low quarter dulq this variable is user defined and can be obtained from ad hoc experimentation or from the literature evans et al 1995 6 pressure at the nozzle the designed working pressure of the center pivot sprinkler package expressed in kpa and established by the pressure regulators installed just upstream from each spray sprinkler 7 direction of rotation fc pivots have one direction of rotation clockwise while pc pivots sequentially irrigate clockwise and counterclockwise 8 current angle the location angle of the pivot span at a given time expressed in degrees it always starts at 0º and increases to reach the total irrigated angle at that time it starts again if the pivot is fc and it changes the direction of rotation decreasing the angle if the pivot is pc 9 control angle the total irrigated area of a pivot is represented by five control radii fig 1e dividing the area in five homogeneous portions and locating a control radius at the middle of each section a control angles is the angle where each control radius is located each control radius has twenty five simulation points fig 1f homogenously distributed along the radius length at each point irrigation depth and crop development are simulated when the pivot passes over one of the control angles irrigation is simulated in its 25 simulation points the net irrigation depth nid mm h 1 at each point is determined using the pivot gid variable 2 in this list and two irrigation performance indexes wind drift and evaporation losses wdel and distribution uniformity dulq wdel are estimated using the empirical equation presented in eq 1 playán et al 2005 wdel are used in eq 2 to determine the average net irrigation depth nid mm h 1 at every simulation point 1 wdel 2 1 1 91 u 0 231 t 2 nid gid 100 wdel 100 with u the wind speed in m s 1 and t the temperature in celsius degrees to assign the net irrigation depth at each simulation point a normal distribution with a known average nid and standard deviation sd is applied eqs 3 and 4 the sd is determined from nid and dulq through the coefficient of variation cv assuming a random distribution of pivot water application the variability in net irrigation depth is randomly assigned in every irrigation event to the twenty five simulation points this procedure permits the integration of the random wind disturbance into the distribution of irrigation water in pivot irrigation machines 3 cv 100 1 du lq 100 1 1 27 4 sd nid cv 100 wind speed has been recognized as the meteorological variable with the largest effect on wdel and dulq in solid set sprinkler irrigation however the effect of wind speed on dulq in center pivot irrigation systems is much lower than in solid sets playán et al 2005 ouazaa et al 2016 the key hypothesis in this module is that the dulq of a pivot irrigated plot does not change with meteorology while wdel varies with wind speed and air temperature the value of nid resulting from a constant dulq and a variable wdel is randomized in every irrigation event we assume that this variability is randomly generated by the wind given the small distance separating spray sprinklers typically about 3 m much smaller than their irrigated radius therefore the nid mm h 1 of a certain point in a pivot irrigated plot will be different in every irrigation event these assumptions are supported by the findings of ouazaa et al 2016 who pointed out differences between 0 5 and 3 on radial heermann and hein uniformity coefficient for irrigation events performed by a center pivot under wind speed from 1 0 to 4 7 m s 1 2 1 4 ador drip new module this module fig 1 g h and i uses the following variables to represent a drip irrigated field 1 the distance between the lateral lines m 2 the distance between the drippers in the laterals m 3 the nominal flow discharge of the drippers l h 1 4 the nominal working pressure of the dripper kpa and 5 the experimental dulq this variable is user defined and can be obtained from ad hoc experimentation or from the literature burt 2004 twenty five simulation points are considered in each drip irrigated field as in the case of center pivot irrigation the variability in net irrigation depth is obtained by applying a normal distribution model with known average nid and standard deviation sd eqs 3 and 4 in the drip irrigation case the spatial distribution of nid is random but it is the same in all irrigation events making an important difference with the center pivot case since the only sources of variability considered in this case are the design of the irrigation system and the variability in the fabrication of the emitters therefore the nid mm h 1 of a certain simulation point in a drip irrigated plot will be the same in all irrigation events 2 1 5 ador crop extension to two consecutive crops per season the ador crop module was updated to simulate two consecutive crops in the same season double cropping four such schemes have been considered in this research barley maize barley sunflower peas maize and peas sunflower the selection of these cropping schemes responds to their current representativeness in the ebro river basin irrigated area the frequency of double cropping has increased in some modernized irrigation areas due to the possibilities of the new automated irrigation systems and to the necessity of increasing net income to payback the investment in irrigation equipment and in some cases the energy costs to simulate a double cropping scheme the seeding date of the second crop is not user controlled but determined by the harvest date of the first crop in turn the harvest date of the first crop is controlled by the completion of the thermal time target eq 5 5 thermal time k seed senescence tk tb tk tc with tb the basal temperature ºc and tk the daily average air temperature ºc the soil water content at the beginning of the second crop is inherited from the first crop the soil water content at harvest of the first crop ador crop provides a number of agronomic hydrologic and economic parameters individually determined for each crop and for both successive crops when adequate irrigation efficiency was seasonally determined as the ratio between net irrigation depth and gross irrigation depth 2 1 6 sprinkler irrigation management irrigation frequency and timing in solid set and center pivot sprinkler systems irrigation frequency affects the wetting drying events of the leaves and consequently interception water losses previous research works martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 urrego pereira a et al 2013 and b reported that interception losses depend on crop architecture being leaf wettability a critical trait corn with wettable crop leaves and alfalfa with non wettable crop leaves respond differently to the intercepted water the ador simulation release presented by zapata et al 2017 considers wdel but does not consider interception losses in the current model release interception losses have been incorporated martínez cob et al 2008 conducted a detailed study in maize using weighing lysimeters these authors concluded that net interception losses i e consumptive losses due to interception amounted to 0 5 mm in daytime irrigation and between 0 1 and 0 3 mm in nighttime irrigation stambouli et al 2013 following the same methodology as martínez cob et al 2008 but in an alfalfa crop proposed similar values 0 5 mm for daytime irrigation and between 0 1 and 0 28 mm for nighttime irrigation these developments have made it possible to integrate interception losses into ador crop the irrigation timing daytime vs nighttime irrigation can also affect crop transpiration microclimatic changes originate during sprinkler irrigation and can last for up to 2 3 h causing a decrease in transpiration and vegetation cover temperature martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 which are more significant in daytime than in nighttime irrigation cavero et al 2009 in daytime irrigation there are differences in photosynthetic activity and yield between wettable and non wettable leaves the high wettability of the maize leaf reduces co2 exchange and at the same time the microclimatic changes reduce the air and vegetation cover temperature below the optimum for the photosynthetic activity of maize urrego pereira et al 2013b during nighttime irrigation since transpiration is practically null there are no differences between wettable or non wettable leaves for alfalfa with non wettable leaves stomata are not plugged by the sheet of irrigation water and the temperature is not below optimum therefore this crop follows its normal transpiration processes during daytime irrigation cavero et al 2016 the effect of irrigation timing has been treated differently in the model for corn and alfalfa the reduction of the photosynthetic activity during maize daytime irrigation has been indirectly incorporated in ador crop since this simplified model does not simulate photosynthetic processes following the results of martínez cob et al 2008 cavero et al 2009 and cavero et al 2016 when maize is daytime irrigated a reduction in the thermal time governing crop development is introduced this reduction is proportional to the duration of the irrigation event the thermal time of alfalfa was not modified for the rest of simulated crops in ador crop the differential response between daytime and nighttime irrigation was not implemented either in this case due to the absence of experimental data in the literature incorporating this effect is very important in the ebro valley due to the prevalence of maize in most crop rotations 2 2 application of the updated ador simulation model to a theoretical problem 2 2 1 general characteristics of the study area fig 2 presents the layout of the collective pressurized irrigation network of the theoretical problem as defined in epanet the network has seven hydrants from h1 to h7 all with the same nominal flow rate 48 l s 1 each hydrant irrigates a 30 ha farm the considered on farm irrigation systems include pivot fc machines a theoretical dulq of 85 has been selected to simulate irrigation water distribution this value represents modern center pivots with high design standards equipped with suitable sprinkler nozzle packages and pressure regulators dukes et al 2006 ouazaa et al 2016 adequately operated and maintained pivot pc machines the theoretical dulq was 85 equal to pivot fc machines solid set sprinkler irrigation the sprinkler layout is triangular with 18 m between lines and 18 m between sprinklers impact sprinklers have main and auxiliary nozzles with diameters of 4 4 and 2 4 mm respectively surface drip irrigation for fruit orchards drip o the drip layout has larger spacing than that for field crops the spacing is user selected and adapted to the layout of the trees in the orchard a theoretical dulq of 90 has been selected for this problem the value corresponds to adequately designed and maintained systems burt 2004 styles et al 2008 subsurface drip irrigation for field crops drip ss the drip layout has spacings of 0 75 m between drip lines and 0 5 m between drippers a theoretical dulq of 90 was selected as in the previous drip system the agrometeorological data of the grañén siar network station for the 2014 irrigation season was used in this problem the soils of the plots were considered homogenous with an average depth of 1 00 m and a moderate soil water holding capacity swhc of 107 mm m 1 four case studies were simulated from cs1 to cs4 fig 2b summarizes the characteristics and the objective of each variant cs1 simulates the irrigation of four plots with maize crops with different on farm methods pivot fc h1 pivot pc of 180º h3 solid set h4 and drip ss h6 the case study evaluates the new model developments related with on farm irrigation fig 1e and g cs2 similar to cs1 but using double cropping barley followed by short cycle maize in all plots the case study evaluates the new model developments related with double cropping fig 1d and i cs3 simulates that all hydrants of the collective network are cropped with maize this case compares two solid set sprinkler design and management cases standard pressure 300 kpa versus low pressure 200 kpa network operation requires pressures at the pumping station of 40 m and 30 m to irrigate at 300 and 200 kpa respectively the only difference required in the on farm irrigation design is the nozzle diameters the standard pressure implements sprinklers equipped with 4 4 mm and 2 4 mm nozzles while the low pressure implements sprinklers equipped with 5 2 mm and 2 5 mm nozzles cs4 the seven plots are equipped with solid set irrigation systems and cultivate maize the effects of irrigation management duration and timing on yield gross irrigation depth interception losses and net income were analyzed simulations were performed for two soil types the original one as described above and a second one with higher depth and water holding capacity 1 40 m and 180 mm respectively in all cases hydrologic seasonal gross irrigation irrigation efficiency seasonal distribution uniformity seasonal water losses agronomic crop yield and economic gross and net income indicators were determined and compared 2 3 application of the updated ador simulation model to a real problem 2 3 1 general characteristics of the study area this problem involves a recently formed water users association wua on a previously dry farmed area of 931 ha which is being transformed to pressurized irrigation with sprinkler and drip irrigation methods this wua named bardenas xi belongs to the bardenas project in the aragón autonomous community and the zaragoza province of spain fig 3a and b crop water requirements were determined using data from the ejea de los caballeros station of the siar agrometeorological network located 7 km west of the study area the analyzed data set covers the period 2004 2018 15 years of daily and semi hourly meteorological data a soil sampling campaign was performed in january 2019 to determine soil physics properties of interest for irrigation the 1 50 000 geologic map of spain igme 2015 was overlapped with the map of the study area to determine the sampling locations the points selected for soil sampling resulted from the litho stratigraphic distribution of the study area a total of 13 points were sampled from p3 to p15 in fig 3c an auger was used to obtain 0 30 m samples to a maximum depth of 1 20 m soil samples were analyzed at the laboratory following the methodology proposed by the soil survey field and laboratory methods manual 2014 for stoniness as a percentage soil water content at field capacity fc and at permanent wilting point pwp were determined using pressure plates set at 33 and 1500 kpa respectively the soil bulk density was obtained from a study performed nearby lecina et al 2004 assigning values of 1 40 and 1 52 mg m 3 for lower river valley and upper platform soils respectively the swhc mm m 1 was obtained for each sample from stoniness fc pwp and bulk density porta et al 2003 table 1 presents the classification ranges for this variable soil depth was classified in four classes lower than 0 60 m 0 60 0 90 m 0 90 1 20 m and higher than 1 20 m these classes will be referred to as shallow moderate deep and very depth respectively the combination of swhc and soil depth was used to define the soil types of the study area the network design used in the construction project aimed to supply irrigation water to a predefined cropping pattern 25 alfalfa 10 fruit orchards peach trees 18 sunflower 32 maize 5 vineyard and 10 wheat the key design question at this wua is whether to pump irrigation water 2 3 2 collective network design without pumping station the designed network starts at an elevated reservoir providing natural pressure to the 52 network hydrants supplying water to the irrigated plots this option results in different pressures at the hydrants from higher than 400 kpa to lower than 250 kpa these differences are mainly due to differences in hydrant elevation within the irrigated land the difference between the highest and the lowest hydrant was 68 m on farm irrigation systems were assigned as a function of the available pressure at the hydrant plots with pressure at the hydrant larger than 400 kpa were equipped with solid set sprinkler using standard pressure at the sprinkler nozzles 300 kpa plots with pressure at the hydrant between 400 and 300 kpa were equipped with solid set sprinkler using low pressure at the sprinkler nozzles 200 kpa plots with pressure at the hydrant between 300 and 200 kpa were equipped with center pivots finally plots with pressure at the hydrant equal to or lower than 200 kpa were equipped with drip irrigation a relationship between the crop and the on farm irrigation method was established horticultural crops and orchards used drip irrigation while field crops used any sprinkler irrigation system solid set or center pivot 2 3 3 collective network design with pumping station a pumping station was designed to ensure a minimum pressure of 400 kpa at all hydrants the pumping station added a supplementary pressure of 180 kpa to natural pressure a total power of 350 kw was required at the pumping station in 2019 the electricity tariff adequate for this pumping station was the 3 1 tariff with three periods for both power and energy costs the three periods off peak base and peak were associated to cheap medium and expensive electricity respectively the timing and the power price of the different periods were regulated by the spanish law boe 2018 the energy price of the different periods was not regulated and was obtained from neighboring wuas zapata et al 2017 the description of each tariff period considered in this study was as follows 1 the off peak period runs from 0 00 8 00 on working days and from 0 00 18 00 on weekends and national holidays the power cost is 8 368 kw 1 year 1 and the energy price is 0 078 kwh 1 2 the base period runs from 8 00 10 00 and from 16 00 24 00 on working days and from 18 00 24 00 on weekends and national holidays from april to october both included the power cost is 36 491 kw 1 year 1 and the energy cost is 0 097 kwh 1 3 the peak period runs from 10 00 16 00 from april to october both included the power cost is 59 173 kw 1 year 1 and the energy cost is 0 106 kwh 1 the payback of the investment cost and the maintenance of the pumping station should also be included when computing net income for this design option the annual payback was estimated at 50 ha 1 and year in agreement with observations of similar systems in the ebro valley 2 3 4 analyses performed at the studied wua in a first step ador simulation was applied to the bardenas xi pressurized network and the abovementioned cropping pattern for the multiannual meteorological data set hydrologic agronomic and economic performance indicators were obtained in a second step comparisons were established between network designs with and without the pumping station originally the collective network was designed without pumping station the only difference with the previous simulation in the wua was the cropping pattern a new crop distribution was introduced only including field crops 25 maize 25 alfalfa 10 wheat and 40 double cropping of peas and maize differences in annual irrigation and crop performance indicators induced by differences in on farm irrigation methods soils and crops were assessed using mean comparisons the interaction between explicative variables can be relevant and is not always intuitive for instance vineyards and fruit orchards are only irrigated by drip irrigation while field crops are irrigated by different on farm methods box plots were used to facilitate this analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 application of ador simulation to a theoretical problem the ador simulation tool was applied to the five case studies described in fig 2 with the aim of illustrating the capacity of the software to contribute to the design and management of collective pressurized wuas 3 1 1 maize and pressurized irrigation systems cs1 the simulated irrigation depth irrigation performance indexes maize yield and gross and net income are presented in fig 4 for each on farm irrigation method the seasonal irrigation depth of the irrigation methods presented in decreasing order was solid set pivot fc pivot pc and drip ss fig 4a deep percolation losses wdel and total losses are presented in fig 4b the most significant losses were observed in the solid set method center pivot irrigation obtained the lowest deep percolation losses and the highest seasonal distribution uniformity 98 due to the complete random spatial distribution of irrigation water drip irrigation had zero wdel since in this method water is directly applied to the soil regarding total water losses the irrigation methods can be decreasingly ordered as solid set pivot fc pivot pc and drip ss fig 4b differences between pivot methods full circle and partial circle were very low and could be considered similar in this cs the large total losses of the solid set method explain its large seasonal irrigation depth fig 4a in comparison with the other on farm methods surface drip has some evaporative losses from the wet bare soil surface and even subsurface drip does because some water moves to the surface by capillary action however these processes have not been considered in this research because there are not sufficient experimental data in the literature and because the magnitude of losses is expected to be low fig 4c shows how on demand irrigation adequately irrigated maize in all irrigation methods obtaining relative yields of 96 98 the design of this case study ensures that differences in irrigation depth irrigation losses and economic income are almost completely due to the on farm method seasonal actual evapotranspiration etactual presented minor differences between on farm methods fig 4c mostly due to small differences in maize seeding date between plots differences in gross and net income between on farm methods were also minor since the operation of the collective network operation does not require energy for pumping fig 4d differences in income only accounted for differences in yield and the cost of irrigation water 3 1 2 on farm irrigation systems and crop intensification validation and comparison cs2 the only difference between cs1 and cs2 is that in this case the four plots are double cropped with barley followed by short cycle maize irrigation depth losses et and income were larger for cs2 than for cs1 in all irrigation methods since cs2 is more intensive than cs1 fig 5 comparisons between on farm methods are quite similar to cs1 with small differences in cs2 the lowest seasonal irrigation depth was obtained for pivot pc fig 5a due to its high seasonal irrigation uniformity 99 and its moderate total losses fig 5b as in cs1 the lowest deep percolation losses were found in pivot systems pivot pc and pivot fc this is related to their high seasonal dulq 99 and 98 respectively the largest deep percolation losses were obtained for drip ss 25 mm followed by solid set 24 mm these losses resulted from seasonal dulq of 90 and 91 respectively the effect of seasonal dulq on deep percolation is remarkable solid set systems showed the largest wdel and total irrigation losses since drip ss has null wdel and the lowest total losses fig 5b cs2 presented high crop yields and similar values of etactual fig 5c for all the studied methods differences in crop yield between on farm methods amounted to 3 and 4 for barley and maize respectively in all on farm methods the yield of the second crop was reduced from 7 to 11 from maximum for pivot fc and drip ss respectively the parameters describing the thermal time for maize as a second crop were calibrated in a different meteorological area within the ebro valley a shorter cycle maize variety would probably have obtained a lower yield reduction differences in gross and net income between on farm methods account for differences in gross irrigation and yield fig 5d pivot fc showed slightly larger gross and net income for this intensive cropping pattern than the other irrigation methods minor differences were found between the other irrigation methods results highlight the important effect of a small yield decrease on net income in this case a slightly larger yield reduction was observed for the second crop with drip ss the effect of differences in water use between irrigation methods on net income was small because no energy and no cost was required for water application in cs2 cs2 results validate the use of different on farm irrigation methods under double cropping further efforts are required to adjust the thermal time parameters of short cycle maize to different meteorological areas in the ebro valley if water application requires energy for pumping the electric cost will primarily affect net income for the different irrigation methods 3 1 3 standard vs low pressure in solid set irrigation cs3 case study 3 compares standard and low pressure sprinkler solid set irrigation with different nozzle configurations leading to a similar sprinkler discharge about 1650 l h 1 and irrigation application rate about 5 2 mm h when operated at 300 and 200 kpa the difference in nozzle pressures induces a difference in pressure requirements at the collective network inlet which is 100 kpa higher for standard pressure than for low pressure table 2 presents a set of irrigation and yield performance variables for both working pressures average values for the total irrigated area and differences between working pressures are presented simulated results reveal that differences in almost all analyzed variables are very low lower than 3 for all variables except for the deep percolation which reached 6 differences are quite similar to those reported by robles et al 2017 and zapata et al 2018 who presented experimental comparisons of maize under both working pressures robles et al 2017 reported differences of 10 in seasonal christiansen uniformity coefficient and no differences in yield zapata et al 2018 explained that maize canopy partitioning reduces the differences in irrigation performance indexes between the pressure treatments explaining why differences in grain yield between pressures were not found these authors indicated that caution should be used when measuring sprinkler irrigation performance above tall canopies since the elevation of the catch cans and the crop canopy partitioning affect performance estimations the corrections proposed by these authors were included in the crop simulation model which produced adequate yield estimates 3 1 4 effect of irrigation frequency and timing on simulation results cs4 different solid set irrigation duration and timing daytime or nighttime were evaluated in case study 4 under two soil types as described above the model generates an irrigation schedule based on soil water balance but the user can control the irrigation duration per irrigation event different durations were tested from 1 to 4 h with a time step of 1 h the shorter the irrigation event the higher the irrigation frequency additionally different irrigation timing arrangements were simulated for maize on demand daytime or nighttime and only nighttime irrigation fig 6 presents the average seasonal irrigation depth interception losses and yield for the different subcases as the irrigation duration increased and frequency decreased the seasonal irrigation depth increased for the soil with moderate water holding capacity fig 6a for the soil with high water holding capacity fig 6d the seasonal irrigation depth remained constant for irrigation durations equal to or larger than 2 h event 1 these differences are mainly related to deep percolation losses which drastically increased with long irrigations 4 h event 1 in soils with moderate water holding capacity on demand irrigation of maize resulted in slightly larger seasonal irrigation depth than nighttime irrigation for soils with moderate water holding capacity fig 6a in the soil with high water holding capacity the irrigation duration had less impact on irrigation depth fig 6d interception losses drastically decreased with the increase in irrigation duration fig 6b and e the number of wetting drying events decreased as the duration of irrigation events increased therefore interception losses were severely reduced soil characteristics and irrigation timing daytime or nighttime showed no effect on interception losses irrigation durations exceeding 2 h event 1 showed a slight effect on maize yield particularly for the soil with high water holding capacity fig 6f irrigation timing had a moderate effect on yield for the soil with moderate water holding capacity fig 7c and practically no effect for the soil with high water holding capacity fig 6f in soils with moderate water holding capacity an optimum irrigation duration 2 3 h event 1 could be identified fig 6c these results also suggest that there is not a general irrigation strategy regarding these variables and that specific analyses are required for each physical environment soils meteorology and irrigation structures collective irrigation networks and pumping stations 3 2 application of ador simulation to a real problem the bardenas xi wua the average annual precipitation of the time series was 405 mm with an inter annual coefficient of variation cv of 25 the highest annual precipitation was 636 mm in 2018 wettest year and the lowest precipitation was 238 mm in 2005 driest year monthly precipitation showed a large variability during the study years april was the wettest month average precipitation of 56 mm while august was the driest one average precipitation of 16 mm august presented the highest inter annual precipitation variability with a cv of 126 while october was the month with the lowest variability of precipitation the average annual reference evapotranspiration et0 was 1271 mm with a low inter annual coefficient of variation 4 6 the highest annual et0 was 1365 mm in 2012 while the lowest was 1167 mm in 2008 the irrigated area can be classified as moderately windy martínez cob et al 2008 the average annual wind speed was 2 9 m s 1 with an inter annual cv of 7 february was the windiest month on record with an average wind speed of 3 4 m s 1 september was the least windy month with an average of 2 5 m s 1 the average monthly wind speed was equal to or larger than 2 5 m s 1 in the twelve months of the year the windiest year was 2010 with an annual average of 3 3 m s 1 while the least windy year was 2008 with an annual average of 2 5 m s 1 like in other windy areas of the ebro river basin the windiest hours were the central hours of the day from 12 to 16 gmt and the least windy period was the nighttime from 20 to 6 gmt the thirteen soil samples fig 3c were processed at the laboratory to determine swhc the average swhc was 152 mm m 1 with 83 mm m 1 being the lowest value p5 fig 3c and 236 mm m 1 being the highest p6 fig 3c in general low swhc values were found in soils with the lowest depth the spatial distribution of the eight soil types is presented in fig 7a plots with a soil sample were assigned their measured value plots without a soil sample were assigned the same value than their geological class as previously reported the geological map was used to determine the number and location of soil samples to characterize the different geological classes in fig 7a intense red color presents soils with moderate depth and swhc while intense green presents soils with high depth and swhc the combination of swhc and soil depth and its percentage of representativeness in the area is presented in table 3 eight soil types are represented in the study area deep soils with moderate high and very high swhc are the most common with 20 6 15 7 and 21 of the total area respectively the soil types with lowest representativeness are deep soils with low swhc with 5 6 of the area followed by soils with moderate depth and high swhc with 6 2 of the area crop spatial distribution was randomly attributed respecting the crop pattern percentages accounted for during the design of the collective network only vineyard plots were manually assigned since vineyards were cultivated before the irrigation project after crop attribution the percentage of the different crops was 24 alfalfa 11 fruit orchards peach trees 16 sunflower 34 maize 6 vineyards and 9 wheat fig 7b presents the simulated crop distribution small differences between the simulated crop distribution and the cropping pattern considered in the project design are due to the area of the individual plots the collective network of the bardenas xi wua irrigates 931 ha supplied by 50 hydrants fig 7c the average area irrigated per hydrant is 17 9 ha with a maximum of 56 6 ha for hydrant 140 and a minimum of 0 8 ha for hydrant 113 the total number of irrigation sectors is 510 each plot has an average of 10 2 sectors being 11 sectors per plot the largest and most common arrangement 41 hydrants have 11 sectors the largest hydrant discharge is 84 9 l s 1 while the lowest is 15 l s 1 the pipes of the collective network have a total length of 17 684 m with diameters ranging from 115 to 1000 mm the reservoir is located at the south of the irrigated area at an elevation of 421 m a s l 27 m above the highest hydrant 222 and 85 m above the lowest hydrant 112 as reported in the previous section the on farm irrigation method was assigned as a function of the available pressure the most common on farm irrigation methods fig 4c were solid set sprinkler irrigation at standard pressure solid set 300 with 281 ha 30 of the total area and solid set at low pressure solid set 200 with 275 ha 30 drip irrigation for fruit orchards drip o irrigates 158 ha 17 and drip irrigation for field crops drip ss covers 52 ha 6 pivot full circle pivot fc irrigated 116 ha 12 while pivot partial circle pivot pc irrigated 49 ha 5 3 2 1 simulating the meteorological data series for the current design the meteorological variability of the analyzed data series induced a slight effect on total etc with an average value of 789 mm and an inter annual cv of 3 6 table 4 the average precipitation was 404 mm with an inter annual cv of 25 the average precipitation during the cropping season was 226 mm with a cv of 35 table 4 the simulated gross irrigation depth showed an inter annual average of 710 mm and a cv of 13 the irrigation performance indicators showed different degrees of inter annual variability seasonal dulq showed the smallest inter annual differences with an average value of 89 1 and a cv of 0 9 the irrigation efficiency ie showed an average value of 86 6 and a cv of 1 2 seasonal wdel and deep percolation losses showed annual averages of 79 9 mm and 54 2 mm both with moderate and strong inter annual variability 16 4 and 56 respectively the inter annual variability of these variables was due to the meteorological variability the moderate inter annual variability of wdel was mainly attributed to wind speed differences during irrigation yearly deep percolation was strongly affected by precipitation with a pearson correlation coefficient pcc of 0 53 and a high significance p value 0 0001 the largest values of deep percolation were found in 2004 and 2018 with average values of 125 and 121 mm respectively however in these years the values of ie were above the annual average 86 8 and 87 5 respectively both years had the highest precipitation annual and during the crop season moreover both years showed intense precipitation events at the beginning of the crop season 90 and 144 mm respectively lasting for 6 7 days these intense precipitation events during periods of low crop water requirements can explain the high values of deep percolation and the moderate effect on ie in these years deep percolation was largely due to excess of precipitation instead of over irrigation the on farm irrigation method had a determinant effect on irrigation performance indicators it had an important effect on dulq although the variability between irrigation methods was moderate with a cv of 6 2 the comparison of means indicates that dulq are statistically different the largest values of dulq were obtained for center pivots while the lowest values were obtained for solid set 200 the variability of ie between irrigation methods was also moderate cv of 8 5 but the comparison of means again confirmed the statistical differences p value 2 2 10 6 differences in wdel and deep percolation between irrigation methods were very high with cvs of 62 and 44 respectively the largest values of wdel and deep percolation losses were obtained for solid sets solid set 300 showed the largest wdel 113 mm while solid set 200 showed the largest deep percolation 75 mm drip irrigation showed average deep percolation losses 49 and 52 mm for drip and drip ss respectively and null wdel pivots showed moderate wdel 64 and 53 mm for pivot fc and pivot pc respectively and low deep percolation losses 16 and 13 mm respectively soil physics had an important effect on deep percolation losses particularly when combined with on farm irrigation methods such as solid set and drip the largest values of deep percolation losses were obtained for soils with moderate depth and swhc s2 93 3 mm and for deep soils with a low swhc s1 70 6 mm the first soil type had a moderate representativeness 14 6 of the total area table 3 and was only present in plots equipped with solid set or drip irrigation methods the second type had a low representativeness 5 6 of the total area table 3 and was only drip irrigated since deep percolation is a key component of ie soil type also affected ie and contributed to explain its variability crops also induced effects on irrigation indicators because of their association with on farm methods and because irrigation depth depends on crop evapotranspiration the coefficient of variation between crops was low for dulq 1 3 moderate for ie 8 6 and high for deep percolation and wdel 45 6 and 61 2 respectively these coefficients of variation are quite similar to those found for the on farm irrigation methods annual irrigation performance at plot level was related to three categorical variables soil type irrigation method and crop a box plot fig 8 was used to analyze these interactions alfalfa and maize plots present the largest number of combinations of irrigation methods and soil types 10 and 12 respectively dulq and ie showed a moderate data spread and low skewness the irrigation method had the most significant effect on both indicators with crops and soils showing moderate ie or low effects dulq wdel showed a larger spread due to the effect of wind speed and low skewness again the irrigation method had more effect than the crop moderate to low effect and the soil type very low effect deep percolation showed the largest spread skewness and number of outliers underlining the abovementioned effect of precipitation variability the irrigation method and the soil type showed important effects on deep percolation fig 9 maps the inter annual average of plot deep percolation ie wdel and dulq the cv of these average indicators was moderate for dulq 5 3 and ie 8 1 and high for wdel 59 7 and deep percolation 61 8 the comparison of fig 9a with fig 7a permits to relate the plots with low deep percolation losses with the soils with adequate hydraulic characteristics plots with very high ie were with drip irrigated fig 7d while plots with low ie and high wdel were solid set irrigated when analyzing the spatial variability of dulq fig 9d the irrigation method is the key variable all considered methods can attain high uniformities although some of them are sensitive to meteorology and to irrigation management practices this is the case of solid sets whose uniformity is strongly affected by wind speed the highest uniformity was attained by pivot irrigation machines followed by drip irrigation this is due to the random and systematic treatment of irrigation depth used for the simulation of pivot and drip irrigation respectively in pivot irrigation machines the random effect of the wind resulted in a seasonal dulq higher than the input provided to the model however in the case of drip irrigation the seasonal dulq was equal to the input provided to the model 3 2 2 comparison between network designs with and without pumping station the introduction of the pumping station introduces relevant differences in irrigation performance energy costs and investment costs thus affecting the income produced by irrigated agriculture at the bardenas xi wua differences in irrigation performance indicators between design options and crops are presented in fig 10 ie and wdel were almost equal for both design options with average differences of 0 4 and 0 5 mm respectively dulq and deep percolation showed larger average differences of 3 7 and 6 mm respectively the average difference in gross irrigation depth was quite moderate 1 1 larger for the option without pumping station these results are in agreement with those published by robles et al 2017 and zapata et al 2018 these authors compared irrigation and crop performance indicators on an experimental irrigated maize plot under standard and low pressure 300 and 200 kpa respectively they concluded that the differences in uniformity had no effect on gross irrigation requirements and grain yield electricity costs were null for the design option without pumping station and amounted to an average cost of 84 ha 1 yr 1 for the design with pumping station the maximum annual electricity cost occurred in 2005 with 137 ha 1 yr 1 while the minimum occurred in 2018 and amounted to 41 ha 1 yr 1 inter annual differences were related to crop water requirements being 2005 a dry year and 2018 a wet year fig 11 presents the annual average net income for both design options the average difference is 134 ha 1 yr 1 with a maximum of 187 and a minimum of 91 ha 1 yr 1 again for 2005 and 2018 respectively the design option without pumping station is the most adequate

assessment of pumping requirements at the design phase of irrigation projects low pressure solid set sprinkler irrigation was completely independent of energy costs without hurting the irrigation performance indicators 4 conclusions 1 center pivot sprinkler irrigation was introduced in the model using the angle covered by the machine and a normal distribution of irrigation depth derived from a user defined dulq the random water application depth in each irrigation event adequately represented the variability induced by the wind drip irrigation was also introduced in the model using random water application but using the same water application pattern in all irrigation events the selected approaches satisfactorily simulated the irrigation methods 2 double cropping simulation adequately reproduced the development of both crops however this crop scheme will require further research efforts to adjust the thermal time parameters of short cycle maize to different meteorological areas in the ebro valley 3 the effect of irrigation timing was successfully implemented in the model it has been treated differently in the model for corn and alfalfa interception losses and the adjustment of thermal time were implemented for wettable leaf crops maize while only interception losses were implemented for non wettable leaf crops alfalfa 4 a general irrigation strategy was not found for irrigation timing and duration specific analyses are required for each physical environment soils meteorology and irrigation structures collective irrigation networks and pumping stations 5 the simulated irrigation performance indicators at the bardenas xi wua showed different degrees of inter annual variability deep percolation was strongly affected by the amount of seasonal precipitation and dulq 6 irrigation performance indicators at the plot level were strongly dependent on the on farm irrigation method the crop and the soil type 7 the design option without pumping station was the most adequate at the bardenas xi wua natural pressure has proven sufficient for low pressure sprinkler irrigation pivot and drip irrigation methods the escalating energy costs emphasize the need for

heat stress the negative impacts of waterlogging on wheat growth have received less scientific attention although it may lead to comparable yield losses international food policy research institute 2022 liu et al 2022a in addition the state of the art of modeling waterlogging in the soil plant system is rudimentary and simplistic liu et al 2020b here using wheat crop models as an example we present a brief overview of how different process based wheat crop simulation models csm simulate waterlogging impacts on wheat growth and recent experimental studies for waterlogging on wheat growth we outline the gaps associated with controlled experiments regarding the impact of waterlogging on wheat that may support crop model development and improvement for a more comprehensive assessment of waterlogging impacts on wheat under climate change 2 wheat crop simulation models and waterlogging some csms were built to first simulate the potential yield of crops i e the yield of a crop when grown without water nutrient and biotic stress van ittersum and cassman 2013 thus yield potential is primarily driven by solar radiation temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration van ittersum and cassman 2013 simultaneously with the simulation of yield potential csms compute stress factors mainly non optimal temperature water and nitrogen deficit based on the observed weather soil data crop management and the current stage of crop development webber et al 2022 these computed stress factors are used to reduce the potential rates of crop growth and development leading to the simulation of crop yields limited by water and nutrient van ittersum and cassman 2013 reducing factors such as biotic stresses due to pests and diseases frost hail high windspeeds and waterlogging are generally not included in csms we assessed 31 csms that have been extensively studied in the agmip agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project rosenzweig et al 2013 wheat projects asseng et al 2013 only one third 29 i e 9 out of 31 of the wheat csms consider the effects of waterlogging on simulated wheat growth fig 2 of the nine wheat crop models that consider waterlogging impacts on wheat five have approaches to reduce wheat transpiration under waterlogged conditions which indirectly limits root water conductivity and affects water supply to the canopy shaw et al 2013 in addition waterlogging is also considered to directly reduce photosynthesis or dry biomass accumulation in four csms leaf area index lai and root growth in three csms and dry biomass partitioning in two csm fig 2b the apsim wheat asseng et al 1997 and the dssat nwheat kassie et al 2016 crop models cover waterlogging impacts on the wheat lai and root activity recently a new mechanism that directly affects wheat photosynthesis in response to waterlogging was added to apsim wheat liu et al 2021b yan et al 2022 table 1 the aquacrop raes et al 2018 model as well as infocrop aggarwal et al 2006 glam li et al 2016 and wofost githui et al 2022 liu et al 2020b crop models represent yield impacts by waterlogging using an indirect effect of reduced transpiration similarly the hermes crop model kersebaum 2007 considers a reduction of transpiration but together with a direct reduction of photosynthesis due to waterlogging the epic githui et al 2022 model considers wheat growth being affected by waterlogging via reduced photosynthesis and lai whereas the wheatgrow model only considers waterlogging impacts on biomass partitioning lv et al 2017 wheat phenological stage directly determines the effect waterlogging has on wheat growth in four csms apsim wheat dssat nwheat infocrop aquacrop and wofost indirect impacts of waterlogging on crop growth due to nitrogen deficiencies caused by nitrogen leaching from water excess are captured in some nóia júnior et al 2023 we demonstrate that only one third of csms consider the impact of waterlogging on wheat and while waterlogging impacts are simulated in different ways there are few comparisons of which algorithms best reflect biophysical reality differences across csms in terms of processes that are modeled in waterlogged fields indicate that observed phenomena in field experiments so far have yet to be adequately reflected in csms it is still unclear which physiological processes are most sensitive to waterlogging and impact growth for example controlled experiments have shown that elevated co2 increases the rate of photosynthesis and reduces water loss through transpiration due to regulation of stomatal opening taub 2010 from these experiments csms were improved to simulate altered photosynthetic and transpiration rates due to co2 this model data learning cycle is yet to be adequately conducted for waterlogging perhaps because waterlogging involves a range of connected yet complex processes including impacts on soil oxygen and nutrients plant responses and recovery waterlogging as a phenomenon in the field is also difficult to measure and quantify and there is considerable spatial variation in its prevalence to better understand such limitations and indicate how new experiments may be performed to guide csms improvements we describe below the current status of wheat waterlogging experiments 3 controlled experiments of waterlogging impacts on wheat controlled experiments are the most reliable method to understand the linkage between single environmental variables e g waterlogging and crop growth significant relationships between wheat growth and waterlogging have been reported in the literature dickin and wright 2008 marti et al 2015 olgun et al 2008 we assessed 17 peer reviewed published articles from 2008 to 2021 which quantified the impacts of waterlogging on wheat grain yield grain number or grain size in 21 controlled experiments supplementary table s1 relevant articles were found by using keywords waterlogging flooding or excess of water and wheat in google scholar database searches occurred in november 2022 in the assessed articles waterlogging was applied in different wheat phenological stages from seedling to grain filling with duration varying from 2 to 58 days with fully waterlogged soil i e soil filled with water with water 2 cm above the soil surface half of these waterlogging experiments were carried out in plastic pots fig 3c about a quarter of the experiments were performed in pvc tubes and 9 n 2 in field plots one experiment was conducted in lysimeters and rhizotrons of all those experiments 56 were performed in open field conditions with no control of temperature or rainfall 26 in greenhouses full control of temperature and rainfall and 9 in semi controlled environment with controlled rainfall nine percent n 2 of the assessed articles did not report the environmental conditions wheat growth responses to waterlogging vary according to the phenological stage in which the waterlogging occurred liu et al 2021a in the assessed articles around 20 of the experiments tested waterlogging impact on wheat growth at the beginning of wheat stem elongation or anthesis fig 3 these are phenological stages highly correlated with final wheat grain yield particularly because of the importance of stem elongation stage in defining the number of fertile florets and grain number per unit area fischer 1985 marti et al 2015 miralles et al 2000 and of the period after anthesis in defining wheat grain size hossain et al 2011 however losses of grain number per unit area due to waterlogging tends to be the highest before anthesis around heading de san celedonio et al 2014 the phenological stage with less waterlogging experiments in the last 15 years fig 3b during emergence tillering and maturity wheat is less sensitive to the effects of waterlogging de san celedonio et al 2014 san celedonio et al 2014 reported a 5 wheat yield loss due to waterlogging during seedling due to formation of few grains in contrast to up to 90 yield loss due to waterlogging starting at anthesis and continuing during grain filling due to few and light grains grain yield in wheat is determined by grain number per unit area and average single grain size average grain dry mass or grain weight these are the most measured wheat growth variables among the assessed experiments fig 3a there are a small number of experiments with measurements of indicating crop growth processes such as gas exchange chlorophyll content and enzyme activity due to the difficulty of measuring root components are rarely measured above ground biomass which is an important indicator of wheat photosynthesis was measured in one third of the assessed experiments all experiments tracked wheat phenology to start waterlogging treatments but only one fifth reported the impact of waterlogging on wheat phenology crop waterlogging experiments are few and their experimental setups and observed variables covered do not optimally support the development of waterlogging modules of csms for example experimental studies indicate that crop phenology is delayed by waterlogging csms for the most part simulate wheat phenology considering photo thermal or degree days indices assuming driving variables of temperature and photoperiod thus modifications to csms to correctly simulate crop delays in phenology associated with waterlogging require experiments that investigate how waterlogging interacts with phenology particularly with the photo thermal or degree days indices for this it would be necessary to carry out experiments with waterlogging occurring at several phenological stages with time series of the observed phenological stages photothermal and degree days indices to our knowledge however no controlled experiments have been conducted with such aims delaying potential model data learning cycles improving broader understanding of how plants respond to and recover from waterlogging there thus an urgent need to describe the fundamental mechanisms between waterlogging and plant growth so that crop modelers have a clear understanding of which mechanisms need to be prioritized we indicate that experiments used to guide the improvement of csms should first provide bases for the critical testing of existing model structures and contemporary processes embedded in csms thereafter also the experimental setups and variables measured should be assessed and modified so that they best serve effective model improvements additional challenges and future research needs are described in the following subsection 4 challenges and future research needs the implementation and improvement of waterlogging modules in csms are constrained by the availability of adequate and representative data in response to waterlogging and lack of information on critical interactions of plant growth waterlogging and weather variables such as temperature solar radiation atmospheric co2 and others on the other hand controlled experiments are usually time consuming and expensive for waterlogging experiments more complex structures with better soil water control are required to keep the soil waterlogged to overcome this it is needed to design specific greenhouse and field experiments to derive more comprehensive understanding on which simulated processes by csm should be improved or included to properly simulate the detrimental impacts of waterlogging on crops in the following we list the identified knowledge gaps regarding the impact of waterlogging on wheat at the plant and field scales which can be closed by dedicated controlled experiments 1 how does the root morphology change under waterlogging stress although effects such as partial root death to waterlogging are demonstrated in the literature herzog et al 2016 further research is essential to improve the representation of waterlogging impacts on roots in csms for instance the number of days under waterlogging after which root death occurs or the maximum proportion of roots having died with respect to the total amount of roots or that become inactive due to different periods of exposure in different phenological stages to waterlogging need to be known this is essential not only to simulate the direct effects of waterlogging more accurately but also its legacy effect of subsequent droughts whose effects may be more severe after a period of waterlogging having had an impact on the roots e g root length density depth distribution and others 2 how does waterlogging support the evolution of other biotic and abiotic stresses it is unclear whether waterlogging combined with other stress factors both occurring in sequence one stress after other e g waterlogging and drought or simultaneously e g waterlogging and frost or heavy rainfalls will have an additive multiplicative or even compensatory impact on crop growth 3 how does atmospheric co2 and temperature interact with the effects of waterlogging increasing atmospheric co2 concentration due to climate change favors growth of c3 plants such as wheat and barley elevated co2 increases the rate of photosynthetic carbon dioxide uptake by leaves and reduces water loss via transpiration due to the regulation of stomatal opening taub 2010 however waterlogging limits root water conductivity causing stomatal closure and reducing co2 concentration within the leaves antagonizing co2 effects on crops else et al 2001 jitsuyama 2017 therefore it is necessary to investigate the combined effect of co2 and waterlogging on wheat growth to understand in what conditions the combination may have positive or negative impacts on crop growth photosynthetic activity and stomatal opening 4 what is the effect of partial waterlogging on crop growth waterlogging does not necessarily occur uniformly over the soil profile but depending on soil hydraulic properties and groundwater levels and dynamics are expected to lead to different effects on the dynamic plant growth and require a strong focus on the correct representation of soil hydraulic properties examples are that the water table may only strongly affect the deepest soil layers or instantaneous heavy rainfalls affecting only the shallowest soil layers waterlogging is generally transient rather than chronic and enduring to robustly capture such phenomena field experiments must reflect reality which could include partial wetting and drying in the season s with which waterlogging occurs typically winter and spring this also emphasizes the importance of continuous and spatially explicit measurement data from the experiments such experiments could be performed with sensors that measure soil moisture at different depths covering the entire root depth as well as visual crop responses e g through spectroscopy continuous measurements of photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance would also be helpful roots are the interface over which the crop perceives waterlogging thus root activity should also be measured when possible 5 how resilient are different cultivars a more systematic comparison of waterlogging responses across cultivars is required to understand the cultivars sensitivity to waterlogging and how different cultivar traits support the resilience of cultivars to waterlogging liu et al 2020b 6 what are the spatial implications of waterlogging severe waterlogging may have minor implications for field scale production if the extent of waterlogging at the field scale is minor spatio temporal quantification of waterlogging similar to the study conducted by chen et al 2021 at the field scale for pastures would be valuable as a research endeavor and in scaling the extent of waterlogging from the field to higher scales chen et al 2021 7 how does waterlogging affect the availability of plant nutrients waterlogging can lead to leaching of nutrients and altered biochemical processes reducing uptake rawnsley et al 2019 and associated greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrous oxide and methane 8 how soil waterlogging responses to engineering management practices across environments engineering practices such as drainage systems raised beds and controlled farming tillage are expected to alleviate the negative impacts of waterlogging on wheat plants manik et al 2019 conducting research to assess the efficacy of various management practices in diverse waterlogging environments can aid farmers and agronomists in making informed decisions about the most suitable engineering practices to adopt for their wheat production systems considering factors such as cost effectiveness feasibility and local environmental conditions future research on waterlogging proposed here should be done under controlled conditions such as a greenhouse and in the field but to better guide agricultural production practices field validation experiments are needed these experiments should be performed in fields with well described physical soil profiles such as small areas and survey pits soil moisture measurements in different soil depths are particularly important to improve the computation of waterlogged soils by csms we also encourage measurements of greenhouse gases from waterlogged soil as soil net greenhouse gas emissions tend to increase under these conditions liu et al 2011 the data resulted from these potential experiments should be strongly encouraged to be made available to the scientific community via cloud based repositories or open data journals only with open access to this cropping climate soil and management sowing date planting density fertilizer and irrigation amount and date data can be tested and used to improve csms we identified that about one third of the wheat csms consider the effects of waterlogging on simulated wheat growth fig 3 several multi model ensemble and model comparison studies such as those implemented under the agmip network rosenzweig et al 2013 have evaluated models for a range of crops and regions by comparing outputs with observed growth and yield data including responses to atmospheric co2 concentration temperature water shortage and water excess models embed different processes and when a range of models are compared using the same initialization and calibration data insights can be gained as to which models more closely reflect the observed data and why such results occur in this way deeper insight can be gained into processes that are necessary in simulating impacts of waterlogging in crops as well as those processes that are superfluous and could be simplified or removed completely in addition the uncertainty due to missing processes relevant for describing waterlogging and its impacts remains unclear these are topics that should be emphasized in future research which addresses crop simulation model development for improved representation of waterlogging moreover waterlogging should be included in crop simulation models especially those to forecast in season wheat yield in regions where waterlogging occurs or when assessing the impacts of climate change to reduce uncertainty in climate impact projections and their impact on future crop production crop models need to include the simulation the waterlogging and its impact on crop growth and yield with this cropping models will be able to give better indications of how to adapt to a future with more extremes arising from climate change due to the relevance of waterlogging impacts and the deficiencies identified in state of the art in waterlogging research this manuscript is a

2007 considers a reduction of transpiration but together with a direct reduction of photosynthesis due to waterlogging the epic githui et al 2022 model considers wheat growth being affected by waterlogging via reduced photosynthesis and lai whereas the wheatgrow model only considers waterlogging impacts on biomass partitioning lv et al 2017 wheat phenological stage directly determines the effect waterlogging has on wheat growth in four csms apsim wheat dssat nwheat infocrop aquacrop and wofost indirect impacts of waterlogging on crop growth due to nitrogen deficiencies caused by nitrogen leaching from water excess are captured in some nóia júnior et al 2023 we demonstrate that only one third of csms consider the impact of waterlogging on wheat and while waterlogging impacts are simulated in different ways there are few comparisons of which algorithms best reflect biophysical reality differences across csms in terms of processes that are modeled in waterlogged fields indicate that observed phenomena in field experiments so far have yet to be adequately reflected in csms it is still unclear which physiological processes are most sensitive to waterlogging and impact growth for example controlled experiments have shown that elevated co2 increases the rate of photosynthesis and reduces water loss through transpiration due to regulation of stomatal opening taub 2010 from these experiments csms were improved to simulate altered photosynthetic and transpiration rates due to co2 this model data learning cycle is yet to be adequately conducted for waterlogging perhaps because waterlogging involves a range of connected yet complex processes including impacts on soil oxygen and nutrients plant responses and recovery waterlogging as a phenomenon in the field is also difficult to measure and quantify and there is considerable spatial variation in its prevalence to better understand such limitations and indicate how new experiments may be performed to guide csms improvements we describe below the current status of wheat waterlogging experiments 3 controlled experiments of waterlogging impacts on wheat controlled experiments are the most reliable method to understand the linkage between single environmental variables e g waterlogging and crop growth significant relationships between wheat growth and waterlogging have been reported in the literature dickin and wright 2008 marti et al 2015 olgun et al 2008 we assessed 17 peer reviewed published articles from 2008 to 2021 which quantified the impacts of waterlogging on wheat grain yield grain number or grain size in 21 controlled experiments supplementary table s1 relevant articles were found by using keywords waterlogging flooding or excess of water and wheat in google scholar database searches occurred in november 2022 in the assessed articles waterlogging was applied in different wheat phenological stages from seedling to grain filling with duration varying from 2 to 58 days with fully waterlogged soil i e soil filled with water with water 2 cm above the soil surface half of these waterlogging experiments were carried out in plastic pots fig 3c about a quarter of the experiments were performed in pvc tubes and 9 n 2 in field plots one experiment was conducted in lysimeters and rhizotrons of all those experiments 56 were performed in open field conditions with no control of temperature or rainfall 26 in greenhouses full control of temperature and rainfall and 9 in semi controlled environment with controlled rainfall nine percent n 2 of the assessed articles did not report the environmental conditions wheat growth responses to waterlogging vary according to the phenological stage in which the waterlogging occurred liu et al 2021a in the assessed articles around 20 of the experiments tested waterlogging impact on wheat growth at the beginning of wheat stem elongation or anthesis fig 3 these are phenological stages highly correlated with final wheat grain yield particularly because of the importance of stem elongation stage in defining the number of fertile florets and grain number per unit area fischer 1985 marti et al 2015 miralles et al 2000 and of the period after anthesis in defining wheat grain size hossain et al 2011 however losses of grain number per unit area due to waterlogging tends to be the highest before anthesis around heading de san celedonio et al 2014 the phenological stage with less waterlogging experiments in the last 15 years fig 3b during emergence tillering and maturity wheat is less sensitive to the effects of waterlogging de san celedonio et al 2014 san celedonio et al 2014 reported a 5 wheat yield loss due to waterlogging during seedling due to formation of few grains in contrast to up to 90 yield loss due to waterlogging starting at anthesis and continuing during grain filling due to few and light grains grain yield in wheat is determined by grain number per unit area and average single grain size average grain dry mass or grain weight these are the most measured wheat growth variables among the assessed experiments fig 3a there are a small number of experiments with measurements of indicating crop growth processes such as gas exchange chlorophyll content and enzyme activity due to the difficulty of measuring root components are rarely measured above ground biomass which is an important indicator of wheat photosynthesis was measured in one third of the assessed experiments all experiments tracked wheat phenology to start waterlogging treatments but only one fifth reported the impact of waterlogging on wheat phenology crop waterlogging experiments are few and their experimental setups and observed variables covered do not optimally support the development of waterlogging modules of csms for example experimental studies indicate that crop phenology is delayed by waterlogging csms for the most part simulate wheat phenology considering photo thermal or degree days indices assuming driving variables of temperature and photoperiod thus modifications to csms to correctly simulate crop delays in phenology associated with waterlogging require experiments that investigate how waterlogging interacts with phenology particularly with the photo thermal or degree days indices for this it would be necessary to carry out experiments with waterlogging occurring at several phenological stages with time series of the observed phenological stages photothermal and degree days indices to our knowledge however no controlled experiments have been conducted with such aims delaying potential model data learning cycles improving broader understanding of how plants respond to and recover from waterlogging there thus an urgent need to describe the fundamental mechanisms between waterlogging and plant growth so that crop modelers have a clear understanding of which mechanisms need to be prioritized we indicate that experiments used to guide the improvement of csms should first provide bases for the critical testing of existing model structures and contemporary processes embedded in csms thereafter also the experimental setups and variables measured should be assessed and modified so that they best serve effective model improvements additional challenges and future research needs are described in the following subsection 4 challenges and future research needs the implementation and improvement of waterlogging modules in csms are constrained by the availability of adequate and representative data in response to waterlogging and lack of information on critical interactions of plant growth waterlogging and weather variables such as temperature solar radiation atmospheric co2 and others on the other hand controlled experiments are usually time consuming and expensive for waterlogging experiments more complex structures with better soil water control are required to keep the soil waterlogged to overcome this it is needed to design specific greenhouse and field experiments to derive more comprehensive understanding on which simulated processes by csm should be improved or included to properly simulate the detrimental impacts of waterlogging on crops in the following we list the identified knowledge gaps regarding the impact of waterlogging on wheat at the plant and field scales which can be closed by dedicated controlled experiments 1 how does the root morphology change under waterlogging stress although effects such as partial root death to waterlogging are demonstrated in the literature herzog et al 2016 further research is essential to improve the representation of waterlogging impacts on roots in csms for instance the number of days under waterlogging after which root death occurs or the maximum proportion of roots having died with respect to the total amount of roots or that become inactive due to different periods of exposure in different phenological stages to waterlogging need to be known this is essential not only to simulate the direct effects of waterlogging more accurately but also its legacy effect of subsequent droughts whose effects may be more severe after a period of waterlogging having had an impact on the roots e g root length density depth distribution and others 2 how does waterlogging support the evolution of other biotic and abiotic stresses it is unclear whether waterlogging combined with other stress factors both occurring in sequence one stress after other e g waterlogging and drought or simultaneously e g waterlogging and frost or heavy rainfalls will have an additive multiplicative or even compensatory impact on crop growth 3 how does atmospheric co2 and temperature interact with the effects of waterlogging increasing atmospheric co2 concentration due to climate change favors growth of c3 plants such as wheat and barley elevated co2 increases the rate of photosynthetic carbon dioxide uptake by leaves and reduces water loss via transpiration due to the regulation of stomatal opening taub 2010 however waterlogging limits root water conductivity causing stomatal closure and reducing co2 concentration within the leaves antagonizing co2 effects on crops else et al 2001 jitsuyama 2017 therefore it is necessary to investigate the combined effect of co2 and waterlogging on wheat growth to understand in what conditions the combination may have positive or negative impacts on crop growth photosynthetic activity and stomatal opening 4 what is the effect of partial waterlogging on crop growth waterlogging does not necessarily occur uniformly over the soil profile but depending on soil hydraulic properties and groundwater levels and dynamics are expected to lead to different effects on the dynamic plant growth and require a strong focus on the correct representation of soil hydraulic properties examples are that the water table may only strongly affect the deepest soil layers or instantaneous heavy rainfalls affecting only the shallowest soil layers waterlogging is generally transient rather than chronic and enduring to robustly capture such phenomena field experiments must reflect reality which could include partial wetting and drying in the season s with which waterlogging occurs typically winter and spring this also emphasizes the importance of continuous and spatially explicit measurement data from the experiments such experiments could be performed with sensors that measure soil moisture at different depths covering the entire root depth as well as visual crop responses e g through spectroscopy continuous measurements of photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance would also be helpful roots are the interface over which the crop perceives waterlogging thus root activity should also be measured when possible 5 how resilient are different cultivars a more systematic comparison of waterlogging responses across cultivars is required to understand the cultivars sensitivity to waterlogging and how different cultivar traits support the resilience of cultivars to waterlogging liu et al 2020b 6 what are the spatial implications of waterlogging severe waterlogging may have minor implications for field scale production if the extent of waterlogging at the field scale is minor spatio temporal quantification of waterlogging similar to the study conducted by chen et al 2021 at the field scale for pastures would be valuable as a research endeavor and in scaling the extent of waterlogging from the field to higher scales chen et al 2021 7 how does waterlogging affect the availability of plant nutrients waterlogging can lead to leaching of nutrients and altered biochemical processes reducing uptake rawnsley et al 2019 and associated greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrous oxide and methane 8 how soil waterlogging responses to engineering management practices across environments engineering practices such as drainage systems raised beds and controlled farming tillage are expected to alleviate the negative impacts of waterlogging on wheat plants manik et al 2019 conducting research to assess the efficacy of various management practices in diverse waterlogging environments can aid farmers and agronomists in making informed decisions about the most suitable engineering practices to adopt for their wheat production systems considering factors such as cost effectiveness feasibility and local environmental conditions future research on waterlogging proposed here should be done under controlled conditions such as a greenhouse and in the field but to better guide agricultural production practices field validation experiments are needed these experiments should be performed in fields with well described physical soil profiles such as small areas and survey pits soil moisture measurements in different soil depths are particularly important to improve the computation of waterlogged soils by csms we also encourage measurements of greenhouse gases from waterlogged soil as soil net greenhouse gas emissions tend to increase under these conditions liu et al 2011 the data resulted from these potential experiments should be strongly encouraged to be made available to the scientific community via cloud based repositories or open data journals only with open access to this cropping climate soil and management sowing date planting density fertilizer and irrigation amount and date data can be tested and used to improve csms we identified that about one third of the wheat csms consider the effects of waterlogging on simulated wheat growth fig 3 several multi model ensemble and model comparison studies such as those implemented under the agmip network rosenzweig et al 2013 have evaluated models for a range of crops and regions by comparing outputs with observed growth and yield data including responses to atmospheric co2 concentration temperature water shortage and water excess models embed different processes and when a range of models are compared using the same initialization and calibration data insights can be gained as to which models more closely reflect the observed data and why such results occur in this way deeper insight can be gained into processes that are necessary in simulating impacts of waterlogging in crops as well as those processes that are superfluous and could be simplified or removed completely in addition the uncertainty due to missing processes relevant for describing waterlogging and its impacts remains unclear these are topics that should be emphasized in future research which addresses crop simulation model development for improved representation of waterlogging moreover waterlogging should be included in crop simulation models especially those to forecast in season wheat yield in regions where waterlogging occurs or when assessing the impacts of climate change to reduce uncertainty in climate impact projections and their impact on future crop production crop models need to include the simulation the waterlogging and its impact on crop growth and yield with this cropping models will be able to give better indications of how to adapt to a future with more extremes arising from climate change due to the relevance of waterlogging impacts and the deficiencies identified in state of the art in waterlogging research this manuscript is a
