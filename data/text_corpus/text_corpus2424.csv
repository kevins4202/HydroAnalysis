12120,this study gives a first time comprehensive report on the quality of groundwater in emevor community in the niger delta region of nigeria for dry and wet season monitoring water samples were collected from ten 10 bore holes bhs and 10 hand dug wells hdws on monthly basis for eight 8 consecutive months spanning from may to august 2016 wet season and october 2016 to january 2017 dry season following standard procedures thirty three 33 water quality parameters were analyzed but for ph being less and ba higher than the prescribed values of the who and son all other physicochemical parameters were within the who and son standards while the low ph value was linked to mineral dissolution the high ba value was attributed to oil exploration activities in the area the main mineral classes in the aquifer calcium iron sodium magnesium and zinc potassium were found to be the determinants of the groundwater chemical composition and ionic exchanges anova showed a significant difference in the concentration of parameters that exceeded regulatory limits for bhs and hdws microorganisms isolated from the water samples obtained from bhs and hdws are enterobacter aerogenes and e coli the higher organic pollution recorded for the hdws corroborated the higher values of e coli obtained by implication this study shows that bhs were safer drinking water sources in the community regular monitoring of groundwater in emevor and neighbouring communities is recommended given the increase in anthropogenic activities in the area of study keywords groundwater quality parameters public health pollution niger delta 1 introduction one of the essential requirements for the sustenance of life and good health is water abubakar 2018a within the last two decades the world has recorded some achievements in the area of improvement of access to improved drinking water idw and hygiene in line with the sustainable development goals sdgs who unicef jmp report 2015 abubakar 2016 kulinkina et al 2014 idw source could be described as a source well protected from external contamination in particular faecal matter abubakar 2018b report has shown that globally more than 2 6 billion people gained access to idw sources since the 1990s mkwate et al 2017 this achievement notwithstanding access to idw is still a problem as about 663 million people in the world are yet to have access to idw sources mkwate et al 2017 this has made many people depend heavily on untreated water from private boreholes unprotected shallow wells streams rivers etc who unicef jmp 2015 while with a population of 319 million people as at 2015 only 24 of the people in sub saharan africa had access to improved drinking water idw latin america and caribbean west asia and north africa east asia and south east asia had theirs as 65 90 and 94 respectively abubakar 2018a b it is also worthy to note that 70 of the global population that depends on surface water for drinking reside in sub saharan bet unicef who 2015 p 11 while 723 million new users of piped water were recorded in the eastern part of asia between 1990 and 2015 a decline from 43 to 33 was obtained in the sub saharan african unicef who 2015 p 9 in nigeria 67 of the population were reported in 2015 to have had access to improved drinking water sources this was however still short of meeting with the 77 mdg goal and much less than the global mean of 91 unicef who 2015 p 9 the nigeria demographic and health surveys of 2013 showed that 50 8 rural and 14 4 urban of nigerian households used unimproved drinking water sources abubakar 2019 drinking of contaminated water alongside inadequate hygiene and poor sanitation has been indicted of being directly or indirectly the cause of over a million annual global deaths who 2012 it has also been reported that not less than eighty percent 80 of all water borne diseases in developing nations are traceable to drinking of contaminated water poor hygiene and open defecation abubakar 2018a b about 50 and one fifth of these people without access to improved drinking water sources in the world reside in sub saharan africa ssa and southern asia respectively mkwate et al 2017 recently countries in ssa were reported to have recorded some achievements as forty three percent of their population now have access to potable water this is however through private boreholes that are mostly not tested for quality who unicef jmp 2015 nigeria with it a 2017 estimated population of more than 190 million people is a notable nation in the sub saharan africa npc 2017 she however still has enormous challenges in the in the area of provision of idw given the near absence of treated public water supply scheme especially in the rural areas and small towns this has thus made a lot of people resident in nigerian depend on groundwater for drinking dahunsi et al 2014 though some groundwater drinking water quality studies have been carried out on mostly urban cities of nigeria with findings showing that many of the wells were contaminated with faecal bacteria and in some cases other pollutants owamah et al 2013 dahunsi et al 2014 sojobi 2016 such extensive drinking water quality studies cannot be said of rural communities that are even more prone to anthropogenic activities that create water contaminants such as open defecation careless disposal of waste materials on the soil open dumps unsanitary systems of sewage disposal siting of water wells near pit latrines and septic tanks etc sojobi 2016 furthermore nigeria in the last 20 years has witnessed an unprecedented growth in the number of individual boreholes but drinking water from these especially the ones in rural communities are rarely checked for quality compliance owamah et al 2013 detailed scientific information on the quality of groundwater used as source of drinking water is crucial for the formulation of policies relating to water supply and public health it is however noteworthy to state that only little or none of such about emevor community in the niger delta region of nigeria is available in scientific literature this research was therefore carried out to critically assess the quality status of groundwater in the study area to serve as baseline water quality data for the community and other isoko neighbouring communities with similar geological formation and anthropogenic activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area emevor is one of the popular communities in the isoko north local government area inlga delta state nigeria the siting of the national open university of nigeria study center in emevor has increased both her population and pressure on resources such as water fig 1 a shows that the inlga lies between 5 0 2 0 and 5 0 3 7 north latitudes and 6 0 1 2 and 6 0 1 3 east longitudes the map of nigeria showing delta state is also shown in fig 1b the inlga is made up of eight clans and a total of 43 communities with two unique climatic seasons the wet season ws runs from march through august while the dry season ds begins from september to end in february agbogidi et al 2007 the inlga with predominantly rainforest vegetation has a mean annual precipitation of 2800 mm monthly temperature of 31 c and relative humidity range of 76 90 owamah et al 2013 the inlga with a population of about 140 000 persons as at 2006 is well known as a major crude oil producing lga in nigeria owamah et al 2013 2 2 sampling and analysis following standard methods water samples were obtained in triplicate from randomly selected sites apha 2012 because emevor community has ten 10 small distinct villages water samples were collected from ten 10 bore holes bhs wells with electric pump and 10 hand dug wells hdws artificial pumpless wells on monthly basis for eight 8 consecutive months spanning from may to august 2016 wet season and october 2016 to january 2017 dry season as shown in fig 1a sojobi 2016 collection of samples was done in a manner that ensured that each of the ten small villages that make up the community had two wells bh and hdw sampled new polyethylene bottles washed three times on site with the same water to be sampled were used for samples collection preservation of samples was done in line with standard protocol apha 2012 samples for physico chemical and microbial investigations were placed in an ice containing box before being transported to dukoria laboratories nigeria for water quality analyses concentrated hno3 was used for the preservation of water samples meant for metal analysis thirty bh and hdw water samples were respectively obtained monthly to give 240 samples each of bhs and hdws 120 per climatic season samples were stored at 4 c using a refrigerator to ensure that contents remained intact prior to laboratory analyses 2 3 analytical procedures adopting standard protocol samples were analyzed for numerous physicochemical parameters emenike et al 2018 turbidity was measured in situ with a movable 2100p turbidimeter hach ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were determined with a movable multimeter hanna instruments model hi 9812 the concentrations of the other physicochemical parameters na ca mg k no3 cl no3 hco3 so4 2 fe ba cu pb ca etc were determined in the laboratory following apha 2012 and owamah et al 2013 anions were measured with an ultraviolet uv spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach usa through the uv spectrophotometer screening method the analysis of the concentration of metals was done using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas sens aa 3000 gbc australia in accordance with procedures outlined in apha 2012 the estimation of the faecal coliforms fc bacteria was through the use of the membrane filtration technique apha 2012 standard plate count method was adopted to count the bacterial colonies that are visible in colony forming units cfu 100 ml the other physiochemical parameters were measured in accordance with standard methods outlined in apha 2012 and khan et al 2013 the mean of data gotten for the various physicochemical and biological parameters were compared with the drinking water standard of the who and son the correlational relationships among the parameters tested were also investigated for reproducibility sake blank pre analyzed and standard samples were analyzed after every ten 10 samples owamah et al 2013 2 4 statistical analysis in situ and laboratory data obtained were analyzed with microsoft excel 2010 version to compute mean standard deviation sd and correlation coefficient cc sojobi 2016 the mean groups of variables were compared using the analysis of variance anova at 95 confidence level patterns among the result variables were shown in graphs and tables emenike et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical and microbiological parameters the statistics of the experimental data obtained from this study are displayed in tables 1 and 2 for wet and dry seasons respectively ph values ranged from 4 92 to 6 28 and 6 50 to 4 82 for the wet and dry seasons respectively average values were 5 63 wet and 5 55 dry to give a seasonal mean variation of 0 08 greater values were recorded in the peak of the ws this could be attributed to dilution effect as water level rose thereby making the ph move from slightly acidic toward neutral in both seasons while the bh water samples were generally more acidic than those of the hdws the most acidic values were obtained from bh samples of ds fig 2 a the highest ph value 6 50 was obtained in a sample collected from a hdw in november these ph values corroborate information in literature on the groundwater quality of communities in the niger delta region of nigeria owamah et al 2013 since the stipulated ph range of the who and son goes from 6 50 to 8 50 table 3 it shows that groundwater in the community is generally acidic and needs to be given some chemical treatment to bring it to normal ph of less than 6 5 could cause gastrointestinal irritation in humans and would therefore require alkaline treatment for improvement to the required range of 6 5 8 5 sojobi 2016 the acidic nature of groundwater in the area of study could be linked to the geological formation of the area owamah et al 2013 egboh and emeshili 2008 sojobi 2016 and akinyemi and souley 2014 had earlier reported acidic ph values 6 5 for the groundwater of omu aran kwara state and ogun state of nigeria respectively the tds of the study area groundwater showed average values of 41 93 mg l ws and 40 65 mg l ds seasonal mean variation value of 1 28 mg l wet dry was also obtained actual values ranged from 33 00 53 70 mg l in the ws and 32 80 49 00 mg l in the dry season the highest ws and ds values were respectively recorded in october and december bh water samples generally had higher tds values than those of hdws showing that it is more of natural than anthropogenic cause the who and son prescribed maximum tds value of 250 mg l table 3 is well above the values obtained in the study since the mean tds values for the bh and hdw water samples for both seasons are less than 1gl 1 it shows that groundwater in emevor is freshwater sojobi 2016 emenike et al 2018 though the son and who stipulated limit is 5 00 ntu turbidity was not detected in any of the samples this could be very deceptive if used by the residents to consider their groundwater water clean and safe akhtar et al 2014 electrical conductivity ec being a function of dissolved mineral matter has a direct relationship with tds for the wet and dry seasons the average ec values obtained were 77 21 μs cm and 78 92 μs cm respectively and had 1 71 μs cm as the seasonal mean variation as shown in fig 2c the highest conductivity value of 98 55 μs cm was found in a bh water sample of ds in the month of december this value is within the who prescribed limit of 1000 μs cm the mean ec values of 77 21 μs cm and 78 92 μs cm further show that the groundwater is freshwater since both mean values are less than 1500 μs cm mondal et al 2008 sojobi 2016 conductivity is a function of the total ionic composition of water and thus shows its level of chemical richness it is usually boosted by sodium magnesium calcium other minerals and the geology of the soil the electrical conductivity of natural waters is mainly due to dissolved mineral matter ademoroti 1996 tables 1 and 2 show that emevor groundwater is not saline as salinity was not detected in all of the samples for both wet and dry seasons the maximum acceptable limit is however 200 table 3 while the mean value of tss in the ws is 0 38 mg l it was not detected in the ds for all samples only few samples showed results for tss and this corroborates the finding in this study that turbidity was not detected in all of the water samples the presence of suspended solids in water affects the clarity of the water and makes it unaesthetic though there is no guideline limit stipulated for tss by the who and son previous studies showed that tss of 1000 mg l is acceptable sojobi 2016 the alkalinity values of the groundwater were found to be on the average of 8 50 mg l and 6 73 mg l in the ws and ds respectively to give a mean seasonal variation of 1 77 mg l similar values were earlier obtained by egboh and emeshie 2008 for groundwater in the neighbouring ndokwa east local government area alkalinity was only not detected in samples with low ph values there was no distinct pattern of seasonal variation as the presence of alkalinity depends on ph of solution however the overall values were relatively higher in the hdw samples of the ws as shown in tables 1 and 2 although there are no regulatory guideline values for alkalinity by the who and son values obtained in this study lie within the safe limits in literature dahunsi et al 2014 chemical oxygen demand cod is a measure of the required oxygen for complete oxidation of carbon iv oxide and organic matter present in a sample of water tables 1 and 2 show that cod was only slightly detected the seasonal mean values were 1 62 mg l ws and 2 28 mg l ds this resulted in a negative seasonal mean variation of 0 66 mg l indicative of higher cod values in the dry season these mean values are less than the maximum desired value of 5 mg l by the who and hence in order for the case of ammonia nitrogen though no value was detected in the wet season some samples in the ds had variable values the seasonal mean value calculated for the ds was 2 41 mg l the major sources of ammonia in groundwater could be excessive availability of nitrogen in the soil following indiscriminate disposal of nitrogen reach organic substances on the soil the desired level of nh3 n in drinking water is 0 5 mg l son 2007 water with higher values need to be treated chemically to acceptable limit the measurement of colour and appearance are important indices in ascertaining the aesthetic acceptability of potable water pure water is usually colourless and insipid colour was not detected in all the samples while total organic carbon toc was not detected in many of the ws water samples values obtained in the ds ranged from 0 01 to 0 80 the ds mean value is 0 28 in the same vein total hydrocarbon was not detected in most of the samples for both seasons the ds however had a mean value of 0 01 mg l odour calculated as threshold odour intensity number ton was not detected in any of the samples analyzed ideally drinking water should not have any detectable odour odour in drinking water usually shows that pollution had occurred in the water source total hardness defined in terms of the total concentration of calcium and magnesium ions expressed as calcium carbonate showed seasonal mean values of 15 63 mg l wet and 10 75 mg l dry with a variation of 4 88 mg l the peak and least values of 25 00 mg l and 8 00 mg l were obtained from hdws in the months of august and february respectively the values obtained are far lower than the who and son guideline values table 3 furthermore since the mean values are less than 50 00 mg l the groundwater is classified as soft water owamah et al 2013 abd el salam and abu zuid 2015 ejoh et al 2018 also found water from egini and ubogo rivers in the niger delta region of nigeria to be soft water hardness poses no real health threat but may result in soap wastage there were no values of total phosphorous in the ws unlike the ds that had considerably low values from few samples collected from the hdws the ds mean value calculated is 0 02 mg l phosphorous compounds occur in natural water effluent and sludge almost entirely in phosphate forms ademoroti 1996 phosphate in drinking water of 75 mg l has been reported to pose no health risk in drinking water owamah et al 2013 the obtained values in this study therefore show that phosphorous has no health related impact on the groundwater of the study area the detection of phosphorous at an insignificant level unlike the nitrogen related contaminants shows that wastewater effluent and other solid waste from the community could be mainly nitrogenous sojobi 2016 obtained mean phosphate values of 14 27 mg l and 15 6 mg l respectively for bhs and hdws of omu aran kwara state nigeria values of 27 5 0 9 mg l and 6 8 18 8 mg l were obtained for boreholes in different cities of northeastern nigeria and were linked to domestic effluent fertilizer and open defecation ishaku et al 2011 hco3 was not detected in many samples of the wet season the seasonal mean values are 10 37 mg l wet and 3 30 mg l dry with a seasonal mean variation of 7 07 mg l the values of the sd show that the variation pattern for rainy and dry seasons were random and suggestive of being caused by anthropogenic activities sojobi 2016 the seasonal mean values obtained for chloride are 5 50 mg l and 13 63 mg l for dry and wet seasons respectively the highest was obtained in the ws from a hdw water sample in the month of october egboh and emeshie 2008 also found greater levels of chloride in the ws for communities in the neighbouring ndokwa east local government area of delta state similar values were also reported for several neighbouring communities by owamah et al 2013 the presence of large concentration of chloride in water could be as a result of natural processes like the passage of water through salty hydrogeological formations or pollution from sea water intrusion the values obtained as shown in tables 1 and 2 are below the maximum guideline value of 200 00 mg l stipulated by the son the mean nitrate no3 values obtained in this study are 2 88 mg l and 3 03 mg l for bh and hdw water samples respectively a higher nitrate 0 02 42 45 mg l was obtained by devic et al 2014 and they attributed it to the activities of the residents ingestion of no3 above permissible limits could cause methemoglobinemia in kids emenike et al 2018 and in some cases cancer sojobi 2016 values of nitrate concentration recorded for the study area are below the son permissible limit of 50 mg l and who limit of 10 mg l for both seasons and water wells and therefore portends no health risk to residents of the community sulphate so4 2 obtained in the groundwater samples ranged from 1 50 mg l to 5 00 mg l in the ws and 2 00 mg l to 12 00 mg l in the ds the seasonal mean values are 3 24 mg l ws and 6 63 mg l ds with a variation of 3 39 mg l higher values were obtained in the ds from bh water samples sulphate is one of the least toxic ions but cathartic problems could be experienced by people when ingested at concentration of 600 00 mg l and above taking in of excess sulphate has also been reported to have caused dehydration the values of so4 2 obtained in this study are below the maximum permissible values of 500 and 100 00 mg l stipulated by who and son respectively for do seasonal mean values obtained are 10 38 mg l wet and 10 00 mg l dry with a mean seasonal variation of 0 38 mg l actual values obtained ranged from 8 00 to 12 00 mg l in both seasons borehole and hdw water samples had mean do values of 9 8 mg l and do 9 1 mg l respectively these are all above the minimum son and who recommendations of 7 5 mg l and 4 mg l respectively and hence in order the bod5 values ranged from 4 00 to 6 80 mg l in the ws and 3 00 6 00 mg l in the ds seasonal average values are 4 83 mg l ws and 4 78 mg l ds with a seasonal mean variation of 0 05 mg l according to owamah et al 2013 the highest allowable bod5 value is 6 00 mg l greater values indicate organic pollution the hdw water samples were found to have higher mean bod5 of 5 22 mg l in comparison with mean value of 4 60 mg l from bh water samples this indicates the occurrence of higher organic pollution in hdws than bhs the observed higher organic pollution of the hdw water samples could be attributed to nearness to septic tanks and poor design and construction of the hdws unsealed wells and wells without caps etc in the community the later could contaminate groundwater as it enables polluted surface water to reach the groundwater without filtration by the soil 3 2 microbial contamination the higher organic pollution obtained from the hdw water samples as noticed by its higher bod5 values corroborates the values of e coli obtained from water samples of the boreholes and hdws samples from the hdws had higher mean e coli value of 228 44 cfu ml than bhs with mean value of 180 56 cfu ml hdw water samples also had a mean total coliform count of 2 65 cfu ml which is again greater than the mean value of 0 94 cfu ml obtained from bh water samples the values recorded for total coliform count 100 ml sample revealed seasonal mean values of 0 38 cfu ml ws and 3 30 cfu ml ds the actual values ranged from 0 00 cfu ml to 1 80 cfu ml in the ws and 1 00 cfu ml to 5 76 cfu ml in the ds while greater values were gotten from the hdw samples of dry season the bh water samples had the least count the highest value of 5 76 cfu ml was found in a hdw water sample in the ds of january the who standard is zero count per 100 ml and therefore implies that groundwater of the study area is slightly contaminated with fecal matter and need to be treated chemically or by simple boiling microorganisms isolated from the water samples obtained from bhs and hdws are enterobacter aerogenes and e coli the presence of these microorganisms in the water samples whether pathogenic or non pathogenic provides a warning signal that the water should be treated before being used abubakar 2018a b ugochukwu and ojike 2019 these organisms are typically found in the intestinal tract of animals and humans grains plant surfaces and feces thakur et al 2012 sojobi 2016 the detection of these organisms in the sampled bh and hdw water samples shows that the groundwater would have had contact with the feces of man and or animals mackie et al 2006 agbabiaka and sule 2010 found e aerogenes in the borehole water samples of ilorin metropolis kwara state and attributed it to unsanitary surroundings of the water wells animal litter and fowl droppings sojobi 2016 recorded similar finding in his study of groundwater in omu aran kwara state the study attributed the bacterial contamination to droppings from sheep and goat litter in the community and the closeness of septic tanks to water wells this is also the situation in emevor community where goat and poultry litters is easily seen poorly constructed water wells are in some cases sited close to poorly constructed septic tanks majority of the bhs are also shallow okiki and ivbijaro 2013 and thakur et al 2012 had earlier reported the presence of e aerogenes in the water samples of hdws and boreholes in imota lagos nigeria and sloan pradesh jacinta and adebayo 2015 found e coli and e aerogenes in the boreholes and hdws of gwagwalada area of abuja nigeria though mackie et al 2006 reported that e aerogenes do not cause diseases in healthy persons sojobi 2016 revealed that they are of considerable health risks to man given their resistance to common antibiotics furthermore olufemi and oluwole 2012 had noted that e coli and e aerogenes caused the last cholera outbreak in ibadan nigeria while there was no detection of fungi in all the water samples of hdws and bhs spore forming yeasts were detected yeast contamination of groundwater resource had been reported in umudike benin city calabar and jos sojobi 2016 it is advisable for residents of emevor community to treat their groundwater before consumption in order to prevent the outbreak of water borne diseases in the community as the presence of these microorganisms in the water samples is a warning signal uzochukwu and chibike 2018 though anova test revealed no significant difference p 0 05 between the physico chemical parameters of bh and hdw water samples it indicated that there was a significant difference between the microbial parameters there was also no significant difference p 0 05 in the seasonal variation of the physical and chemical factors obtained it can therefore be said that though the geological formation in the community is similar the aquifers through different anthropogenic activities now have different microbiological properties this is evidenced by the fact that the bh and hdws were found to have different levels of bacterial contamination even when some were located close to each other 3 3 metals the major cations studied in this research are sodium na potassium k magnesium mg and calcium ca results obtained show that the most abundant of the cations is sodium with the highest concentration value of 18 99 mg l followed by calcium with the value of 18 00 mg l magnesium 7 80 mg l and potassium 13 01 mg l as found in the water samples collected from bhs in the wet season the seasonal mean values of the cations wet dry are 14 49 mg l 13 92 mg l 6 89mg l 6 52 mg l 10 50mg l 5 76 mg l and 11 62mg l 5 30 mg l for sodium potassium magnesium and calcium respectively this showed that the distribution of cations concentration decreased from ws to ds the observed values are within acceptable who son limits except for potassium which exceeded the threshold limit value of 2 mg l k is usually not a serious health related parameter in drinking water quality studies the other metals studied in this research include lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn copper cu iron fe and barium ba tables 1 and 2 contain the mean standard deviation and range of the metals concentrations the bhs in the ws had a relative abundance for cations na ca mg k ba zn cu fe and anions cl so4 2 no3 hco3 the hdws however had a relative abundance of na ca mg k ba zn cu fe for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for anions for the dry season the boreholes had a relative abundance of na k mg ca zn ba cu fe for cations and cl so4 2 no3 hco3 for anions the hdws however had it as na ca mg k ba cu fe zn and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 for cations and anions respectively this finding is unlike the relative cations and anions abundance obtained by devic et al 2014 which were ca mg na k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 respectively sojobi 2016 also obtained different cations and anions relative abundance of na k ca mg zn pb and cl po4 2 so4 2 no3 respectively in the bhs and cations ca na k mg pb and anions no3 po4 2 so4 2 cl in the shallow wells of omu aran groundwater kwara state nigeria mean na concentration of 12 67 mg l boreholes and 13 82 mg l hdws obtained are less tha the son and who stipulated maximum value of 200 mg l todd 1980 reported that sodium could cause corrosion and formation of scale in boilers high sodium concentration in water can be suggestive of strong water aquifer interaction due to exchange of cations and or anthropogenic activities like wastewater disposal sojobi 2016 for mg the mean concentration values are 10 25 mg l for bhs and 5 12 mg l for hdws though these mean values exceeded the son prescribed maximum value of 0 2 mg l they are below the who maximum limit of 200 mg l the relative high mg value can be associated with the presence of basalts kaolinite and hematite in the geological formation of the study area owamah et al 2013 trostle et al 2014 values obtained in this study corroborate the finding of nwankwoala et al 2014 of mean mg value of 0 89 mg l for boreholes in yenagoa in the same niger delta region of nigeria like the study area nwankwoala et al 2014 linked the presence of the high mg to dissolution of minerals like feldspar and mica anthony et al 2008 had reported of extreme high concentrations of 68 173 mg l for groundwater in manali india high magnesium concentration in the groundwater of serbia was attributed to domestic effluents chemical fertilizers and minerals devic et al 2014 though mean ca values of 8 65 mg l bhs and 12 82 mg l hdws were less than the 49 3 mg l of viswanath et al 2015 they are higher than the 2 97 mg l for neighbouring yenagoa bayesa state nigeria as obtained by nwankwoala et al 2014 this suggests that coastal areas may be prone to having lower calcium values in their groundwater possibly due to the effects of dilution since the who permissible limit is 200 mg l the mean ca concentration values obtained in this study for both bhs and hdws are compliant the presence of ca in the groundwater of communities in the niger delta region of nigeria had been attributed by nwankwoala et al 2014 to feldspars and micas dissolution in the groundwater kim et al 2015 however reported that ca in groundwater could be as a result of the release of carbonate minerals in the course of the dissolution of silicate compounds the mean k values in the hdw and borehole water samples are 6 82 mg l and 5 52 mg l respectively and are above the mean values of 4 9 mg l and 0 91 mg l recorded respectively by ishaku et al 2011 and trostle et al 2014 for the other metals studied as displayed in tables 1 and 2 the highest concentration of 1 90 mg l was recorded for barium in the month of october in a sample collected from a hdw lead and cadmium had the least concentration pb was only slightly detected with a value of 0 01 mg l in just one sample of the wet season it was neither detected in the bh or hdw water samples of the dry season nor had measurable overall seasonal mean values for wet and dry seasons lead is therefore not of health concern in the groundwater of the community oni and hassan 2013 found elevated pb concentration in groundwater samples of wells close to a landfill and reported that pb in groundwater could be linked to improper disposal of pb containing domestic waste substances within the surrounding of water wells especially when there is absence of industrial activities pb can lead to subencelophalopathic disorders sojobi 2016 cadmium was not detected in the ws and ds for the bh and hdw samples zinc concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 1 00 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 0 12 mg l in the ds the overall seasonal mean values are 0 16 mg l in the ws and 0 04 mg l in the ds for copper the concentrations ranged from 0 001 to 0 09 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 0 20 mg l in the ds with seasonal mean values of 0 14 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively iron concentration values ranged from 0 001 to 0 06 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 0 05 mg l in the ds with seasonal mean values of 0 03 mg l and 0 03 mg l for wet and dry seasons respectively lastly barium had values ranging from 0 88 to 1 90 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 1 88 mg l in the ds the overall seasonal mean values for barium are 1 16 mg l for the ws and 0 58 mg l for the ds apart from barium the other metals tested had seasonal mean values that complied with the who son limit for potable water table 3 as shown in fig 2b ba was higher in the ws for both bhs and hdws this could be attributable to greater dissolution of barium containing minerals during the rains 4 correlation analysis of the physicochemical parameters studied in accordance with the work of sojobi 2016 the correlation classes adopted for the study are perfect r2 1 very strong 0 9 r2 1 strong 0 7 r2 0 9 moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 and weak r2 0 5 from table 4 by correlation coefficients cc the main cations influencing the presence and concentration of tds in the groundwater were identified as ca 0 99 mg 0 99 ba 0 99 fe 0 98 na 0 95 and k 0 85 tds was also very strongly correlated with bod5 0 89 no3 0 84 tss 0 86 and perfectly with dissolved oxygen do 0 97 these results are in accordance with the findings of emenike et al 2018 sojobi 2016 and viswanath et al 2015 in which ca was reported to be an influential factor for the estimation of tds in groundwater table 4 also shows that the notable mineral classes influencing the tds and ec in the study area groundwater are mg ca 0 98 ca fe class 0 98 na k 0 97 and na mg class 0 96 no3 was associated with mg ca group with cc 0 91 0 85 respectively mg and ca were found to have no correlation with cl following the finding of skrzypek et al 2013 the presence of mg2 and ca2 in the groundwater may be associated with other anions the strong cc of 0 98 between magnesium and calcium reflects huge mutual dependence and same anthropogenic sources devic et al 2014 emenike et al 2018 no3 has perfect cc with cd 0 98 and mg 0 91 and very strong cc with ba 0 84 showing that it could have come from anthropogenic activities such as the release of domestic wastewater on the environment table 4 reveals that affinity reactions and ionic exchanges were occurring in the hydrogeological formation of the area of study sojobi 2016 emenike et al 2018 while cl and so4 2 had strong preferential affinity for the anions and cations no3 was perfectly correlated with mg 0 91 and cd 0 98 when an aquifer is rich in magnesium it will allow its dissolution into it this notwithstanding majority of the anions that make up the aquifer minerals may not prefer the dissolved mg and hence may be the cause of the high mg concentration in the bh and hdw samples sojobi 2016 emenike et al 2018 reported that groundwater chemistry is mainly affected by the dissolution of minerals and the activities of man ph and ec were respectively found to be perfectly 0 96 and very strongly 0 90 correlated with so4 2 electrical conductivity correlated weakly with do iron no3 ca and bod5 showing that the mentioned physicochemical factors may not be appropriate for the estimation of ec in the study area groundwater this is however different from the report of sojobi 2016 for omu aran groundwater in kwara state nigeria table 5 gives a brief of the different groundwater contaminants and their related health effects it also shows that ground water pollutants vary from location to location as a result of differences in geological formations and anthropogenic activities table 6 however compares the results obtained from different previous authors about groundwater quality in different locations of the world with the findings of this study it can be seen from table 6 that quality of groundwater in the study area is relatively safer and cleaner than lots of other groundwater studied in the past however in line with the sdg 6 1 goal of achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 the study area needs urgent attention as bacterial and barium contamination found could have adverse health effects on the community dwellers especially on children and the aged 5 conclusion a detailed evaluation of the quality of groundwater in emevor community of the niger delta region of nigeria was carried out the groundwater was found to be mainly contaminated with coliform bacteria and slightly with ba entero bacteriaceae and escherichia coli species were also found in the water samples most especially the hdws the presence of coliform bacteria in the groundwater samples was linked to the nearness of hdws and bhs to pit latrines poorly constructed septic tanks and presence of many open dumps in the community the ba contamination was linked to oil explorations and processing activities in the region geological formation and careless disposal of electronic wastes the study recommends the development of modern sanitary systems in the community and public awareness by the supervising ministry and relevant non governmental organizations though huge priorities should be given to the provision of improved water to the people by government in the interim improvement of water quality at household level through chlorination addition of alum filtration solar disinfection and boiling is advised this study has been able to generate a broad water quality database for the study area which could help engineer future water project development in the region acknowledgement

12120,this study gives a first time comprehensive report on the quality of groundwater in emevor community in the niger delta region of nigeria for dry and wet season monitoring water samples were collected from ten 10 bore holes bhs and 10 hand dug wells hdws on monthly basis for eight 8 consecutive months spanning from may to august 2016 wet season and october 2016 to january 2017 dry season following standard procedures thirty three 33 water quality parameters were analyzed but for ph being less and ba higher than the prescribed values of the who and son all other physicochemical parameters were within the who and son standards while the low ph value was linked to mineral dissolution the high ba value was attributed to oil exploration activities in the area the main mineral classes in the aquifer calcium iron sodium magnesium and zinc potassium were found to be the determinants of the groundwater chemical composition and ionic exchanges anova showed a significant difference in the concentration of parameters that exceeded regulatory limits for bhs and hdws microorganisms isolated from the water samples obtained from bhs and hdws are enterobacter aerogenes and e coli the higher organic pollution recorded for the hdws corroborated the higher values of e coli obtained by implication this study shows that bhs were safer drinking water sources in the community regular monitoring of groundwater in emevor and neighbouring communities is recommended given the increase in anthropogenic activities in the area of study keywords groundwater quality parameters public health pollution niger delta 1 introduction one of the essential requirements for the sustenance of life and good health is water abubakar 2018a within the last two decades the world has recorded some achievements in the area of improvement of access to improved drinking water idw and hygiene in line with the sustainable development goals sdgs who unicef jmp report 2015 abubakar 2016 kulinkina et al 2014 idw source could be described as a source well protected from external contamination in particular faecal matter abubakar 2018b report has shown that globally more than 2 6 billion people gained access to idw sources since the 1990s mkwate et al 2017 this achievement notwithstanding access to idw is still a problem as about 663 million people in the world are yet to have access to idw sources mkwate et al 2017 this has made many people depend heavily on untreated water from private boreholes unprotected shallow wells streams rivers etc who unicef jmp 2015 while with a population of 319 million people as at 2015 only 24 of the people in sub saharan africa had access to improved drinking water idw latin america and caribbean west asia and north africa east asia and south east asia had theirs as 65 90 and 94 respectively abubakar 2018a b it is also worthy to note that 70 of the global population that depends on surface water for drinking reside in sub saharan bet unicef who 2015 p 11 while 723 million new users of piped water were recorded in the eastern part of asia between 1990 and 2015 a decline from 43 to 33 was obtained in the sub saharan african unicef who 2015 p 9 in nigeria 67 of the population were reported in 2015 to have had access to improved drinking water sources this was however still short of meeting with the 77 mdg goal and much less than the global mean of 91 unicef who 2015 p 9 the nigeria demographic and health surveys of 2013 showed that 50 8 rural and 14 4 urban of nigerian households used unimproved drinking water sources abubakar 2019 drinking of contaminated water alongside inadequate hygiene and poor sanitation has been indicted of being directly or indirectly the cause of over a million annual global deaths who 2012 it has also been reported that not less than eighty percent 80 of all water borne diseases in developing nations are traceable to drinking of contaminated water poor hygiene and open defecation abubakar 2018a b about 50 and one fifth of these people without access to improved drinking water sources in the world reside in sub saharan africa ssa and southern asia respectively mkwate et al 2017 recently countries in ssa were reported to have recorded some achievements as forty three percent of their population now have access to potable water this is however through private boreholes that are mostly not tested for quality who unicef jmp 2015 nigeria with it a 2017 estimated population of more than 190 million people is a notable nation in the sub saharan africa npc 2017 she however still has enormous challenges in the in the area of provision of idw given the near absence of treated public water supply scheme especially in the rural areas and small towns this has thus made a lot of people resident in nigerian depend on groundwater for drinking dahunsi et al 2014 though some groundwater drinking water quality studies have been carried out on mostly urban cities of nigeria with findings showing that many of the wells were contaminated with faecal bacteria and in some cases other pollutants owamah et al 2013 dahunsi et al 2014 sojobi 2016 such extensive drinking water quality studies cannot be said of rural communities that are even more prone to anthropogenic activities that create water contaminants such as open defecation careless disposal of waste materials on the soil open dumps unsanitary systems of sewage disposal siting of water wells near pit latrines and septic tanks etc sojobi 2016 furthermore nigeria in the last 20 years has witnessed an unprecedented growth in the number of individual boreholes but drinking water from these especially the ones in rural communities are rarely checked for quality compliance owamah et al 2013 detailed scientific information on the quality of groundwater used as source of drinking water is crucial for the formulation of policies relating to water supply and public health it is however noteworthy to state that only little or none of such about emevor community in the niger delta region of nigeria is available in scientific literature this research was therefore carried out to critically assess the quality status of groundwater in the study area to serve as baseline water quality data for the community and other isoko neighbouring communities with similar geological formation and anthropogenic activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area emevor is one of the popular communities in the isoko north local government area inlga delta state nigeria the siting of the national open university of nigeria study center in emevor has increased both her population and pressure on resources such as water fig 1 a shows that the inlga lies between 5 0 2 0 and 5 0 3 7 north latitudes and 6 0 1 2 and 6 0 1 3 east longitudes the map of nigeria showing delta state is also shown in fig 1b the inlga is made up of eight clans and a total of 43 communities with two unique climatic seasons the wet season ws runs from march through august while the dry season ds begins from september to end in february agbogidi et al 2007 the inlga with predominantly rainforest vegetation has a mean annual precipitation of 2800 mm monthly temperature of 31 c and relative humidity range of 76 90 owamah et al 2013 the inlga with a population of about 140 000 persons as at 2006 is well known as a major crude oil producing lga in nigeria owamah et al 2013 2 2 sampling and analysis following standard methods water samples were obtained in triplicate from randomly selected sites apha 2012 because emevor community has ten 10 small distinct villages water samples were collected from ten 10 bore holes bhs wells with electric pump and 10 hand dug wells hdws artificial pumpless wells on monthly basis for eight 8 consecutive months spanning from may to august 2016 wet season and october 2016 to january 2017 dry season as shown in fig 1a sojobi 2016 collection of samples was done in a manner that ensured that each of the ten small villages that make up the community had two wells bh and hdw sampled new polyethylene bottles washed three times on site with the same water to be sampled were used for samples collection preservation of samples was done in line with standard protocol apha 2012 samples for physico chemical and microbial investigations were placed in an ice containing box before being transported to dukoria laboratories nigeria for water quality analyses concentrated hno3 was used for the preservation of water samples meant for metal analysis thirty bh and hdw water samples were respectively obtained monthly to give 240 samples each of bhs and hdws 120 per climatic season samples were stored at 4 c using a refrigerator to ensure that contents remained intact prior to laboratory analyses 2 3 analytical procedures adopting standard protocol samples were analyzed for numerous physicochemical parameters emenike et al 2018 turbidity was measured in situ with a movable 2100p turbidimeter hach ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were determined with a movable multimeter hanna instruments model hi 9812 the concentrations of the other physicochemical parameters na ca mg k no3 cl no3 hco3 so4 2 fe ba cu pb ca etc were determined in the laboratory following apha 2012 and owamah et al 2013 anions were measured with an ultraviolet uv spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach usa through the uv spectrophotometer screening method the analysis of the concentration of metals was done using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas sens aa 3000 gbc australia in accordance with procedures outlined in apha 2012 the estimation of the faecal coliforms fc bacteria was through the use of the membrane filtration technique apha 2012 standard plate count method was adopted to count the bacterial colonies that are visible in colony forming units cfu 100 ml the other physiochemical parameters were measured in accordance with standard methods outlined in apha 2012 and khan et al 2013 the mean of data gotten for the various physicochemical and biological parameters were compared with the drinking water standard of the who and son the correlational relationships among the parameters tested were also investigated for reproducibility sake blank pre analyzed and standard samples were analyzed after every ten 10 samples owamah et al 2013 2 4 statistical analysis in situ and laboratory data obtained were analyzed with microsoft excel 2010 version to compute mean standard deviation sd and correlation coefficient cc sojobi 2016 the mean groups of variables were compared using the analysis of variance anova at 95 confidence level patterns among the result variables were shown in graphs and tables emenike et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical and microbiological parameters the statistics of the experimental data obtained from this study are displayed in tables 1 and 2 for wet and dry seasons respectively ph values ranged from 4 92 to 6 28 and 6 50 to 4 82 for the wet and dry seasons respectively average values were 5 63 wet and 5 55 dry to give a seasonal mean variation of 0 08 greater values were recorded in the peak of the ws this could be attributed to dilution effect as water level rose thereby making the ph move from slightly acidic toward neutral in both seasons while the bh water samples were generally more acidic than those of the hdws the most acidic values were obtained from bh samples of ds fig 2 a the highest ph value 6 50 was obtained in a sample collected from a hdw in november these ph values corroborate information in literature on the groundwater quality of communities in the niger delta region of nigeria owamah et al 2013 since the stipulated ph range of the who and son goes from 6 50 to 8 50 table 3 it shows that groundwater in the community is generally acidic and needs to be given some chemical treatment to bring it to normal ph of less than 6 5 could cause gastrointestinal irritation in humans and would therefore require alkaline treatment for improvement to the required range of 6 5 8 5 sojobi 2016 the acidic nature of groundwater in the area of study could be linked to the geological formation of the area owamah et al 2013 egboh and emeshili 2008 sojobi 2016 and akinyemi and souley 2014 had earlier reported acidic ph values 6 5 for the groundwater of omu aran kwara state and ogun state of nigeria respectively the tds of the study area groundwater showed average values of 41 93 mg l ws and 40 65 mg l ds seasonal mean variation value of 1 28 mg l wet dry was also obtained actual values ranged from 33 00 53 70 mg l in the ws and 32 80 49 00 mg l in the dry season the highest ws and ds values were respectively recorded in october and december bh water samples generally had higher tds values than those of hdws showing that it is more of natural than anthropogenic cause the who and son prescribed maximum tds value of 250 mg l table 3 is well above the values obtained in the study since the mean tds values for the bh and hdw water samples for both seasons are less than 1gl 1 it shows that groundwater in emevor is freshwater sojobi 2016 emenike et al 2018 though the son and who stipulated limit is 5 00 ntu turbidity was not detected in any of the samples this could be very deceptive if used by the residents to consider their groundwater water clean and safe akhtar et al 2014 electrical conductivity ec being a function of dissolved mineral matter has a direct relationship with tds for the wet and dry seasons the average ec values obtained were 77 21 μs cm and 78 92 μs cm respectively and had 1 71 μs cm as the seasonal mean variation as shown in fig 2c the highest conductivity value of 98 55 μs cm was found in a bh water sample of ds in the month of december this value is within the who prescribed limit of 1000 μs cm the mean ec values of 77 21 μs cm and 78 92 μs cm further show that the groundwater is freshwater since both mean values are less than 1500 μs cm mondal et al 2008 sojobi 2016 conductivity is a function of the total ionic composition of water and thus shows its level of chemical richness it is usually boosted by sodium magnesium calcium other minerals and the geology of the soil the electrical conductivity of natural waters is mainly due to dissolved mineral matter ademoroti 1996 tables 1 and 2 show that emevor groundwater is not saline as salinity was not detected in all of the samples for both wet and dry seasons the maximum acceptable limit is however 200 table 3 while the mean value of tss in the ws is 0 38 mg l it was not detected in the ds for all samples only few samples showed results for tss and this corroborates the finding in this study that turbidity was not detected in all of the water samples the presence of suspended solids in water affects the clarity of the water and makes it unaesthetic though there is no guideline limit stipulated for tss by the who and son previous studies showed that tss of 1000 mg l is acceptable sojobi 2016 the alkalinity values of the groundwater were found to be on the average of 8 50 mg l and 6 73 mg l in the ws and ds respectively to give a mean seasonal variation of 1 77 mg l similar values were earlier obtained by egboh and emeshie 2008 for groundwater in the neighbouring ndokwa east local government area alkalinity was only not detected in samples with low ph values there was no distinct pattern of seasonal variation as the presence of alkalinity depends on ph of solution however the overall values were relatively higher in the hdw samples of the ws as shown in tables 1 and 2 although there are no regulatory guideline values for alkalinity by the who and son values obtained in this study lie within the safe limits in literature dahunsi et al 2014 chemical oxygen demand cod is a measure of the required oxygen for complete oxidation of carbon iv oxide and organic matter present in a sample of water tables 1 and 2 show that cod was only slightly detected the seasonal mean values were 1 62 mg l ws and 2 28 mg l ds this resulted in a negative seasonal mean variation of 0 66 mg l indicative of higher cod values in the dry season these mean values are less than the maximum desired value of 5 mg l by the who and hence in order for the case of ammonia nitrogen though no value was detected in the wet season some samples in the ds had variable values the seasonal mean value calculated for the ds was 2 41 mg l the major sources of ammonia in groundwater could be excessive availability of nitrogen in the soil following indiscriminate disposal of nitrogen reach organic substances on the soil the desired level of nh3 n in drinking water is 0 5 mg l son 2007 water with higher values need to be treated chemically to acceptable limit the measurement of colour and appearance are important indices in ascertaining the aesthetic acceptability of potable water pure water is usually colourless and insipid colour was not detected in all the samples while total organic carbon toc was not detected in many of the ws water samples values obtained in the ds ranged from 0 01 to 0 80 the ds mean value is 0 28 in the same vein total hydrocarbon was not detected in most of the samples for both seasons the ds however had a mean value of 0 01 mg l odour calculated as threshold odour intensity number ton was not detected in any of the samples analyzed ideally drinking water should not have any detectable odour odour in drinking water usually shows that pollution had occurred in the water source total hardness defined in terms of the total concentration of calcium and magnesium ions expressed as calcium carbonate showed seasonal mean values of 15 63 mg l wet and 10 75 mg l dry with a variation of 4 88 mg l the peak and least values of 25 00 mg l and 8 00 mg l were obtained from hdws in the months of august and february respectively the values obtained are far lower than the who and son guideline values table 3 furthermore since the mean values are less than 50 00 mg l the groundwater is classified as soft water owamah et al 2013 abd el salam and abu zuid 2015 ejoh et al 2018 also found water from egini and ubogo rivers in the niger delta region of nigeria to be soft water hardness poses no real health threat but may result in soap wastage there were no values of total phosphorous in the ws unlike the ds that had considerably low values from few samples collected from the hdws the ds mean value calculated is 0 02 mg l phosphorous compounds occur in natural water effluent and sludge almost entirely in phosphate forms ademoroti 1996 phosphate in drinking water of 75 mg l has been reported to pose no health risk in drinking water owamah et al 2013 the obtained values in this study therefore show that phosphorous has no health related impact on the groundwater of the study area the detection of phosphorous at an insignificant level unlike the nitrogen related contaminants shows that wastewater effluent and other solid waste from the community could be mainly nitrogenous sojobi 2016 obtained mean phosphate values of 14 27 mg l and 15 6 mg l respectively for bhs and hdws of omu aran kwara state nigeria values of 27 5 0 9 mg l and 6 8 18 8 mg l were obtained for boreholes in different cities of northeastern nigeria and were linked to domestic effluent fertilizer and open defecation ishaku et al 2011 hco3 was not detected in many samples of the wet season the seasonal mean values are 10 37 mg l wet and 3 30 mg l dry with a seasonal mean variation of 7 07 mg l the values of the sd show that the variation pattern for rainy and dry seasons were random and suggestive of being caused by anthropogenic activities sojobi 2016 the seasonal mean values obtained for chloride are 5 50 mg l and 13 63 mg l for dry and wet seasons respectively the highest was obtained in the ws from a hdw water sample in the month of october egboh and emeshie 2008 also found greater levels of chloride in the ws for communities in the neighbouring ndokwa east local government area of delta state similar values were also reported for several neighbouring communities by owamah et al 2013 the presence of large concentration of chloride in water could be as a result of natural processes like the passage of water through salty hydrogeological formations or pollution from sea water intrusion the values obtained as shown in tables 1 and 2 are below the maximum guideline value of 200 00 mg l stipulated by the son the mean nitrate no3 values obtained in this study are 2 88 mg l and 3 03 mg l for bh and hdw water samples respectively a higher nitrate 0 02 42 45 mg l was obtained by devic et al 2014 and they attributed it to the activities of the residents ingestion of no3 above permissible limits could cause methemoglobinemia in kids emenike et al 2018 and in some cases cancer sojobi 2016 values of nitrate concentration recorded for the study area are below the son permissible limit of 50 mg l and who limit of 10 mg l for both seasons and water wells and therefore portends no health risk to residents of the community sulphate so4 2 obtained in the groundwater samples ranged from 1 50 mg l to 5 00 mg l in the ws and 2 00 mg l to 12 00 mg l in the ds the seasonal mean values are 3 24 mg l ws and 6 63 mg l ds with a variation of 3 39 mg l higher values were obtained in the ds from bh water samples sulphate is one of the least toxic ions but cathartic problems could be experienced by people when ingested at concentration of 600 00 mg l and above taking in of excess sulphate has also been reported to have caused dehydration the values of so4 2 obtained in this study are below the maximum permissible values of 500 and 100 00 mg l stipulated by who and son respectively for do seasonal mean values obtained are 10 38 mg l wet and 10 00 mg l dry with a mean seasonal variation of 0 38 mg l actual values obtained ranged from 8 00 to 12 00 mg l in both seasons borehole and hdw water samples had mean do values of 9 8 mg l and do 9 1 mg l respectively these are all above the minimum son and who recommendations of 7 5 mg l and 4 mg l respectively and hence in order the bod5 values ranged from 4 00 to 6 80 mg l in the ws and 3 00 6 00 mg l in the ds seasonal average values are 4 83 mg l ws and 4 78 mg l ds with a seasonal mean variation of 0 05 mg l according to owamah et al 2013 the highest allowable bod5 value is 6 00 mg l greater values indicate organic pollution the hdw water samples were found to have higher mean bod5 of 5 22 mg l in comparison with mean value of 4 60 mg l from bh water samples this indicates the occurrence of higher organic pollution in hdws than bhs the observed higher organic pollution of the hdw water samples could be attributed to nearness to septic tanks and poor design and construction of the hdws unsealed wells and wells without caps etc in the community the later could contaminate groundwater as it enables polluted surface water to reach the groundwater without filtration by the soil 3 2 microbial contamination the higher organic pollution obtained from the hdw water samples as noticed by its higher bod5 values corroborates the values of e coli obtained from water samples of the boreholes and hdws samples from the hdws had higher mean e coli value of 228 44 cfu ml than bhs with mean value of 180 56 cfu ml hdw water samples also had a mean total coliform count of 2 65 cfu ml which is again greater than the mean value of 0 94 cfu ml obtained from bh water samples the values recorded for total coliform count 100 ml sample revealed seasonal mean values of 0 38 cfu ml ws and 3 30 cfu ml ds the actual values ranged from 0 00 cfu ml to 1 80 cfu ml in the ws and 1 00 cfu ml to 5 76 cfu ml in the ds while greater values were gotten from the hdw samples of dry season the bh water samples had the least count the highest value of 5 76 cfu ml was found in a hdw water sample in the ds of january the who standard is zero count per 100 ml and therefore implies that groundwater of the study area is slightly contaminated with fecal matter and need to be treated chemically or by simple boiling microorganisms isolated from the water samples obtained from bhs and hdws are enterobacter aerogenes and e coli the presence of these microorganisms in the water samples whether pathogenic or non pathogenic provides a warning signal that the water should be treated before being used abubakar 2018a b ugochukwu and ojike 2019 these organisms are typically found in the intestinal tract of animals and humans grains plant surfaces and feces thakur et al 2012 sojobi 2016 the detection of these organisms in the sampled bh and hdw water samples shows that the groundwater would have had contact with the feces of man and or animals mackie et al 2006 agbabiaka and sule 2010 found e aerogenes in the borehole water samples of ilorin metropolis kwara state and attributed it to unsanitary surroundings of the water wells animal litter and fowl droppings sojobi 2016 recorded similar finding in his study of groundwater in omu aran kwara state the study attributed the bacterial contamination to droppings from sheep and goat litter in the community and the closeness of septic tanks to water wells this is also the situation in emevor community where goat and poultry litters is easily seen poorly constructed water wells are in some cases sited close to poorly constructed septic tanks majority of the bhs are also shallow okiki and ivbijaro 2013 and thakur et al 2012 had earlier reported the presence of e aerogenes in the water samples of hdws and boreholes in imota lagos nigeria and sloan pradesh jacinta and adebayo 2015 found e coli and e aerogenes in the boreholes and hdws of gwagwalada area of abuja nigeria though mackie et al 2006 reported that e aerogenes do not cause diseases in healthy persons sojobi 2016 revealed that they are of considerable health risks to man given their resistance to common antibiotics furthermore olufemi and oluwole 2012 had noted that e coli and e aerogenes caused the last cholera outbreak in ibadan nigeria while there was no detection of fungi in all the water samples of hdws and bhs spore forming yeasts were detected yeast contamination of groundwater resource had been reported in umudike benin city calabar and jos sojobi 2016 it is advisable for residents of emevor community to treat their groundwater before consumption in order to prevent the outbreak of water borne diseases in the community as the presence of these microorganisms in the water samples is a warning signal uzochukwu and chibike 2018 though anova test revealed no significant difference p 0 05 between the physico chemical parameters of bh and hdw water samples it indicated that there was a significant difference between the microbial parameters there was also no significant difference p 0 05 in the seasonal variation of the physical and chemical factors obtained it can therefore be said that though the geological formation in the community is similar the aquifers through different anthropogenic activities now have different microbiological properties this is evidenced by the fact that the bh and hdws were found to have different levels of bacterial contamination even when some were located close to each other 3 3 metals the major cations studied in this research are sodium na potassium k magnesium mg and calcium ca results obtained show that the most abundant of the cations is sodium with the highest concentration value of 18 99 mg l followed by calcium with the value of 18 00 mg l magnesium 7 80 mg l and potassium 13 01 mg l as found in the water samples collected from bhs in the wet season the seasonal mean values of the cations wet dry are 14 49 mg l 13 92 mg l 6 89mg l 6 52 mg l 10 50mg l 5 76 mg l and 11 62mg l 5 30 mg l for sodium potassium magnesium and calcium respectively this showed that the distribution of cations concentration decreased from ws to ds the observed values are within acceptable who son limits except for potassium which exceeded the threshold limit value of 2 mg l k is usually not a serious health related parameter in drinking water quality studies the other metals studied in this research include lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn copper cu iron fe and barium ba tables 1 and 2 contain the mean standard deviation and range of the metals concentrations the bhs in the ws had a relative abundance for cations na ca mg k ba zn cu fe and anions cl so4 2 no3 hco3 the hdws however had a relative abundance of na ca mg k ba zn cu fe for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 for anions for the dry season the boreholes had a relative abundance of na k mg ca zn ba cu fe for cations and cl so4 2 no3 hco3 for anions the hdws however had it as na ca mg k ba cu fe zn and cl hco3 so4 2 no3 for cations and anions respectively this finding is unlike the relative cations and anions abundance obtained by devic et al 2014 which were ca mg na k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 respectively sojobi 2016 also obtained different cations and anions relative abundance of na k ca mg zn pb and cl po4 2 so4 2 no3 respectively in the bhs and cations ca na k mg pb and anions no3 po4 2 so4 2 cl in the shallow wells of omu aran groundwater kwara state nigeria mean na concentration of 12 67 mg l boreholes and 13 82 mg l hdws obtained are less tha the son and who stipulated maximum value of 200 mg l todd 1980 reported that sodium could cause corrosion and formation of scale in boilers high sodium concentration in water can be suggestive of strong water aquifer interaction due to exchange of cations and or anthropogenic activities like wastewater disposal sojobi 2016 for mg the mean concentration values are 10 25 mg l for bhs and 5 12 mg l for hdws though these mean values exceeded the son prescribed maximum value of 0 2 mg l they are below the who maximum limit of 200 mg l the relative high mg value can be associated with the presence of basalts kaolinite and hematite in the geological formation of the study area owamah et al 2013 trostle et al 2014 values obtained in this study corroborate the finding of nwankwoala et al 2014 of mean mg value of 0 89 mg l for boreholes in yenagoa in the same niger delta region of nigeria like the study area nwankwoala et al 2014 linked the presence of the high mg to dissolution of minerals like feldspar and mica anthony et al 2008 had reported of extreme high concentrations of 68 173 mg l for groundwater in manali india high magnesium concentration in the groundwater of serbia was attributed to domestic effluents chemical fertilizers and minerals devic et al 2014 though mean ca values of 8 65 mg l bhs and 12 82 mg l hdws were less than the 49 3 mg l of viswanath et al 2015 they are higher than the 2 97 mg l for neighbouring yenagoa bayesa state nigeria as obtained by nwankwoala et al 2014 this suggests that coastal areas may be prone to having lower calcium values in their groundwater possibly due to the effects of dilution since the who permissible limit is 200 mg l the mean ca concentration values obtained in this study for both bhs and hdws are compliant the presence of ca in the groundwater of communities in the niger delta region of nigeria had been attributed by nwankwoala et al 2014 to feldspars and micas dissolution in the groundwater kim et al 2015 however reported that ca in groundwater could be as a result of the release of carbonate minerals in the course of the dissolution of silicate compounds the mean k values in the hdw and borehole water samples are 6 82 mg l and 5 52 mg l respectively and are above the mean values of 4 9 mg l and 0 91 mg l recorded respectively by ishaku et al 2011 and trostle et al 2014 for the other metals studied as displayed in tables 1 and 2 the highest concentration of 1 90 mg l was recorded for barium in the month of october in a sample collected from a hdw lead and cadmium had the least concentration pb was only slightly detected with a value of 0 01 mg l in just one sample of the wet season it was neither detected in the bh or hdw water samples of the dry season nor had measurable overall seasonal mean values for wet and dry seasons lead is therefore not of health concern in the groundwater of the community oni and hassan 2013 found elevated pb concentration in groundwater samples of wells close to a landfill and reported that pb in groundwater could be linked to improper disposal of pb containing domestic waste substances within the surrounding of water wells especially when there is absence of industrial activities pb can lead to subencelophalopathic disorders sojobi 2016 cadmium was not detected in the ws and ds for the bh and hdw samples zinc concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 1 00 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 0 12 mg l in the ds the overall seasonal mean values are 0 16 mg l in the ws and 0 04 mg l in the ds for copper the concentrations ranged from 0 001 to 0 09 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 0 20 mg l in the ds with seasonal mean values of 0 14 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively iron concentration values ranged from 0 001 to 0 06 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 0 05 mg l in the ds with seasonal mean values of 0 03 mg l and 0 03 mg l for wet and dry seasons respectively lastly barium had values ranging from 0 88 to 1 90 mg l in the ws and from 0 001 to 1 88 mg l in the ds the overall seasonal mean values for barium are 1 16 mg l for the ws and 0 58 mg l for the ds apart from barium the other metals tested had seasonal mean values that complied with the who son limit for potable water table 3 as shown in fig 2b ba was higher in the ws for both bhs and hdws this could be attributable to greater dissolution of barium containing minerals during the rains 4 correlation analysis of the physicochemical parameters studied in accordance with the work of sojobi 2016 the correlation classes adopted for the study are perfect r2 1 very strong 0 9 r2 1 strong 0 7 r2 0 9 moderate 0 5 r2 0 7 and weak r2 0 5 from table 4 by correlation coefficients cc the main cations influencing the presence and concentration of tds in the groundwater were identified as ca 0 99 mg 0 99 ba 0 99 fe 0 98 na 0 95 and k 0 85 tds was also very strongly correlated with bod5 0 89 no3 0 84 tss 0 86 and perfectly with dissolved oxygen do 0 97 these results are in accordance with the findings of emenike et al 2018 sojobi 2016 and viswanath et al 2015 in which ca was reported to be an influential factor for the estimation of tds in groundwater table 4 also shows that the notable mineral classes influencing the tds and ec in the study area groundwater are mg ca 0 98 ca fe class 0 98 na k 0 97 and na mg class 0 96 no3 was associated with mg ca group with cc 0 91 0 85 respectively mg and ca were found to have no correlation with cl following the finding of skrzypek et al 2013 the presence of mg2 and ca2 in the groundwater may be associated with other anions the strong cc of 0 98 between magnesium and calcium reflects huge mutual dependence and same anthropogenic sources devic et al 2014 emenike et al 2018 no3 has perfect cc with cd 0 98 and mg 0 91 and very strong cc with ba 0 84 showing that it could have come from anthropogenic activities such as the release of domestic wastewater on the environment table 4 reveals that affinity reactions and ionic exchanges were occurring in the hydrogeological formation of the area of study sojobi 2016 emenike et al 2018 while cl and so4 2 had strong preferential affinity for the anions and cations no3 was perfectly correlated with mg 0 91 and cd 0 98 when an aquifer is rich in magnesium it will allow its dissolution into it this notwithstanding majority of the anions that make up the aquifer minerals may not prefer the dissolved mg and hence may be the cause of the high mg concentration in the bh and hdw samples sojobi 2016 emenike et al 2018 reported that groundwater chemistry is mainly affected by the dissolution of minerals and the activities of man ph and ec were respectively found to be perfectly 0 96 and very strongly 0 90 correlated with so4 2 electrical conductivity correlated weakly with do iron no3 ca and bod5 showing that the mentioned physicochemical factors may not be appropriate for the estimation of ec in the study area groundwater this is however different from the report of sojobi 2016 for omu aran groundwater in kwara state nigeria table 5 gives a brief of the different groundwater contaminants and their related health effects it also shows that ground water pollutants vary from location to location as a result of differences in geological formations and anthropogenic activities table 6 however compares the results obtained from different previous authors about groundwater quality in different locations of the world with the findings of this study it can be seen from table 6 that quality of groundwater in the study area is relatively safer and cleaner than lots of other groundwater studied in the past however in line with the sdg 6 1 goal of achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 the study area needs urgent attention as bacterial and barium contamination found could have adverse health effects on the community dwellers especially on children and the aged 5 conclusion a detailed evaluation of the quality of groundwater in emevor community of the niger delta region of nigeria was carried out the groundwater was found to be mainly contaminated with coliform bacteria and slightly with ba entero bacteriaceae and escherichia coli species were also found in the water samples most especially the hdws the presence of coliform bacteria in the groundwater samples was linked to the nearness of hdws and bhs to pit latrines poorly constructed septic tanks and presence of many open dumps in the community the ba contamination was linked to oil explorations and processing activities in the region geological formation and careless disposal of electronic wastes the study recommends the development of modern sanitary systems in the community and public awareness by the supervising ministry and relevant non governmental organizations though huge priorities should be given to the provision of improved water to the people by government in the interim improvement of water quality at household level through chlorination addition of alum filtration solar disinfection and boiling is advised this study has been able to generate a broad water quality database for the study area which could help engineer future water project development in the region acknowledgement

12121,in the present paper an attempt has been made to simulate the performance of solar still by using iteration method for an internal convective heat and evaporative mass transfer coefficient which are used in basic energy balance equations the energy balance is based on the first law of thermodynamics as a function of design and climatic parameters respectively the internal convective heat transfer coefficient plays a significant role in the performance of solar still the iteration method based on kumar and tiwari model ktm which has not been considered earlier by any authors has been adopted for numerical computation for the convective heat transfer coefficient hcw based on numerical computation for new delhi climatic condition it has been observed that the numerical values of hourly change of an internal convective heat transfer coefficient hcw vary between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c after fourth iteration process which is reduced by 11 7 in comparison with the first iteration

relatively low population and easy accesses to the surface water kucera 2014 but more populated areas specially located in arid regions are experiencing water stress or scarcity the unstable and explosive population growth and fast industrialization in such regions have worsened the water stress condition world bank 2013 the growing concern over water scarcity in arid semi arid and some humid regions intensify the interest in desalination process desalination technologies have potential to convert seawater and brackish ground water into the freshwater current exhaustive desalination technologies are relying on the thermal energy or electricity generated by fossil fuel this high energy consumption in desalination process raising the concern about the environmental impacts worldwide after reviewing many types of desalination processes kalogirou 2005 concluded that solar distillation is an economical and popular method the solar still is a solar distillation system that utilizes the solar radiation for producing the fresh water mohan et al 2019 panchal 2019 panchal and mohan 2017 panchal and patel 2017 the theoretical studies related with the detail understanding of the performance of the solar still was initiated by g lof 1960 later many researchers have contributed in it baum and bairamov 1964 lof 1980 lof et al 1961 morse and read 1968 it is currently a well established fact that the internal heat and mass transfer relations for the solar distillation in comparison with external heat transfer plays an important role in the thermal modeling of solar distillation system which is used to optimize any design parameters tiwari et al 2016 tiwari and sahota 2017 including the hourly yield to maximize the hourly yield of the solar distillation system the internal heat transfer including evaporative heat transfer should be maximized for this purpose an accurate numerical value of evaporative heat transfer will be maximum only when an internal convective heat transfer will be accurately evaluated in the year 1961 dunkle 1961a has derived an analytical expression for internal convective heat transfer in the solar distillation unit under the simulation conditions dunkle s relation to convective heat transfer has limitations as i the relation is valid only for operating water temperature of 50 c ii it is independent of spacing between the evaporative and internal condensing cover surface iii the value of constants c 0 075 and n 1 3 has been considered and iv asmall inclination of condensing cover is considered by using lewis relations lewis 1922 incropera and dewitt 1996 between convective mass transfer cooper cooper 1972 1969a 1969b and malik et al 1982 have derived an analytical expression for internal evaporative heat loss to evaluate the performance of solar distillation the derived model for heat and mass transfer has been used by many scientists agrawal et al 2017 dutt et al 1989 kiatsiriroat et al 1987 ahmad and tiwari 2011 setoodeh et al 2011 sivakumar et al 2016 sodha et al 1981 tiwari et al 1998 bapeshwararao et al 1983 in single slop passive solar still to derive an analytical expression for water and glass temperature the rate of evaporation instantaneous thermal efficiency and hourly yield till date for the outdoor conditions since then there were many attempts to develop an internal convective heat transfer coefficient for single slop solar still adhikari et al 1995 clark 1990 shawaqfeht 1995 for thermal modeling later on kumar and tiwari 1997 have also develop a new model for computing the constant c and n by regression method without any limitation as laid down by dunkle in the year 1961 r v dunkle 1961a the model presented by kumar and tiwari can also is used for indoor as well as an outdoor simulation for any shape of condensing cover and operating temperature mode the proposed model can be also used for other applications namely solar crop drying forson et al 2007 ratti and mujumdar 1997 tiwari et al 2004 kumar and tiwari 2006 open swimming pool dongellini et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 greenhouse aquaculture jain 2007 li et al 2009 and solar pond valderrama et al 2016 kurt et al 2000 weinberg 1979 etc later on tsilingiris 2013 2011 2010 2009 have modified dunkle relation by considering the physical properties of saturated mixture thermo physical properties with the same limitation made by dunkle the model for convective heat transfer presented by kumar and tiwari 1997 has also been used by many researchers balan et al n d dumka and mishra 2018 madhlopa 2014 singh 2018 tiwari et al 1997 tripathi and tiwari 2006 which will be considered as a modified model in the present study however it has been observed that a more accurate convective heat transfer coefficient will be obtained if the iteration process is applied in kumar and tiwari s model ktm in the present study the internal convective heat transfer coefficients hcw have been evaluated by the iteration method by using kumar and tiwari s model which has not been carried out earlier for iteration method numerical computations have been carried out for the climatic condition of new delhi tiwari et al 1997 by using matlab the iteration method has been carried out from first step to fifth step based on the results it has been observed that there is no significant change in hourly variation of an internal convective heat transfer coefficient after fourth iteration step it has also been found that the internal convective heat transfer coefficent varies between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c after fourth iteration process which is reduced by 11 7 in comparison with first iteration the proposed iteration method is applicable to outdoor as well as indoor simulation conditions unlike other models without any limitation 2 working principle fig 1 shows a cross sectional view of single slop solar still the solar radiation after transmitting through glass cover and water mass is absorbed by basin liner and temperature of basin liner starts increasing the absorbed thermal energy α b i t is convected to water mass q w to raise its temperature from water surface there are three types of heat transfers namely radiative q rw convective q cw and evaporative q ew first the evaporated water saturates the space between water surface and condensing surface and then starts condensing on inner surface of glass cover after releasing its latent heat of evaporation the condensed water is trickled down under gravity and it is collected in a channel attached to lower end of condensing cover the released latent heat of condensation increases the temperature of glass cover which is responsible for the decrease in the temperature difference between water surface and glass cover due to this phenomenon the rate of heat transfer between water surface and glass cover is significantly affected the rate of heat transfer between water surface and glass cover can be increased by increasing the rate of heat loss from glass cover to ambient by radiation q rg and convective q cg fig 1 also shows the other losses as well fig 2 shows the thermal circuit diagram of single slop solar still which will be utilized to write the energy balance equation for the present study 3 thermal modeling following assumptions panchal and mohan 2017 tiwari and sahota 2017 have been made to write the energy balance equations i heat capacity of condensing cover insulating and absorbing materials have been neglected ii the quasi steady state condition of system is considered iii there is no stratification in water depth condensing cover thickness iv average value of solar intensity and ambient air temperature for 0 t time interval has been considered for numerical computation and v the values of internal heat transfer coefficient calculated at initial temperature are same for 0 t time interval referring to fig 2 and based on first law of thermodynamics the energy balance of glass cover water mass and basin liner can be written as follows glass cover 1 h 1 t w t g h 2 t g t a water mass 2 α w i t h 3 t b t w mc w dt w dt h 1 t w t g basin liner 3a α b i t h 3 t b t w h b t b t a where 3b h 1 h cw h ew h rw which is sum of internal convective evaporative and radiative heat transfer coefficient from the water surface to glass cover and h2 5 7 3 8v 5 7 for v 0 v is wind velocity is sum of convective and radiative heat transfer coefficient from condensing cover to ambient air temperature the other constants appearing in eqs 1 3 are given in table 1 b the expression for hrw and hew tiwari and sahota 2017 are given as follows 4 h rw σ t wo 273 4 t go 273 4 t wo t go and 5 h ew 0 016 h cw p wo p go t wo t go where p wo exp 25 137 5144 t wo 273 p go exp 25 137 5144 t go 273 the t wo and t go are known as initial water and glass cover temperature respectively eq 5 shows that accurate evaporative heat transfer coefficient hew can be calculated only if an accurate internal convective heat transfer coefficient hcw is known the radiative and evaporative heat transfer coefficients calculated at t wo and t go are same during 0 t time interval as per assumptions the numerical values of hcw in eq 5 can be evaluated by the following methods 3 1 first method by using dunkle s relation dunkle 1961a for convective heat transfer coefficient which is given by 6 h cw 0 884 t w 0 t g 0 p wo p go t wo 273 268 9 10 3 p wo for known values of two and tgo hcw can be evaluated from above equation which can be used to evaluate hew from eq 5 and hence total internal heat transfer coefficient h1 is known numerically after knowing the numerical values of h1 for initial condition i e two and tgo and other constants given in table 1b and climatic parameters as shown in fig 4 the water tw glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation q ew and yield m ew at time t can be obtained from the following expressions water temperature 7 t w α eff u l i t t a 1 e at t w 0 e at glass temperature 8 t g h 1 t w h 2 t a h 1 h 2 eqs 7 and 8 can be derived from eqs 1 3 now the rate of evaporation can be obtained as 9 q ew h ew t w t g further the rate of yield mass is given by 10 m ew q ew l h ew t w t g l where α eff α w h α b h h 3 h 3 h b a u l mc w u l u t u b u t 1 h 1 1 h 2 1 and u b 1 h 3 1 h b 1 in the above derivations an average value of solar intensity and ambient air temperature has been considered for 0 t time interval as mentioned in assumption the obtained values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures at time t 3600 s becomes the initial conditions for the next set of calculation and so on by this we can get 24 values of water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation q e w and yield m e w the obtained 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w table 1a will be used in following second method to evaluate c and n and finally hcw 3 2 second method from eqs 5 and 10 we can have the expression for the rate of mass evaporated in 3600 s as follows 11 m e w h ew t w t g l 3600 0 016 h cw p w p g 3600 l here it is assumed that the value of hew remains same for 0 t time interval kumar and tiwari have used the following dimensionless nusselt number for computing convective heat transfer coefficient by regression method 12a nu h cw d f k f c gr pr n or 12b h cw k f d f c gr pr n where gr and pr are the grashof and prandtl numbers respectively and its expressions are given by 13 gr β gl 3 ρ 2 δ t μ 2 and pr μ c p k f the unknown constants c and n as proposed in eq 12b will be calculated by linear regression analysis as by kumar and tiwari tiwari 2002 the temperature dependent physical properties of saturated mixture of vapor appearing in gr and pr number in eq 13 are given in table 2 being evaluated at average temperature t two tgo 2 following kumar and tiwari and with the help of eqs 11 and 12 we have 14 y ax b where y m ew r r 0 016 h cw p w p g k f d f x gr pr a c and b n by taking log on both sides of equation 14 it can be written in the form of straight line equation given by 15 y bx a here y log y a log a and x log x by using the linear regression analysis the coefficients a and b in equation 15 can be obtained as 16 a σ y n b σx n and 17 b n σx y σx σy n σx 2 σx 2 where under steady state condition n is the number of experimental observations i e 25 for 24 obtained values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w from first method and by using temperature dependent of physical properties of vapor table 2 one can get 24 values of y and x and by using regression method one can get the numerical values of c and n which can be used to evaluate the 24 values of internal convective heat transfer coefficient then 24 values of hrw and hew from eqs 4 and 5 and then 24 values of internal total heat transfer coefficient similarly the 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w can be obtained as done in first method the results obtained by second method can be compared with the results obtained by first method 3 3 proposed iteration method it has been observed that there is further scope for improvement in evaluating internal convective heat transfer coefficient by using iteration method for kumar and tiwari model which has not been done earlier by any one for first iteration process the obtained 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w is used to evaluate new values of c and n by adopting second method kumar and tiwari 1997 following the procedure of second method we can again have new set of 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w then the results obtained by first iteration process will be compared with the results obtained by second iteration process this iteration process will continue till the difference between two consecutive results becomes approximately zero flow chart for numerical computation has been shown in fig 3 4 methodology step 1 h1 is calculated for known initial value of water two and glass cover tgo temperature at t 0 at 6am by using dunkle s relation eq 6 step 2 for known h1 water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation and hourly yield should be computed by using eqs 4 7 for a given design and climatic parameters at time t at 7am step 3 the known tw and tg at t 7am becomes initial condition for next set of computation of tw and tg at 8am further in this case too the h1 should be computed by using step1 step 4 for new values of h1 obtained from step3 the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation and hourly yield should be computed by using eqs 4 7 for average value of solar intensity and ambient temperature between 7 8 a m step 5 the known tw and tg at 8 a m becomes initial condition for next set of computation of tw and tg at 9 a m further in this case too the h1 should be computed by using step1 step 6 similarly the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation and hourly yield can be computed for each time interval and we can get 24 values of each parameters including tw and tg step 7 the 24 values of tw tg and yield can be used to calculated c and n by using second method kumar and tiwari s model as discussed earlier step 8 by using c and n from step 7 new values for hcw eq 12b will be used for getting new 24 set of hrw hcw hew tw tg m e w by using steps 1 7 step 9 now the 24 values of tw tg and yield in step 8 is further used to get new c and n as mentioned in step 8 step 10 for known c and n another 24 set of hrw hcw hew tw tg will m e w be obtained as done in step 9 these values will be referred as first iteration step 11 similarly one can carry iterations till two consecutive values become approximately same 5 results and discussion the climatic parameters namely hourly variations of the solar intensity i t and ambient temperature ta and hourly variation of water and glass cover temperature and yield for new delhi condition used for present study have been shown in fig 4 and table 1a for a typical day in the month of september 2017 further it is necessary to mention that the results for a typical day are also valid for all other climatic condition too following flow chart as shown in fig 3 and methology mentioned in section 4 following procedure adopted i by using the data for water and glass cover temperature of table 1a eq 6 has been used to calculate convective heat transfer coefficent and the reults have been shown in fig 5 as a dunkle model for the same data variation of evaporative and radiative heat retransfer coefficent have been shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively sum of these internal heat transfer coefficient can be evaluated from eq 3b further eqs 7 10 have been used to evaluate hourly variation of water glass and yield by dunkle s model and the reults have been shown in figs 7 10 ii now using the ktm model along with hourly water and glass temperatures data of table 1a and physical properties of vapor from table 2 the reults for convective heat transfer coefficient hcw by first iteration method has been done and the results have been shown in the same fig 5 as a first iteration method which is lower than dunkle model correspondingly evaporative heat transfer eq 4 and radiative heat transfer eq 5 coefficients have also been evaluated to get total internal heat transfer coefficent h1 eq 3b by first iteration method in this case too hourly variation of water glass and yield will be calculated as done earlier and the reults have been shown in figs 7 10 iii further for second iteration method new water and glass cover temperatures for obtained total internal heat transfer coefficient h1 by first iteration and design parameters of table 1b and climatic data of fig 3 were evaluated iv for new values of water and glass cover temperatures another internal convective heat transfer coefficient will be evaluated as stated in first iteration menton and the results have been shown in fig 5 which is refereed as second iteration method the value of convective heat transfer coefficient obtained by second iteration method is lower by in comparisons with first iteration method v similarly convective heat transfer coefficient have been evaluated for third to fifth iteration method and the reults have been shown in fig 5 too it is necessary to mention here that the results mentioned in figs 4 9 included all the results by the three methods namely first section 3 1 second method section 3 2 and proposed method section 3 3 respectively it is observed from fig 5 that the hourly internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained by dunkle s model is maximum and varies between 1 1 to 2 1 w m2 0c further the values of internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained by kumar and tiwari model varies between 1 2 to 1 7 w m2 0c which is reduced by 19 now the variation in the values of internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained after fourth iteration method varies between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c which is reduced by 11 7 it is also important to mention that the fluctuation in internal heat transfer coefficient obtained by iteration method is also reduced significantly which is required condition for simple thermal modeling from fig 6 it is seen that the hourly variation of internal evaporative heat transfer obtained by three methods as mentioned earlier in this case to there is reduction in the values of internal evaporative heat transfer coefficient by 31 in comparison with dunkle s model and 7 7 by iteration methods in comparison with kumar and tiwari model also fig 7 shows the hourly variation of internal radiative heat transfer obtained by these methods as mentioned earlier it can be seen that there is near to no variations in the internal radiative heat transfer coefficient obtained by kumar and tiwari model ktm and iteration method it is due to fact that small variation in the operating temperature in oc becomes insignificant when converted into kelvin this is also important to mention that there is reduction in numerical value of radiative heat transfer coefficient obtained by kumar and tiwari model and iteration method by 5 in comparison with dunkle s model similar brands have been obtained for hourly variation in water and glass condensing cover temperatures and yield as shown in figs 8 10 respectively 6 conclusions from the present study the following conclusions have been made i for a given design and climatic parameter of solar distillation system in the present study the values of internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained after fourth iteration method varies between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c fig 5 this value is practically constant can be considered as 1 4 w m2 0c which is average value to make simple thermal modeling ii in solar distillation out of three internal heat tansfer coefficients only evaporative heat tansfer coefficent plays an important role due to higher numerical value range between 2 5 w m2 0c to 40 w m2 0c unlike convective 1 3 1 5 w m2 0c and radiative heat tansfer coefficent 5 25 8 w

12121,in the present paper an attempt has been made to simulate the performance of solar still by using iteration method for an internal convective heat and evaporative mass transfer coefficient which are used in basic energy balance equations the energy balance is based on the first law of thermodynamics as a function of design and climatic parameters respectively the internal convective heat transfer coefficient plays a significant role in the performance of solar still the iteration method based on kumar and tiwari model ktm which has not been considered earlier by any authors has been adopted for numerical computation for the convective heat transfer coefficient hcw based on numerical computation for new delhi climatic condition it has been observed that the numerical values of hourly change of an internal convective heat transfer coefficient hcw vary between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c after fourth iteration process which is reduced by 11 7 in comparison with the first iteration

technologies are relying on the thermal energy or electricity generated by fossil fuel this high energy consumption in desalination process raising the concern about the environmental impacts worldwide after reviewing many types of desalination processes kalogirou 2005 concluded that solar distillation is an economical and popular method the solar still is a solar distillation system that utilizes the solar radiation for producing the fresh water mohan et al 2019 panchal 2019 panchal and mohan 2017 panchal and patel 2017 the theoretical studies related with the detail understanding of the performance of the solar still was initiated by g lof 1960 later many researchers have contributed in it baum and bairamov 1964 lof 1980 lof et al 1961 morse and read 1968 it is currently a well established fact that the internal heat and mass transfer relations for the solar distillation in comparison with external heat transfer plays an important role in the thermal modeling of solar distillation system which is used to optimize any design parameters tiwari et al 2016 tiwari and sahota 2017 including the hourly yield to maximize the hourly yield of the solar distillation system the internal heat transfer including evaporative heat transfer should be maximized for this purpose an accurate numerical value of evaporative heat transfer will be maximum only when an internal convective heat transfer will be accurately evaluated in the year 1961 dunkle 1961a has derived an analytical expression for internal convective heat transfer in the solar distillation unit under the simulation conditions dunkle s relation to convective heat transfer has limitations as i the relation is valid only for operating water temperature of 50 c ii it is independent of spacing between the evaporative and internal condensing cover surface iii the value of constants c 0 075 and n 1 3 has been considered and iv asmall inclination of condensing cover is considered by using lewis relations lewis 1922 incropera and dewitt 1996 between convective mass transfer cooper cooper 1972 1969a 1969b and malik et al 1982 have derived an analytical expression for internal evaporative heat loss to evaluate the performance of solar distillation the derived model for heat and mass transfer has been used by many scientists agrawal et al 2017 dutt et al 1989 kiatsiriroat et al 1987 ahmad and tiwari 2011 setoodeh et al 2011 sivakumar et al 2016 sodha et al 1981 tiwari et al 1998 bapeshwararao et al 1983 in single slop passive solar still to derive an analytical expression for water and glass temperature the rate of evaporation instantaneous thermal efficiency and hourly yield till date for the outdoor conditions since then there were many attempts to develop an internal convective heat transfer coefficient for single slop solar still adhikari et al 1995 clark 1990 shawaqfeht 1995 for thermal modeling later on kumar and tiwari 1997 have also develop a new model for computing the constant c and n by regression method without any limitation as laid down by dunkle in the year 1961 r v dunkle 1961a the model presented by kumar and tiwari can also is used for indoor as well as an outdoor simulation for any shape of condensing cover and operating temperature mode the proposed model can be also used for other applications namely solar crop drying forson et al 2007 ratti and mujumdar 1997 tiwari et al 2004 kumar and tiwari 2006 open swimming pool dongellini et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 greenhouse aquaculture jain 2007 li et al 2009 and solar pond valderrama et al 2016 kurt et al 2000 weinberg 1979 etc later on tsilingiris 2013 2011 2010 2009 have modified dunkle relation by considering the physical properties of saturated mixture thermo physical properties with the same limitation made by dunkle the model for convective heat transfer presented by kumar and tiwari 1997 has also been used by many researchers balan et al n d dumka and mishra 2018 madhlopa 2014 singh 2018 tiwari et al 1997 tripathi and tiwari 2006 which will be considered as a modified model in the present study however it has been observed that a more accurate convective heat transfer coefficient will be obtained if the iteration process is applied in kumar and tiwari s model ktm in the present study the internal convective heat transfer coefficients hcw have been evaluated by the iteration method by using kumar and tiwari s model which has not been carried out earlier for iteration method numerical computations have been carried out for the climatic condition of new delhi tiwari et al 1997 by using matlab the iteration method has been carried out from first step to fifth step based on the results it has been observed that there is no significant change in hourly variation of an internal convective heat transfer coefficient after fourth iteration step it has also been found that the internal convective heat transfer coefficent varies between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c after fourth iteration process which is reduced by 11 7 in comparison with first iteration the proposed iteration method is applicable to outdoor as well as indoor simulation conditions unlike other models without any limitation 2 working principle fig 1 shows a cross sectional view of single slop solar still the solar radiation after transmitting through glass cover and water mass is absorbed by basin liner and temperature of basin liner starts increasing the absorbed thermal energy α b i t is convected to water mass q w to raise its temperature from water surface there are three types of heat transfers namely radiative q rw convective q cw and evaporative q ew first the evaporated water saturates the space between water surface and condensing surface and then starts condensing on inner surface of glass cover after releasing its latent heat of evaporation the condensed water is trickled down under gravity and it is collected in a channel attached to lower end of condensing cover the released latent heat of condensation increases the temperature of glass cover which is responsible for the decrease in the temperature difference between water surface and glass cover due to this phenomenon the rate of heat transfer between water surface and glass cover is significantly affected the rate of heat transfer between water surface and glass cover can be increased by increasing the rate of heat loss from glass cover to ambient by radiation q rg and convective q cg fig 1 also shows the other losses as well fig 2 shows the thermal circuit diagram of single slop solar still which will be utilized to write the energy balance equation for the present study 3 thermal modeling following assumptions panchal and mohan 2017 tiwari and sahota 2017 have been made to write the energy balance equations i heat capacity of condensing cover insulating and absorbing materials have been neglected ii the quasi steady state condition of system is considered iii there is no stratification in water depth condensing cover thickness iv average value of solar intensity and ambient air temperature for 0 t time interval has been considered for numerical computation and v the values of internal heat transfer coefficient calculated at initial temperature are same for 0 t time interval referring to fig 2 and based on first law of thermodynamics the energy balance of glass cover water mass and basin liner can be written as follows glass cover 1 h 1 t w t g h 2 t g t a water mass 2 α w i t h 3 t b t w mc w dt w dt h 1 t w t g basin liner 3a α b i t h 3 t b t w h b t b t a where 3b h 1 h cw h ew h rw which is sum of internal convective evaporative and radiative heat transfer coefficient from the water surface to glass cover and h2 5 7 3 8v 5 7 for v 0 v is wind velocity is sum of convective and radiative heat transfer coefficient from condensing cover to ambient air temperature the other constants appearing in eqs 1 3 are given in table 1 b the expression for hrw and hew tiwari and sahota 2017 are given as follows 4 h rw σ t wo 273 4 t go 273 4 t wo t go and 5 h ew 0 016 h cw p wo p go t wo t go where p wo exp 25 137 5144 t wo 273 p go exp 25 137 5144 t go 273 the t wo and t go are known as initial water and glass cover temperature respectively eq 5 shows that accurate evaporative heat transfer coefficient hew can be calculated only if an accurate internal convective heat transfer coefficient hcw is known the radiative and evaporative heat transfer coefficients calculated at t wo and t go are same during 0 t time interval as per assumptions the numerical values of hcw in eq 5 can be evaluated by the following methods 3 1 first method by using dunkle s relation dunkle 1961a for convective heat transfer coefficient which is given by 6 h cw 0 884 t w 0 t g 0 p wo p go t wo 273 268 9 10 3 p wo for known values of two and tgo hcw can be evaluated from above equation which can be used to evaluate hew from eq 5 and hence total internal heat transfer coefficient h1 is known numerically after knowing the numerical values of h1 for initial condition i e two and tgo and other constants given in table 1b and climatic parameters as shown in fig 4 the water tw glass

has been considered for 0 t time interval as mentioned in assumption the obtained values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures at time t 3600 s becomes the initial conditions for the next set of calculation and so on by this we can get 24 values of water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation q e w and yield m e w the obtained 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w table 1a will be used in following second method to evaluate c and n and finally hcw 3 2 second method from eqs 5 and 10 we can have the expression for the rate of mass evaporated in 3600 s as follows 11 m e w h ew t w t g l 3600 0 016 h cw p w p g 3600 l here it is assumed that the value of hew remains same for 0 t time interval kumar and tiwari have used the following dimensionless nusselt number for computing convective heat transfer coefficient by regression method 12a nu h cw d f k f c gr pr n or 12b h cw k f d f c gr pr n where gr and pr are the grashof and prandtl numbers respectively and its expressions are given by 13 gr β gl 3 ρ 2 δ t μ 2 and pr μ c p k f the unknown constants c and n as proposed in eq 12b will be calculated by linear regression analysis as by kumar and tiwari tiwari 2002 the temperature dependent physical properties of saturated mixture of vapor appearing in gr and pr number in eq 13 are given in table 2 being evaluated at average temperature t two tgo 2 following kumar and tiwari and with the help of eqs 11 and 12 we have 14 y ax b where y m ew r r 0 016 h cw p w p g k f d f x gr pr a c and b n by taking log on both sides of equation 14 it can be written in the form of straight line equation given by 15 y bx a here y log y a log a and x log x by using the linear regression analysis the coefficients a

values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w from first method and by using temperature dependent of physical properties of vapor table 2 one can get 24 values of y and x and by using regression method one can get the numerical values of c and n which can be used to evaluate the 24 values of internal convective heat transfer coefficient then 24 values of hrw and hew from eqs 4 and 5 and then 24 values of internal total heat transfer coefficient similarly the 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w can be obtained as done in first method the results obtained by second method can be compared with the results obtained by first method 3 3 proposed iteration method it has been observed that there is further scope for improvement in evaluating internal convective heat transfer coefficient by using iteration method for kumar and tiwari model which has not been done earlier by any one for first iteration process the obtained 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w is used to evaluate new values of c and n by adopting second method kumar and tiwari 1997 following the procedure of second method we can again have new set of 24 values of the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures and yield m e w then the results obtained by first iteration process will be compared with the results obtained by second iteration process this iteration process will continue till the difference between two consecutive results becomes approximately zero flow chart for numerical computation has been shown in fig 3 4 methodology step 1 h1 is calculated for known initial value of water two and glass cover tgo temperature at t 0 at 6am by using dunkle s relation eq 6 step 2 for known h1 water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation and hourly yield should be computed by using eqs 4 7 for a given design and climatic parameters at time t at 7am step 3 the known tw and tg at t 7am becomes initial condition for next set of computation of tw and tg at 8am further in this case too the h1 should be computed by using step1 step 4 for new values of h1 obtained from step3 the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation and hourly yield should be computed by using eqs 4 7 for average value of solar intensity and ambient temperature between 7 8 a m step 5 the known tw and tg at 8 a m becomes initial condition for next set of computation of tw and tg at 9 a m further in this case too the h1 should be computed by using step1 step 6 similarly the water tw and glass cover tg temperatures the rate of evaporation and hourly yield can be computed for each time interval and we can get 24 values of each parameters including tw and tg step 7 the 24 values of tw tg and yield can be used to calculated c and n by using second method kumar and tiwari s model as discussed earlier step 8 by using c and n from step 7 new values for hcw eq 12b will be used for getting new 24 set of hrw hcw hew tw tg m e w by using steps 1 7 step 9 now the 24 values of tw tg and yield in step 8 is further used to get new c and n as mentioned in step 8 step 10 for known c and n another 24 set of hrw hcw hew tw tg will m e w be obtained as done in step 9 these values will be referred as first iteration step 11 similarly one can carry iterations till two consecutive values become approximately same 5 results and discussion the climatic parameters namely hourly variations of the solar intensity i t and ambient temperature ta and hourly variation of water and glass cover temperature and yield for new delhi condition used for present study have been shown in fig 4 and table 1a for a typical day in the month of september 2017 further it is necessary to mention that the results for a typical day are also valid for all other climatic condition too following flow chart as shown in fig 3 and methology mentioned in section 4 following procedure adopted i by using the data for water and glass cover temperature of table 1a eq 6 has been used to calculate convective heat transfer coefficent and the reults have been shown in fig 5 as a dunkle model for the same data variation of evaporative and radiative heat retransfer coefficent have been shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively sum of these internal heat transfer coefficient can be evaluated from eq 3b further eqs 7 10 have been used to evaluate hourly variation of water glass and yield by dunkle s model and the reults have been shown in figs 7 10 ii now using the ktm model along with hourly water and glass temperatures data of table 1a and physical properties of vapor from table 2 the reults for convective heat transfer coefficient hcw by first iteration method has been done and the results have been shown in the same fig 5 as a first iteration method which is lower than dunkle model correspondingly evaporative heat transfer eq 4 and radiative heat transfer eq 5 coefficients have also been evaluated to get total internal heat transfer coefficent h1 eq 3b by first iteration method in this case too hourly variation of water glass and yield will be calculated as done earlier and the reults have been shown in figs 7 10 iii further for second iteration method new water and glass cover temperatures for obtained total internal heat transfer coefficient h1 by first iteration and design parameters of table 1b and climatic data of fig 3 were evaluated iv for new values of water and glass cover temperatures another internal convective heat transfer coefficient will be evaluated as stated in first iteration menton and the results have been shown in fig 5 which is refereed as second iteration method the value of convective heat transfer coefficient obtained by second iteration method is lower by in comparisons with first iteration method v similarly convective heat transfer coefficient have been evaluated for third to fifth iteration method and the reults have been shown in fig 5 too it is necessary to mention here that the results mentioned in figs 4 9 included all the results by the three methods namely first section 3 1 second method section 3 2 and proposed method section 3 3 respectively it is observed from fig 5 that the hourly internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained by dunkle s model is maximum and varies between 1 1 to 2 1 w m2 0c further the values of internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained by kumar and tiwari model varies between 1 2 to 1 7 w m2 0c which is reduced by 19 now the variation in the values of internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained after fourth iteration method varies between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c which is reduced by 11 7 it is also important to mention that the fluctuation in internal heat transfer coefficient obtained by iteration method is also reduced significantly which is required condition for simple thermal modeling from fig 6 it is seen that the hourly variation of internal evaporative heat transfer obtained by three methods as mentioned earlier in this case to there is reduction in the values of internal evaporative heat transfer coefficient by 31 in comparison with dunkle s model and 7 7 by iteration methods in comparison with kumar and tiwari model also fig 7 shows the hourly variation of internal radiative heat transfer obtained by these methods as mentioned earlier it can be seen that there is near to no variations in the internal radiative heat transfer coefficient obtained by kumar and tiwari model ktm and iteration method it is due to fact that small variation in the operating temperature in oc becomes insignificant when converted into kelvin this is also important to mention that there is reduction in numerical value of radiative heat transfer coefficient obtained by kumar and tiwari model and iteration method by 5 in comparison with dunkle s model similar brands have been obtained for hourly variation in water and glass condensing cover temperatures and yield as shown in figs 8 10 respectively 6 conclusions from the present study the following conclusions have been made i for a given design and climatic parameter of solar distillation system in the present study the values of internal convective heat transfer coefficent obtained after fourth iteration method varies between 1 3 to 1 5 w m2 0c fig 5 this value is practically constant can be considered as 1 4 w m2 0c which is average value to make simple thermal modeling ii in solar distillation out of three internal heat tansfer coefficients only evaporative heat tansfer coefficent plays an important role due to higher numerical value range between 2 5 w m2 0c to 40 w m2 0c unlike convective 1 3 1 5 w m2 0c and radiative heat tansfer coefficent 5 25 8 w m2 0c iii there is marginal difference in water temperature fig 8 glass cover temperature fig 9 hourly temperatures and yield fig 10 for any iteration method by using ktm model however there is significant difference in these values in comparision with dunkle s model iv the reduction in convective heat transfer coefficent obtained by iteration method is 33 lower in comparison with results

12122,drinking water is a necessity not only for humanity but also for the all living organisms available in the earth today but the availability of the potable water is not in abundant amount hence clean water is scarce in the world today solar desalination system is used to turn the saline water into the freshwater by use of sunrays solar still is a device which can be employed for desalination as the daily productivity of solar distiller is low so multiple techniques have been used by various researchers to improve its productivity but work done on the fins to enhance the distillate output is not much fin is a low cost heat transfer enhancement which is used by many researchers in the solar thermal applications present review paper shows the use of fins in solar still and how it can be used to enhance the distillate output of solar still at last a table is also presented to show the use of fins to increase the distillate output alone and with the use of certain materials graphical abstract image 1 abbreviations nf number of fins mw mass of water in the storage tank pcm phase change materials gi galvanized iron 1 introduction pure drinking water is the choice element of human plants and animals on earth about 97 of the earth s water is available as salt water in oceans and the remaining 3 as freshwater in the form of ice groundwater lakes and rivers which supply most human and animal needs so the requirement of pure drinking water is a significant challenge for all solar desalination is the best method to convert the salty water into pure drinkable form solar still is a simple device which converts the saltwater into pure drinkable form but the lower efficiency and less productivity is the major problem of solar still awasthi et al 2018 mohan et al 2019 panchal 2010 2011 2016a 2016b 2018 gawande et al 2013 panchal and shah 2013a solar energy intensity remains higher during noon hence the water temperature remains more elevated and the condensation temperature also remains higher the temperature of the water does not only depend on the water temperature but also lower condensation temperature panchal and shah 2013b panchal et al 2018 panchal and patel 2017 rai et al 2013 it is required to store the excess of heat during the noon and utilized during the off sunshine hours therefore sensible heat storage materials have been used by many researchers to store the excess heat during the noon and use it during the off sunshine hours hitesh et al 2019a panchal et al 2017 panchal 2016 sathish kumar and raja bharathi 2013 panchal 2015 dinesh babu and venkata ramanan 2017 panchal et al 2010 akash bilal et al 1998 kalidasa murugavel et al 2010 nafey et al 2001 many researchers have also used latent heat storage materials hitesh et al 2019b hitesh and sadasivuni 2019 abhat 1983 buddhi et al 2003 sharma et al 2000 latent heat storage materials release the heat and increase the temperature the fixed amount of solar rays available in the solar still and due to intermittent solar rays the temperature of the water does not remain higher instead of the use of an only conventional solar still if the collector is used then the water temperature would be obtaining higher flat plate collector panchal et al 2011a thakar et al 2014 vala et al 2018 has been used by many researchers to supply the hot water to the solar still it is a simple solar thermal device which can be provided with hot water later evacuated tubes anchal and anuradha 2017 panchal et al 2011b panchal and hemin 2016 panchal and shah 2013c panchal and shah 2014b panchal and shah 2014 sampathkumar et al 2013 singh et al 2013 have been used by many researchers evacuated tubes can be coupled directly with the solar still or it can be connected with the solar still with the help of piping at present to improve the distillate output either flat plate collector or evacuated tubes can be employed from the above kinds of literature it has been found that solar still is a beneficial device which can produce potable water from saline or brackish water many researchers have tried their ideas to enhance the distillate output of solar still by sensible and latent heat storage materials flat plate collector evacuated tubes collector and many more the heat transfer depends on the surface area and fin is a simple device used to improve the heat transfer the work done on the fins in solar still is much hence the main objective of the review paper is to study the use of fins in the solar still for the improvement in distillate output 2 use of fins in solar still heat transfer is a critical parameter while designing any solar thermal applications fin is a straightforward device which can be used in the solar still to increase the surface area increment of the surface area leads to heat transfer researchers have used fins in the solar still to increase the surface area of water and hence the increment of water temperature 2 1 effect of pin fin to increase the distillate output of solar still rabhi et al 2017 had carried out experiments on solar still with the use of pin fin and condenser their main aim was to conduct experiments on conventional solar still with the use of pin fin and condenser they carried out experiments in three cases e g conventional solar still modified solar still with pin fin and modified solar still with pin fin and condenser they obtained higher distillate output in modified solar still with pin fin and condenser they also found that the pin fin increases the surface area hence water temperature rises and condenser improves the condensation fig 1 shows the experimental set up of modified solar still with pin fin and condenser another experiment was conducted between the conventional solar still and modified solar still with use of pin fin wick by alaian et al 2016 the use of the pin fin wick is to increase the surface area alongwith the even distribution of water in the solar still basin several experiments have been conducted on modified solar still to see the increment in distillate output an experimental study is carried out between conventional solar still and solar still with pin finned wick by the result shows in fig 2 that solar still with pin finned wick gives 23 higher productivity than the conventional one 2 2 effect of materials of fin on distillate output of solar still el sebaii and el naggar 2017 investigated the performance of solar still with use of different materials of the fin actually they want to determine the effect of fin material on increment in distillate output they have carried out several tests on solar still with varying the materials of the fins from their results it has been concluded that there is no significant effect on the distillate output by varying the fin materials 2 3 effect of fin configuration on distillate output of solar still el sebaii et al 2015 experimentally investigate the effect of fin configuration parameters on solar still they used single basin solar still with variations of the fin height and thickness of fins it is found that increasing the number of fin and width of the fin the productivity decreases as shown in fig 3 also it is observed that the performance of the fin increases with the increase of fin height 2 4 use of fins to reduce the heat loss from the solar still the main reason behind the lower productivity of solar still is the higher heat loss i e bottom side and top hence to reduce the heat losses from the solar still an acrylic sheet is used in the casing of the still by manokar and winston 2017 they used acrylic sheet along with the aluminium fins are attached at the basin of the still to increase productivity due to the low thermal conductivity of acrylic material the heat losses found lower as compared with the conventional solar still hence the temperature of the modified solar still found higher as compared with the conventional one 2 5 comparison of circular and

evaporator solar still a theoretical study on heat transfer characteristics of plain fin is done by qiu et al 2018 they found that increasing the fin height beyond 0 04 m due to negative value of convective heat transfer coefficient efficiency of the still decreases also in off sunshine hours the solar finned tube evaporator gives better results in addition to higher the fin height and solar

12122,drinking water is a necessity not only for humanity but also for the all living organisms available in the earth today but the availability of the potable water is not in abundant amount hence clean water is scarce in the world today solar desalination system is used to turn the saline water into the freshwater by use of sunrays solar still is a device which can be employed for desalination as the daily productivity of solar distiller is low so multiple techniques have been used by various researchers to improve its productivity but work done on the fins to enhance the distillate output is not much fin is a low cost heat transfer enhancement which is used by many researchers in the solar thermal applications present review paper shows the use of fins in solar still and how it can be used to enhance the distillate output of solar still at last a table is also presented to show the use of fins to increase the distillate output alone and with the use of certain materials graphical abstract image 1 abbreviations nf number of fins mw mass of water in the storage tank pcm phase change materials gi galvanized iron 1 introduction pure drinking water is the choice element of human plants and animals on earth about 97 of the earth s water is available as salt water in oceans and the remaining 3 as freshwater in the form of ice groundwater lakes and rivers which supply most human and animal needs so the requirement of pure drinking water is a significant challenge for all solar desalination is the best method to convert the salty water into pure drinkable form solar still is a simple device which converts the saltwater into pure drinkable form but the lower efficiency and less productivity is the major problem of solar still awasthi et al 2018 mohan et al 2019 panchal 2010 2011 2016a 2016b 2018 gawande et al 2013 panchal and shah 2013a solar energy intensity remains higher during noon hence the water temperature remains more elevated and the condensation temperature also remains higher the temperature of the water does not only depend on the water temperature but also lower condensation temperature panchal and shah 2013b panchal et al 2018 panchal and patel 2017 rai et al 2013 it is required to store the excess of heat during the noon and utilized during the off sunshine hours therefore sensible heat storage materials have been used by many researchers to store the excess heat during the noon and use it during the off sunshine hours hitesh et al 2019a panchal et al 2017 panchal 2016 sathish kumar and raja bharathi 2013 panchal 2015 dinesh babu and venkata ramanan 2017 panchal et al 2010 akash bilal et al 1998 kalidasa murugavel et al 2010 nafey et al 2001 many researchers have also used latent heat storage materials hitesh et al 2019b hitesh and sadasivuni 2019 abhat 1983 buddhi et al 2003 sharma et al 2000 latent heat storage materials release the heat and increase the temperature the fixed amount of solar rays available in the solar still and due to intermittent solar rays the temperature of the water does not remain higher instead of the use of an only conventional solar still if the collector is used then the water temperature would be obtaining higher flat plate collector panchal et al 2011a thakar et al 2014 vala et al 2018 has been used by many researchers to supply the hot water to the solar still it is a simple solar thermal device which can be provided with hot water later evacuated tubes anchal and anuradha 2017 panchal et al 2011b panchal and hemin 2016 panchal and shah 2013c panchal and shah 2014b panchal and shah 2014 sampathkumar et al 2013 singh et al 2013 have been used by many researchers evacuated tubes can be coupled directly with the solar still or it can be connected with the solar still with the help of piping at present to improve the distillate output either flat plate collector or evacuated tubes can be employed from the above kinds of literature it has been found that solar still is a beneficial device which can produce potable water from saline or brackish water many researchers have tried their ideas to enhance the distillate output of solar still by sensible and latent heat storage materials flat plate collector evacuated tubes collector and many more the heat transfer depends on the surface area and fin is a simple device used to improve the heat transfer the work done on the fins in solar still is much hence the main objective of the review paper is to study the use of fins in the solar still for the improvement in distillate output 2 use of fins in solar still heat transfer is a critical parameter while designing any solar thermal applications fin is a straightforward device which can be used in the solar still to increase the surface area increment of the surface area leads to heat transfer researchers have used fins in the solar still to increase the surface area of water and hence the increment of water temperature 2 1 effect of pin fin to increase the distillate output of solar still rabhi et al 2017 had carried out experiments on solar still with the use of pin fin and condenser their main aim was to conduct experiments on conventional solar still with the use of pin fin and condenser they carried out experiments in three cases e g conventional solar still modified solar still with pin fin and modified solar still with pin fin and condenser they obtained higher distillate output in modified solar still with pin fin and condenser they also found that the pin fin increases the surface area hence water temperature rises and condenser improves the condensation fig 1 shows the experimental set up of modified solar still with pin fin and condenser another experiment was conducted between the conventional solar still and modified solar still with use of pin fin wick by alaian et al 2016 the use of the pin fin wick is to increase the surface area alongwith the even distribution of water in the solar still basin several experiments have been conducted on modified solar still to see the increment in distillate output an experimental study is carried out between conventional solar still and solar still with pin finned wick by the result shows in fig 2 that solar still with pin finned wick gives 23 higher productivity than the conventional one 2 2 effect of materials of fin on distillate output of solar still el sebaii and el naggar 2017 investigated the performance of solar still with use of different materials of the fin actually they want to determine the effect of fin material on increment in distillate output they have carried out several tests on solar still with varying the materials of the fins from their results it has been concluded that there is no significant effect on the distillate output by varying the fin materials 2 3 effect of fin configuration on distillate output of solar still el sebaii et al 2015 experimentally investigate the effect of fin configuration parameters on solar still they used single basin solar still with variations of the fin height and thickness of fins it is found that increasing the number of fin and width of the fin the productivity decreases as shown in fig 3 also it is observed that the performance of the fin increases with the increase of fin height 2 4 use of fins to reduce the heat loss from the solar still the main reason behind the lower productivity of solar still is the higher heat loss i e bottom side and top hence to reduce the heat losses from the solar still an acrylic sheet is used in the casing of the still by manokar and winston 2017 they used acrylic sheet along with the aluminium fins are attached at the basin of the still to increase productivity due to the low thermal conductivity of acrylic material the heat losses found lower as compared with the conventional solar still hence the temperature of the modified solar still found higher as compared with the conventional one 2 5 comparison of circular and

12123,the quality of groundwater for irrigation was assessed in warri and the surrounding area using america public health association standard apha method of analysis the following results were obtained from different constituents that influence the water quality for irrigation electrical conductivity was found within the range 207 1163 soluble sodium percentage ssp was found between 1 12

plotted with chadha revealed that the water shows little characteristics of na hco3 and na cl water types while for gibbs plot it revealed that groundwater chemistry is controlled dominantly by rock weathering processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry groundwater irrigation sodium percentage niger delta basin sar residual sodium bicarbonate 1 introduction niger delta region of nigeria is richly blessed with natural resources such as crude oil and water resources however the exploration and exploitation of these natural resources have not been managed by the government and inhabitant of the area as supposed as a result oil bunkering activities oil spillages illegal refining of crude and other fast practices have become the order of the day and have affected both the aquatic life and quality of water in most parts of this area a major oil producing community in this region water resources in this area occur majorly as surface water and groundwater resources although these water resources are evenly distributed in the area the water needs of the inhabitants are not met due to natural and anthropogenic influences that cause pollution in the area especially the surface water bodies this makes groundwater resources more reliable for domestic and irrigation in warri niger delta region because it is not easily contaminated due to the overlying formation on the aquifer but quality water is required for better yield of agricultural crops and for domestic use barik and pattanayak 2019 jasrotia et al 2019 however the quality of the groundwater resources is subject to confirmation as a result of the closeness of warri town to the coast this makes the water easily prone to intrusion by the salt water from the coastal aquifer salty water above threshold poses a major threat to plants and animals with a few exceptions most terrestrial plants cannot survive salty environment salt water the high acidity of saltwater with its corresponding high density and high concentration of dissolved solutes makeabsorption of nutrient from soils difficult for irrigated plants gupta and gupta 1987 hence this abundant and available resource for agriculture in the area should be certified fit before its use for irrigation irrigation therefore is a modern approach to agriculture in most parts of the globe especially in the developing nations of the world of which nigeria is a part of reza et al 2013 eyankware et al 2018 since agriculture is a major driving force of many nations economy quality water for irrigation will be a major factor to bring about

soils mh was calculated using eqn 3 high concentration of magnesium in water has negative influence on crop yields as the soil becomes more alkaline sai 2010 the value of mh ranges from 9 52 to 93 33 with an average value of 50 22 mh value less than or equal to 50 is suggestive of suitability for irrigation while any value above this threshold is considered unfit 50 of the sampled area represented by sample wa nb 03 04 09 10 13 14 15 16 18 19 24 25 27 28 29 are considered fit for irrigation while the remaining samples are considered unfit for irrigation 3 4 sodium percentage na sodium percentage is an important criterion for defining the type of water for irrigation is an important factor used to study sodium hazard doneen 1964 the value of na ranges from 2 56 to 280 00 with an

falls within doubtful to unsuitable this implies that it is not fit for irrigation 3 5 sodium adsorption ratio sar the concentrations of na ca2 and mg2 in analyzed water samples are studied using sar this takes into consideration the fact that high sodium concentration in natural water is controlled by the presence of calcium and magnesium ions therefore when sar value is less than 10 the water is excellent for irrigation and has no effect on the soil if the value rises above 18 but less than 26 serious physical soil problems occur and plants have difficulty absorbing water the value of sar ranges from 0 02 to 1 31 with average value of 0 44 samples location wa nb 01 to 30 values are considered fit for irrigation as shown in fig 5 and tables 4 and 5 from fig 5 the region s1 shows low

irrigation 3 6 kelly ratio kr kelly ratio is a parameter introduced to evaluate water quality for irrigation based on the level of sodium ion measured against calcium and magnesium ions kelly 1963 water with kr 1 is suitable for irrigation whereas water with kr 1 is suggestive of unsuitability for agricultural purpose due to alkali hazards kr values range from 0 02 to 133 33 with average value

and table 4 class i and class ii waters are categorized as good for irrigation and class iii waters are unsuitable with 25 of maximum permeability the sampled points fall within class ii which implies that the water is considered good for irrigation as shown in fig 6 3 9 electrical conductivity ec ec in the study area ranges from 207 to 1263 μs cm with an average value of 639 28 μs cm table 3 this parameter is related to the concentration of salts dissolved in water salinity from table 2 sample location wa nb 17 is within the c1 category that is excellent class while wa nb 08 09 10 11 12 14 15

of nigeria is richly blessed with natural resources such as crude oil and water resources however the exploration and exploitation of these natural resources have not been managed by the government and inhabitant of the area as supposed as a result oil bunkering activities oil spillages illegal refining of crude and other fast practices have become the order of the day and have affected both the aquatic life and quality of water in most parts of this area a major oil producing community in this region water resources in this area occur majorly as surface water and groundwater resources although these water resources are evenly distributed in the area the water needs of the inhabitants are not met due to natural and anthropogenic influences that cause pollution in the area especially the surface water bodies this makes groundwater resources more reliable for domestic and irrigation in warri niger delta region because it is not easily contaminated due to the overlying formation on the aquifer but quality water is required for better yield of agricultural crops and for domestic use barik and pattanayak 2019 jasrotia et al 2019 however the quality of the groundwater resources is subject to confirmation as a result of the closeness of warri town to the coast this makes the water easily prone to intrusion by the salt water from the coastal aquifer salty water above threshold poses a major threat to plants and animals with a few exceptions most terrestrial plants cannot survive salty environment salt water the high acidity of saltwater with its corresponding high density and high concentration of dissolved solutes makeabsorption of nutrient from soils difficult for irrigated plants gupta and gupta 1987 hence this abundant and available resource for agriculture in the

12124,bangladesh is a riverine country but its north western part popularly known as barind tract is mostly drought prone and faces scarcity of water because of very limited surface water resource groundwater is the main source of water for drinking and irrigation purposes the increasing demand and withdrawal of groundwater result permanent depletion of groundwater level gwl due to low infiltration capacity the monsoon rainwater cannot percolate through thick surface clay layer barind clay of pleistocene age so an attempt is made in the present study for artificial recharge of aquifer by adopting managed aquifer recharge mar model through recharge well rw and recharge shaft rs installed in khari canal bed for infiltrating flowing rainy season storm water the study also compares performance and effectiveness of application of conventional mar model with the modified engineering model as viable adaptive menu to restore the depleting gwl the conventional mar model has functioned well initially but recharge rate rr has gradually reduced 1 5 2 5 l min from the initial stage 28 64 48 0 l min due to clogging of the recharge units with clay barind clay to improve the recharge capacity modification of the engineering design in mar model has been adopted and their performance have been assessed in modified mar model it is possible to replace clogged sand layer any time even during storm water surge in the khari performance was more effective with increased amount of recharge than that of conventional one in the long run moreover the groundwater quality has improved due to dilution process and found suitable for drinking purpose within acceptable and allowable limits of bdws 2005 and who 2008 finally in depth research activities and regular monitoring

of recharge structures in march 2012 rs was constructed at the bed of rasulpur khari by excavating up to 36 5 m depth and filled with sand brick wall of 1 16 m diameter and 0 15 m height was constructed to prevent higher load of clayey materials at the bottom later in 2013 rw was constructed at the bed of sormongla khari to filtrate storm water through 3 m diameter and 3 m deep filter pit filled with coarse sand and gravel at its top the upvc blind pipe and strainer with nominal slot width 1 52 mm and open area 20 were used in rw the construction of rw structures at sormongla khari and rs at rasulpur khari are shown in fig 6 a b the annular space between the casing assembly and the borehole wall was shrouded by 4 10 mm size pea gravel to monitor the gwl phss were installed near recharge units at khari sides the quantity of storm water was measured that helped to calculate the rr liter min by pouring water into the recharge units volumetrically during dry season in dried up khari the measurement of rr and subsequent gwl recording in the kharis are shown in plate 1 a c during monsoon period after submergence of khari thick clay are deposited as clogging material at top of the sandy layer in recharge structures which are replaced by clean sandy materials time to time and then quantity of recharged amount of water has measured to measure the rr the water measuring recharge box has filled up with storm water entered through pipe to a certain height then the pipes have closed by tightening the caps to prevent the entrance storm water into the measuring units further water height inside the units has reduced with time due to recharging process to the aquifer recharge quantity q has calculated by multiplying the reduced height of storm water at certain time interval inside the recharge structure thus the average rr has calculated as reduced height of water h inside diameter of measuring structure d and time t then quantity of recharged amount of water q π d 2 h 4 and r r q t the groundwater quality was assessed during the pre and post mar model implementation stages the depth of gwl was also monitored regularly for performance analysis of rw and rs structures performance of recharge structure with modified mar model to improve the performance of rw and rs structures their designs have modified to protect the clogging problem for reversing the declining trend of the groundwater rr here the brick wall has constructed as hollow cylindrical shape with diameter 3 5 m and height of 2 m in the rw site in sormongla khari on 5 june 2016 the water entrance pipes covered by nylon mesh in rw were fitted horizontally at 0 6 m height at 0 15 m interval above the khari bed this type of construction in rw is effective as highly suspended clay turbid materials in storm water could not enter through entrance pipe of hollow cylindrical structure and create clogging problem here caps are used to close and open the pipes at the inner side of the wall in available storm water in the khari the water control structure has filled and the pipe is closed the storm water inside the recharge units has infiltrated to the aquifer and at one stage the measuring structure has got empty thus the recharged quantity has calculated moreover top sand layer of recharge structure has replaced by the fresh sand at a certain time interval for continuous operation of mar model in case of rasulpur khari 1 5 m diameter and 1 5 m height brick wall was made around the rs structure and the structure has filled with coarse sand and 4 10 mm gravel there has no opening in the wall up to 0 6 m from the bed of khari the runoff water entered easily into the structure horizontally and goes vertically through filtration media into aquifer with comparatively

absorption spectrometer ass and that of cl no3 so4 2 and po4 have measured by using spectrophotometer the parameters obtained from laboratory analysis were compared with the bangladesh drinking water standard bdws 2005 and world health organization who 2008 standards as recommended for drinking purposes and results are shown in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of conventional mar technique recharge well rw in sormongla khari to calculate the value of rr water is poured through rw structure when the khari has dried during summer season the calculated values of rr are shown in

down the recharge process and ultimately hardly any recharge occurs the clogged rw clay on the top sandy layer in sormongla khari is shown in plate 1 d the clogging clay layer on top of sand layer in rw was then replaced with fresh sand particles the gwl hydrograph after beginning of the recharge process through mar model for the period of june 26 2013 to february 2 2015 is shown in fig 8 a and reveals that it has started to rise for couple of weeks and months and then started to slowing down declining gradually due to clogging effect of clay particles on the top of the sandy layer in the rw

hydrograph after starting the recharge process through modified mar model in rw structure fig 8a reveals that after submergence of the khari gwl has a rising trend due to lower clogging effect in the top sand layers of recharge structure recharge shaft rs in rasulpur khari here the modified mar model with rs works in the same way as that of rw in sormongla khari the performance of this modified mar model with rs reveals that gwl started to rise when storm water is available in the khari fig 8b but after 2016 the storm water in khari has used mostly purpose for irrigation and has been pumped

12124,bangladesh is a riverine country but its north western part popularly known as barind tract is mostly drought prone and faces scarcity of water because of very limited surface water resource groundwater is the main source of water for drinking and irrigation purposes the increasing demand and withdrawal of groundwater result permanent depletion of groundwater level gwl due to low infiltration capacity the monsoon rainwater cannot percolate through thick surface clay layer barind clay of pleistocene age so an attempt is made in the present study for artificial recharge of aquifer by adopting managed aquifer recharge mar model through recharge well rw and recharge shaft rs installed in khari canal bed for infiltrating flowing rainy season storm water the study also compares performance and effectiveness of application of conventional mar model with the modified engineering model as viable adaptive menu to restore the depleting gwl the conventional mar model has functioned well initially but recharge rate rr has gradually reduced 1 5 2 5 l min from the initial stage 28 64 48 0 l min due to clogging of the recharge units with clay barind clay to improve the recharge capacity modification of the engineering design in mar model has been adopted and their performance have been assessed in modified mar model it is possible to replace clogged sand layer any time even during storm water surge in the khari performance was more effective with increased amount of recharge than that of conventional one in the long run moreover the groundwater quality has improved due to dilution process and found suitable for drinking purpose within acceptable and allowable limits of bdws 2005 and who 2008 finally in depth research activities and regular monitoring and maintenance are necessary for fruitful operation of mar model to elevate the water scarcity for drinking and irrigation purposes in the area graphical abstract image 1 keywords performance modified mar model storm water management barind tract bangladesh 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of water for drinking irrigation and domestic purpose in bangladesh and plays an important role in sustaining country s economy environment and livelihood rahaman 2018 the benefits of utilizing groundwater in developing countries have clearly demonstrated that the aquifer provides a good storage alexander 1995 if the groundwater is utilized and managed effectively it can play a vital role for increased food production with reliable drinking irrigation facilities gale et al 2002 in this context technique like the managed aquifer recharge mar previously known as artificial recharge a water banking system is adopted as a viable drought adaptation measure for subsequent recovery of depleted groundwater resource future use and environmental benefits dillon 2005 the mar model is an engineered system and its basic purpose is to recharge aquifer artificially where rainwater is put in the underground for subsequent movement restoring the resource where gwl is depleting due to insufficient recharge and over exploitation cgwb 2000 bhattacharya 2010 the national water management plan nwmp of bangladesh considers drought as a major water deficiency issue in the water scarce and agro based barind tract where the agricultural water demand needs to be balanced with drinking water for the livelihood and environment brammer 1996 alexander 1995 rasheed 2008 the rate of groundwater withdrawal and extension of irrigated agriculture in the tract has increased gradually causing lowering of gwl at alarming rate since the beginning of last decades and never comes back to its original level even at the end of rainy season rahman et al 2017 the natural groundwater recharge capacity to aquifer through barind clay is very poor due to its low infiltration capacity 2 3 mm day jahan et al 2010a and at the same time no significant artificial recharge facilities have been developed here so far for storm water management in khari where runoff water is flowing towards river basin during rainy season jahan et al 2015 the groundwater irrigation demand is increasing here day by day so the conservation of runoff storm water as well as groundwater augmentation through application of mar model is a demand of time there is huge potential for the application of this model to recharge the aquifer artificially by storm water flowing through the kharies in the area iwm 2006 2012 as the erosion of the top surface clay is high so clogging of clay materials has created challenge for mar model operation it lowers the capacity of infiltration rate in mar model and usually conventional mar model is not working fruitfully o hare et al 1986 kumar and aiyagari 1997 bouwer 2002 bgs 2002 in this context the mar model with modified engineering design has been constructed in the bed of kharies for recharging artificially the aquifer by runoff storm water the aim of the present study is threefold 1 to assess the effectiveness of the conventional and modified mar model through rw and rs structures for storm water management of the kharies 2 to determine the operational constrains and 3 to evaluate the performance of modified mar model in the drought prone barind tract this is the pioneer attempt of application of mar model in khari for storm water management and its performance analysis in the country 2 study area in the barind tract mar model has been implemented with rw at sormongla khari near paromanondopur village in godagari upazila and through rs at rasulpur khari near rasulpur village in niamatpur upazila in rajshahi and naogaon districts respectively district and upazila are second and third tiers of the administrative units from top in bangladesh location map of the study area along with digital elevation model and physiography is shown in fig 1 a and b the area has the focus of strong agricultural development over last 30 years with increasing agricultural productivity here cultivated land and settlement area are 82 and 9 respectively but only 20 of that area is under surface water irrigation coverage these surface water bodies mostly get dry up during summer seasons rahman and mahbub 2012 islam 2017 the area is characterized by north south oriented dome shaped tract with irregular to highly irregular topography high drainage density less rainfall and thick top surface clay having less potentiality of groundwater resource jahan et al 2007 2015 the tract is edged parallel by valleys of major rivers like the padma in the south the atrai in the east and the mahananda in the west the area has limited scope to conserve storm water in ponds kharies etc and ultimately flows to the nearby river valleys through significant numbers of derelict kharies jahan and ahmed 1997 the kharies are re excavated recently by the water management institutions like the barind multipurpose development authority bmda the bangladesh water development board bwdb the local government engineering department lged etc who are working in water sector for agriculture and domestic supply in the area many cross check dams have been constructed on the kharies to conserve flowing storm runoff water for supplementary irrigation use in 5 7 months annually after rainy season it also gears up the natural recharge process for augmentation of groundwater resource for future uses the groundwater potentiality study of the tract using geospatial technologies like rs and gis based multi criteria analysis shows mostly poor to very poor zones 60 of the total area rahaman 2018 on the other hand more than 15000 deep tubewells dtws have been installed for groundwater withdrawal for irrigation purposes bmda 2017 18 with total of nearly 23000 including private owned this huge amount of groundwater withdrawal put threat on resource sustainability jahan et al 2010b rahman et al 2016a 2016b 2017 3 methodology the rainfall data for the period of 2002 2015 have collected from rain gauge stations rgss established by bmda in each upazila of the study area monthly average and annual rainfall status of godagari and niamatpur
