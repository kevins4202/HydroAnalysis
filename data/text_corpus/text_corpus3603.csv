18015,the co ion and counter ion sorption of monovalent na k cl and no3 and divalent ions ca2 and so4 2 in commercial neosepta ion exchange membranes were systemically studied in both single and binary salt systems the new generation of neosepta cation exchange membrane cse showed a significant difference in water uptake and co ion sorption compared to the earlier generation cmx use of the manning model confirmed that there were significant differences between these membranes with the estimated value of the manning parameter changing from 1 0 0 1 for cmx to 2 8 0 5 for cse there were fewer differences between the two neosepta anion exchange membranes amx and ase in single salt solutions potassium sorbed most strongly into the cation exchange membranes but in binary salt mixtures calcium dominated due to donnan exclusion at low concentrations while these trends were expected the sorption behaviour in the anion exchange membranes was more complex the water uptake of both amx and ase was shown to be the greatest in na2so4 solutions this strong water uptake was reflected in strong sorption of sulphate ions in a single salt solution conversely in a binary salt mixture with nacl sulphate sorption fell significantly at higher concentrations this was possibly caused by ion pairing within the solution as well as the strongly hydrophobic nature of styrene in the charged polymer water uptake was lowest in nano3 solutions even though sorption of the nitrate ion was comparable to that of chloride in these single salt solutions in the binary mixture nitrate was absorbed more strongly than chloride these results could be due to the low surface charge density of this ion allowing it to bond more strongly with the hydrophobic polymeric backbone at the exclusion of water and other ions graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion exchange membrane sorption binary calcium nitrate sulphate 1 introduction the transport of ions through ion exchange membranes is a critical factor to maximise energy efficiency and productivity in the electromembrane processes used in water treatment such as electrodialysis arola et al 2019 kim et al 2012 van der bruggen et al 2003 2004 donnan dialysis durmaz et al 2005 electrodialysis with bipolar membranes li et al 2016 reverse electrodialysis kim et al 2019 vermaas et al 2013 and membrane capacitive deionisation hassanvand et al 2018 ma et al 2020 these processes involve the selective migration of ionic species through charged polymeric membranes often made from dense non porous polymers that have anionic and or cationic fixed charged groups sata 2004 these fixed charged groups are typically sulfonic acid groups so3 for cation exchange membranes and amine groups nh3 nrh2 nr2h for anion exchange membranes commercial applications of these electromembrane processes are often hindered by the limited ion selectivity high electrical resistance and high manufacturing costs of the ion exchange membranes iems strathmann 2010 to overcome these hurdles a fundamental understanding of the ion sorption diffusion and transport properties in exchange membrane materials is required to advance the design and fabrication of high performance cost effective membranes ion transport through iems is governed by the absorption of the ionic species into the membrane and their migration through the membrane phase sata et al 2002 hence ion sorption or ion partitioning between the iem and the surrounding electrolyte solution is an important transport property of ion exchange membranes fan and yip 2019 geise et al 2012 it has been reported that ion mobility affinity of the competing ions galama et al 2014 sata et al 2002 van der bruggen et al 2004 the concentration of charged groups bound to the membrane matrix i e ion exchange capacity kamcev et al 2017b and water uptake of the membrane geise et al 2014 ju et al 2010 can affect the ultimate ion sorption direct measurements of sorption equilibria have been performed in many studies in single electrolyte systems galizia et al 2019 kamcev et al 2016b 2017a 2018 le et al 2009 martí calatayud et al 2014 pintauro and bennion 1984 however it is of practical importance to quantify and obtain a better understanding of the competitive absorption of a mixture of ions in commercial iems this has been conducted by a number of research groups who have used various cation exchange membranes bontha and pintauro 1994 chapotot et al 1994 palomo and pintauro 2003 pintauro et al 1995 and anion exchange membranes guesmi et al 2010 hannachi et al 2013 malewitz et al 2007 mostly by varying the mixing ratios of the two divalent and monovalent ions at a fixed total concentration an equilibrium uptake model based on a key assumption that membranes are considered as an array of cylindrical pores of identical radius with fixed charge groups uniformly distributed on the pore wall surface was proposed by the pintauro group in the 1990s and since then mainly applied to ion sorption in nafion membranes bontha and pintauro 1994 palomo and pintauro 2003 pintauro et al 1995 however to quantitatively account for not only the properties of polymer chains but also the non ideal behavior in the membranes a thermodynamically based framework was developed recently by kamcev et al 2015b kamcev et al 2016 based on manning s counter ion condensation theory the non ideal behavior in the membrane is described by the electrostatic interactions between the fixed charged groups within the polymer matrix and the electrolyte ions present similar to an electrolyte solution where non ideal behaviour is quantified by an activity coefficient such non ideality can be evaluated based on the concentration dependence of the counter and co ion activity in the iems kamcev et al 2015b in an ion exchange membrane the ions of opposite charge to the fixed charge groups are called counter ions while those of the same charge are called co ions when equilibrium is established between a charged membrane and an electrolyte solution for a monovalent electrolyte e g nacl the thermodynamic condition is often given by sata 2004 1 a m a m a s a s where a is the activity superscripts m and s refer to the membrane and external solution respectively and subscripts and denote counter ion e g na for cems and cl for aems and co ion e g cl for cems and na for aems respectively the activity of an ion is the product of the concentration and the activity coefficient in the same phase the thermodynamic condition for a co ion within a monovalent electrolyte can be rewritten as eq 2 full derivation of this expression can be found in the original paper published by kamcev et al 2016b 2 c m c fix m 2 4 γ s 2 γ m γ m c s s 2 c fix m 2 where c m the co ion concentration within the membrane is a function of the fixed charge group concentration c fix m the concentration in the external salt solution c s s the external salt solution mean activity coefficient γ s and the activity coefficient of co ion and counter ion in the membrane γ m and γ m the ratio of activity coefficients for a monovalent salt is defined in donnan theory as 3 γ γ s 2 γ m γ m while the activity coefficients of ions in the external salt solution can be estimated by the pitzer model those in the membrane can be related to a dimensionless linear charge density of the

volume of sorbed water a similar expression can be found in the supporting information eq s 1 for when a cation exchange membrane is in equilibrium with an m x2 type salt solution e g cacl2 or when an anion exchange membrane is in equilibrium with an m2 x type salt solution e g na2so4 in this work the sorption equilibria of ions in two cation exchange membranes cems namely cmx and cse and two anion exchange membranes aems namely amx and ase are studied over a total salt concentration range of 0 01 m 1 m these are commercially available iems manufactured by astom corporation japan and are categorised as standard grade with high mechanical strength the investigation of co ion and counter ion solubility i e partition coefficient is carried out in solutions containing single cations na k ca for cems and single anions cl no3 so4 2 in aems as well as their binary mixtures the ion sorption framework based on manning s counter ion condensation theory as described above is employed to gain insight in the relationship between structural material characteristics and ion sorption properties within these membranes the quantification of single and binary ion sorption in iems presented in this work will improve the understanding of the principal phenomena governing ion transport and separation in electromembrane processes such as electrodialysis reverse electrodialysis and capacitive de ionisation this is vital for the future development of highly efficient ion exchange membranes to advance water purification processes 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercially available anion exchange membranes neosepta amx and ase and cation exchange membranes neosepta cmx and cse were used in this study these are standard grade homogeneous membranes with high mechanical strength as summarized in table 1 the cation exchange membranes consist of a styrene based copolymer functionalized with negatively charged sulfonated groups while the anion exchange membranes have a base polymer of styrene crosslinked with divinyl benzene with strongly basic groups as the positive fixed charges while the charged polymers are similar within the two cems and the aems the backing fabric changes from polyvinyl chloride in cmx and amx to mixtures of polyethylene and polypropylene in cse and ase the proportions of polymer and reinforcement are also different between these membranes this leads to differences in membrane characteristics such as thickness electric resistance burst strength and ion exchange capacity iec table 1 sodium chloride nacl 99 7 potassium chloride kcl 99 0 and calcium chloride anhydrous cacl2 98 sodium nitrate nano3 99 and sodium sulphate na2so4 99 were procured from chem supply australia to prepare salt solutions at different concentrations caesium chloride cscl

water to remove residual solvent not associated with the fixed charged groups they were then dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 48 h following this the dry mass m d thickness and diameter

sorption following water pre soaking the cation exchange membranes i e cmx and cse were soaked in 1 m hcl to remove the previously sorbed ions and replace them with the h form due to the limited ph tolerance of the anion exchange membranes amx and ase these membranes were used directly after water pre soaking the membranes were then immersed in 80 ml salt solutions of different concentrations c s s for 48 h to reach equilibrium after which the membranes were transferred to water of a known volume 80 ml for a further 48 h during the second water soaking period the adsorbed co ions were released into the water the concentration of co ions in these water samples were later measured to determine the co ion concentrations in the membranes c m the cem membranes were then moved to a 0 1 m cscl solution to release the absorbed counter ions through the uptake of the caesium ions similarly the aem membranes were placed in a 0 1 m nai solution to exchange the adsorbed counter ions with iodide the concentrations of ions in these solutions were later measured to determine the fixed charge concentrations in the membranes c f i x m the concentration of counter ions c m within the

of 1 2 in eq 9 account for the valency of ca2 in cems and so4 2 in aems as counter ions because a each mobile divalent ion is associated with two mobile co ions and b each divalent counter ion is bound to two fixed charge groups in the ion exchange membrane all concentrations were expressed in eq l swollen membrane unless eqs 1 5 were considered in which case eq l water sorbed was used ion

used for equilibrating the cems were nacl kcl and cacl2 solutions from 0 01 m to 1 m and binary solutions of equimolar cation concentrations of nacl kcl and nacl cacl2 similarly the aems were equilibrated in nacl nano3 and na2so4 solutions from 0 01 m to 1 m and binary solutions of equimolar cation concentrations of nacl nano3 and nacl na2so4 the concentrations of cations i e sodium potassium and calcium were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes 720 es varian the concentrations of anions i e chloride nitrate and sulphate were determined using ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 1000 3 results and discussion 3 1 water uptake the water uptake of the ion exchange membranes equilibrated in different salt solutions is presented in fig 1 as shown in table 1 the fixed charges of these membranes are either strongly negative i e so3 group in cmx and cse or strongly positive in amx and ase the water uptake presented for all neosepta iems studied in this work is within the typical range reported in the literature 0 14 0 46 g h2o g dry membrane strathmann 2004 membrane swelling caused by water absorbed into the charged polymer has a direct influence on the absorption and transport of ions with iems water enters the polymer matrix to hydrate both the fixed charged groups and their counter ions stretching the polymer network however the elastic forces that result from crosslinking resist the polymer stretching and thus the amount of water that can enter the network the water uptake is therefore a trade off between these two effects helfferich 1962 kamcev 2016 water uptake is affected by the concentration and type of fixed charged groups and the degree of crosslinking water uptake is also related to the hydrated radius of the counter ions the counter ion valency and how it interacts with the fixed charge group galizia et al 2017 strathmann 2004 the hydrated radius is similar between na and k 3 58 å and 3 31 å and is higher for ca2 4 12 å however for the cation exchange membranes fig 1 a the water uptake of cmx and cse is the highest in nacl solutions but is similar between kcl and cacl2 within experimental error similar trends have been reported by bonner et al bonner and smith 1957 for sulfonated polystyrene resins and galizia et al 2017 for cross linked poly p styrene sulfonate co divinylbenzene for the anion exchange membranes fig 1 b the water uptake of both amx and ase is shown to be the greatest in na2so4 solutions and the lowest in nano3 solutions in this case the hydrated radii of cl no3 and so4 2 are 3 32 å 3 35 å and 3 79 å respectively in binary solutions the amount of water uptake mostly lies between the water uptake values of the respective single salt solutions this is the case for both cse and ase membranes as shown in fig 1 the backing fabric is changed from polyvinyl chloride for cmx to mixtures of polyethylene and polypropylene for cse which weighs less per unit area table 1 the percentage water uptake for the cation exchange membranes also changes on a mass basis declining from 0 37 0 44 g g for cmx to 0 28 0 33 g g for cse fig 1 a the swollen cmx membranes are greater in both volume and thickness have a higher membrane resistance and lower iec the water uptake however appears to be similar between amx and ase 18 28 as shown in table 1 the dry mass is lower for the ase membranes than the amx membranes while the iec is higher the swollen amx membranes are thinner than the ase membranes and the membrane resistance reported by the manufacturer is similar between amx and ase however these changes do not seem to affect greatly the percentage of water sorbed per dry mass of membrane or the swollen membrane volume although changes have been made to the content of the polymer and the backing fabric no information is available as to whether the degree of crosslinking or the type of fixed charged group has been altered therefore it is unclear how the changes in iec and the content in polymer and fabric backing ultimately leads to a similar water uptake between amx and ase fig 1 b finally it is known that water uptake also slightly decreases with increasing external salt concentrations due to osmotic de swelling kamcev 2016 khare and peppas 1995 paul et al 2008 this decline at high salt concentrations is observed for most cases presented in fig 1 3 2 co ion concentration in membranes both the concentrations of counter ion and co ion within the iems were measured most of the counter ions sorbed in the membrane are associated with the fixed charges within the polymer matrix but a very small portion of counter ions are required to neutralize any sorbed co ions in the membrane therefore this concentration of co ion is also referred to as the mobile salt concentration within the membrane geise et al 2012 kamcev et al 2015a since the co ion concentration in the desorption solution was very low for salt solutions of 0 01 m and 0 03 m we were not able to accurately determine these concentrations only co ion concentrations for external salt concentrations of greater than 0 1 m are reported co ions are restricted from entering the membrane due to repulsion by the fixed charge groups which generate an electrical potential known as the donnan potential at the membrane solution interface donnan 1924 as the external salt concentration increases this electrical potential declines due to charge screening allowing more co ions to be absorbed thus as expected the concentration of co ion i e the chloride concentration in cmx and cse and the sodium concentration in amx and ase increases with increasing external salt concentration fig 2 the donnan potential is inversely proportional to the counter ion valence galizia et al 2019 and thus the presence of divalent counter ions i e calcium in cems and sulphate in aems reduces the donnan potential which also results in a greater co ion concentration within the membrane experimental data for these single salt experiments are fitted to eq 6 for monovalent counter ions and eq s1 for divalent counter ions the fitting was performed using all three sets of data for each membrane treating the linear charge density of polymer ξ as the only fitting parameter this approach assumes that ξ does not depend significantly on the type of salt used kamcev et al 2016 within experimental error the estimated values of linear charge density reported in the caption of fig 2 are within the typical range 1 4 reported for polyelectrolyte systems kwak 1973 manning 1969 the ratio of activity coefficients between the solution and the membrane γ were also estimated by eq 3 for monovalent salts and eq s5 for divalent salts using the modelled values of co ion concentrations this parameter is presented in fig 3 a and b for cation exchange membranes and anion exchange membranes respectively γ decreases gradually from low to high external salt concentrations for all membranes similar trends were also reported by kamcev et al 2015b and galzia et al 2017 the activity coefficients of the external salt solutions in general decrease with concentration the decline in γ as a function of external salt concentration hence results from much lower activity coefficients in the membranes when external salt concentration is low as the concentration of external solution increases the ion concentration difference between the membrane phase and the external solution becomes smaller with γ slowly approaching unity for single electrolyte system the cl concentrations in the cse membrane are higher than that in cmx in all solutions fig 2 a and b however the na concentrations do not appear to vary between amx and ase when these anion exchange membranes are equilibrated with different counter ions i e cl no3 and so4 2 fig 2 c and d the estimated value of ξ changes from 1 0 0 1 for cmx to 2 8 0 5 in cse while within experimental error does not change between amx and ase 4 8 1 4 and 5 4 1 5 respectively similar to the water uptake results the change from amx to ase appears to have little effects on the fixed charge group properties it seems that the polymer itself was not changed which is partly confirmed by the description provided by the manufacturer table 1 for the cation exchange membranes the polymer changed from a styrene and divinyl benzene copolymer with sulfonic acid groups in cmx to a styrene based copolymer with sodium sulfonic acid groups in cse this has resulted in some changes to the fixed charge group properties as indicated by the change in the value of ξ the amount of water uptake in the cmx membrane as discussed previously is hence higher than that in the cse membrane due to the lack of information on the detailed chemistry of the polymers used and the exact relative portion of polymer to backing fabric in these commercial membranes further interpretation of the ξ has not been carried out for binary electrolyte systems it is also apparent that the co ion concentration increases steadily with external solution concentration fig 4 the concentration of co ion for the monovalent salt mixtures nacl kcl for cse in fig 4 a and nacl nano3 for ase in fig 4 b is lower than that for the monovalent and divalent salt mixtures nacl cacl2 for cse in fig 4 a and nacl na2so4 for ase in fig 4 b this is expected as the presence of divalent ions again decreases the donnan potential for co ions the concentrations of co ion in the iems for monovalent salt mixtures are similar to the concentrations observed in single salt experiments for monovalent and divalent mixtures however the co ion concentration sits between the values for the single monovalent salt experiments and the single divalent salt experiments 3 3 partition of counter ion in iems 3 3 1 cation exchange membranes the counter ion concentration in the cation exchange membranes expressed in moles per l of swollen membrane is presented in fig 5 the concentration of the counter ion in the iems is more sensitive to external salt concentration at values below 0 1 m after which the concentration begins to plateau the cation exchange membranes are initially in an h form as they were pre soaked in 1m hcl solution section 2 3 at low concentrations of the external solution not all h ions bound to the fixed charges can be replaced by na ions however as the external concentration increases provision of more counter ions in the external solution results in little further change as all fixed charge groups are occupied only slightly more counter ions are sorbed in cse than in cmx resulting from a greater iec but a smaller swollen membrane volume for cse the calcium concentration is around half of that of na and k due to its double charge showing a steady trend over the range of external salt concentrations the distribution of na and k within these neosepta membranes in a mixture of equimolar nacl and kcl solutions is reported here for the first time as presented in fig 5 b potassium is preferably absorbed by cse which is consistent with the results from the single salt sorption experiments at low salt concentrations fig 5 a a smaller hydrated radius of potassium and correspondingly a higher charge density is probably the reason for such a trend fig 5 b also presents the counter ion concentrations for a nacl cacl2 mixture in equimolar concentration which reveal a strong preference of the divalent ions over monovalent ions in the cse membrane the strong electrostatic forces between divalent cations and the fixed charged group leads to the preferential divalent counter ion sorption strathmann 2004 this is the basis of donnan exclusion theory donnan 1924 however as total salt concentrations increase the concentration of sodium in the membrane approaches that of calcium this is because the electrostatic forces are screened by the increasing charge from the ions in the solution reducing the extent of donnan exclusion for monovalent ions it should be noted that the calcium concentration in the binary system is very close to its concentration for the single salt case although the calcium concentrations in the external solutions were halved while the hydrated radii of ca2 is larger than that of na in this case the double charge of the former ion leads to stronger bonds with the fixed charged groups of the cse the partition coefficient of the counter ion for cmx and cse determined using eq 10 is presented in fig 6 for the single salt and binary salts experiments ion partitioning between ion exchange membranes and the surrounding salt solutions is governed by the concentration of charged groups bound to the membrane matrix geise et al 2012 lonsdale et al 1965 paul 2004 similar to counter ion concentration in mol l swollen membrane the partition coefficients are slightly higher for cse than cmx but both showing a declining trend with increasing external salt concentration for all three cations the partition of the counter ion is higher for a monovalent salt in comparison with a divalent one reflecting the changes in membrane concentration due to the double charge on the divalent ion and to donnan exclusion shown in fig 5 the selectivity between the ion pairs calculated by eq 11 is shown in fig 7 as expected the selectivity of na to k is around 1 due to the similarities between these two ions in a binary mixture cse selectively absorbed k as seen in fig 5 b probably due to the smaller hydrated radius of potassium a higher selectivity of ca2 in the membrane for a binary salt solution is in agreement with data reported by sata 2004 for a typical ion exchange membrane with sulfonate groups 3 3 2 anion exchange membranes similar experiments were conducted with different salts nacl nano3 and na2so4 to obtain the concentration of various counter ions within the neosepta anion exchange membranes the concentration of nitrate in both the amx and ase fig 8 a is lower than that of chloride expressed in mol l swollen membrane this trend is reversed when the amount of water uptake is taken into consideration fig s1 so that this concentration is expressed in mol l solution the water uptake is noticeably lower when the aems are equilibrated in nano3 solutions in comparison with nacl solutions fig 1 it is also more apparent that no3 is preferably absorbed when the membrane was equilibrated in binary salt solutions of nacl and nano3 fig 8 b unlike na and k in the cmx and cse membranes where the hydrated radii are noticeably different those of no3 and cl are much closer 3 35 å and 3 32 å respectively some researchers have reported that amx malewitz et al 2007 and nafion bontha and pintauro 1994 pintauro et al 1995 membranes selectively absorb the monovalent counter ion with a larger hard sphere radius cl 1 81 å no3 2 64 å and hence lower surface charge density this lower charge density may allow the no3 to bond more strongly with the hydrophobic polymeric backbone table 1 and may also explain the lower water uptake similar behaviour has been previously observed where hydrophobic resins demonstrated affinity towards perchlorate wang 2010 xiong et al 2007 sata sata 2000 2004 also showed a higher transport number for no3 over cl at different concentrations transport number ratio 1 luo et al 2018 also note that the permselectivity for no3 over cl is consistent with the hofmeister series hofmeister and hofmeister 1888 and the gibbs hydration energy for an equimolar binary mixture of nacl and na2so4 the concentration of so4 2 decreases with external solution concentration while that of cl increases fig 8 b these trends are different to what is observed for the monovalent and divalent counter ion mixture in cation exchange membranes the transport number of so4 2 relative to cl ions for different types of anion exchange membranes was also reported to be less than one in contrast to the relative ratio between no3 and cl sata 2000 the hydrophobic nature of styrene in aems could partly inhibit the absorption of sulphate ions which are strongly hydrated sata et al 1998 as the gibbs hydration energy of so4 2 is the highest among the three anions studied cl 370 kj mol no3 270 kj mol so4 2 1000 kj mol another reason is likely to be the formation of naso4 i e ion pairing within the solution at higher concentrations ion pairing has been identified as the cause of very low activity coefficients for sulphate in aqueous solutions buchner et al 1999 marcus and hefter 2006 as a monovalent ion naso4 would compete less effectively with cl within the anion exchange membrane however its full impact upon the activity and the ion partitioning in ion exchange membranes is still unknown and requires further study the partition coefficient of these counter ions determined using eq 10 are presented in fig 9 for the single salt and binary salts experiments similar to counter ion concentration in mol l swollen membrane the partition coefficients are similar between amx and ase but both showing a declining trend with increasing external salt concentration for all three anions the partition of the monovalent anions is higher than that of divalent anions in the case of single salt experiments this trend can again be justified both by the lower concentration in the membrane fig 8 and by the lower activity coefficient of the divalent ions in the bulk solution in comparison with that of monovalent ions the selectivity between the anion pairs determined by eq 11 is shown in fig 10 when considering single salt data the selectivity of no3 to cl is close to 1 but in a binary mixture ase selectively absorbs no3 as seen in fig 8 b with a ratio of partition coefficients of 3 5 this is in a similar range of values reported for anion exchange membranes with benzyl trimethylammonium groups sata et al 1998 a very low selectivity of so4 2 in the membrane for a binary salt solution is observed in agreement with the trends shown in fig 8 b for counter ion concentration 4 conclusions we have reported the sorption equilibria of ions in commercial neosepta ion exchange membranes including cmx and cse cation exchange membranes and amx and ase anion exchange membranes calcium has little impact on the water uptake in the cems while the presence of sulphate results in the highest water uptake among all anions the manning donnan model was employed to investigate the structural characteristics of these membranes as co ion concentration is determined by the donnan equilibrium between the membrane and the external solution the change in polymer composition from cmx to cse leads to a change in the manning s parameter this is consistent with the differences in sorption properties between cmx and cse the ion sorption characteristics however were found to be similar between amx and ase which was also confirmed from the similar manning s parameters obtained sorption of counter ion in the binary mixtures of these ions revealed very different trends of monovalent and divalent ion sorption between cse and ase while calcium dominates the fixed charge groups in cse the concentration of sodium in the membrane increases significantly with increasing external salt concentrations however the concentration of sulphate in the anion exchange membrane ase declines with external salt concentration while the concentration of chloride in the binary system increases this leads to very low selectivities between sulphate and chloride this unusual behavior could be due to the strong hydration of the sulphate anion and its interaction with the hydrophobic styrene in the charged polymer it may also relate to the formation of the ion pair naso4 as external concentrations increase nitrate ions also show unusual behavior in single salt solutions they absorb as strongly as chloride ions but with less water accompanying the uptake in binary mixtures the nitrate is able to exclude chloride this behavior may be related to the low surface charge density of the nitrate ion allowing it to interact more readily with the polymeric backbone the characterisation of ion sorption behavior in single and binary mixtures provides useful information for their future applications for these commercial membranes declaration of competing interest the

18015,the co ion and counter ion sorption of monovalent na k cl and no3 and divalent ions ca2 and so4 2 in commercial neosepta ion exchange membranes were systemically studied in both single and

fewer differences between the two neosepta anion exchange membranes amx and ase in single salt solutions potassium sorbed most strongly into the cation exchange membranes but in binary salt mixtures calcium dominated due to donnan exclusion at low concentrations while these trends were expected the sorption behaviour in the anion exchange membranes was more complex the water uptake of both amx and ase was shown to be the greatest in na2so4 solutions this strong water uptake was reflected in strong sorption of sulphate ions in a single salt solution conversely in a binary salt mixture with nacl sulphate sorption fell significantly at higher concentrations this was possibly caused by ion pairing within the solution as well as the strongly hydrophobic nature of styrene in the charged polymer water uptake was lowest in nano3 solutions even though sorption of the nitrate ion was comparable to that of chloride in these single salt solutions in the binary mixture nitrate was absorbed more strongly than chloride these results could be due to the low surface charge density of this ion allowing it to bond more strongly with the hydrophobic polymeric backbone at the exclusion of water

fixed charged groups sata 2004 these fixed charged groups are typically sulfonic acid groups so3 for cation exchange membranes and amine groups nh3 nrh2 nr2h for anion exchange membranes commercial applications of these electromembrane processes are often hindered by the limited ion selectivity high electrical resistance and high manufacturing costs of the ion exchange membranes iems strathmann 2010 to overcome these hurdles a fundamental understanding of the ion sorption diffusion and transport properties in exchange membrane materials is required to advance the design and fabrication of high performance cost effective membranes ion transport through iems is governed by the absorption of the ionic species into the membrane and their migration through the membrane phase sata et al 2002 hence ion sorption or ion partitioning between the iem and the surrounding electrolyte solution is an important transport property of ion exchange membranes fan and yip 2019 geise et al 2012 it has been reported that ion mobility affinity of the competing ions galama et al 2014 sata et al 2002 van der bruggen et al 2004 the concentration of charged groups bound to the membrane matrix i e ion exchange capacity kamcev et al 2017b and water uptake of the membrane geise et al 2014 ju et al 2010 can affect the ultimate ion sorption direct measurements of sorption equilibria have been performed in many studies in single electrolyte systems galizia et al 2019 kamcev et al 2016b 2017a 2018 le et al 2009 martí calatayud et al 2014 pintauro and bennion 1984 however it is of practical importance to quantify and obtain a better understanding of the competitive absorption of a mixture of ions in commercial iems this has been conducted by a number of research groups who have used various cation exchange membranes bontha and pintauro 1994 chapotot et al 1994 palomo and pintauro 2003 pintauro et al 1995 and anion exchange membranes guesmi et al 2010 hannachi et al 2013 malewitz et al 2007 mostly by varying the mixing ratios of the two divalent and monovalent ions at a fixed total concentration an equilibrium uptake model based on a key assumption that membranes are considered as an array of cylindrical pores of identical radius with fixed charge groups uniformly distributed on the pore wall surface was proposed by the pintauro group in the 1990s and since then mainly applied to ion sorption in nafion membranes bontha and pintauro 1994 palomo and pintauro 2003 pintauro et al 1995 however to quantitatively account for not only the properties of polymer chains but also the non ideal behavior in the membranes a thermodynamically based framework was developed recently by kamcev et al 2015b kamcev et al 2016 based on manning s counter ion condensation theory the non ideal behavior in the membrane is described by the electrostatic interactions between the fixed charged groups within the polymer matrix and the electrolyte ions present similar to an electrolyte solution where non ideal behaviour is quantified by an activity coefficient such non ideality can be evaluated based on the concentration dependence of the counter and co ion activity in the iems kamcev et al 2015b in an ion exchange membrane the ions of opposite charge to the fixed charge groups are called counter ions while those of the same charge are called co ions when equilibrium is established between a charged membrane and an electrolyte solution for a monovalent electrolyte e g nacl the thermodynamic condition is often given by sata 2004 1 a m a m a s a s where a is the activity superscripts m and s refer to the membrane and external solution respectively and subscripts and denote counter ion e g na for cems and cl for aems and co ion e g cl for cems and na for aems respectively the activity of an ion is the product of the concentration and the activity coefficient in the same phase the thermodynamic condition for a co ion within a monovalent electrolyte can be rewritten as eq 2 full derivation of this expression can be found in the original paper published by kamcev et al 2016b 2 c m c fix m 2 4 γ s 2 γ m γ m c s s 2 c fix m 2 where c m the co ion

γ m while the activity coefficients of ions in the external salt solution can be estimated by the pitzer model those in the membrane can be related to a dimensionless linear charge density of the

anion exchange membrane is in equilibrium with an m2 x type salt solution e g na2so4 in this work the sorption equilibria of ions in two cation exchange membranes cems namely cmx and cse and two anion exchange membranes aems namely amx and ase are studied over a total salt concentration range of 0 01 m 1 m these are commercially available iems manufactured by astom corporation japan and are categorised as standard grade with high mechanical strength the investigation of co ion and counter ion solubility i e partition coefficient is carried out in solutions containing single cations na k ca for cems and single anions cl no3 so4 2 in aems as well as their binary mixtures the ion sorption framework based on manning s counter ion condensation theory as described above is employed to gain insight in the relationship between structural material characteristics and ion sorption properties within these membranes the quantification of single and binary ion sorption in iems presented in this work will improve the understanding of the principal phenomena governing ion transport and separation in electromembrane processes such as electrodialysis reverse electrodialysis and capacitive de ionisation this is vital for the future development of highly efficient ion exchange membranes to advance water purification processes 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercially available anion exchange membranes neosepta amx and ase and cation exchange membranes neosepta cmx and cse were used in this study these are standard grade homogeneous membranes with high mechanical strength as summarized in table 1 the cation exchange membranes consist of a styrene based copolymer functionalized with negatively charged sulfonated groups while the anion exchange membranes have a base polymer of styrene crosslinked with divinyl benzene with strongly basic groups as the positive fixed charges while the charged polymers are similar within the two cems and the aems the backing fabric changes from polyvinyl chloride in cmx and amx to mixtures of polyethylene and polypropylene in cse and ase the proportions of polymer and reinforcement are also different between these membranes this leads to differences in membrane characteristics such as thickness electric resistance burst strength and ion exchange capacity iec table 1 sodium chloride nacl 99 7 potassium chloride kcl 99 0 and calcium chloride anhydrous cacl2 98 sodium nitrate nano3 99 and sodium sulphate na2so4 99 were procured from chem supply australia to prepare salt solutions at different concentrations caesium chloride cscl

water to remove residual solvent not associated with the fixed charged groups they were then dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 48 h following this the dry mass m d thickness and diameter

thickness and diameter water uptake can be calculated as 7 w u m w m d m d the thickness and diameter of the wet membranes were used to calculate the volume of the swollen membrane v m 2 3 ion sorption following water pre soaking the cation exchange membranes i e cmx and cse were soaked in 1 m hcl to remove the previously sorbed ions and replace them with the h form due to the limited ph tolerance of the anion exchange membranes amx and ase these membranes were used directly after water pre soaking the membranes were then immersed in 80 ml salt solutions of different concentrations c s s for 48 h to reach equilibrium after which the membranes were transferred to water of a known volume 80 ml for a further 48 h during the second water soaking period the adsorbed co ions were released into the water the concentration of co ions in these water samples were later measured to determine the co ion concentrations in the membranes c m the cem membranes were then moved to a 0 1 m cscl solution to release the absorbed counter ions through the uptake of the caesium ions similarly the aem membranes were placed in a 0 1 m nai solution to exchange the adsorbed counter ions with iodide the concentrations of ions in these solutions were later measured to determine the fixed charge concentrations in the membranes c f i x m the concentration of counter ions c m within the

of 1 2 in eq 9 account for the valency of ca2 in cems and so4 2 in aems as counter ions because a each mobile divalent ion is associated with two mobile co ions and b each divalent counter ion is bound to two fixed charge groups in the ion exchange membrane all concentrations were expressed in eq l swollen membrane unless eqs 1 5 were considered in which case eq l water sorbed was used ion

used for equilibrating the cems were nacl kcl and cacl2 solutions from 0 01 m to 1 m and binary solutions of equimolar cation concentrations of nacl kcl and nacl cacl2 similarly the aems were equilibrated in nacl nano3 and na2so4 solutions from 0 01 m to 1 m and binary solutions of equimolar cation concentrations of nacl nano3 and nacl na2so4 the concentrations of cations i e sodium potassium and calcium were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes 720 es varian the concentrations of anions i e chloride nitrate and sulphate were determined using ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 1000 3 results and discussion 3 1 water uptake the water uptake of the ion exchange membranes equilibrated in different salt solutions is presented in fig 1 as shown in table 1 the fixed charges of these membranes are either strongly negative i e so3 group in cmx and cse or strongly positive in amx and ase the water uptake presented for all neosepta iems studied in this work is within the typical range reported in the literature 0 14 0 46 g h2o g dry membrane strathmann 2004 membrane swelling caused by water absorbed into the charged polymer has a direct influence on the absorption and transport of ions with iems water enters the polymer matrix to hydrate both the fixed charged groups and their counter ions stretching the polymer network however the elastic forces that result from crosslinking resist the polymer stretching and thus the amount of water that can enter the network the water uptake is therefore a trade off between these two effects helfferich 1962 kamcev 2016 water uptake is affected by the concentration and type of fixed charged groups and the degree of crosslinking water uptake is also related to the hydrated radius of the counter ions the counter ion valency and how it interacts with the fixed charge group galizia et al 2017 strathmann 2004 the hydrated radius is similar between na and k 3 58 å and 3 31 å and is higher for ca2 4 12 å however for the cation exchange membranes fig 1 a the water uptake of cmx and cse is the highest in nacl solutions but is similar between kcl and cacl2 within experimental error similar trends have been reported by bonner et al bonner and smith 1957 for sulfonated polystyrene resins and galizia et al 2017 for cross linked poly p styrene sulfonate co divinylbenzene for the anion exchange membranes fig 1 b the water uptake of both amx and ase is shown to be the greatest in na2so4 solutions and the lowest in nano3 solutions in this case the hydrated radii of cl no3 and so4 2 are 3 32 å 3 35 å and 3 79 å respectively in binary solutions the amount of water uptake mostly lies between the water uptake values of the respective single salt solutions this is the case for both cse and ase membranes as shown in fig 1 the backing fabric is changed from polyvinyl chloride for cmx to mixtures of polyethylene and polypropylene for cse which weighs less per unit area table 1 the percentage water uptake for the cation exchange membranes also changes on a mass basis declining from 0 37 0 44 g g for cmx to 0 28 0 33 g g for cse fig 1 a the swollen cmx membranes are greater in both volume and thickness have a higher membrane resistance and lower iec the water uptake however appears to be similar between amx and ase 18 28 as shown in table 1 the dry mass is lower for the ase membranes than the amx membranes while the iec is higher the swollen amx membranes are thinner than the ase membranes and the membrane resistance reported by the manufacturer is similar between amx and ase however these changes do not seem to affect greatly the percentage of water sorbed per dry mass of membrane or the swollen membrane volume although changes have been made to the content of the polymer and the backing fabric no information is available as to whether the degree of crosslinking or the type of fixed charged group has been altered therefore it is unclear how the changes in iec and the content in polymer and fabric backing ultimately leads to a similar water uptake between amx and ase fig 1 b finally it is known that water uptake also slightly decreases with increasing external salt concentrations due to osmotic de swelling kamcev 2016 khare and peppas 1995 paul et al 2008 this decline at high salt concentrations is observed for most cases presented in fig 1 3 2 co ion concentration in membranes both the concentrations of counter ion and co ion within the iems were measured most of the counter ions sorbed in the membrane are associated with the fixed charges within the polymer matrix but a very small portion of counter ions are required to neutralize any sorbed co ions in the membrane therefore this concentration of co ion is also referred to as the mobile salt concentration within the membrane geise et al 2012 kamcev et al 2015a since the co ion concentration in the desorption solution was very low for salt solutions of 0 01 m and 0 03 m we were not able to accurately determine these concentrations only co ion concentrations for external salt concentrations of greater than 0 1 m are reported co ions are restricted from entering the membrane due to repulsion by the fixed charge groups which generate an electrical potential known as the donnan potential at the membrane solution interface donnan 1924 as the external salt concentration increases this electrical potential declines due to charge screening allowing more co ions to be absorbed thus as expected the concentration of co ion i e the chloride concentration in cmx and cse and the sodium concentration in amx and ase increases with increasing external salt concentration fig 2 the donnan potential is inversely proportional to the counter ion valence galizia et al 2019 and thus the presence of divalent counter ions i e calcium in cems and sulphate in aems reduces the donnan potential which also results in a greater co ion concentration within the membrane experimental data for these single salt experiments are fitted to eq 6 for monovalent counter ions and eq s1 for divalent counter ions the fitting was performed using all three sets of data for each membrane treating the linear charge density of polymer ξ as the only fitting parameter this approach assumes that ξ does not depend significantly on the type of salt used kamcev et al 2016 within experimental error the estimated values of linear charge density reported in the caption of fig 2 are within the typical range 1 4 reported for polyelectrolyte systems kwak 1973 manning 1969 the ratio of activity coefficients between the solution and the membrane γ were also estimated by eq 3 for monovalent salts and eq s5 for divalent salts using the modelled values of co ion concentrations this parameter is presented in fig 3 a and b for cation exchange membranes and anion exchange membranes respectively γ decreases gradually from low to high external salt concentrations for all membranes similar trends were also reported by kamcev et al 2015b and galzia et al 2017 the activity coefficients of the external salt solutions in general decrease with concentration the decline in γ as a function of external salt concentration hence results from much lower activity coefficients in the membranes when external salt concentration is low as the concentration of external solution increases the ion concentration difference between the membrane phase and the external solution becomes smaller with γ slowly approaching unity for single electrolyte system the cl concentrations in the cse membrane are higher than that in cmx in all solutions fig 2 a and b however the na concentrations do not appear to vary between amx and ase when these anion exchange membranes are equilibrated with different counter ions i e cl no3 and so4 2 fig 2 c and d the estimated value of ξ changes from 1 0 0 1 for cmx to 2 8 0 5 in cse while within experimental error does not change between amx and ase 4 8 1 4 and 5 4 1 5 respectively similar to the water uptake results the change from amx to ase appears to have little effects on the fixed charge group properties it seems that the polymer itself was not changed which is partly confirmed by the description provided by the manufacturer table 1 for the cation exchange membranes the polymer changed from a styrene and divinyl benzene copolymer with sulfonic acid groups in cmx to a styrene based copolymer with sodium sulfonic acid groups in cse this has resulted in some changes to the fixed charge group properties as indicated by the change in the value of ξ the amount of water uptake in the cmx membrane as discussed previously is hence higher than that in the cse membrane due to the lack of information on the detailed chemistry of the polymers used and the exact relative portion of polymer to backing fabric in these commercial membranes further interpretation of the ξ has not been carried out for binary electrolyte systems it is also apparent that the co ion concentration increases steadily with external solution concentration fig 4 the concentration of co ion for the monovalent salt mixtures nacl kcl for cse in fig 4 a and nacl nano3 for ase in fig 4 b is lower than that for the monovalent and divalent salt mixtures nacl cacl2 for cse in fig 4 a and nacl na2so4 for ase in fig 4 b this is expected as the presence of divalent ions again decreases the donnan potential for co ions the concentrations of co ion in the iems for monovalent salt mixtures are similar to the concentrations observed in single salt experiments for monovalent and divalent mixtures however the co ion concentration sits between the values for the single monovalent salt experiments and the single divalent salt experiments 3 3 partition of counter ion in iems 3 3 1 cation exchange membranes the counter ion concentration in the cation exchange membranes expressed in moles per l of swollen membrane is presented in fig 5 the concentration of the counter ion in the iems is more sensitive to external salt concentration at values below 0 1 m after which the concentration begins to plateau the cation exchange membranes are initially in an h form as they were pre soaked in 1m hcl solution section 2 3 at low concentrations of the external solution not all h ions bound to the fixed charges can be replaced by na ions however as the external concentration increases provision of more counter ions in the external solution results in little further change as all fixed charge groups are occupied only slightly more counter ions are sorbed in cse than in cmx resulting from a greater iec but a smaller swollen membrane volume for cse the calcium concentration is around half of that of na and k due to its double charge showing a steady trend over the range of external salt concentrations the distribution of na and k within these neosepta membranes in a mixture of equimolar nacl and kcl solutions is reported here for the first time as presented in fig 5 b potassium is preferably absorbed by cse which is consistent with the results from the single salt sorption experiments at low salt concentrations fig 5 a a smaller hydrated radius of potassium and correspondingly a higher charge density is probably the reason for such a trend fig 5 b also presents the counter ion concentrations for a nacl cacl2 mixture in equimolar concentration which reveal a strong preference of the divalent ions over monovalent ions in the cse membrane the strong electrostatic forces between divalent cations and the fixed charged group leads to the preferential divalent counter ion sorption strathmann 2004 this is the basis of donnan exclusion theory donnan 1924 however as total salt concentrations increase the concentration of sodium in the membrane approaches that of calcium this is because the electrostatic forces are screened by the increasing charge from the ions in the solution reducing the extent of donnan exclusion for monovalent ions it should be noted that the calcium concentration in the binary system is very close to its concentration for the single salt case although the calcium concentrations in the external solutions were halved while the hydrated radii of ca2 is larger than that of na in this case the double charge of the former ion leads to stronger bonds with the fixed charged groups of the cse the partition coefficient of the counter ion for cmx and cse determined using eq 10 is presented in fig 6 for the single salt and binary salts experiments ion partitioning between ion exchange membranes and the surrounding salt solutions is governed by the concentration of charged groups bound to the membrane matrix geise et al 2012 lonsdale et al 1965 paul 2004 similar to counter ion concentration in mol l swollen membrane the partition coefficients are slightly higher for cse than cmx but both showing a declining trend with increasing external salt concentration for all three cations the partition of the counter ion is higher for a monovalent salt in comparison with a divalent one reflecting the changes in membrane concentration due to the double charge on the divalent ion and to donnan exclusion shown in fig 5 the selectivity between the ion pairs calculated by eq 11 is shown in fig 7 as expected the selectivity of na to k is around 1 due to the similarities between these two ions in a binary mixture cse selectively absorbed k as seen in fig 5 b probably due to the smaller hydrated radius of potassium a higher selectivity of ca2 in the membrane for a binary salt solution is in agreement with data reported by sata 2004 for a typical ion exchange membrane with sulfonate groups 3 3 2 anion exchange membranes similar experiments were conducted with different salts nacl nano3 and na2so4 to obtain the concentration of various counter ions within the neosepta anion exchange membranes the concentration of nitrate in both the amx and ase fig 8 a is lower than that of chloride expressed in mol l swollen membrane this trend is reversed when the amount of water uptake is taken into consideration fig s1 so that this concentration is expressed in mol l solution the water uptake is noticeably lower when the aems are equilibrated in nano3 solutions in comparison with nacl solutions fig 1 it is also more apparent that no3 is preferably absorbed when the membrane was equilibrated in binary salt solutions of nacl and nano3 fig 8 b unlike na and k in the cmx and cse membranes where the hydrated radii are noticeably different those of no3 and cl are much closer 3 35 å and 3 32 å respectively some researchers have reported that amx malewitz et al 2007 and nafion bontha and pintauro 1994 pintauro et al 1995 membranes selectively absorb the monovalent counter ion with a larger hard sphere radius cl 1 81 å no3 2 64 å and hence lower surface charge density this lower charge density may allow the no3 to bond more strongly with the hydrophobic polymeric backbone table 1 and may also explain the lower water uptake similar behaviour has been previously observed where hydrophobic resins demonstrated affinity towards perchlorate wang 2010 xiong et al 2007 sata sata 2000 2004 also showed a higher transport number for no3 over cl at different concentrations transport number ratio 1 luo et al 2018 also note that the permselectivity for no3 over cl is consistent with the hofmeister series hofmeister and hofmeister 1888 and the gibbs hydration energy for an equimolar binary mixture of nacl and na2so4 the concentration of so4 2 decreases with external solution concentration while that of cl increases fig 8 b these trends are different to what is observed for the monovalent and divalent counter ion mixture in cation exchange membranes the transport number of so4 2 relative to cl ions for different types of anion exchange membranes was also reported to be less than one in contrast to the relative ratio between no3 and cl sata 2000 the hydrophobic nature of styrene in aems could partly inhibit the absorption of sulphate ions which are strongly hydrated sata et al 1998 as the gibbs hydration energy of so4 2 is the highest among the three anions studied cl 370 kj mol no3 270 kj mol so4 2 1000 kj mol another reason is likely to be the formation of naso4 i e ion pairing within the solution at higher concentrations ion pairing has been identified as the cause of very low activity coefficients for sulphate in aqueous solutions buchner et al 1999 marcus and hefter 2006 as a monovalent ion naso4 would compete less effectively with cl within the anion exchange membrane however its full impact upon the activity and the ion partitioning in ion exchange membranes is still unknown and requires further study the partition coefficient of these counter ions determined using eq 10 are presented in fig 9 for the single salt and binary salts experiments similar to counter ion concentration in mol l swollen membrane the partition coefficients are similar between amx and ase but both showing a declining trend with increasing external salt concentration for all three anions the partition of the monovalent anions is higher than that of divalent anions in the case of single salt experiments this trend can again be justified both by the lower concentration in the membrane fig 8 and by the lower activity coefficient of the divalent ions in the bulk solution in comparison with that of monovalent ions the selectivity between the anion pairs determined by eq 11 is shown in fig 10 when considering single salt data the selectivity of no3 to cl is close to 1 but in a binary mixture ase selectively absorbs no3 as seen in fig 8 b with a ratio of partition coefficients of 3 5 this is in a similar range of values reported for anion exchange membranes with benzyl trimethylammonium groups sata et al 1998 a very low selectivity of so4 2 in the membrane for a binary salt solution is observed in agreement with the trends shown in fig 8 b for counter ion concentration 4 conclusions we have reported the sorption equilibria of ions in commercial neosepta ion exchange membranes including cmx and cse cation exchange membranes and amx and ase anion exchange membranes calcium has little impact on the water uptake in the cems while the presence of sulphate results in the highest water uptake among all anions the manning donnan model was employed to investigate the structural characteristics of these membranes as co ion concentration is determined by the donnan equilibrium between the membrane and the external solution the change in polymer composition from cmx to cse leads to a change in the manning s parameter this is consistent with the differences in sorption properties between cmx and cse the ion sorption characteristics however were found to be similar between amx and ase which was also confirmed from the similar manning s parameters obtained sorption of counter ion in the binary mixtures of these ions revealed very different trends of monovalent and divalent ion sorption between cse and ase while calcium dominates the fixed charge groups in cse the concentration of sodium in the membrane increases significantly with increasing external salt concentrations however the concentration of sulphate in the anion exchange membrane ase declines with external salt concentration while the concentration of chloride in the binary system increases this leads to very low selectivities between sulphate and chloride this unusual behavior could be due to the strong hydration of the sulphate anion and its interaction with the hydrophobic styrene in the charged polymer it may also relate to the formation of the ion pair naso4 as external concentrations increase nitrate ions also show unusual behavior in single salt solutions they absorb as strongly as chloride ions but with less water accompanying the uptake in binary mixtures the nitrate is able to exclude chloride this behavior may be related to the low surface charge density of the nitrate ion allowing it to interact more readily with the polymeric backbone the characterisation of ion sorption behavior in single and binary mixtures provides useful information for their future applications for these commercial membranes declaration of competing interest the

4 05 than those in uncoated sand 1 00 1 05 due to the stronger electrostatic attraction between anionic pfoa and al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand surface notably al oxyhydroxide have a more profound effect on pfoa retention and retardation than fe oxyhydroxide besides higher ionic strength significantly inhabited pfoa retention and retardation in positively charged sand and the considerable retention of pfoa 90 in deionized water than those in 1 5 mm and 30 0 mm nacl 10 clearly proves the role of competitive adsorption of cl on pfoa transport in positively charged sand in contrast higher

applications for over 50 years fujii et al 2007 prevedouros et al 2006 strong carbon fluorine bonds make pfass extremely resistant to thermal chemical and microbiological degradation and thus render them ubiquitous in diverse environmental matrices casal et al 2017 houtz et al 2013 loos et al 2010 szabo et al 2018 weber et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 zhu and kannan 2019 current studies reported that several to dozens tons of pfass e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos were released into soil and surface environment annually and many of them can enter into groundwater as a predominant ultimate sink liu et al 2017 furthermore groundwater is one of the most important water resources as agricultural irrigated water and drinking water for humans given their environmental bioaccumulation and toxic effects chen et al 2018 2019 koskela et al 2016 wang et al 2014 it is crucial to gain in depth knowledge on pfass transport in the subsurface environment for proposing effective environmental restoration strategies and assessing the potential human health risk unfortunately only a limited studies have addressed on the transport of pfass in the subsurface environment and found that pfass transport strongly depended on the physicochemical properties of surrounding media e g mineral and soil organic matter contents brusseau et al 2019a 2019b lv et al 2018 lyu et al 2018 2019 mckenzie et al 2015 for instance lv et al 2018 reported pfoa exhibited higher mobility in sand than in limestone due to the less negatively charged surface and greater surface area of limestone brusseau et al 2019b observed a greater retardation of pfos in soil compared to the sand moreover our recent study observed distinctly different transport behavior of pfoa in three soils with contrasting physicochemical properties and found the greatest retention of pfoa occurred in red soil with the highest mineral content suggesting the importance role of minerals in pfoa transport lyu et al 2019 al and fe oxyhydroxides are significant components of natural media minerals e g soil and sediment but their individual effect and associated mechanisms on pfass transport

al and fe oxyhydroxides are amphoteric minerals with relatively high points of zero charge phpzc al oxyhydroxides 9 4 fe oxyhydroxide 8 1 8 5 fisher power and cheng 2018 wang et al 2012a and they are then positively charged at the tested ph value 5 6 it was also noticeable that more positively charged surface of al 1 with lower al oxyhydroxide coating amount 0 257 mg g 1 32 5 mv 38 0 mv were observed in comparison with that of fe 2 with higher fe oxyhydroxide coating amount 0 838 mg g 1 12 7 mv 19 7 mv revealing a more significant impact on surface charge of al oxyhydroxide than fe oxyhydroxide furthermore surface charge became less slightly positive with an increase in ionic strength for the positively charged sand al 1 32 5 mv 41 9 mv al 2 40 4 mv 45 2 mv fe 2 12 7 mv 19 7 mv this is likely due to the compression of the electrical double layer at higher ionic strength wang and shih 2011 zhao et al 2014 besides surface charge became less negative for the negatively charged sand at a greater ionic strength fe 1 21 9 mv 8 3 mv un 22 9 mv 21 0 mv which is consistent with the results in many previous studies feriancikova and xu 2012 wang et al 2017 3 2 effects of al fe oxyhydroxide grain coatings fig 3 shows observed and simulated breakthrough curves btcs for pfoa in both al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand and un when the solution ionic strength 1 5 mm and 30 mm nacl the btcs are plotted as normalized effluent concentrations c c0 where c0 is the influent pfoa concentration versus pvs the experimental conditions and effluent recovery information are presented in table 2 the effluent recovery of pfoa in both al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand and un entirely exceeded 81 66 under both ionic strength conditions 1 5 mm and 30 mm nacl table 2 reflecting the trivial impact of al fe oxyhydroxide coating on pfoa retention under the tested conditions however it should be noted that the btcs of pfoa in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand all exhibited significant additional spreading with decreasing rising slope and increasing tailings and shifted noticeably to the right comparing with these in un fig 3 besides both increasing al and fe coating amount on sand surface contributed to a reduction in rising slope but a high degree of tailing for btcs these observations indicate a clear increase in pfoa retardation occur in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand than those in un interestingly pfoa retardation in al 1 and al 2 coating amount 0 257 mg g 1 and 0 394 mg g 1 were greater than those in fe 1 and fe 2 with higher grain coating amount 0 489 mg g 1 and 0 838 mg g 1 indicating a more profound effect of al oxyhydroxide than fe oxyhydroxide on pfoa transport the retardation factors of pfoa generally followed the following sequence al 2 3 23 5 58 al 1 1 87 5 13 fe 2 2 11 4 05 fe 1 1 44 1 66 un 1 00 1 05 the order of retardation for different sand at 1 5 mm and 30 0 mm nacl was consistent with that of zeta potentials as illustrated in 3 1 and fig 2 al 2 40 4 mv 45 2 mv al 1 32 5 mv 38 0 mv fe 2 12 7 mv 19 7 mv fe 1 9 8 mv 8 3 mv un 21 2 mv 21 0 mv because pfoa pka 0 2 2 8 mainly exists in deprotonated forms under the tested ph value 5 6 liu et al 2018 more positively charged sand surface can contribute to stronger electrostatic attraction between the anionic pfoa molecules and sand surface and hence lead to more adsorption and desorption of pfoa on sand surface similar results have also been reported for limestone and soil in our previous studies lv et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 besides our previous study showed that larger sssa of porous media can also attribute to greater pfoa retention and retardation to a certain degree lv et al 2018 however the retardation of pfoa was inconsistent with the sssa for different sands in this study for example the btcs in al 2 with the smallest sssa 0 0147 m2 g 1 exhibited the greatest retardation 3 23 5 58 which demonstrate that sssa of porous media is not responsible for the retardation of pfoa in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand thus it can be concluded that electrostatic interaction played a vital role in pfoa transport in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand the two site kinetic retention model provided an excellent description for the btcs of pfoa for both al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand and un under both ionic strength conditions 1 5 mm and 30 mm with a pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 928 table s1 the results showed that the first order sorption coefficients k2 and one site desorption coefficient kd2 in reversible attachment site 2 was generally much greater than the first order sorption coefficients k1 in irreversible attachment site 1 indicating the importance of adsorption desorption process in controlling pfoa transport in these sands the values of kd2 and k2 for both al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand were generally greater than those for un consisting with the experimental results that al fe oxyhydroxide coating can strongly affect the retardation of pfoa during transport 3 3 effects of ionic strength fig 3 also presents the effect of ionic strength on pfoa transport in al fe oxyhydroxide coated and un comparing the minimal effect on pfoa transport in un ionic strength can strongly impact the transport behavior of pfoa in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand it is very interesting to note that for the positively charged al 1 al 2 and fe 2 the pfoa broke through at progressively earlier times and the btcs shifted noticeably to the left at higher ionic strength suggesting the occurrence of less retardation the retardation factors for al 1 al 2 and fe 2 decreased from 5 13 to 1 87 5 58 to 3 23 and 4 05 to 2 11 with an elevation in ionic strength 1 5 mm 30 0 mm nacl respectively table 2 previous studies revealed higher ionic strength may increase the degree of adsorption of pfass e g pfoa and pfos on positively charged mineral soil surface owing to the decreasing electrostatic attraction between the positively charged mineral soil surface and anionic pfass molecules wang et al 2012b wang and shih 2011 however as we illustrated in 3 1 the relatively minimal increase in zeta potentials with increasing ionic strength al 1 32 5 mv 38 0 mv al 2 40 4 mv 45 2 mv and fe 2 12 7 mv 19 7 mv can lead to insignificant deviation in pfoa adsorption on these positively charged sand surfaces and hence is unlikely responsible for the greatly reduced retardation at higher ionic strength in this study additionally based on the observation of minor adsorption of cl on aluminum oxide regalbuto et al 1999 some researchers speculated that the competitive adsorption of cl on the active adsorption sites may decrease the adsorption of pfass on the positively charged mineral surface wang et al 2012b thus we speculate that the less pfoa retardation at higher ionic strength in the positively charged sand may due to the enhanced competitive adsorption of cl in contrast for the negatively charged fe 1 greater retardation of pfoa was observed with increasing ionic strength 1 5 mm 30 mm with retardation factors increasing from 1 44 to 1 66 this is likely that the electrostatic repulsion between anionic pfoa and the negatively charged sand surface was weakened at a greater ionic strength because of the increase in zeta potential 9 8 mv 8 3 mv to further illustrate the mechanisms for the transport of pfoa in medium with different surface charge property additional column experiments were conducted without cl in background solution di water for al 1 representative positively charged sand and fe 1 representative negatively charged sand the results in fig 4 a reveal that 90 of pfoa was retained in the positively charged al 1 in di water effluent recovery 10 07 1 29 which was significantly higher than those in 1 5 mm and 30 0 mm nacl effluent recovery 91 22 1 28 and 104 15 1 40 given the minimal differences in zeta potential 32 5 mv 41 9 mv under three concentrations of cl 0 mm 30 0 mm the distinct discrepancy in pfoa retention between with and without cl conditions was not attributed to the electrostatic interaction but the competitive adsorption of cl with anionic pfoa for the active adsorption sites on sand surface thus we can conclude that the competitive adsorption of cl is another important mechanism for controlling pfoa transport in positively charged sand as expected no significant changes in breakthrough were observed under three concentrations of cl 0 mm 30 0 mm nacl for the negatively charged fe 1 fig 4b the corresponding effluent recoveries exceed 96 88 1 08 under all texted conditions indicating the conditions are all unfavorable for the adsorption of pfoa on sand surface besides greater cl in the solution 0 mm 30 mm was found to slightly enhance pfoa retardation with retardation factors increasing from 1 28 to 1 66 not that enhanced zeta potentials 21 9 mv 8 3 mv were observed with an increase in nacl fig 2 these observations further prove that electrostatic interaction is the dominant mechanism for pfoa transport in negatively charged sand the best fit values of k1 k2 and kd2 under different ionic strength 0 mm 30 mm nacl are presented in table s1 for the positively charged sand al 1 al 2 and fe 2 the values of k1 and k2 generally decreased with an increase in ionic strength suggesting a decreasing sorption rate at both reversible and irreversible attachment sites the values of kd2 generally increased with increasing ionic strength indicating an increasing detachment rate at the reversible attachment site these observations confirm that less pfoa retention and retardation occurred on the positively charged sand surface at higher ionic strength however for the negatively charged sand fe 1 and un the values of k1 and k2 slightly increased with increasing ionic strength while the values of kd2 slightly decreased with increasing ionic strength these findings prove the slightly greater retardation for negatively charged sand with increasing ionic strength 4 conclusions the present study provides new information on the transport behavior of pfoa in soil and groundwater environments greater pfoa retardation may occur in natural media with higher al fe oxyhydroxide amount presenting on the media surface due to the enhanced electrostatic attraction between anionic pfoa and collector surfaces in addition al oxyhydroxide is proved to have a more dramatic effect on pfoa retention and retardation than fe oxyhydroxide the considerable retention of pfoa in the positively charged al 1 with no cl in background solution illustrated that pfoa transport in positively charged sand is also greatly affected by competitive adsorption of cl however greater retardation of pfoa was observed in the negatively charged fe 1 with an increase in ionic strength indicating that electrostatic interaction is the main mechanism for pfoa transport in negatively charged sand declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

additional spreading with decreasing rising slope and increasing tailings and shifted noticeably to the right comparing with these in un fig 3 besides both increasing al and fe coating amount on sand surface contributed to a reduction in rising slope but a high degree of tailing for btcs these observations indicate a clear increase in pfoa retardation occur in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand than those in un interestingly pfoa retardation in al 1 and al 2 coating amount 0 257 mg g 1 and 0 394 mg g 1 were greater than those in fe 1 and fe 2 with higher grain coating amount 0 489 mg g 1 and 0 838 mg g 1 indicating a more profound effect of al oxyhydroxide than fe oxyhydroxide on pfoa transport the retardation factors of pfoa generally followed the following sequence al 2 3 23 5 58 al 1 1 87 5 13 fe 2 2 11 4 05 fe 1 1 44 1 66 un 1 00 1 05 the order of retardation for different sand at 1 5 mm and 30 0 mm nacl was consistent with that of zeta potentials as illustrated in 3 1 and fig 2 al 2 40 4 mv 45 2 mv al 1 32 5 mv 38 0 mv fe 2 12 7 mv 19 7 mv fe 1 9 8 mv 8 3 mv un 21 2 mv 21 0 mv because pfoa pka 0 2 2 8 mainly exists in deprotonated forms under the tested ph value 5 6 liu et al 2018 more positively charged sand surface can contribute to stronger electrostatic attraction between the anionic pfoa molecules and sand surface and hence lead to more adsorption and desorption of pfoa on sand surface similar results have also been reported for limestone and soil in our previous studies lv et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 besides our previous study showed that larger sssa of porous media can also attribute to greater pfoa retention and retardation to a certain degree lv et al 2018 however the retardation of pfoa was inconsistent with the sssa for different sands in this study for example the btcs in al 2 with the smallest sssa 0 0147 m2 g 1 exhibited the greatest retardation 3 23 5 58 which demonstrate that sssa of porous media is not responsible for the retardation of pfoa in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand thus it can be concluded that electrostatic interaction played a vital role in pfoa transport in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand the two site kinetic retention model provided an excellent description for the btcs of pfoa for both al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand and un under both ionic strength conditions 1 5 mm and 30 mm with a pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 928 table s1 the results showed that the first order sorption coefficients k2 and one site desorption coefficient kd2 in reversible attachment site 2 was generally much greater than the first order sorption coefficients k1 in irreversible attachment site 1 indicating the importance of adsorption desorption process in controlling pfoa transport in these sands the values of kd2 and k2 for both al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand were generally greater than those for un consisting with the experimental results that al fe oxyhydroxide coating can strongly affect the retardation of pfoa during transport 3 3 effects of ionic strength fig 3 also presents the effect of ionic strength on pfoa transport in al fe oxyhydroxide coated and un comparing the minimal effect on pfoa transport in un ionic strength can strongly impact the transport behavior of pfoa in al fe oxyhydroxide coated sand it is very interesting to note that for the positively charged al 1 al 2 and fe 2 the pfoa broke through at progressively earlier times and the btcs shifted noticeably to the left at higher ionic strength suggesting the occurrence of less retardation the retardation factors for al 1 al 2 and fe 2 decreased from 5 13 to 1 87 5 58 to 3 23 and 4 05 to 2 11 with an elevation in ionic strength 1 5 mm 30 0 mm nacl respectively table 2 previous studies revealed higher ionic strength may increase the degree of adsorption of pfass e g pfoa and pfos on positively charged mineral soil surface owing to the decreasing electrostatic attraction between the positively charged mineral soil surface and anionic pfass molecules wang et al 2012b wang and shih 2011 however as we illustrated in 3 1 the relatively minimal increase in zeta potentials with increasing ionic strength al 1 32 5 mv 38 0 mv al 2 40 4 mv 45 2 mv and fe 2 12 7 mv 19 7 mv can lead to insignificant deviation in pfoa adsorption on these positively charged sand surfaces and hence is unlikely responsible for the greatly reduced retardation at higher ionic strength in this study additionally based on the observation of minor adsorption of cl on aluminum oxide regalbuto et al 1999 some researchers speculated that the competitive adsorption of cl on the active adsorption sites may decrease the adsorption of pfass on the positively charged mineral surface wang et al 2012b thus we speculate that the less pfoa retardation at higher ionic strength in the positively charged sand may due to the enhanced competitive adsorption of cl in contrast for the negatively charged fe 1 greater retardation of pfoa was observed with increasing ionic strength 1 5 mm 30 mm with retardation factors increasing from 1 44 to 1 66 this is likely that the electrostatic repulsion between anionic pfoa and the negatively charged sand surface was weakened at a greater ionic strength because of the increase in zeta potential 9 8 mv 8 3 mv to further illustrate the mechanisms for the transport of pfoa in medium with different surface charge property additional column experiments were conducted without cl in background solution di water for al 1 representative positively charged sand and fe 1 representative negatively charged sand the results in fig 4 a reveal that 90 of pfoa was retained in the positively charged al 1 in di water effluent recovery 10 07 1 29 which was significantly higher than those in 1 5 mm and 30 0 mm nacl effluent recovery 91 22 1 28 and 104 15 1 40 given the minimal differences in zeta potential 32 5 mv 41 9 mv under three concentrations of cl 0 mm 30 0 mm the distinct discrepancy in pfoa retention between with and without cl conditions was not attributed to the electrostatic interaction but the competitive adsorption of cl with anionic pfoa for the active adsorption sites on sand surface thus we can conclude that the competitive adsorption of cl is another important mechanism for controlling pfoa transport in positively charged sand as expected no significant changes in breakthrough were observed under three concentrations of cl 0 mm 30 0 mm nacl for the negatively charged fe 1 fig 4b the corresponding effluent recoveries exceed 96 88 1 08 under all texted conditions indicating the conditions are all unfavorable for the adsorption of pfoa on sand surface besides greater cl in the solution 0 mm 30 mm was found to slightly enhance pfoa retardation with retardation factors increasing from 1 28 to 1 66 not that enhanced zeta potentials 21 9 mv 8 3 mv were observed with an increase in nacl fig 2 these observations further prove that electrostatic interaction is the dominant mechanism for pfoa transport in negatively charged sand the best fit values of k1 k2 and kd2 under different ionic strength 0 mm 30 mm nacl are presented in table s1 for the positively charged sand al 1 al 2 and fe 2 the values of k1 and k2 generally decreased with an increase in ionic strength suggesting a decreasing sorption rate at both reversible and irreversible attachment sites the values of kd2 generally increased with increasing ionic strength indicating an increasing detachment rate at the reversible attachment site these observations confirm that less pfoa retention and retardation occurred on the positively charged sand surface at higher ionic strength however for the negatively charged sand fe 1 and un the values of k1 and k2 slightly increased with increasing ionic strength while the values of kd2 slightly decreased with increasing ionic strength these findings prove the slightly greater retardation for negatively charged sand with increasing ionic strength 4 conclusions the present study provides new information on the transport behavior of pfoa in soil and groundwater environments greater pfoa retardation may occur in natural media with higher al fe oxyhydroxide amount presenting on the media surface due to the enhanced electrostatic attraction between anionic pfoa and collector surfaces in addition al oxyhydroxide is proved to have a more dramatic effect on pfoa retention and retardation than fe oxyhydroxide the considerable retention of pfoa in the positively charged al 1 with no cl in background solution illustrated that pfoa transport in positively charged sand is also greatly affected by competitive adsorption of cl however greater retardation of pfoa was observed in the negatively charged fe 1 with an increase in ionic strength indicating that electrostatic interaction is the main mechanism for pfoa transport in negatively charged sand declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18017,the removal of phosphate nutrient and e coli pathogen from secondary effluent is of great importance to control the water quality of the receiving water bodies in this study magnetic porous nila layered double oxides nila ldos fe3o4 were synthesized using a simple co precipitation method nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited a high phosphate adsorption capacity of 203 10 mg g 1 in batch adsorption experiments which can mostly be maintained within the ph range 5 5 8 5 and ionic strength range 5 20 mm of secondary effluent and in the presence of commonly co existing species anions and organics nila ldos fe3o4 were further evaluated in real secondary effluent and the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm was used to predict the performance in field applications under typical conditions nila ldos fe3o4 can last for 1845 2448 bed volumes bvs before the phosphate concentration in the effluent exceeds the monthly average limit of 1 mg l 1 p good regeneration capacities were also demonstrated in cyclic adsorption desorption runs in both synthetic solution and secondary effluent in addition the presence of ni and la species greatly enhanced the antibacterial performance of the nila ldos fe3o4 toward e coli results obtained from this study indicate porous nila ldos fe3o4 can be a promising multifunctional material for the treatment of secondary effluent graphical abstract image 1 keywords porous magnetic ldos secondary effluent hsdm phosphate adsorption antibacterial activity 1 introduction excessive discharge of nutrients such as phosphorus p is a major cause of eutrophication that can lead to the deterioration of water quality in the receiving water bodies secondary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps represents a main source of nutrients aly 2015 citulski et al 2009 gao et al 2016 for example total phosphate in secondary effluent may vary from not detected to 12 3 mg l 1 po4 3 usepa 2007 while the threshold concentrations that may cause eutrophication have been recommended to be 0 03 0 3 mg l 1 po4 3 kumar et al 2019 pathogens can also be a concern for secondary effluent where e coli concentration can be up to 103 cfu ml 1 anastasi et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2013 stampi et al 2001 the removal of pathogen from secondary effluent often requires a disinfection process where chlorination or uv irradiation is commonly employed in wwtps however chlorination may result in formation of harmful by products and an extra step of dechlorination may be needed to remove the excess chlorine and uv irradiation may increase the energy cost significantly phosphorus mainly exists in the soluble reactive orthophosphate form in the raw wastewater and in the secondary effluent gu et al 2011 common methods to remove p from secondary effluent include biological treatment chemical precipitation adsorption and membrane filtration citulski et al 2009 le et al 2020 malhotra 1963 although being considered low cost and thus commonly used chemical precipitation is largely affected by the solution s ph and may produce a high amount of sludge that needs to be further treated or processed yang et al 2012 biological methods can have high removal efficiencies but also incur high cost and require highly skilled operation oehmen et al 2007 membrane filtration e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration has outstanding efficiencies but requires considerably high capital cost and energy consumption chen et al 2019 compared to other methods adsorptive filtration possesses the advantages of low cost simple operation high efficiency and low energy consumption le et al 2019 moreover adsorbents can be regenerated for multiple uses making the treatment environmentally friendly ahmadi et al 2018 metal i e aluminum iron lanthanum etc hydroxides oxides are often used for the adsorption of phosphate which can form inner sphere complex with the hydroxyl surface groups kumar et al 2019 between different metal hydroxides oxides lanthanum la oxides hydroxide have shown promising performance for p adsorption due to their high affinity for phosphate chen et al 2016 hao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2012 also in recent years layered double hydroxides ldhs and their calcination derivatives layered double oxides ldos have been studied intensively as promising adsorbents for water purification applications goh et al 2008 gonzalez rodriguez et al 2017 hatami et al 2018 li et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 ldhs are brucite like layers denoted as m2 1 xm3 x oh 2an x n mh2o in which m2 and m3 are the di valent and trivalent cations respectively x is the molar ratio of m 3 m 3 m 2 and an are the intercalated anions the high surface area low cost highly tunable interior architecture and outstanding anion exchange ability render ldhs potential adsorbents for both inorganic and organic contaminants goh et al 2008 the porosity and surface area of ldhs can be further increased by exfoliation adachi pagano et al 2000 or intercalation decomposition processes gonzalez rodriguez et al 2017 however these methods require complicated synthesis processes and involve the use of toxic and dangerous chemicals zubair et al 2017 on the other hand egg white has been employed to synthesize porous ferrospinel materials wang et al 2018 the oxidization and gasification of organic compounds of the egg white during calcination can leave behind pores and cavities and thus increase the surface area of the material which is generally preferred for surface mediated processes therefore the addition of egg white during the synthesis of ldhs ldos may represent a simple and green method to enhance the surface properties of the material for adsorption applications most adsorption studies in the literature have only employed synthetic phosphate polluted solution prepared with deionized di water and the experiments have often been conducted in batch mode which is not representative in terms of practical conditions for wastewater treatment therefore in addition to batch adsorption tests that can characterize the adsorption capacity there is a need for flow through studies which can better capture the dynamic changes of actual wastewater treatment processes in this study we synthesized magnetic porous ni la ldos nila ldos fe3o4 via a low temperature one pot co precipitation method with the addition of egg white and subsequently employed it for the adsorption of phosphate and antibacterial testing toward e coli the magnetic separability can ease post separation when needed the low cost and simple egg white treatment helped enhance the porosity and surface area of ldos and consequently the treatment capacity also the reusability of ni la ldos for phosphate removal from both synthetic solution and secondary effluent was examined in cyclic adsorption desorption runs moreover a column study was conducted with secondary effluent collected from a local wwtp in order to estimate the lifetime of the adsorbent at field scale adsorption application the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm was adopted for the mathematical modelling of field scale operations lastly the antibacterial properties of nila ldos fe3o4 was tested against e coli inactivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals of analytical grade including ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o

treatment the synthesis was performed in a water bath at 80 c with vigorous stirring a salt solution 100 ml containing 8 56 g nicl2 6h2o and 6 68 g lacl3 7h2o ni la molar ratio 2 1 and an alkaline solution 100 ml of 4 86 g naoh in order to keep ph at about 10 and 3 82 g na2co3 were added drop wise simultaneously then 60 ml egg white was added as a template to enhance the porosity of the material the products were then aged at room temperature for 8 h dried at 60 c crushed and calcined at 500 c for 60 min the porous nila ldos fe3o4 was separated by a magnet and washed with di water until the effluent became neutral nila ldos fe3o4 with other ni la molar ratios were also prepared moreover different control samples were synthesized porous ni fe3o4 and porous la fe3o4 were prepared with only ni or la salt nonporous nila ldos fe3o4 were synthesized without the addition of egg white the performance of different adsorbents was examined in our preliminary study as shown in fig s1 porous nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited the highest p adsorption capacity and thus was tested in the following experiments 2 3 material characterization surface morphology and composition of nila ldos fe3o4

fourier transformed infrared atr ftir analysis was performed on a thermo scientific nicolet ftir from 400 to 4000 cm 1 specific surface area pore size and pore volume were measured using multi bet dft

described in our previous study vu and wu 2019 2 4 batch adsorption experiment batch adsorption tests were conducted in 40 ml of synthetic phosphate solution ph 7 ionic strength 3 5 mm nacl unless otherwise noted containing 0 05 g the adsorbent at 25 c and 60 rpm isotherm tests were performed for 24 h with the initial phosphate concentrations of 0 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 and 400 mg l 1 to study the effects of ph isotherm experiments were conducted at ph 5 5 7 8 5 and 12 5 ionic strength 3 5 mm nacl similarly the effects of ionic strength were studied at 5 10 15 and 20 mm nacl ph 7 the effects of co existing species sulfate bicarbonate and humic acid were also investigated in batch isotherm experiments as well as batch kinetics tests at 120 rpm with an initial phosphate concentration 7 mg l 1 which is a representative phosphate concentration in secondary effluent usepa 2007 batch experiments isotherm and kinetics were also conducted in real secondary effluent taken from a local wastewater treatment plant characteristics of the secondary effluent are provided in table s1 the isotherm and kinetics determination were based on langmuir and freundlich and pseudo first and pseudo second models respectively texts s2 s3 adsorbent regeneration was carried out by mixing the saturated adsorbents 0 05 g in 0 1 m naoh 5m nacl desorbing solution 40 ml for 2 h at 60 rpm and 25 c kong et al 2018 zhan et al 2016 the adsorbent was then dried at 60 c and tested for phosphate adsorption again the desorption adsorption cycle was repeated 7 times phosphate measurement

of hsdm model is provided in the si text s4 and fitting of the hsdm model was performed using fast 2 0 fixed bed adsorption simulation tool technische universität berlin software 2 5 1 determination of film diffusion coefficient k l and surface diffusion coefficient d s by differential column batch reactor dcbr experiments the details of the dcbr setup are reported elsewhere sontheimer et al 1988 here the secondary effluent containing 7 mg l 1 phosphate was stored in a 5 l reservoir and recirculated through a small layer of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbents sandwiched between a bed of sand which showed no affinity toward phosphate data not shown at a flow rate that can help maintain the hlr to be higher than 14 m h 1 so that the film diffusion was not the rate limiting step sperlich et al 2008 the amount of adsorbent used was determined based on the requirement that the final equilibrium concentration was 50 of the initial concentration hand 1982 film diffusion coefficient k l and surface diffusion coefficient d s were determined using the multi run function of fast software 2 5 2 verification of hsdm results in order to verify the model continuous column flow through 175 mm l x 26 mm d experiments fig s2 were conducted using secondary effluent with an initial phosphate concentration of 7 mg l 1 at flowrate of 7 ml min 1 two layers 50 mm each of sand 0 85 2 mm were packed at the top and the bottom to distribute the flow the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbent 10 g was packed up to 32 5 mm neodymium magnet pieces were used to stabilize the adsorbent in the column other details of the column setup are shown in table 2 2 6 antibacterial experiments e coli microbiologics strain atcc 11775 mn usa was cultured on tryptic soy agar and incubated for 24 h at 35 c ahmadi and wu 2017 a small amount was then taken from the stock culture and inoculated into 0 9 nacl to prepare a stock solution from which a small aliquot was taken and spiked into the secondary effluent where the initial concentrations was controlled at 1 1 104 1 4 104 cfu ml 1 next 50 mg of adsorbents were mixed with 40 ml secondary effluent spiked with e coli antibacterial experiments were performed in a shaker at 35 c samples were taken at different time intervals for e coli measurement using plate counting duplicate plates were prepared for each dilution 10 300 times with total 6 measurements for each sample 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 was performed to assess the model verification where the difference between the experimental data and model prediction was evaluated based on a 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch adsorption experiments 3 1 1 effects of ph and ionic strength ph is one of the most important water chemistry parameters that may have a profound effect on the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbents and adsorbates herein batch isotherm tests were performed within the typical ph range 6 9 of secondary effluent company et al 2007 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2013 to examine the effect of ph on phosphate uptake by nila ldos fe3o4 as illustrated in fig 1 a ph showed little effect on the adsorption capacities of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 toward phosphate and maximized at 175 20 178 40 mg g 1 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption behavior at different ph table s3 though a better fitting with langmuir model r 2 0 99 was observed freundlich model fitting was also good r 2 0 95 0 97 therefore multiple types of interactions may be involved in the adsorption wang et al 2019 the phpzc of nila ldos fe3o4 was measured to be 11 7 table s2 this may explain the ph independence of phosphate adsorption within the neutral range where the adsorbent surface was protonated and may maintain a relatively constant affinity electrostatic attraction toward the negatively charged phosphate species to further confirm this the phosphate adsorption experiment was carried out at ph 12 5 phpzc as can be seen in fig 1a a noticeable decrease of the adsorption capacity 104 8 mg g 1 was observed which can be explained by the fact that the adsorbent surface was deprotonated creating repulsive forces between the negative surface of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 and phosphate anions and thus lowering the phosphate uptake nonetheless the stable and high phosphate adsorption capacity within the common ph range of secondary effluent demonstrates the appealing properties of nila ldos fe3o4 for field wastewater treatment applications the effects of ionic strength 5 20 mm on the isotherm were shown in fig 1b the maximum adsorption capacities stabilized at 174 40 178 00 mg g 1 within the testing range again langmuir model r 2 0 99 fit better the adsorption isotherms than freundlich model r 2 0 97 0 98 the overlapped isotherm curves at different ionic strengths demonstrated negligible effects of ionic strength which suggests the adsorption can be characterized as inner sphere complexation compared to the outer sphere complexation the inner sphere complexation is relatively independent to the competitive sorption of the background ions and the electric double layer contraction gu et al 2016 su et al 2013 the shift of phpzc of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 to a lower value 7 6 and the increase of the solution s ph after phosphate adsorption from 7 to 8 2 are deemed explainable for the inner sphere complexation between the metal hydroxyl groups and phosphate species li et al 2016 xu et al 2017b it is likely that the physical electrostatic interaction first occurred between the negatively charged phosphate and the positively charged sites on the surface of the adsorbent where then the inner sphere complexation with mainly la sites stepped in and strengthened the bonding between them 3 1 2 effects of co existing species the presence of major co existing species such as sulfate bicarbonate and effluent organic matter efom in real environmental water matrices can lower phosphate removal due to their competition for adsorption sites aly et al 2017 company et al 2007 soluble humic acid a fraction of natural organic matter nom can also form complexes with phosphate through ligand exchange and negatively affect the phosphate uptake by the adsorbent sibanda and young 1986 as nom is a part of effluent organic matter efom in secondary effluent we selected humic acid for testing the influence of efom on phosphate adsorption in synthetic solutions the role of efom could be further reflected in our later experiments with real secondary effluent together with humic acid sulfate and bicarbonate were also selected as the representative co existing species in environmental matrices typical concentrations of these species in the secondary effluent are reported to be 50 150 mg l 1 for sulfate 150 300 mg l 1 for bicarbonate and 2 4 mg l 1 for humic acid aly et al 2017 company et al 2007 filloux et al 2012 herein we examined the effects of sulfate 120 mg l 1 bicarbonate 250 mg l 1 and humic acid 3 76 mg toc l 1 on both the isotherm and kinetics of phosphate adsorption using nila ldos fe3o4 fig 2 a and b the shape of the isotherm curves in the presence of these species are similar to that of control where the adsorption capacities quickly increased to 112 80 122 00 mg g 1 and then gradually reached the maximum values of 155 20 165 60 mg g 1 the isotherms were also better described by langmuir model r 2 0 99 table s3 the inhibition effect follows the order of humic acid sulfate bicarbonate under the experimental conditions here considering the different concentrations of the interfering species used it seems humic acid exerts the strongest influence followed by sulfate and then bicarbonate in general presence of these species at environmentally relevant concentrations did not significantly affect the phosphate adsorption indicating the good selectivity of the nila ldos fe3o4 toward phosphate regarding the kinetics results at an initial phosphate concentration of 7 mg l 1 the highest adsorption capacities were at 5 46 5 57 mg g 1 with 97 99 43 removal in the presence of sulfate bicarbonate or humic acid the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics models were used to fit the experimental data text s3 the pseudo second order kinetics model r 2 0 97 0 98 showed a better fitting compared to the pseudo first order kinetics model r 2 0 89 0 95 table s3 the kinetic profiles of phosphate adsorption in the presence of other species are close to that of the control run suggesting the insignificant effects of the co existing species on the phosphate update rate by nila ldos fe3o4 such performance could be ascribed to the high selectivity of lanthanum towards phosphate and would support the recovery of phosphate with high purity hao et al 2019 3 1 3 tests in secondary effluent desorption and regeneration to evaluate the utility of nila ldos fe3o4 isotherm and kinetics experiments were conducted in real secondary effluent collected from a local wastewater treatment plant fig 3 a and b the isotherm followed langmuir model r 2 0 99 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 156 20 mg g 1 table s3 the lower adsorption capacity than those achieved in the synthetic solutions discussed above may be ascribed to the fact that secondary effluent is a complex matrix with many co existing species which can exert competitive and or inhibitive effects and thus negatively affect phosphate uptake by the adsorbents table s1 nevertheless the performance of nila ldos fe3o4 in real environmental matrices is high comparing with other adsorbing materials reported in the literature table 1 implying the good potential of the nila ldos fe3o4 for field applications the kinetics tests were performed with three initial phosphate concentrations of 1 4 and 7 mg l 1 and the highest adsorption capacities were 0 78 3 12 and 5 03 mg g 1 respectively the pseudo second order kinetics model r 2 0 96 0 99 can well describe the experimental data table s3 as can be seen in fig 3b the matrix effect was not significant at the environmentally relevant concentrations another important aspect that affects the practical application of an adsorbent is the regeneration possibility here the regeneration study was carried out in both synthetic solutions fig 4 a and secondary effluent fig 4b during 7 cycles of adsorption desorption regeneration the nila ldos fe3o4 maintained good removal efficiencies 88 99 in synthetic solution and 87 90 in secondary effluent and desorption rates 87 90 in synthetic solution and 82 92 in secondary effluent in both matrices which indicates that nila ldos fe3o4 is a promising material for phosphate removal in wastewater treatment 3 1 4 adsorbent characterization and adsorption mechanisms xps spectra of nila ldos fe3o4 fig s3 confirm the existence of ni 2p la 3d fe 2p and o 1s the sem images show many irregular crystals on the adsorbent surface and eds elemental analysis indicates ni and la occupied the surface sites fig 5 the xrd analysis of the adsorbent showed characteristic peaks of nio i e 101 012 110 113 and 202 jcpds 23 0362 and la2o2co3 i e 002 004 100 101 102 103 006 106 110 107 114 201 203 116 109 207 211 and 213 jcpds 37 0804 but peaks of fe3o4 were weakened where only two peaks at 111 and 311 were observed jcpds 75 0449 implying that the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles was mostly covered by the metal oxides fig s4 tang et al 2015 after the phosphate adsorption the intensities of xrd peaks at 2θ 22 3 25 2 25 9 30 1 44 0 and 47 3 were reduced which might be due to the intercalation of phosphate anions onto the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbent memory effect might take place reconstructing ldh layers from ldo and capturing phosphate ions during such reconstruction zhou et al 2011 ftir spectra of nila ldos fe3o4 before and after phosphate adsorption were also recorded as shown in fig s5 two new peaks appeared at 1053 and 615 cm 1 after phosphate adsorption which corresponded to the v3 and v4 band vibrations of phosphate species hpo4 2 and h2po4 hatami et al 2018 these peaks of p o could be attributed to the formation of inner sphere complex between phosphate species and the adsorbent hatami et al 2018 which is consistent with the abovementioned shift of phpzc of the adsorbent to a lower value and the increase the solution s ph after the adsorption further the reduction in transmittance of the c o bending vibration band at 1369 cm 1 carbonate suggests the anion exchange between phosphate anions and the adsorbent s carbonate anions moreover within the neutral ph range of secondary effluent h2po4 and hpo4 2 should be dominant species facilitating the electrostatic interactions between these ionic species and the positively surface charged adsorbent whose phpzc is above 11 table s2 zhan et al 2016 as the solution ph increases to above phpzc e g 12 5 in fig 1a such interaction became weaker since the adsorbent surface is negatively charged the fact that the adsorbent can maintain its adsorption capacity within a wide ph range could also be attributed to the permanent isometric substitution of la for ni in the octahedral sites or permanent surface charge during the synthesis chang et al 2019 in addition the weakening of o h vibrational peak at 1460 cm 1 water molecules suggests the formation of hydrogen bond between hydroxyl groups and phosphate zhan et al 2016 overall the adsorption of phosphate onto the porous nila ldos fe3o4 is a combination of inner and outer sphere complexation as summarized in table s2 the addition of egg white during the adsorbent synthesis increased the phpzc specific surface area pore volume and pore size of the nila ldos fe3o4 leading to the enhanced phosphate uptake capacity fig s1 egg white is known for the gelling foaming and emulsifying characteristics wang et al 2018 calcination in the presence of egg white can lead to the formation of porous oxides wang et al 2018 higher surface area brought about higher chance for the phosphate anions to interact with the adsorbent s surface enhancing the adsorption capacity the negligible effects of ph within the neutral ph range on the adsorption performance of adsorbents synthesized with egg white involvement have been reported previously hou et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 which is consistent with the observation in this study the phosphate adsorption capacity of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 was within the higher range of those of other magnetic adsorbents reported in the literature table s4 also the la containing adsorbents performed generally better probably due to the high affinity of la toward phosphate fang et al 2018 in general the existence of metal oxides active sites the high specific surface area and the positively charged surface within a wide ph range all contribute to the high phosphate adsorption capacity of nila ldos fe3o4 together with the property of easy separation nila ldos fe3o4 appears to be a promising adsorbent for the control of phosphate in secondary effluent 3 2 field scale adsorption beds using the porous nila ldos fe3o4 the lifetime of field scale adsorption setup was estimated firstly by determining the diffusion coefficients as described in section 2 5 2 and then conducting lab scale column tests to verify the performance of the hsdm model all experiments were conducted in secondary effluent the input parameters of the verification testing and the field scale simulation are shown in table 2 and the results of the column run model verification are shown in fig 6 a it can be seen that the hsdm model well predicted the column performance of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 p 0 05 hence the model was then used for the prediction of the field scale column performance a typical tertiary filter used in municipal wastewater treatment plants usually has a bed volume from 100 to 180 m3 and is able to treat a volumetric flowrate of 3 000 4 500 m3 day 1 cecen and aktas 2011 usepa 2000 the mass of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 in such a filter was estimated to be 100 000 kg corresponding to a bed density of 0 58 g cm 3 the prediction result of the field scale filter performance is shown in fig 6b considering the standard limit of 1 mg l 1 of total phosphorus i e 3 07 mg l 1 of orthophosphate as a monthly average for the nutrient discharge from wastewater treatment plants usepa 2011 the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbent in the field scale filter bed can last for 1845 2448 bv 3 4 months for initial concentrations varying from 4 to 7 mg l 1 until regeneration replacement is needed which is considered acceptable for tertiary nutrient filters usepa 2009 2007 another concern of field scale adsorption using the porous nila ldos fe3o4 is ni leaching therefore the leaching test was performed in batch mode 25 c 60 rpm with 0 05 g adsorbent and 40 ml secondary effluent samples were taken at different intervals 6 12 24 and 48 h as shown in fig s6 ni leaching remained almost constant at 0 1 mg l 1 after 6 h contact constituting the maximum ni leaching of 0 08 mg per g adsorbent considering that the field scale adsorption bed would be operated with 100 000 kg adsorbent to treat 3500 m3 day 1 secondary effluent for 3 4 months the average ni concentration in the effluent would be 19 25 μg l 1 which is even lower than the epa s maximum contaminant level mcl of 100 μg l 1 in drinking water usepa 1995 yet it should be noticed that this conservative approach of leaching testing in batch mode mixing for a long contact time is not the case at field scale application where the contact time would be much lower and leaching equilibrium may never be reached resulting in even lower ni concentration in the effluent 3 3 antibacterial activity the antibacterial performance of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 and fe3o4 nanoparticles along with the changes of e coli concentrations in the control sample are shown in fig 7 the fe3o4 nanoparticles showed negligible antibacterial activity while the porous nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited strong antibacterial activity toward e coli where 1 log reduction was achieved after 90 min and almost no e coli was detected after 120 min incubation 3 log reduction this antibacterial activity can be attributed to the existence of ni argueta figueroa et al 2014 yasuyuki et al 2010 and probably la species deng et al 2018 wenhua et al 2003 also the attachment of e coli on the surface of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 could inhibit its biological functions li et al 2019 ryu et al 2010 the negligible antibacterial activity of fe3o4 nanoparticles may be due to the short contact time 180 min moreover the metabolism of e coli could be indirectly affected when the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbs the nutrients necessary for bacterial growth during wastewater treatment li et al 2019 ryu et al 2010 as a pathogen indicator the e coli concentration can reach up to 103 cfu ml 1 in secondary effluent posing a serious threat to the ecosystem and receiving waters anastasi et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2013 stampi et al 2001 the good antibacterial property along with the high phosphate adsorption capacity renders nila ldos fe3o4 a promising multifunctional material for tertiary filtration applications 4 conclusions in this study porous nila ldos fe3o4 was synthesized through a simple co precipitation process with the aid of egg white to improve the surface properties nila ldos fe3o4 showed a high phosphate adsorption capacity in both synthetic solution and real secondary effluent which was negligibly affected by changes in ph and ionic strength and the presence of co existing species anions and organics within the common ranges of those in secondary effluent furthermore nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited good regeneration capabilities during cyclic adsorption desorption runs in both synthetic solution and secondary effluent the hsdm model was used for the lifetime estimation of field scale applications under typical conditions the filter bed can last for 3 4 months before regeneration replacement is needed lastly the presence of ni and la species significantly enhanced the antibacterial property of the material compared with that of the fe3o4 core where 104 cfu ml e coli was completely inactivated after 2 h contact results from this study have demonstrated that nila ldos fe3o4 can be a promising multifunctional material for tertiary wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

18017,the removal of phosphate nutrient and e coli pathogen from secondary effluent is of great importance to control the water quality of the receiving water bodies in this study magnetic porous nila layered double oxides nila ldos fe3o4 were synthesized using a simple co precipitation method nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited a high phosphate adsorption capacity of 203 10 mg g 1 in batch adsorption experiments which can mostly be maintained within the ph range 5 5 8 5 and ionic strength range 5 20 mm of secondary effluent and in the presence of commonly co existing species anions and organics nila ldos fe3o4 were further evaluated in real secondary effluent and the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm was used to predict the performance in field applications under typical conditions nila ldos fe3o4 can last for 1845 2448 bed volumes bvs before the phosphate concentration in the effluent exceeds the monthly average limit of 1 mg l 1 p good regeneration capacities were also demonstrated in cyclic adsorption desorption runs in both synthetic solution and secondary effluent in addition the presence of ni and la species greatly enhanced the antibacterial performance of the nila ldos fe3o4 toward e coli results obtained from this study indicate porous nila ldos fe3o4 can be a promising multifunctional material for the treatment of secondary effluent graphical abstract image 1 keywords porous magnetic ldos secondary effluent hsdm phosphate adsorption antibacterial activity 1 introduction excessive discharge of nutrients such as phosphorus p is a major cause of eutrophication that can lead to the deterioration of water quality in the receiving water bodies secondary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps represents a main source of nutrients aly 2015 citulski et al 2009 gao et al 2016 for example total phosphate in secondary effluent may vary from not detected to 12 3 mg l 1 po4 3 usepa 2007 while the threshold concentrations that may cause eutrophication have been recommended to be 0 03 0 3 mg l 1 po4 3 kumar et al 2019 pathogens can also be a concern for secondary effluent where e coli concentration can be up to 103 cfu ml 1 anastasi et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2013 stampi et al 2001 the removal of pathogen from secondary effluent often requires a disinfection process where chlorination or uv irradiation is commonly employed in wwtps however chlorination may result in formation of harmful by products and an extra step of dechlorination may be needed to remove the excess chlorine and uv irradiation may increase the energy cost significantly phosphorus mainly exists in the soluble reactive orthophosphate form in the raw wastewater and in the secondary effluent gu et al 2011 common methods to remove p from secondary effluent include biological treatment chemical precipitation adsorption and membrane filtration citulski et al 2009 le et al 2020 malhotra 1963 although being considered low cost and thus commonly used chemical precipitation is largely affected by the solution s ph and may produce a high amount of sludge that needs to be further treated or processed yang et al 2012 biological methods can have high removal efficiencies but also incur high cost and require highly skilled operation oehmen et al 2007 membrane filtration e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration has outstanding efficiencies but requires considerably high capital cost and energy consumption chen et al 2019 compared to other methods adsorptive filtration possesses the advantages of low cost simple operation high efficiency and low energy consumption le et al 2019 moreover adsorbents can be regenerated for multiple uses making the treatment environmentally friendly ahmadi et al 2018 metal i e aluminum iron lanthanum etc hydroxides oxides are often used for the adsorption of phosphate which can form inner sphere complex with the hydroxyl surface groups kumar et al 2019 between different metal hydroxides oxides lanthanum la oxides hydroxide have shown promising performance for p adsorption due to their high affinity for phosphate chen et al 2016 hao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2012 also in recent years layered double hydroxides ldhs and their calcination derivatives layered double oxides ldos have been studied intensively as promising adsorbents for water purification applications goh et al 2008 gonzalez rodriguez et al 2017 hatami et al 2018 li et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 ldhs are brucite like layers denoted as m2 1 xm3 x oh 2an x n mh2o in which m2 and m3 are the di valent and trivalent cations respectively x is the molar ratio of m 3 m 3 m 2 and an are the intercalated anions the high surface area low cost highly tunable interior architecture and outstanding anion exchange ability render ldhs potential adsorbents for both inorganic and organic contaminants goh et al 2008 the porosity and surface area of ldhs can be further increased by exfoliation adachi pagano et al 2000 or intercalation decomposition processes gonzalez rodriguez et al 2017 however these methods require complicated synthesis processes and involve the use of toxic and dangerous chemicals zubair et al 2017 on the other hand egg white has been employed to synthesize porous ferrospinel materials wang et al 2018 the oxidization and gasification of organic compounds of the egg white during calcination can leave behind pores and cavities and thus increase the surface area of the material which is generally preferred for surface mediated processes therefore the addition of egg white during the synthesis of ldhs ldos may represent a simple and green method to enhance the surface properties of the material for adsorption applications most adsorption studies in the literature have only employed synthetic phosphate polluted solution prepared with deionized di water and the experiments have often been conducted in batch mode which is not representative in terms of practical conditions for wastewater treatment therefore in addition to batch adsorption tests that can characterize the adsorption capacity there is a need for flow through studies which can better capture the dynamic changes of actual wastewater treatment processes in this study we synthesized magnetic porous ni la ldos nila ldos fe3o4 via a low temperature one pot co precipitation method with the addition of egg white and subsequently employed it for the adsorption of phosphate and antibacterial testing toward e coli the magnetic separability can ease post separation when needed the low cost and simple egg white treatment helped enhance the porosity and surface area of ldos and consequently the treatment capacity also the reusability of ni la ldos for phosphate removal from both synthetic solution and secondary effluent was examined in cyclic adsorption desorption runs moreover a column study was conducted with secondary effluent collected from a local wwtp in order to estimate the lifetime of the adsorbent at field scale adsorption application the homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm was adopted for the mathematical modelling of field scale operations lastly the antibacterial properties of nila ldos fe3o4 was tested against e coli inactivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals of analytical grade including ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o

sodium carbonate na2co3 and potassium phosphate monobasic kh2po4 were purchased from fisher scientific eggs were obtained from a local grocery store 18 2 mω cm milli q water was used in all the synthesis and experiments unless otherwise noted 2 2 synthesis of magnetic porous nila ldos fe3o4 a hydrothermal method was used to prepare fe3o4 nanoparticles which is detailed in the supporting information si text s1 nila ldos fe3o4 was synthesized using a low saturation co precipitation method specifically fe3o4 nanoparticles 1 38 g were first dispersed into 150 ml di water using ultrasonic treatment the synthesis was performed in a water bath at 80 c with vigorous stirring a salt solution 100 ml containing 8 56 g nicl2 6h2o and 6 68 g lacl3 7h2o ni la molar ratio 2 1 and an alkaline solution 100 ml of 4 86 g naoh in order to keep ph at about 10 and 3 82 g na2co3 were added drop wise simultaneously then 60 ml egg white was added as a template to enhance the porosity of the material the products were then aged at room temperature for 8 h dried at 60 c crushed and calcined at 500 c for 60 min the porous nila ldos fe3o4 was separated by a magnet and washed with di water until the effluent became neutral nila ldos fe3o4 with other ni la molar ratios were also prepared moreover different control samples were synthesized porous ni fe3o4 and porous la fe3o4 were prepared with only ni or la salt nonporous nila ldos fe3o4 were synthesized without the addition of egg white the performance of different adsorbents was examined in our preliminary study as shown in fig s1 porous nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited the highest p adsorption capacity and thus was tested in the following experiments 2 3 material characterization surface morphology and composition of nila ldos fe3o4 were analyzed with jeol fe 7000 scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fesem eds x ray photoelectron spectra xps spectra were collected with kratos axis ultra dld 600w fourier transformed infrared atr ftir analysis was performed on a thermo scientific nicolet ftir from 400 to 4000 cm 1 specific surface area pore size and pore volume were measured using multi bet dft and bjh methods respectively with nitrogen adsorption at 77 k on a quantachrome autosorb iq mp xr ahmadi and wu 2019 point of zero charge phpzc was determined by batch equilibrium techniques as described in our previous study vu and wu 2019 2 4 batch adsorption experiment batch adsorption tests were conducted in 40 ml of synthetic phosphate solution ph 7 ionic strength 3 5 mm nacl unless otherwise noted containing 0 05 g the adsorbent at 25 c and 60 rpm isotherm tests were performed for 24 h with the initial phosphate concentrations of 0 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 and 400 mg l 1 to study the effects of ph isotherm experiments were conducted at ph 5 5 7 8 5 and 12 5 ionic strength 3 5 mm nacl similarly the effects of ionic strength were studied at 5 10 15 and 20 mm nacl ph 7 the effects of co existing species sulfate bicarbonate and humic acid were also investigated in batch isotherm experiments as well as batch kinetics tests at 120 rpm with an initial phosphate concentration 7 mg l 1 which is a representative phosphate concentration in secondary effluent usepa 2007 batch experiments isotherm and kinetics were also conducted in real secondary effluent taken from a local wastewater treatment plant characteristics of the secondary effluent are provided in table s1 the isotherm and kinetics determination were based on langmuir and freundlich and pseudo first and pseudo second models respectively texts s2 s3 adsorbent regeneration was carried out by mixing the saturated adsorbents 0 05 g in 0 1 m naoh 5m nacl desorbing solution 40 ml for 2 h at 60 rpm and 25 c kong et al 2018 zhan et al 2016 the adsorbent was then dried at 60 c and tested for phosphate adsorption again the desorption adsorption cycle was repeated 7 times phosphate measurement was conducted using a uv vis spectrometer at 880 nm hach method 8048 detection ranges 0 02 2 5 mg l 1 2 5 homogenous surface diffusion model hsdm for column lifetime estimation mathematical equation of hsdm model is provided in the si text s4 and fitting of the hsdm model was performed using fast 2 0 fixed bed adsorption simulation tool technische universität berlin software 2 5 1 determination of film diffusion coefficient k l and surface diffusion coefficient d s by differential column batch reactor dcbr experiments the details of the dcbr setup are reported elsewhere sontheimer et al 1988 here the secondary effluent containing 7 mg l 1 phosphate was stored in a 5 l reservoir and recirculated through a small layer of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbents sandwiched between a bed of sand which showed no affinity toward phosphate data not shown at a flow rate that can help maintain the hlr to be higher than 14 m h 1 so that the film diffusion was not the rate limiting step sperlich et al 2008 the amount of adsorbent used was determined based on the requirement that the final equilibrium concentration was 50 of the initial concentration hand 1982 film diffusion coefficient k l and surface diffusion coefficient d s were determined using the multi run function of fast software 2 5 2 verification of hsdm results in order to verify the model continuous column flow through 175 mm l x 26 mm d experiments fig s2 were conducted using secondary effluent with an initial phosphate concentration of 7 mg l 1 at flowrate of 7 ml min 1 two layers 50 mm each of sand 0 85 2 mm were packed at the top and the bottom to distribute the flow the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbent 10 g was packed up to 32 5 mm neodymium magnet pieces were used to stabilize the adsorbent in the column other details of the column setup are shown in table 2 2 6 antibacterial experiments e coli microbiologics strain atcc 11775 mn usa was cultured on tryptic soy agar and incubated for 24 h at 35 c ahmadi and wu 2017 a small amount was then taken from the stock culture and inoculated into 0 9 nacl to prepare a stock solution from which a small aliquot was taken and spiked into the secondary effluent where the initial concentrations was controlled at 1 1 104 1 4 104 cfu ml 1 next 50 mg of adsorbents were mixed with 40 ml secondary effluent spiked with e coli antibacterial experiments were performed in a shaker at 35 c samples were taken at different time intervals for e coli measurement using plate counting duplicate plates were prepared for each dilution 10 300 times with total 6 measurements for each sample 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 was performed to assess the model verification where the difference between the experimental data and model prediction was evaluated based on a 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch adsorption experiments 3 1 1 effects of ph and ionic strength ph is one of the most important water chemistry parameters that may have a profound effect on the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbents and adsorbates herein batch isotherm tests were performed within the typical ph range 6 9 of secondary effluent company et al 2007 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2013 to examine the effect of ph on phosphate uptake by nila ldos fe3o4 as illustrated in fig 1 a ph showed little effect on the adsorption capacities of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 toward phosphate and maximized at 175 20 178 40 mg g 1 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption behavior at different ph table s3 though a better fitting with langmuir model r 2 0 99 was observed freundlich model fitting was also good r 2 0 95 0 97 therefore multiple types of interactions may be involved in the adsorption wang et al 2019 the phpzc of nila ldos fe3o4 was measured to be 11 7 table s2 this may explain the ph independence of phosphate adsorption within the neutral range where the adsorbent surface was protonated and may maintain a relatively constant affinity electrostatic attraction toward the negatively charged phosphate species to further confirm this the phosphate adsorption experiment was carried out at ph 12 5 phpzc as can be seen in fig 1a a noticeable decrease of the adsorption capacity 104 8 mg g 1 was observed which can be explained by the fact that the adsorbent surface was deprotonated creating repulsive forces between the negative surface of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 and phosphate anions and thus lowering the phosphate uptake nonetheless the stable and high phosphate adsorption capacity within the common ph range of secondary effluent demonstrates the appealing properties of nila ldos fe3o4 for field wastewater treatment applications the effects of ionic strength 5 20 mm on the isotherm were shown in fig 1b the maximum adsorption capacities stabilized at 174 40 178 00 mg g 1 within the testing range again langmuir model r 2 0 99 fit better the adsorption isotherms than freundlich model r 2 0 97 0 98 the overlapped isotherm curves at different ionic strengths demonstrated negligible effects of ionic strength which suggests the adsorption can be characterized as inner sphere complexation compared to the outer sphere complexation the inner sphere complexation is relatively independent to the competitive sorption of the background ions and the electric double layer contraction gu et al 2016 su et al 2013 the shift of phpzc of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 to a lower value 7 6 and the increase of the solution s ph after phosphate adsorption from 7 to 8 2 are deemed explainable for the inner sphere complexation between the metal hydroxyl groups and phosphate species li et al 2016 xu et al 2017b it is likely that the physical electrostatic interaction first occurred between the negatively charged phosphate and the positively charged sites on the surface of the adsorbent where then the inner sphere complexation with mainly la sites stepped in and strengthened the bonding between them 3 1 2 effects of co existing species the presence of major co existing species such as sulfate bicarbonate and effluent organic matter efom in real environmental water matrices can lower phosphate removal due to their competition for adsorption sites aly et al 2017 company et al 2007 soluble humic acid a fraction of natural organic matter nom can also form complexes with phosphate through ligand exchange and negatively affect the phosphate uptake by the adsorbent sibanda and young 1986 as nom is a part of effluent organic matter efom in secondary effluent we selected humic acid for testing the influence of efom on phosphate adsorption in synthetic solutions the role of efom could be further reflected in our later experiments with real secondary effluent together with humic acid sulfate and bicarbonate were also selected as the representative co existing species in environmental matrices typical concentrations of these species in the secondary effluent are reported to be 50 150 mg l 1 for sulfate 150 300 mg l 1 for bicarbonate and 2 4 mg l 1 for humic acid aly et al 2017 company et al 2007 filloux et al 2012 herein we examined the effects of sulfate 120 mg l 1 bicarbonate 250 mg l 1 and humic acid 3 76 mg toc l 1 on both the isotherm and kinetics of phosphate adsorption using nila ldos fe3o4 fig 2 a and b the shape of the isotherm curves in the presence of these species are similar to that of control where the adsorption capacities quickly increased to 112 80 122 00 mg g 1 and then gradually reached the maximum values of 155 20 165 60 mg g 1 the isotherms were also better described by langmuir model r 2 0 99 table s3 the inhibition effect follows the order of humic acid sulfate bicarbonate under the experimental conditions here considering the different concentrations of the interfering species used it seems humic acid exerts the strongest influence followed by sulfate and then bicarbonate in general presence of these species at environmentally relevant concentrations did not significantly affect the phosphate adsorption indicating the good selectivity of the nila ldos fe3o4 toward phosphate regarding the kinetics results at an initial phosphate concentration of 7 mg l 1 the highest adsorption capacities were at 5 46 5 57 mg g 1 with 97 99 43 removal in the presence of sulfate bicarbonate or humic acid the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics models were used to fit the experimental data text s3 the pseudo second order kinetics model r 2 0 97 0 98 showed a better fitting compared to the pseudo first order kinetics model r 2 0 89 0 95 table s3 the kinetic profiles of phosphate adsorption in the presence of other species are close to that of the control run suggesting the insignificant effects of the co existing species on the phosphate update rate by nila ldos fe3o4 such performance could be ascribed to the high selectivity of lanthanum towards phosphate and would support the recovery of phosphate with high purity hao et al 2019 3 1 3 tests in secondary effluent desorption and regeneration to evaluate the utility of nila ldos fe3o4 isotherm and kinetics experiments were conducted in real secondary effluent collected from a local wastewater treatment plant fig 3 a and b the isotherm followed langmuir model r 2 0 99 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 156 20 mg g 1 table s3 the lower adsorption capacity than those achieved in the synthetic solutions discussed above may be ascribed to the fact that secondary effluent is a complex matrix with many co existing species which can exert competitive and or inhibitive effects and thus negatively affect phosphate uptake by the adsorbents table s1 nevertheless the performance of nila ldos fe3o4 in real environmental matrices is high comparing with other adsorbing materials reported in the literature table 1 implying the good potential of the nila ldos fe3o4 for field applications the kinetics tests were performed with three initial phosphate concentrations of 1 4 and 7 mg l 1 and the highest adsorption capacities were 0 78 3 12 and 5 03 mg g 1 respectively the pseudo second order kinetics model r 2 0 96 0 99 can well describe the experimental data table s3 as can be seen in fig 3b the matrix effect was not significant at the environmentally relevant concentrations another important aspect that affects the practical application of an adsorbent is the regeneration possibility here the regeneration study was carried out in both synthetic solutions fig 4 a and secondary effluent fig 4b during 7 cycles of adsorption desorption regeneration the nila ldos fe3o4 maintained good removal efficiencies 88 99 in synthetic solution and 87 90 in secondary effluent and desorption rates 87 90 in synthetic solution and 82 92 in secondary effluent in both matrices which indicates that nila ldos fe3o4 is a promising material for phosphate removal in wastewater treatment 3 1 4 adsorbent characterization and adsorption mechanisms xps spectra of nila ldos fe3o4 fig s3 confirm the existence of ni 2p la 3d fe 2p and o 1s the sem images show many irregular crystals on the adsorbent surface and eds elemental analysis indicates ni and la occupied the surface sites fig 5 the xrd analysis of the adsorbent showed characteristic peaks of nio i e 101 012 110 113 and 202 jcpds 23 0362 and la2o2co3 i e 002 004 100 101 102 103 006 106 110 107 114 201 203 116 109 207 211 and 213 jcpds 37 0804 but peaks of fe3o4 were weakened where only two peaks at 111 and 311 were observed jcpds 75 0449 implying that the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles was mostly covered by the metal oxides fig s4 tang et al 2015 after the phosphate adsorption the intensities of xrd peaks at 2θ 22 3 25 2 25 9 30 1 44 0 and 47 3 were reduced which might be due to the intercalation of phosphate anions onto the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbent memory effect might take place reconstructing ldh layers from ldo and capturing phosphate ions during such reconstruction zhou et al 2011 ftir spectra of nila ldos fe3o4 before and after phosphate adsorption were also recorded as shown in fig s5 two new peaks appeared at 1053 and 615 cm 1 after phosphate adsorption which corresponded to the v3 and v4 band vibrations of phosphate species hpo4 2 and h2po4 hatami et al 2018 these peaks of p o could be attributed to the formation of inner sphere complex between phosphate species and the adsorbent hatami et al 2018 which is consistent with the abovementioned shift of phpzc of the adsorbent to a lower value and the increase the solution s ph after the adsorption further the reduction in transmittance of the c o bending vibration band at 1369 cm 1 carbonate suggests the anion exchange between phosphate anions and the adsorbent s carbonate anions moreover within the neutral ph range of secondary effluent h2po4 and hpo4 2 should be dominant species facilitating the electrostatic interactions between these ionic species and the positively surface charged adsorbent whose phpzc is above 11 table s2 zhan et al 2016 as the solution ph increases to above phpzc e g 12 5 in fig 1a such interaction became weaker since the adsorbent surface is negatively charged the fact that the adsorbent can maintain its adsorption capacity within a wide ph range could also be attributed to the permanent isometric substitution of la for ni in the octahedral sites or permanent surface charge during the synthesis chang et al 2019 in addition the weakening of o h vibrational peak at 1460 cm 1 water molecules suggests the formation of hydrogen bond between hydroxyl groups and phosphate zhan et al 2016 overall the adsorption of phosphate onto the porous nila ldos fe3o4 is a combination of inner and outer sphere complexation as summarized in table s2 the addition of egg white during the adsorbent synthesis increased the phpzc specific surface area pore volume and pore size of the nila ldos fe3o4 leading to the enhanced phosphate uptake capacity fig s1 egg white is known for the gelling foaming and emulsifying characteristics wang et al 2018 calcination in the presence of egg white can lead to the formation of porous oxides wang et al 2018 higher surface area brought about higher chance for the phosphate anions to interact with the adsorbent s surface enhancing the adsorption capacity the negligible effects of ph within the neutral ph range on the adsorption performance of adsorbents synthesized with egg white involvement have been reported previously hou et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 which is consistent with the observation in this study the phosphate adsorption capacity of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 was within the higher range of those of other magnetic adsorbents reported in the literature table s4 also the la containing adsorbents performed generally better probably due to the high affinity of la toward phosphate fang et al 2018 in general the existence of metal oxides active sites the high specific surface area and the positively charged surface within a wide ph range all contribute to the high phosphate adsorption capacity of nila ldos fe3o4 together with the property of easy separation nila ldos fe3o4 appears to be a promising adsorbent for the control of phosphate in secondary effluent 3 2 field scale adsorption beds using the porous nila ldos fe3o4 the lifetime of field scale adsorption setup was estimated firstly by determining the diffusion coefficients as described in section 2 5 2 and then conducting lab scale column tests to verify the performance of the hsdm model all experiments were conducted in secondary effluent the input parameters of the verification testing and the field scale simulation are shown in table 2 and the results of the column run model verification are shown in fig 6 a it can be seen that the hsdm model well predicted the column performance of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 p 0 05 hence the model was then used for the prediction of the field scale column performance a typical tertiary filter used in municipal wastewater treatment plants usually has a bed volume from 100 to 180 m3 and is able to treat a volumetric flowrate of 3 000 4 500 m3 day 1 cecen and aktas 2011 usepa 2000 the mass of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 in such a filter was estimated to be 100 000 kg corresponding to a bed density of 0 58 g cm 3 the prediction result of the field scale filter performance is shown in fig 6b considering the standard limit of 1 mg l 1 of total phosphorus i e 3 07 mg l 1 of orthophosphate as a monthly average for the nutrient discharge from wastewater treatment plants usepa 2011 the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbent in the field scale filter bed can last for 1845 2448 bv 3 4 months for initial concentrations varying from 4 to 7 mg l 1 until regeneration replacement is needed which is considered acceptable for tertiary nutrient filters usepa 2009 2007 another concern of field scale adsorption using the porous nila ldos fe3o4 is ni leaching therefore the leaching test was performed in batch mode 25 c 60 rpm with 0 05 g adsorbent and 40 ml secondary effluent samples were taken at different intervals 6 12 24 and 48 h as shown in fig s6 ni leaching remained almost constant at 0 1 mg l 1 after 6 h contact constituting the maximum ni leaching of 0 08 mg per g adsorbent considering that the field scale adsorption bed would be operated with 100 000 kg adsorbent to treat 3500 m3 day 1 secondary effluent for 3 4 months the average ni concentration in the effluent would be 19 25 μg l 1 which is even lower than the epa s maximum contaminant level mcl of 100 μg l 1 in drinking water usepa 1995 yet it should be noticed that this conservative approach of leaching testing in batch mode mixing for a long contact time is not the case at field scale application where the contact time would be much lower and leaching equilibrium may never be reached resulting in even lower ni concentration in the effluent 3 3 antibacterial activity the antibacterial performance of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 and fe3o4 nanoparticles along with the changes of e coli concentrations in the control sample are shown in fig 7 the fe3o4 nanoparticles showed negligible antibacterial activity while the porous nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited strong antibacterial activity toward e coli where 1 log reduction was achieved after 90 min and almost no e coli was detected after 120 min incubation 3 log reduction this antibacterial activity can be attributed to the existence of ni argueta figueroa et al 2014 yasuyuki et al 2010 and probably la species deng et al 2018 wenhua et al 2003 also the attachment of e coli on the surface of the porous nila ldos fe3o4 could inhibit its biological functions li et al 2019 ryu et al 2010 the negligible antibacterial activity of fe3o4 nanoparticles may be due to the short contact time 180 min moreover the metabolism of e coli could be indirectly affected when the porous nila ldos fe3o4 adsorbs the nutrients necessary for bacterial growth during wastewater treatment li et al 2019 ryu et al 2010 as a pathogen indicator the e coli concentration can reach up to 103 cfu ml 1 in secondary effluent posing a serious threat to the ecosystem and receiving waters anastasi et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2013 stampi et al 2001 the good antibacterial property along with the high phosphate adsorption capacity renders nila ldos fe3o4 a promising multifunctional material for tertiary filtration applications 4 conclusions in this study porous nila ldos fe3o4 was synthesized through a simple co precipitation process with the aid of egg white to improve the surface properties nila ldos fe3o4 showed a high phosphate adsorption capacity in both synthetic solution and real secondary effluent which was negligibly affected by changes in ph and ionic strength and the presence of co existing species anions and organics within the common ranges of those in secondary effluent furthermore nila ldos fe3o4 exhibited good regeneration capabilities during cyclic adsorption desorption runs in both synthetic solution and secondary effluent the hsdm model was used for the lifetime estimation of field scale applications under typical conditions the filter bed can last for 3 4 months before regeneration replacement is needed lastly the presence of ni and la species significantly enhanced the antibacterial property of the material compared with that of the fe3o4 core where 104 cfu ml e coli was completely inactivated after 2 h contact results from this study have demonstrated that nila ldos fe3o4 can be a promising multifunctional material for tertiary wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

18018,many sources of wastewater contain sulfides which can cause excessive growth of filamentous bacteria such as thiothrix sp resulting in bulking sludge in conventional activated sludge systems granular sludge systems could potentially also suffer from the growth of filamentous bacteria uptake of easily degradable cod by the relatively slow growing ca accumulibacter phosphatis bacteria and the absence of strong diffusion gradients due to plug flow feeding through the settled granular sludge bed are assumed to be the dominant factors for successful granulation sulfides will remain after this anaerobic phase and cause growth of sulfide consuming bacteria such as thiothrix sp here we observed the impact of growth of thiothrix sp bacteria in a laboratory aerobic granular sludge reactor by feeding a mixture of acetate and thiosulfate in the influent thiothrix sp proliferated when 18 of the influent cod was due to thiosulfate forming 51 4 8 3 of the total granular biomass despite the strong presence of these filamentous bacteria a well settling sludge was maintained svi10 equal to 13 3 ml g these results confirm that sludge morphology is not necessarily a reflection of the cell morphology of the bacteria but is highly influence by reactor operation it also reiterates the fact that compact biofilms are formed when the substrate consumption rate is lower than the substrate

volume indexes svi are obtained in laboratory and full scale installations de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015a many sources of wastewater contain sulfides this can originate from iron sulfate usage

presence is associated in wastewater treatment with proliferation of filamentous organisms especially thiothrix species leading to bulking sludge williams and unz 1985 many studies report on prevention and handling of filamentous bulking chiesa and irvine 1985 jenkins et al 2003 martins et al 2004 multiple engineering solutions have been developed for minimizing filamentous microorganisms in activated sludge systems such as addition of a selector or intermittent feeding chudoba et al 1973 verachtert et al 1980 houtmeyers et al 1980 there is limited information on the impact of proliferation of filamentous bacteria on granular sludge morphology occurrence of filamentous microorganisms in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems leading to problems have been reported in literature wanner et al 1987 gonzalez gil and holliger 2011 a study by rubio rincón et al 2017b reported the presence of thiothrix caldifontis next to ca accumulibacter phosphatis in an ebpr culture performing complete removal of both phosphate and acetate t caldifontis is a typical filamentous organism with a cell length up to 6 5 μm growing in multicellular filaments that are protected by polysaccharide sheaths this strain can anaerobically consume acetate and store it as polyhydroxyalkaonates pha wanner et al 1987 williams et al 1987 brigmon et al 1994 rubio rincon et al 2017a t caldifontis also encodes the ppk2 gene which is a widely conserved gene that is responsible for the synthesis of poly p from gtp or atp garcia martin et al 2006 simultaneously this strain can oxidize both sulfide and thiosulfate this oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds serves as another energy source next to pha oxidation which leads to an increased growth yield on acetate in this way t caldifontis can effectively compete with ca accumulibacter sp and other paos in the presence of sulfides the metabolic similarity between t caldifontis and ca accumulibacter phosphatis led to the question whether stable granulation can be achieved when this filamentous microorganism proliferates in sulfide containing wastewater formation of compact and non filamentous granules is based on diffusion based selection which prescribes that compact biofilms are formed when the substrate consumption rate is lower than the substrate transport rate van loosdrecht et al 1995 picioreanu et al 1998 based on this theory our hypothesis is that granule morphology is determined by reactor operation rather than by bacterial morphology van loosdrecht et al 1995 martins et al 2003 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 to verify this hypothesis a lab scale reactor has been operated with up to 25 cod in the form of thiosulfate and the remaining cod from acetate the choice for thiosulfate over sulfide has been made to purely study the increase in filamentous thiothrix and to prevent a potential toxicity of sulfide to the microbial community granule morphology changes in microbial community and phosphate removal rates have been monitored over time to identify the presence of filamentous bacteria and successful stable granulation 2 materials methods 2 1 reactor operation aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in a 3 0 l bubble column 5 6 cm diameter operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr similar to the setup as described in de graaff et al 2020 the reactor was seeded with biomass from a lab scale seawater adapted ags reactor the temperature was controlled at 20 c the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 1 by dosing either 1m naoh or 1m hcl during the first month of startup the ph was not controlled the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled at 3 7 mg l o2 50 saturation the average sludge retention time srt was 20 days the influent was 1 5 l per cycle consisting of 1200 ml artificial seawater instant ocean final concentration 35 g l 150 ml of medium a and 150 ml of medium b medium a contained 57 2 mm sodium acetate trihydrate medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm

g l edta the combination of these feed streams led to influent concentrations of 366 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 9 3 mg l po4 3 p the reactor was seeded with only 200 ml of granular biomass to make sure all the cod was taken up during the anaerobic feeding time the cod influent concentration for the first two weeks was limited to 14 3 mm sodium acetate thiosulfate was added to the influent by addition to the artificial seawater vessel its concentration was gradually increased up to 80 mg s cod l influent concentration equal to 18 cod from thiosulfate over a period of 58 days afterwards the thiosulfate concentration was increased to 120 mg s cod l equal to 25 cod from thiosulfate in a single step and operated for a period of 53 days reactor cycles with 80 mg s cod l 18 s cod consisted of 60 min of anaerobic feeding 195 min aeration 10 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal reactor cycles under 120 mg s cod l 25 s cod consisted of 90 min of anaerobic feeding 200 min aeration 5 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal 2 2 analytical methods concentrations of phosphate were measured on a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham usa acetate was measured by hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an ri and uv detector using 0 01m phosphoric acid as eluent the sludge volume index after 10 min svi10 was determined by taking a mixed liquor sample from the reactor during aeration and allowing this sample to settle in a measuring cylinder for 10 min this sludge was subsequently used for determination of the biomass concentration the settled granules in the measuring cylinder were washed with demineralized water to remove soluble salts dried for 24 h at 105 c and used for tss calculation the dried granules were subsequently incinerated at 550 c for determining the ash content and for vss calculation 2 3 granule morphology pictures of whole granules were taken with a stereo zoom microscope leica microsystems

analysis software 3 results 3 1 reactor operation an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor was operated with addition of thiosulfate in the influent up to 80 mg s cod l in combination with addition of 366 mg hac cod l equaling 18 of cod derived from thiosulfate a representative measurement of a typical cycle in the sbr reactor is shown in fig 1 the development of biomass concentration and phosphorus concentrations during reactor operation are shown in fig 2 acetate was completely removed by the biomass during the 60 min anaerobic feeding phase resulting in a net release of phosphate up to 65 4 mg l aerobic uptake of phosphate was linear over time with a rate of 3 2 mgp gvss h biomass concentration was stable with a concentration of 7 9 0 7 g vss l and a sludge bed density of 77 0 3 2 g tss l sludge bed an identical but thiosulfate free reactor operation is described in de graaff et al 2020 this reactor operation was used as the reference reactor after increasing the influent concentration to 120 mg s cod l 25 cod from thiosulfate from day 58 onwards anaerobic acetate uptake and anaerobic phosphate release began to decrease over a period of 36 days due to an accidental washout of around 50 of biomass from the reactor at day 104 acetate started leaking into the aeration phase and phosphate removal collapsed the sludge bed density decreased to 13 4 g tss l and the effluent started containing filaments with a solids concentration of 0 11 g l which was near zero before at this stage reactor operation was stopped 3 2 granule morphology stable granules were obtained when the reactor was fed with 18 cod from thiosulfate these thiosulfate based granules had a similarly dense structure as the thiosulfate free grown granules used as inoculation source fig 3 a and b minor amounts of filamentous outgrowth from the granule core were visible still resulting in proper settling behavior with a sludge volume index after 10 min svi10 of 13 3 ml g after a sudden drop in srt after 104 days of operation the granule morphology changed markedly into a more fibrillous structure fig 3c and d 3 3 microbial community robust granules were formed with thiosulfate in the feed despite the presence of filamentous thiothrix bacteria both the inoculum and the granules that were grown with 18 s cod were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish using probes that were specific for pao gao thiothrix sp and eubacteria the inoculum contained a large fraction of pao and gao were not detected fig 4 a no filamentous organisms were detected fig 4b granules from the thiosulfate added reactor showed a high abundance of thiothrix bacteria fig 4c based on quantification of fish images the fraction of thiothrix was estimated as 51 4 8 3 of the total amount of biomass the filamentous morphology of thiothrix was clearly visible and these bacteria coexisted with pao in the granule microbial community fig 4d and e besides these two groups also a smaller amount of gao was present fig 4f fish analysis on a slice of whole non crushed granules showed that gamma proteobacteria to which thiothrix belong are mainly present on the outer layer of the granules fig 5 inspection of the filamentous bacteria with bright field microscopy showed the presence of a large number of intracellular globules these were morphologically similar to storage polymers which are commonly found in thiothrix bacteria fig 6 dahl and prange 2006 rubio rincon et al 2017a 4 discussion 4 1 successful granulation with the presence of filamentous bacteria stable aerobic granules were obtained despite a dominant presence of filamentous thiothrix bacteria roughly half of the microbial biomass in the reactors was formed by thiothrix determined by fish analysis fig 4 nevertheless this still resulted in the formation of dense and well settling granules fig 3 the filamentous thiothrix bacteria mainly grew inside the granular structure rather than deteriorate settling properties and forming bulking sludge jenkins et al 2003 martins et al 2004 the results from this study show that the stability of aerobic granular sludge is not necessarily sensitive for the growth of filamentous bacteria unlike conventional activated sludge systems the standard theory states that bulking sludge occurs when there is a low substrate concentration in the bulk giving a competitive advantage to organisms with a low affinity constant k s especially filamentous organisms chudoba et al 1973 the generally higher μ max of floc forming bacteria as compared to filamentous bacteria is an important factor in their relative proliferation when substrate is present in higher amounts chudoba 1985 chiesa and irvine 1985 liu and liu 2006 this principle has led to the development of aerobic selectors with high spatial substrate gradients verachtert et al 1980 chiesa et al 1985 and explains why sbr systems suffer less from filamentous outgrowth than cstr systems martins et al 2003 in an earlier experiment by martins et al 2011 it was shown that proliferation of filamentous nostocoida bacteria can lead to compact flocs or bulking sludge depending on the presence of substrate gradients a key factor for stable granulation is the temporal separation of diffusion and consumption of cod and growth compact granules are obtained when the biofilm has a higher substrate diffusive transport than substrate consumption rate picioreanu et al 1998 the sbr operation in our study consists of anaerobic plug flow feeding during which the high substrate concentration allows for complete diffusion of acetate into the granules fig 1 this acetate is stored as pha inside the granule which is consumed for growth only during the subsequent aeration phase if the acetate were supplied aerobically the diffusive flux of oxygen or acetate would be rate limiting compared to the metabolic capacity and would lead to less stable granule formation thiothrix much like pao and gao have the ability to store acetate as pha under anaerobic conditions rubio rincón et al 2017a this means that the same granulation principles apply stable granule formation fig 5 with the filamentous thiothrix bacteria can be formed under the correct reactor operations 4 2 proliferation of thiothrix in an ebpr system in our study with only 18 of the influent cod being reduced sulfur roughly 50 of the biomass consisted of thiothrix with the remainder mainly formed by ca accumulibacter phosphatis an essential factor for the successful proliferation of thiothrix is the capacity of using reduced sulfur compounds as energy source reduced sulfur is rapidly sequestered as intracellular sulfur pools these are oxidized for energy generation during the aerobic phase to sulfate rubio rincon et al 2017a observed an increase in the yield by 116 7 when compared to typical pao ca accumulibacter resulting in a higher fraction of thiothrix over ca accumulibacter in a suspended ebpr system rubio rincon et al 2017a this was linked to the extra energy that becomes available by oxidation of poly s pools allowing them to achieve mixotrophic metabolism chernousova et al 2009 the choice of thiosulfate instead of sulfide in our study led to a difference in terms of toxicity to ca accumulibacter sulfide affects its anaerobic metabolism more severely than its aerobic metabolism rubio rincón et al 2017b complete anaerobic uptake of acetate is essential for stable granulation so issues with filamentous outgrowth due to acetate overshoot into aeration were prevented by supplying thiosulfate rather than sulfide thiosulfate can be disproportionated by thiothrix to sulfide and sulfite or sulfate prior to being taken up by the cells hao et al 1996 this sulfide gets taken up rapidly by thiothrix under aerobic conditions in order to replenish their poly s pools rubio rincon et al 2017a the potentially toxic effect of sulfide production from thiosulfate is therefore deemed minor with this small exposure time 4 3 biological phosphate removal with thiothrix bacteria ebpr activity in our system was high at a remarkably high sulfur content of 18 cod next to acetate figs 1 and 2 this amount of sulfur was higher than usual observed in domestic wastewaters which is usually up to 10 mg s l in gravity driven sewer systems nielsen et al 1992 these results therefore imply that presence of sulfides in wastewater with subsequent growth of filamentous thiothrix bacteria is not a problem for development of good settling aerobic granular sludge removal of phosphate and anaerobic acetate uptake in our system started deteriorating when the reactor was fed with 120 mg s cod l and 366 mg hac cod l 25 cod present as thiosulfate rubio rincón et al 2017b observed steady phosphate removal with the presence of 65 3 filamentous t caldifontis bacteria after feeding with an influent concentration of 100 mg s cod l 295 mg hac cod l and 100 mg hpr cod l 20 cod from sulfide the vfa uptake rate decreased by 65 compared to sulfide free influent but their anaerobic time was long enough for complete consumption the remarkable change in granule morphology after an srt drop at 25 s cod fig 3c and d is likely due to the overshoot of acetate into the aeration phase rather than an effect of the growth of thiothrix sp mosquera corral et al 2005 the granules showed a more fibrous structure the lower uptake rate of vfa by the thiothrix community combined with a system more prone to preferential flow in the granular sludge bed with fibrous outgrowth resulting in acetate presence in the aerated phase where limited sulfide in the influent as in municipal wastewater seems not to give problems higher sulfide loadings might need extra attention for the influent distribution and flow rate through the granular sludge bed 5 conclusions reduced sulfur compounds select for thiothrix type of phosphate accumulating bacteria presence of thiothrix bacteria leads to stable aerobic granular sludge despite their filamentous cell morphology granule morphology is determined by reactor operation and in a much lower extent by morphology of the individual cells when easy degradable cod is still present when aeration starts in an aerobic granular sludge system the sludge morphology and p removal efficiency can rapidly deteriorate declaration

oxidize both sulfide and thiosulfate this oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds serves as another energy source next to pha oxidation which leads to an increased growth yield on acetate in this way t caldifontis can effectively compete with ca accumulibacter sp and other paos in the presence of sulfides the metabolic similarity between t caldifontis and ca accumulibacter phosphatis led to the question whether stable granulation can be achieved when this filamentous microorganism proliferates in sulfide containing wastewater formation of compact and non filamentous granules is based on

sludge was cultivated in a 3 0 l bubble column 5 6 cm diameter operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr similar to the setup as described in de graaff et al 2020 the reactor was seeded with biomass from a lab scale seawater adapted ags reactor the temperature was controlled at 20 c the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 1 by dosing either 1m naoh or 1m hcl during the first month of startup the ph was not controlled the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled at 3 7 mg l o2 50 saturation the average sludge retention time srt was 20 days the influent was 1 5 l per cycle consisting of 1200 ml artificial seawater instant ocean final concentration 35 g l 150 ml of medium a and 150 ml of medium b medium a contained 57 2 mm sodium acetate trihydrate medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm

g l edta the combination of these feed streams led to influent concentrations of 366 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 9 3 mg l po4 3 p the reactor was seeded with only 200 ml of granular biomass to make sure all the cod was taken up during the anaerobic feeding time the cod influent concentration for the first two weeks was limited to 14 3 mm sodium acetate thiosulfate was added to the influent by addition to the artificial seawater vessel its concentration was gradually increased up to 80 mg s cod l influent concentration equal to 18 cod from thiosulfate over a period of 58 days afterwards the thiosulfate concentration was increased to 120 mg s cod l equal to 25 cod from thiosulfate in a single step and operated for a period of 53 days reactor cycles with 80 mg s cod l 18 s cod consisted of 60 min of anaerobic feeding 195 min aeration 10 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal reactor cycles under 120 mg s cod l 25 s cod consisted of 90 min of anaerobic feeding 200 min aeration 5 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal 2 2 analytical methods concentrations of phosphate were measured on a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham usa acetate was measured by hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an ri and uv detector using 0 01m phosphoric acid as eluent the sludge volume index after 10 min svi10 was determined by taking a mixed liquor sample from the reactor during aeration and allowing this sample to settle in a measuring cylinder for 10 min this sludge was subsequently used for determination of the biomass concentration the settled granules in the measuring cylinder were washed with demineralized water to remove soluble salts dried for 24 h at 105 c and used for tss calculation the dried granules were subsequently incinerated at 550 c for determining the ash content and for vss calculation 2 3 granule morphology pictures of whole granules were taken with a stereo zoom microscope leica microsystems ltd m205 fa germany and processed with leica microsystems qwin v3 5 1 image analysis software 2 4 fluorescent in situ hybridization fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as described in bassin et al 2011 a mixture of pao462 pao651 and pao846 probes paomix were used for visualizing polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao crocetti et al 2000 a mixture of gaoq431 and gaoq989 probes gaomix were used for visualizing glycogen accumulating organisms gao crocetti et al 2002 gam42a probes were used for staining gammaproteobacteria manz et al 1992 g123t probes were used for staining thiothrix bacteria kanagawa et al 2000 a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii probes were used for staining all bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 images were taken with a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with filter set 26 bp 575e625 ft645 bp 660e710 20 bp 546 12 ft560 bp 575e640 17 bp 485 20 ft 510 bp 5515e565 for cy5 cy3 and fluos respectively quantification of fish images was done by counting the relative amounts of pixels per fluorescence signal of cy3 fluos and cy5 signals using leica microsystems qwin v3 5 1 image analysis software 3 results 3 1 reactor operation an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor was operated with addition of thiosulfate in the influent up to 80 mg s cod l in combination with addition of 366 mg hac cod l equaling 18 of cod derived from thiosulfate a representative measurement of a typical cycle in the sbr reactor is shown in fig 1 the development of biomass concentration and phosphorus concentrations during reactor operation are shown in fig 2 acetate was completely removed by the biomass during the 60 min anaerobic feeding phase resulting in a net release of phosphate up to 65 4 mg l aerobic uptake of phosphate was linear over time with a rate of 3 2 mgp gvss h biomass concentration was stable with a concentration of 7 9 0 7 g vss l and a sludge bed density of 77 0 3 2 g tss l sludge bed an identical but thiosulfate free reactor operation is described in de graaff et al 2020 this reactor operation was used as the reference reactor after increasing the influent concentration to 120 mg s cod l 25 cod from thiosulfate from day 58 onwards anaerobic acetate uptake and anaerobic phosphate release began to decrease over a period of 36 days due to an accidental washout of around 50 of biomass from the reactor at day 104 acetate started leaking into the aeration phase and phosphate removal collapsed the sludge bed density decreased to 13 4 g tss l and the effluent started containing filaments with a solids concentration of 0 11 g l which was near zero before at this stage reactor operation was stopped 3 2 granule morphology stable granules were obtained when the reactor was fed with 18 cod from thiosulfate these thiosulfate based granules had a similarly dense structure as the thiosulfate free grown granules used as inoculation source fig 3 a and b minor amounts of filamentous outgrowth from the granule core were visible still resulting in proper settling behavior with a sludge volume index after 10 min svi10 of 13 3 ml g after a sudden drop in srt after 104 days of operation the granule morphology changed markedly into a more fibrillous structure fig 3c and d 3 3 microbial community robust granules were formed with thiosulfate in the feed despite the presence of filamentous thiothrix bacteria both the inoculum and the granules that were grown with 18 s cod were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish using probes that were specific for pao gao thiothrix sp and eubacteria the inoculum contained a large fraction of pao and gao were not detected fig 4 a no filamentous organisms were detected fig 4b granules from the thiosulfate added reactor showed a high abundance of thiothrix bacteria fig 4c based on quantification of fish images the fraction of thiothrix was estimated as 51 4 8 3 of the total amount of biomass the filamentous morphology of thiothrix was clearly visible and these bacteria coexisted with pao in the granule microbial community fig 4d and e besides these two groups also a smaller amount of gao was present fig 4f fish analysis on a slice of whole non crushed granules showed that gamma proteobacteria to which thiothrix belong are mainly present on the outer layer of the granules fig 5 inspection of the filamentous bacteria with bright field microscopy showed the presence of a large number of intracellular globules these were morphologically similar to storage polymers which are commonly found in thiothrix bacteria fig 6 dahl and prange 2006 rubio rincon et al 2017a 4 discussion 4 1 successful granulation with the presence of filamentous bacteria stable aerobic granules were obtained despite a dominant presence of filamentous thiothrix bacteria roughly half of the microbial biomass in the reactors was formed by thiothrix determined by fish analysis fig 4 nevertheless this still resulted in the formation of dense and well settling granules fig 3 the filamentous thiothrix bacteria mainly grew inside the granular structure rather than deteriorate settling properties and forming bulking sludge jenkins et al 2003 martins et al 2004 the results from this study show that the stability of aerobic granular sludge is not necessarily sensitive for the growth of filamentous bacteria unlike conventional activated sludge systems the standard theory states that bulking sludge occurs when there is a low substrate concentration in the bulk giving a competitive advantage to organisms with a low affinity constant k s especially filamentous organisms chudoba et al 1973 the generally higher μ max of floc forming bacteria as compared to filamentous bacteria is an important factor in their relative proliferation when substrate is present in higher amounts chudoba 1985 chiesa and irvine 1985 liu and liu 2006 this principle has led to the development of aerobic selectors with high spatial substrate gradients verachtert et al 1980 chiesa et al 1985 and explains why sbr systems suffer less from filamentous outgrowth than cstr systems martins et al 2003 in an earlier experiment by martins et al 2011 it was shown that proliferation of filamentous nostocoida bacteria can lead to compact flocs or bulking sludge depending on the presence of substrate gradients a key factor for stable granulation is the temporal separation of diffusion and consumption of cod and growth compact granules are obtained when the biofilm has a higher substrate diffusive transport than substrate consumption rate picioreanu et al 1998 the sbr operation in our study consists of anaerobic plug flow feeding during which the high substrate concentration allows for complete diffusion of acetate into the granules fig 1 this acetate is stored as pha inside the granule which is consumed for growth only during the subsequent aeration phase if the acetate were supplied aerobically the diffusive flux of oxygen or acetate would be rate limiting compared to the metabolic capacity and would lead to less stable granule formation thiothrix much like pao and gao have the ability to store acetate as pha under anaerobic conditions rubio rincón et al 2017a this means that the same granulation principles apply stable granule formation fig 5 with the filamentous thiothrix bacteria can be formed under the correct reactor operations 4 2 proliferation of thiothrix in an ebpr system in our study with only 18 of the influent cod being reduced sulfur roughly 50 of the biomass consisted of thiothrix with the remainder mainly formed by ca accumulibacter phosphatis an essential factor for the successful proliferation of thiothrix is the capacity of using reduced sulfur compounds as energy source reduced sulfur is rapidly sequestered as intracellular sulfur pools these are oxidized for energy generation during the aerobic phase to sulfate rubio rincon et al 2017a observed an increase in the yield by 116 7 when compared to typical pao ca accumulibacter resulting in a higher fraction of thiothrix over ca accumulibacter in a suspended ebpr system rubio rincon et al 2017a this was linked to the extra energy that becomes available by oxidation of poly s pools allowing them to achieve mixotrophic metabolism chernousova et al 2009 the choice of thiosulfate instead of sulfide in our study led to a difference in terms of toxicity to ca accumulibacter sulfide affects its anaerobic metabolism more severely than its aerobic metabolism rubio rincón et al 2017b complete anaerobic uptake of acetate is essential for stable granulation so issues with filamentous outgrowth due to acetate overshoot into aeration were prevented by supplying thiosulfate rather than sulfide thiosulfate can be disproportionated by thiothrix to sulfide and sulfite or sulfate prior to being taken up by the cells hao et al 1996 this sulfide gets taken up rapidly by thiothrix under aerobic conditions in order to replenish their poly s pools rubio rincon et al 2017a the potentially toxic effect of sulfide production from thiosulfate is therefore deemed minor with this small exposure time 4 3 biological phosphate removal with thiothrix bacteria ebpr activity in our system was high at a remarkably high sulfur content of 18 cod next to acetate figs 1 and 2 this amount of sulfur was higher than usual observed in domestic wastewaters which is usually up to 10 mg s l in gravity driven sewer systems nielsen et al 1992 these results therefore imply that presence of sulfides in wastewater with subsequent growth of filamentous thiothrix bacteria is not a problem for development of good settling aerobic granular sludge removal of phosphate and anaerobic acetate uptake in our system started deteriorating when the reactor was fed with 120 mg s cod l and 366 mg hac cod l 25 cod present as thiosulfate rubio rincón et al 2017b observed steady phosphate removal with the presence of 65 3 filamentous t caldifontis bacteria after feeding with an influent concentration of 100 mg s cod l 295 mg hac cod l and 100 mg hpr cod l 20 cod from sulfide the vfa uptake rate decreased by 65 compared to sulfide free influent but their anaerobic time was long enough for complete consumption the remarkable change in granule morphology after an srt drop at 25 s cod fig 3c and d is likely due to the overshoot of acetate into the aeration phase rather than an effect of the growth of thiothrix sp mosquera corral et al 2005 the granules showed a more fibrous structure the lower uptake rate of vfa by the thiothrix community combined with a system more prone to preferential flow in the granular sludge bed with fibrous outgrowth resulting in acetate presence in the aerated phase where limited sulfide in the influent as in municipal wastewater seems not to give problems higher sulfide loadings might need extra attention for the influent distribution and flow rate through the granular sludge bed 5 conclusions reduced sulfur compounds select for thiothrix type of phosphate accumulating bacteria presence of thiothrix bacteria leads to stable aerobic granular sludge despite their filamentous cell morphology granule morphology is determined by reactor operation and in a much lower extent by morphology of the individual cells when easy degradable cod is still present when aeration starts in an aerobic granular sludge system the sludge morphology and p removal efficiency can rapidly deteriorate declaration

18019,mainstream anammox still faces the challenges of non ideal no2 nh4 ratios and excess nitrate resulted from the instability of partial nitrification pn in municipal wastewater to address these problems in this study we developed a novel two sludge process that combined pn with synchronous anammox and endogenous partial denitrification saepd the process was tested with pre treated domestic sewage at ambient temperatures for 205 d high nitrogen removal efficiency of 91 2 was achieved with an influent c n ratio of 1 7 at 15 4 c the success was attributed to the fact that epd replenished the deficient nitrite by reducing nitrate and the excess nitrite was further reduced to nitrogen gas with a non ideal no2 nh4 ratio of 0 89 the contribution of the saepd sequencing batch reactor sbr during the anoxic stage reached 98 2 and the proportional contributions of the anammox and denitrification pathways were 77 2 and 22 8 respectively although the low nitrite accumulation 66 1 caused 10 8 mg n l of nitrate to be transported into the saepd sbr and the anammox reaction also converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate only 1 1 mg n l of nitrate remained in the effluent high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that although nh2oh was added some genera of nitrite oxidizing bacteria 0 73 remained in the pn sbr and potentially resulted in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in the saepd sbr anammox and endogenous denitrifying bacteria co existed and synergistically achieved the removal of ammonium nitrite and nitrate overall the pn saepd process has great potential for achieving cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 10859164 keywords mainstream anammox partial nitrification endogenous partial denitrification municipal wastewater energy efficiency 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which anaerobically oxidizes ammonium to nitrogen gas with nitrite as an electron acceptor has been widely considered a cost efficient process for nitrogen removal from wastewater gu et al 2018 kuenen 2008 combined with partial nitrification pn nh4 no2 anammox based processes reduce the requirements for aeration by 60 and for organic carbon by 100 and decrease sludge production by 90 in theory cao et al 2017 to date the pn anammox process has been successfully applied for removing high concentrations of ammonium from landfill leachate anaerobic sludge digestion of reject liquor lackner et al 2014 and other applications this technology has also been proposed for mainstream treatment to achieve cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment the stable nitrite production via pn is critical to the mainstream pn anammox process many efforts have been made to achieve pn through appropriate regulation of low dissolved oxygen do ma et al 2009 intermittent aeration kornaros et al 2010 aeration duration control yang et al 2007 free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 hydroxylamine nh2oh addition xu et al 2012 etc these approaches aim to promote the ammonia oxidation rate to out compete the nitrite oxidation rate and eliminate nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob however due to the difficulty in the suppression of nob at low ammonium strength and ambient temperatures the mainstream pn anammox process has still not been applied successfully in municipal wastewater treatment reino et al 2018 the excess growth of nob often leads to fluctuations in the nitrite to ammonium no2 nh4 ratio and results in low nitrogen removal efficiencies approximately 70 with high nitrate accumulation in the final effluent especially at low temperatures cao et al 2017 in addition the organic matter present in the municipal wastewater can result in the competition for nitrite between heterotrophic bacteria and anammox bacteria which has adverse effects on the sustainability of the anammox based process cao et al 2017 recently it was reported that endogenous partial denitrification epd driven by glycogen accumulating organisms gaos resulted in a stable production of nitrite for the anammox reaction ji et al 2017 2018 gaos are able to fully absorb organic matter contained in the influent to form polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions and then use phas as carbon sources for reducing nitrate to nitrite under anoxic conditions rubio rincón et al 2017 ji et al 2017 previous studies have evaluated the feasibility of achieving mainstream anammox in combination with epd and nitrification for treating simulated domestic sewage ji et al 2018 however very few studies were conducted on the epd anammox process for the nitrogen removal from actual domestic sewage wang et al 2019 it should also be noted that nitrate as the electron acceptor in epd is produced by the nitrifying pathway which consumes more aeration energy than pn ma et al 2017a additionally nitrate as a by product of the anammox reaction remains in the final effluent of the epd combining with anammox system ji et al 2018 which requires additional treatment epd also provides an important opportunity for enhancing the nitrogen removal efficiency by integrating it and anammox in a single reactor however this remains unexplored to date the synergy of epd and anammox may enable significant savings due to the lower requirements for aeration and organic carbon when combined with pn in such a process nitrate produced by nob and anammox bacteria can be reduced to nitrite for the anammox reaction and the excess nitrite can be further reduced to nitrogen gas this could complement each other s advantages to provide more flexibility regarding the no2 nh4 ratio for the anammox reaction potentially enhancing the robustness of the mainstream anammox system compared with traditional pn anammox technologies this technology also has a unique advantage to remove excess nitrate significantly improving the nitrogen removal efficiency moreover the low carbon requirements allow the system to be easily integrated with high rate activated sludge technology ma et al 2017a thereby making more organic material be used for biogas production the objective of this study is to develop a novel two sludge pn synchronous anammox and epd pn saepd process for treating pre treated domestic sewage with a low c n ratio the long term performance of the pn saepd system was evaluated for a period of 205 d as the ambient temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c the microbial community dynamics of the pn and saepd reactors were assessed using high throughput sequencing analysis the nitrogen removal pathways were explored by determining the nutrient concentration in a typical cycle of the pn saepd system and the robustness of the saepd pathway was investigated by conducting batch tests under various process conditions the results of this study provide a novel concept and technique for cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation two laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 10 l were employed for establishing the 2 sludge pn saepd system fig 1 whose ambient temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c during the experiment table 1 the pre treated domestic sewage was fed into the saepd sbr to transform biodegradable carbon sources to phas under anaerobic conditions subsequently the supernatant was fed into the pn sbr to oxidize ammonium to nitrite or nitrate and was then fed back into the saepd sbr under anoxic conditions ammonium and nitrite are removed by the anammox bacteria nitrate from the pn sbr or produced by the anammox reaction is reduced to nitrite via epd driven by gaos and is removed by the anammox bacteria resulting in a high level nitrogen removal efficiency the pn sbr was inoculated with the pn sludge from a pilot scale sbr used to treat domestic sewage at the beijing university of technology beijing china this reactor was operated without controlling the do 0 2 9 0 mg l the pn sbr was operated for four cycles per day with a cycle of 6 h including 10 min feeding 120 240 min aerobic reaction 40 min settling and decanting and 70 190 min of an idle period the pn sbr volume exchange ratio was 60 with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 3 6 6 h the 205 d treatment process was divided into three phases according to different control strategies in phase ⅰ day 1 52 a real time control strategy which coincided with the pilot scale sbr operation was used to stabilize the pn process in phase ⅱ day 53 121 approximately 2500 ml of sludge from the pn sbr was discharged every day and was thickened and reduced to 210 ml subsequently the thickened sludge was fed into an fna treatment unit and treated with 1 35 mg hno2 n l no2 n 550 mg l ph 6 0 0 1 t 22 c for 24 h the fna concentration was based on the results of a previous study wang et al 2014 after the treatment the sludge was transferred back to the pn sbr in phase ⅲ day 122 205 the fna treatment was discontinued and 0 2 g of hydroxylammonium chloride nh2oh hcl was added after feeding once a day resulting in an initial 10 mg l of nh2oh in the pn sbr the nh2oh concentration was selected according to a previous study xu et al 2012 the saepd sbr was inoculated with an anammox biofilm and the epd sludge the mature anammox biofilms were obtained from a pilot scale pn a reactor in the gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant wwtp beijing china which treats ammonium rich wastewater the biofilm carriers were cubic polyurethane sponge carriers with a length of 1 5 cm and pore density of 60 ppi in this study the anammox biofilms were strung together with nylon wire and attached to a shelf resulting in a carrier filling degree of approximately 9 the epd sludge was obtained from an enriched epd reactor used to treat nitrate wastewater with a nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 87 ji et al 2017 resulting in a biomass concentration of 2700 mg l it should be noted that most of the epd sludge was adsorbed on the biofilm carriers after about 7 d of operation the saepd sbr was operated under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions with a cycle of 6 h the 60 min anaerobic reaction included an initial 10 min feeding period 15 min settling and 10 min decanting and the 240 min anoxic reaction included an initial 10 min feeding period 15 min settling 10 min decanting and 10 min idle period the saepd sbr to pn sbr volume exchange ratio was 60 and the saepd sbr volume discharge ratio was 50 resulting in an hrt of 10 h 2 2 wastewater composition the actual domestic sewage was collected from a septic tank in the residential area of the beijing university of technology in china the characteristics of the sewage were as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 224 6 21 2 mg l nh4 n 67 7 5 1 mg n l no2 n 1 0 mg n l no3 n 1 0 mg n l and po4 3 p 5 8 1 3 mg p l to simulate pre treated domestic sewage via the carbon capture process the domestic sewage was diluted by the final effluent of the saepd sbr accompanied by the replenishment of nh4 n by adding ammonium chloride this resulted in a low c n ratio 1 4 2 8 of the pre treated domestic sewage which contained 80 6 169 7 mg l of cod and approximately 60 mg n l of nh4 n this sewage was used as the influent of the pn saepd system in this study 2 3 bath tests to evaluate the robustness of the saepd pathway with different initial no3 n no2 n ratios in order to demonstrate the robustness of the pn saepd system especially with regard to the low nitrite accumulation via pn the nitrogen performance of the saepd unit with different initial no3 n no2 n ratios was evaluated by bath tests table 2 in the steady period the biofilm carriers were removed from the saepd sbr after the anaerobic reaction and transferred to four sealed reactors with a working volume of 500 ml in order to remove the residual oxygen high purity n2 was sparged in each reactor until the do concentration was below 0 02 mg l prior to the tests at the beginning of the bath tests a stock solution containing ammonium 30 g n l nh4cl was added to each reactor resulting in an initial nh4 n concentration of approximately 15 mg n l in addition two stock solutions containing nitrite 30 g n l no2na and nitrate 30 g n l no3na respectively were added to the four reactors resulting in an initial nox n no2 n no3 n concentration of approximately 15 mg n l with initial no3 n no2 n ratios of 0 0 5 2 and respectively all anoxic tests were conducted at 25 0 5 c and magnetic stirrers were used to ensure complete mixing each test lasted 240 min and samples were obtained every 30 min 2 4 analytical methods wastewater samples were collected and immediately filtered through 0 45 μm filter

sbr provides nitrite for the saepd sbr and it is inevitable to produce nitrate with a relative low nitrite accumulation ratio nar the performance of the ammonium transformation in the pn sbr is shown in fig 2 during phase ⅰ day 1 52 the aerobic reaction was stopped through real time control when nitritation was complete which was indicated by the change in the ph yang et al 2007 in the first 30 d of operation a nar of 87 5 was achieved owing to the good performance of the seed sludge and the real time control strategy fig 2b however during 31 52 d the nar decreased from 83 7 to 13 1 as the nitrate concentration increased from 5 3 mg n l to 28 9 mg n l the absence of the anoxic denitrification stage led to nitrite accumulation at the beginning of the aerobic reaction going against the suppression of nob yang et al 2007 this might have been responsible for the instability of the pn after 30 d of operation in order to inhibit the activity of the nob a side stream sludge treatment using fna was introduced in phase ⅱ day 53 121 the details of this process were based on a previous study wang et al 2014 during 53 61 d an increase in the nar from 13 1 to 44 9 was observed with the decline in nitrate from 28 9 mg n l to 16 7 mg n l there was no ammonium residue fig 2b however the nar dropped to an average of 14 5 and the main product was nitrate 24 6 mg n l during 62 121 d indicating that the fna treatment in the side stream was not suitable for the sludge in this study the reason might be that the nob were able to adapt to the fna treatment during long term operation ma et al 2017b in addition the temperature gradually decreased from 25 5 c to 15 6 c in this period fig 2d and the low temperature was not beneficial to the growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob but favored the nob during the treatment of low strength ammonium wastewaters isanta et al 2015 therefore another strategy was needed to suppress the growth of nob in phase ⅲ day 122 205 nh2oh was added once a day to inhibit the nob activity previous studies have reported that the synthesis of the enzyme nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme was subject to the presence of nh2oh resulting in lower nob activity and the eventual removal of the nob xu et al 2012 sixteen days after the addition of nh2oh the nar increased from 4 6 to 85 3 on day 138 and then remained around 68 9 fig 2b this response is commonly observed in studies on pn for the treatment of domestic sewage with low strength ammonium at low temperatures isanta et al 2015 in the steady period day 138 205 the effluent of pn sbr contained nitrite and nitrate at concentrations of 21 8 mg n l and 9 7 mg n l respectively fig 2b the relatively low nitrite accumulation caused the no2 nh4 ratio average 0 89 to deviate from the desired ratio 1 32 strous et al 1998 traditionally resulting in poor nitrogen removal performance during the subsequent anammox reaction the excess nitrate which was not removed by the anammox reaction was transported into the anammox unit and increased the nitrate residue in the final effluent thus it is imperative to develop a cost efficient treatment to improve nitrogen removal performance under mainstream conditions 3 1 2 the performance of the saepd sbr the saepd sbr was operated in three phases over a period of 205 d as the ambient temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c the nitrogen removal performance during this process is shown in fig 2 in the first 22 d while the pn sbr provided as stable source of nitrite for the saepd sbr fig 2b the anoxic effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were 14 2 mg n l and 4 9 mg n l respectively and the no3 n concentration approached zero fig 2c this was likely related to the low activity of the anammox bacteria after inoculation hereafter the anoxic effluent nh4 n concentration gradually decreased to 4 0 mg n l and then slightly increased to 6 7 mg n l during 39 52 d due to the instability of pn in the pn sbr fig 2b and c moreover the anoxic effluent no3 n concentration increased to 6 9 mg n l resulting in a low tin removal efficiency of 77 6 fig 2d in phase ⅱ day 53 121 without the recovery of pn in the pn sbr the influent cod increased from 95 8 mg l to 141 3 mg l in order to improve the nitrogen removal performance of the pn saepd system fig 2a however with the increase in the influent c n ratio from 1 5 to 2 4 the tin removal efficiency still remained at a low level of 72 3 fig 2d the anoxic effluent no3 n concentration decreased to 2 8 mg n l and the nh4 n concentration increased to 13 5 mg n l fig 2c indicating that the anammox activity was subject to the high c n ratio the higher cod concentration facilitated the denitrification process which competed the key substrate no2 n with the anammox process cao et al 2017 in addition the high influent cod resulted in low nitrite accumulation during epd ji et al 2017 limiting the anammox activity and thereby leading to a low tin removal efficiency in order to ensure the anammox growth and suppress the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying organism an optimized saepd system comprised of the anammox granular sludge and epd floc sludge was suggested in future application in other words discharging the floc sludge could decrease the population of heterotrophic denitrifying organisms but further investigation is warranted in phase ⅲ day 122 205 the nar in the pn sbr increased to 68 9 fig 2b and the influent cod concentration of the saepd sbr declined to 102 4 mg l fig 2a the anoxic effluent nh4 n concentration decreased and then remained at 3 7 mg n l and the no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 0 5 mg n l and 1 1 mg n l respectively fig 2c as a result a high tin removal efficiency of 91 2 was achieved with an influent c n ratio of 1 7 at 15 4 c fig 2d during 154 205 d the low nar 66 1 and the high no3 n concentration 10 8 mg n l of the pn sbr effluent led to a lower no2 nh4 ratio average 0 89 at the beginning of the anoxic stage of the saepd sbr fig 2b in spite of this the nitrogen removal performance of this system stabilized at around 91 2 which might owe to the reduction of no3 n to no2 n via epd it also should be noted that the endogenous denitrification were able to reduce the no2 n or no3 n to n2 when there was excess nox n no2 n no3 n zeng et al 2003 ji et al 2018 thus due to the synergy of the anammox and epd processes the system was able to cope with non ideal initial no2 nh4 ratios demonstrating the robustness of the pn saepd system obviously in this study epd of which occurred owing to the inoculation of mature epd sludge with a nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 87 ji et al 2017 played an important role in suppling nitrite for anammox the low influent c n ratio of 1 7 led to a limitation in the organic matter supply likely benefiting the stable production of nitrite via epd ji et al 2017 2018 previous study reported that the nitrate reduction was prior to the nitrite reduction in the presence of nitrate resulting in a high nitrite accumulation during epd process ji et al 2017 this might also be the case in this study since the low nar 66 1 of the pn sbr caused excess nitrate to be transported into the saepd sbr and the anammox reaction also converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate moreover owing to the coexistence of anammox and endogenous denitrifying bacteria the produced nitrite from epd might be used immediately by anammox contributing to the high epd efficiency 3 2 contribution of the anammox pathway to tin removal under nitrite limiting conditions since almost all of the readily biodegradable cod was removed during the anaerobic stage of the saepd sbr the tin removal contribution of the pn sbr was negligible compared with the saepd sbr in this study in the anoxic stage of the saepd sbr the proportional contribution of the anammox pathway to the tin removal increased from 15 1 to 79 5 during 1 30 d and then remained at 93 6 during 31 52 d fig 3 a due to the instability of pn in the pn sbr during 31 52 d a sufficient amount of nitrate instead of nitrite was transported into the saepd sbr during the anoxic stage resulting in a decrease in the proportional contribution of the denitrification pathway with the limitation of electron donors as shown in fig 3b the nitrite provided by epd increased significantly thereby ensuring nitrogen removal via the anammox reaction with the low nitrite concentration of the influent with the increase in the influent cod concentration in phase ⅱ day 53 121 the proportional contribution of the anammox pathway decreased to 57 3 that of the denitrification pathway increased to 42 7 fig 3a this resulted in low nh4 n removal 5 1 mg n l fig 3b and low tin removal performance 72 3 of the pn saepd system fig 2d in phase ⅲ day 122 205 the contribution of the saepd sbr during the anoxic stage to tin removal of the pn saepd system reached 98 2 fig 3a among which the proportional contributions of the anammox and denitrification pathways were 77 2 and 22 8 respectively since the anammox pathway was dominant high tin removal efficiency 91 2 was achieved with a low c n ratio of 1 7 at 15 4 c fig 2d this also facilitated the nitrate removal via denitrification notably although the nitrite from the pn sbr did not meet the requirement of nh4 n removal via the anammox reaction during the anoxic stage of the saepd sbr fig 3b epd replenished the deficient nitrite and increased the proportional contribution of the anammox pathway to the tin removal thus the pn saepd system achieved stable and high nitrogen removal efficiency 91 2 and showed a unique advantage over the traditional pn anammox process which commonly exhibits fluctuations in the no2 nh4 ratio and results in low nitrogen removal efficiencies approximately 70 cao et al 2017 3 3 nutrient translation mechanism of the pn saepd system in a typical sbr cycle in order to investigate the nutrient translation pathway of the pn saepd system the ph do and the concentrations of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p in the pn sbr and saepd sbr were monitored during a typical operation cycle on day 189 fig 4 in the pn sbr owing to the inhibiting effect of nh2oh on the nob activity a significantly higher production rate of no2 n than that of no3 n was observed with the decrease in the nh4 n concentration fig 4a the ph first decreased before 150 min and began to increase after nh4 n was depleted at 150 min the reason was that acids were generated during the oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n yang et al 2007 resulting in a ph peak during the nitrification process a sharp increase in do was also observed near the minimum nh4 n concentration fig 4a because nitritation consumed 75 less oxygen than nitrification kornaros et al 2010 thus the aeration was terminated at the ph inflection point and do breakpoint using real time control thereby preventing the oxidation of the accumulated no2 n to no3 n however nob inevitably oxidized no2 n to no3 n resulting in no2 n and no3 n concentrations of 22 0 mg n l and 11 1 mg n l respectively in the effluent of the pn sbr fig 4a in the saepd sbr after feeding the cod concentration decreased from 81 5 mg l to 63 4 mg l during the anaerobic stage fig 4b due to a lack of no2 n or no3 n the decreased cod was potentially stored as endogenous carbon sources e g phas previous studies reported that gaos and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos often were enriched in the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions and could absorb and store organic substances as phas under the anaerobic condition wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2003 this might also be the case in this study moreover gaos relied solely on the consumption of glycogen to produce the required atp and nadh2 while paos mainly consumed polyphosphate for producing atp with the release of po4 3 p rubio rincón et al 2017 thus a slight increase in the po4 3 p concentration from 6 2 mg p l to 9 2 mg p l might indicate that gaos rather than paos played a predominant role in consuming exogenous carbon sources for phas synthesis in this study this also was supported by the higher abundance of gaos 3 89 than paos 0 77 in the saepd system detail see section 3 5 2 during the anoxic stage the nh4 n concentration decreased from 15 6 mg n l to 3 3 mg n l and the no2 n concentration decreased from 13 1 mg n l to 0 4 mg n l indicating that the anammox reaction had occurred a decrease in the no3 n concentration from 6 6 mg n l to 0 5 mg n l was also observed with no obvious change in the cod concentration fig 4b suggesting that denitrification had occurred and was likely driven by the endogenous carbon sources the po4 3 p concentration slightly decreased by 2 5 mg p l supporting that the endogenous denitrification were mainly driven by gaos according to the theoretical ratio 1 32 of no2 n to nh4 n for the anammox reaction strous et al 1998 the removal of 12 3 mg n l of nh4 n required 16 3 mg n l of no2 n which was higher than 12 7 mg n l of no2 n removed in this study previous study reported that epd readily occurred in an anaerobic anoxic system with the limited carbon sources among which epd bacteria could absorb and store organic substances as phas during the anaerobic period and then reduce nitrate to nitrite by using phas as carbon sources during anoxic period ji et al 2017 2018 this demonstrated that epd provided no2 n for the anammox reaction thereby improving the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies of the pn saepd system 3 4 the robustness of the saepd system with different initial no3 n no2 n ratios in order to evaluate the robustness of the saepd pathway anoxic batch tests were carried out with the biofilms obtained from the saepd sbr after the anaerobic reaction as shown in fig 5 the concentrations of removed nh4 n were 9 7 mg n l 8 9 mg n l 8 3 mg n l and 6 1 mg n l respectively in the four tests although the initial no2 n nh4 n ratio decreased from 1 09 to 0 36 with the increase in the initial no3 n no2 n ratio from 0 to 2 a slight decline 1 4 mg n l in the nh4 n removal amount was observed in batch test a c this suggested that the anammox reaction in the saepd system exhibited good robustness at initial no2 n nh4 n ratios ranging from 0 36 to 1 09 this was attributed to the nitrite production from nitrate via epd due to the absence of nitrite at the beginning of the batch test d fig 5d a lower amount of nh4 n removal was achieved and significant nitrite accumulation was observed with the decrease in nitrate at 30 min the likely reason is that epd reduced nitrate to nitrite during the anammox reaction although the by product of nitrate generated by the anammox reaction theoretically accounted for 26 of the ammonium removal strous et al 1998 no nitrate accumulation was detected in the first 180 min of each batch test owing to the role of epd fig 5 the slight accumulation of nitrate observed after 180 min fig 5a b and c might be resulted from the depletion of endogenous carbon sources which was similar with the observation reported before ji et al 2017 overall these results indicate that the saepd system has the potential to achieve complete nitrogen removal but this process requires further optimization in addition the contribution of the anammox pathway to the total nitrogen removal increased from 78 7 to 97 2 99 9 with the increase in the initial no3 n no2 n ratio from 0 to 2 or no presence of initial no2 n fig 5e the removal nox n nh4 n ratio decreased to about 1 09 which was close to the theoretical value 1 06 of the denitrifying ammonium oxidation deamox process du et al 2017 this indicated that in the presence of endogenous carbon sources the presence of nitrate attenuated the no2 n competition from denitrification and contribute to the anammox reaction in summary the proposed saepd system was able to cope with different no2 n nh4 n ratios resulting from the unstable pn potentially enhancing the robustness of the system 3 5 microbial community analysis of the pn saepd system 3 5 1 microbial community structure and dynamics in the pn sbr to better understand the mechanism of pn in this study the microbial community structure and dynamics in the pn sbr were analyzed using high throughput sequencing at the end of phase ⅰ day 50 nitrosomonas 0 15 which are proteobacteria was detected as the sole aob genus in the pn sbr fig 6 a nitrotoga and nitrospira which are nob had abundances of 0 01 and 0 30 respectively the relative abundance of nob 0 31 was much higher than that of aob 0 15 which may be the reason for the pn instability in phase ⅰ after the introduction of fna treatment in phase ⅱ the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 15 to 1 03 whereas that of nitrospira slightly decreased to 0 27 fig 6a however nitrotoga significantly increased from 0 01 to 5 05 resulting in a higher abundance of nob than aob this was consistent with a previous study which reported that nitrotoga could adapt to fna and their presence led to the failure of pn after long term fna treatment ma et al 2017b it was assumed that the presence of nitrotoga in this study was responsible for the low nar 14 5 in phase ⅱ fig 2b as shown in fig 6a the nitrotoga and nitrospira abundances decreased to 0 53 and 0 21 respectively while that of nitrosomonas increased to 2 73 in phase ⅲ this indicated that the relative abundance of aob was higher than that of nob after changing the strategy from the fna treatment to nh2oh addition which was responsible for the relatively high nitrite accumulation during this phase notably nob 0 74 did remain in the pn sbr which might have resulted in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and thereby affected the performance of pn with an undesirable nar of 66 1 fig 2b this phenomenon was also observed in other studies during the mainstream pn anammox process ma et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 indicating that the removal of excess nitrate is imperative 3 5 2 microbial community structure and dynamics in the saepd sbr in the saepd sbr the anammox bacteria were responsible for ammonium and nitrite removal and the gaos and paos were related to the nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation in this study the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia 0 83 1 46 and candidatus kuenenia 0 02 0 11 which belong to the planctomycetes phylum were detected fig 6b these two genera are usually dominant in anammox based systems especially during the treatment of domestic sewage with low levels of ammonium ali et al 2015 in phase ⅰ and ⅱ the relative abundances of the anammox bacteria remained at relatively low levels of 1 03 and 0 85 fig 6b respectively due to the low nitrite supply resulting from the instability of the pn process once the pn process was restored the abundances of anammox bacteria genera increased to 1 57 in phase ⅲ with a low temperature of 15 4 c thereby ensuring energy efficient nitrogen removal in this system this was consistent with previous studies that reported a stable anammox operation when there was enough nitrite even at 11 20 c ji et al 2019 reino et al 2018 due to the low nar 66 1 of pn nitrite accumulation during endogenous denitrification played a key role in supplying extra nitrite for the anammox reaction in this study candidatus competibacter dechloromonas and defluviicoccus which were previously reported as gaos involved in endogenous denitrification rubio rincón et al 2017 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2008 were detected with abundances of 1 97 4 01 0 18 1 98 and 0 32 0 57 respectively fig 6b the gao candidatus competibacter is assumed to be responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems rubio rincón et al 2017 in previous studies it was observed that an increase in nitrite in the early anoxic stage was driven by dechloromonas members with carbon sources of endogenous phas kim et al 2013 defluviicoccus which belongs to alphaproteobacteria was reported to likely reduce nitrate rather than nitrite wang et al 2008 our recent studies also confirmed that epd driven by gaos was feasible with a high nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of about 88 ji et al 2017 2019 moreover a significant nitrite accumulation was observed with the decrease in nitrate at 30 min during batch test d confirming the occurrence of epd in this study thus gaos with a major abundance of 3 89 4 56 might be responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the anammox reaction in the saepd system due to their similar metabolism paos regularly co exist with gaos in the activated sludge system rubio rincón et al 2017 candidatus accumulibacter 0 51 1 09 candidatus microthrix 0 002 0 23 paracoccus 0 04 0 11 and pseudomonas 0 01 0 34 which are paos wang et al 2019 were also detected in this study fig 6b their much lower abundance than the gaos abundance was associated with the negligible phosphorous removal performance of this system supporting that gaos played a predominant role in epd process except for the abovementioned gaos and paos some genera related to ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos were detected these might utilize the complex compounds generated by normal substrate metabolism or biomass decay to grow ji et al 2018 among them denitratisoma and thauera were the top two dominant genera with relative abundances of 0 63 3 89 and 0 46 2 02 fig 6b these genera have the ability to remove nitrate during denitrification wang et al 2019 in addition thauera was reported to contain much less nir 588 hits than nar 5892 hits ma et al 2017a resulting in high nitrite accumulation during the denitrification process and thereby facilitating the anammox reaction in summary various microbial species such as anammox bacteria gaos paos and ohos co existed in the saepd system fig 6b synergistically achieved the removal of ammonium nitrite and nitrate and ensured the good robustness of this system to cope with varying no2 n nh4 n ratios 3 6 the advantages and engineering application of the pn saepd process although the traditional pn anammox process has been widely investigated in the recent three decades and successfully applied in high strength ammonium wastewaters lackner et al 2014 it still faces many challenges in practical application according to the stoichiometry of the anammox reaction du et al 2017 20 of nitrite is converted to nitrate resulting in a maximum tin removal efficiency of 89 in other words the traditional pn anammox process is not able to remove the nitrate accounting for 11 of influent tin remaining in the effluent fig 7 a which needs to be further treated to meet strict sewage discharge standards especially for domestic wastewater with low strength ammonium instability of the pn process frequently occurs under mainstream conditions cao et al 2017 this not only leads to more nitrate production from nob but also provides an undesirable ratio of no2 nh4 for the anammox process that requires a strict no2 nh4 ratio of 1 32 lotti et al 2014 thus the pn anammox process may still not be adequate for municipal wastewater treatment reino et al 2018 and poor nitrogen removal efficiency 70 is usually achieved under mainstream conditions cao et al 2017 the novel pn saepd process developed in this study is able to cope with the low nitrite accumulation of pn fig 7b thereby significantly enhancing the robustness of the mainstream anammox system the ability of the saepd system to remove nitrate represents a unique advantage of this technology over traditional pn anammox technologies in this study although 66 1 of the nar resulted in about 10 8 mg n l of nitrate to be transported into the saepd unit and the anammox reaction converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate only about 1 1 mg n l of nitrate remained in the effluent fig 2 notably epd replenishes the nitrite whose low concentration is a result of the low nitrite accumulation of the pn process this allows more flexibility regarding the no2 nh4 ratio for the anammox reaction fig 7b on the other hand when the no2 no3 nh4 ratio is greater than 1 06 excess nox is eventually reduced to n2 by endogenous denitrification thus the pn saepd process possesses great robustness without the requirement of the strict no2 nh4 ratio of 1 32 and the tin removal efficiency can reach 100 theoretically in practical applications due to the high c n ratio of 7 12 which is common in municipal wastewater cao et al 2017 it is suggested that a high rate activated sludge system that captures carbon to produce biomethane is combined with the pn saepd system previous studies reported that the c n ratio of domestic sewage pre treated via carbon capture unit is 1 4 2 8 malovanyy et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 which is adequate to meet the requirements of the system as shown in this study moreover with the different nar of pn process an optimal c n ratio could be obtained flexibly through controlling a suitable solids retention time in the carbon capture process in this case while most of the organic matter contained in municipal wastewater is captured for energy recovery the remaining organic matter is fully utilized by the pn saepd system to achieve advanced nitrogen removal with an energy saving and cost efficient way overall the pn saepd process shows great potential and is favorable for achieving efficient and energy neutral positive municipal wastewater treatment 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of a novel pn saepd process for cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment the performance and microbial community of the pn saepd system for treating pre treated municipal wastewater which was simulated with actual domestic sewage and the final effluent were evaluated for over 205 d as the temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c the following conclusions were drawn 1 in this process a high tin removal efficiency of 91 2 was achieved with an influent c n ratio of 1 7 although 10 8 mg n l of nitrate from the pn sbr was transported into the saepd sbr and the anammox reaction also converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate only about 1 1 mg n l of nitrate remained in the effluent this represented a unique advantage of this technology over traditional pn anammox technologies which are not able to remove nitrate present in the wastewater 2 epd replenished the nitrite whose low concentration resulted from the low nitrite accumulation 66 1 of the pn sbr thereby significantly enhancing the robustness of the mainstream anammox system with a low no2 nh4 ratio of 0 89 the contribution of the saepd sbr during the anoxic stage to the tin removal was 98 2 and the proportional contributions of the anammox and denitrification pathways were 77 2 and 22 8 respectively 3 in the pn sbr the nh2oh addition resulted in a lower relative abundance of nob than aob which ensured nitrite accumulation however some nob 0 74 did remain in the pn sbr which might have resulted in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and thereby affected the pn performance with an undesirable nar of 66 1 4 various microbial species such as anammox bacteria gaos paos and ohos co existed in the saepd sbr synergistically achieving the removal of ammonium nitrite and nitrate and ensuring the ability of this system to cope with different no2

18019,mainstream anammox still faces the challenges of non ideal no2 nh4 ratios and excess nitrate resulted from the instability of partial nitrification pn in municipal wastewater to address these problems in this study we developed a novel two sludge process that combined pn with synchronous anammox and endogenous partial denitrification saepd the process was tested with pre treated domestic sewage at ambient temperatures for 205 d high nitrogen removal efficiency of 91 2 was achieved with an influent c n ratio of 1 7 at 15 4 c the success was attributed to the fact that epd replenished the deficient nitrite by reducing nitrate and the excess nitrite was further reduced to nitrogen gas with a non ideal no2 nh4 ratio of 0 89 the contribution of the saepd sequencing batch reactor sbr during the anoxic stage reached 98 2 and the proportional contributions of the anammox and denitrification pathways were 77 2 and 22 8 respectively although the low nitrite accumulation 66 1 caused 10 8 mg n l of nitrate to be transported into the saepd sbr and the anammox reaction also converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate only 1 1 mg n l of nitrate remained in the effluent high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that although nh2oh was added some genera of nitrite oxidizing bacteria 0 73 remained in the pn sbr and potentially resulted in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in the saepd sbr anammox and endogenous denitrifying bacteria co existed and synergistically achieved the removal of ammonium nitrite and nitrate overall the pn saepd process has great potential for achieving cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 10859164 keywords mainstream anammox partial nitrification endogenous partial denitrification municipal wastewater energy efficiency 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which anaerobically oxidizes ammonium to nitrogen gas with nitrite as an electron acceptor has been widely considered a cost efficient process for nitrogen removal from wastewater gu et al 2018 kuenen 2008 combined with partial nitrification pn nh4 no2 anammox based processes reduce the requirements for aeration by 60 and for organic carbon by 100 and decrease sludge production by 90 in theory cao et al 2017 to date the pn anammox process has been successfully applied for removing high concentrations of ammonium from landfill leachate anaerobic sludge digestion of reject liquor lackner et al 2014 and other applications this technology has also been proposed for mainstream treatment to achieve cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment the stable nitrite production via pn is critical to the mainstream pn anammox process many efforts have been made to achieve pn through appropriate regulation of low dissolved oxygen do ma et al 2009 intermittent aeration kornaros et al 2010 aeration duration control yang et al 2007 free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 hydroxylamine nh2oh addition xu et al 2012 etc these approaches aim to promote the ammonia oxidation rate to out compete the nitrite oxidation rate and eliminate nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob however due to the difficulty in the suppression of nob at low ammonium strength and ambient temperatures the mainstream pn anammox process has still not been applied successfully in municipal wastewater treatment reino et al 2018 the excess growth of nob often leads to fluctuations in the nitrite to ammonium no2 nh4 ratio and results in low nitrogen removal efficiencies approximately 70 with high nitrate accumulation in the final effluent especially at low temperatures cao et al 2017 in addition the organic matter present in the municipal wastewater can result in the competition for nitrite between heterotrophic bacteria and anammox bacteria which has adverse effects on the sustainability of the anammox based process cao et al 2017 recently it was reported that endogenous partial denitrification epd driven by glycogen accumulating organisms gaos resulted in a stable production of nitrite for the anammox reaction ji et al 2017 2018 gaos are able to fully absorb organic matter contained in the influent to form polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions and then use phas as carbon sources for reducing nitrate to nitrite under anoxic conditions rubio rincón et al 2017 ji et al 2017 previous studies have evaluated the feasibility of achieving mainstream anammox in combination with epd and nitrification for treating simulated domestic sewage ji et al 2018 however very few studies were conducted on the epd anammox process for the nitrogen removal from actual domestic sewage wang et al 2019 it should also be noted that nitrate as the electron acceptor in epd is produced by the nitrifying pathway which consumes more aeration energy than pn ma et al 2017a additionally nitrate as a by product of the anammox reaction remains in the final effluent of the epd combining with anammox system ji et al 2018 which requires additional treatment epd also provides an important opportunity for enhancing the nitrogen removal efficiency by integrating it and anammox in a single reactor however this remains unexplored to date the synergy of epd and anammox may enable significant savings due to the lower requirements for aeration and organic carbon when combined with pn in such a process nitrate produced by nob and anammox bacteria can be reduced to nitrite for the anammox reaction and the excess nitrite can be further reduced to nitrogen gas this could complement each other s advantages to provide more flexibility regarding the no2 nh4 ratio for the anammox reaction potentially enhancing the robustness of the mainstream anammox system compared with traditional pn anammox technologies this technology also has a unique advantage to remove excess nitrate significantly improving the nitrogen removal efficiency moreover the low carbon requirements allow the system to be easily integrated with high rate activated sludge technology ma et al 2017a thereby making more organic material be used for biogas production the objective of this study is to develop a novel two sludge pn synchronous anammox and epd pn saepd process for treating pre treated domestic sewage with a low c n ratio the long term performance of the pn saepd system was evaluated for a period of 205 d as the ambient temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c the microbial community dynamics of the pn and saepd reactors were assessed using high throughput sequencing analysis the nitrogen removal pathways were explored by determining the nutrient concentration in a typical cycle of the pn saepd system and the robustness of the saepd pathway was investigated by conducting batch tests under various process conditions the results of this study provide a novel concept and technique for cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation two laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs with a working volume of 10 l were employed for establishing the 2 sludge pn saepd system fig 1 whose ambient temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c during the experiment table 1 the pre treated domestic sewage was fed into the saepd sbr to transform biodegradable carbon sources to phas under anaerobic conditions subsequently the supernatant was fed into the pn sbr to oxidize ammonium to nitrite or nitrate and was then fed back into the saepd sbr under anoxic conditions ammonium and nitrite are removed by the anammox bacteria nitrate from the pn sbr or produced by the anammox reaction is reduced to nitrite via epd driven by gaos and is removed by the anammox bacteria resulting in a high level nitrogen removal efficiency the pn sbr was inoculated with the pn sludge from a pilot scale sbr used to treat domestic sewage at the beijing university of technology beijing china this reactor was operated without controlling the do 0 2 9 0 mg l the pn sbr was operated for four cycles per day with a cycle of 6 h including 10 min feeding 120 240 min aerobic reaction 40 min settling and decanting and 70 190 min of an idle period the pn sbr volume exchange ratio was 60 with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 3 6 6 h the 205 d treatment process was divided into three phases according to different control strategies in phase ⅰ day 1 52 a real time control strategy which coincided with the pilot scale sbr operation was used to stabilize the pn process in phase ⅱ day 53 121 approximately 2500 ml of sludge from the pn sbr was discharged every day and was thickened and reduced to 210 ml subsequently the thickened sludge was fed into an fna treatment unit and treated with 1 35 mg hno2 n l no2 n 550 mg l ph 6 0 0 1 t 22 c for 24 h the fna concentration was based on the results of a previous study wang et al 2014 after the treatment the sludge was transferred back to the pn sbr in phase ⅲ day 122 205 the fna treatment was discontinued and 0 2 g of hydroxylammonium chloride nh2oh hcl was added after feeding once a day resulting in an initial 10 mg l of nh2oh in the pn sbr the nh2oh concentration was selected according to a previous study xu et al 2012 the saepd sbr was inoculated with an anammox biofilm and the epd sludge the mature anammox biofilms were obtained from a pilot scale pn a reactor in the gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant wwtp beijing china which treats ammonium rich wastewater the biofilm carriers were cubic polyurethane sponge carriers with a length of 1 5 cm and pore density of 60 ppi in this study the anammox biofilms were strung together with nylon wire and attached to a shelf resulting in a carrier filling degree of approximately 9 the epd sludge was obtained from an enriched epd reactor used to treat nitrate wastewater with a nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 87 ji et al 2017 resulting in a biomass concentration of 2700 mg l it should be noted that most of the epd sludge was adsorbed on the biofilm carriers after about 7 d of operation the saepd sbr was operated under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions with a cycle of 6 h the 60 min anaerobic reaction included an initial 10 min feeding period 15 min settling and 10 min decanting and the 240 min anoxic reaction included an initial 10 min feeding period 15 min settling 10 min decanting and 10 min idle period the saepd sbr to pn sbr volume exchange ratio was 60 and the saepd sbr volume discharge ratio was 50 resulting in an hrt of 10 h 2 2 wastewater composition the actual domestic sewage was collected from a septic tank in the residential area of the beijing university of technology in china the characteristics of the sewage were as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 224 6 21 2 mg l nh4 n 67 7 5 1 mg n l no2 n 1 0 mg n l no3 n 1 0 mg n l and po4 3 p 5 8 1 3 mg p l to simulate pre treated domestic sewage via the carbon capture process the domestic sewage was diluted by the final effluent of the saepd sbr accompanied by the replenishment of nh4 n by adding ammonium chloride this resulted in a low c n ratio 1 4 2 8 of the pre treated domestic sewage which contained 80 6 169 7 mg l of cod and approximately 60 mg n l of nh4 n this sewage was used as the influent of the pn saepd system in this study 2 3 bath tests to evaluate the robustness of the saepd pathway with different initial no3 n no2 n ratios in order to demonstrate the robustness of the pn saepd system especially with regard to the low nitrite accumulation via pn the nitrogen performance of the saepd unit with different initial no3 n no2 n ratios was evaluated by bath tests table 2 in the steady period the biofilm carriers were removed from the saepd sbr after the anaerobic reaction and transferred to four sealed reactors with a working volume of 500 ml in order to remove the residual oxygen high purity n2 was sparged in each reactor until the do concentration was below 0 02 mg l prior to the tests at the beginning of the bath tests a stock solution containing ammonium 30 g n l nh4cl was added to each reactor resulting in an initial nh4 n concentration of approximately 15 mg n l in addition two stock solutions containing nitrite 30 g n l no2na and nitrate 30 g n l no3na respectively were added to the four reactors resulting in an initial nox n no2 n no3 n concentration of approximately 15 mg n l with initial no3 n no2 n ratios of 0 0 5 2 and respectively all anoxic tests were conducted at 25 0 5 c and magnetic stirrers were used to ensure complete mixing each test lasted 240 min and samples were obtained every 30 min 2 4 analytical methods wastewater samples were collected and immediately filtered through 0 45 μm filter

using the free online majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of nitrogen removal in the pn saepd system 3 1 1 the performance of the pn sbr the pn sbr provides nitrite for the saepd sbr and it is inevitable to produce nitrate with a relative low nitrite accumulation ratio nar the performance of the ammonium transformation in the pn sbr is shown in fig 2 during phase ⅰ day 1 52 the aerobic reaction was stopped through real time control when nitritation was complete which was indicated by the change in the ph yang et al 2007 in the first 30 d of operation a nar of 87 5 was achieved owing to the good performance of the seed sludge and the real time control strategy fig 2b however during 31 52 d the nar decreased from 83 7 to 13 1 as the nitrate concentration increased from 5 3 mg n l to 28 9 mg n l the absence of the anoxic denitrification stage led to nitrite accumulation at the beginning of the aerobic reaction going against the suppression of nob yang et al 2007 this might have been responsible for the instability of the pn after 30 d of operation in order to inhibit the activity of the nob a side stream sludge treatment using fna was introduced in phase ⅱ day 53 121 the details of this process were based on a previous study wang et al 2014 during 53 61 d an increase in the nar from 13 1 to 44 9 was observed with the decline in nitrate from 28 9 mg n l to 16 7 mg n l there was no ammonium residue fig 2b however the nar dropped to an average of 14 5 and the main product was nitrate 24 6 mg n l during 62 121 d indicating that the fna treatment in the side stream was not suitable for the sludge in this study the reason might be that the nob were able to adapt to the fna treatment during long term operation ma et al 2017b in addition the temperature gradually decreased from 25 5 c to 15 6 c in this period fig 2d and the low temperature was not beneficial to the growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob but favored the nob during the treatment of low strength ammonium wastewaters isanta et al 2015 therefore another strategy was needed to suppress the growth of nob in phase ⅲ day 122 205 nh2oh was added once a day to inhibit the nob activity previous studies have reported that the synthesis of the enzyme nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme was subject to the presence of nh2oh resulting in lower nob activity and the eventual removal of the nob xu et al 2012 sixteen days after the addition of nh2oh the nar increased from 4 6 to 85 3 on day 138 and then remained around 68 9 fig 2b this response is commonly observed in studies on pn for the treatment of domestic sewage with low strength ammonium at low temperatures isanta et al 2015 in the steady period day 138 205 the effluent of pn sbr contained nitrite and nitrate at concentrations of 21 8 mg n l and 9 7 mg n l respectively fig 2b the relatively low nitrite accumulation caused the no2 nh4 ratio average 0 89 to deviate from the desired ratio 1 32 strous et al 1998 traditionally resulting in poor nitrogen removal performance during the subsequent anammox reaction the excess nitrate which was not removed by the anammox reaction was transported into the anammox unit and increased the nitrate residue in the final effluent thus it is imperative to develop a cost efficient treatment to improve nitrogen removal performance under mainstream conditions 3 1 2 the performance of the saepd sbr the saepd sbr was operated in three phases over a period of 205 d as the ambient temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c the nitrogen removal performance during this process is shown in fig 2 in the first 22 d while the pn sbr provided as stable source of nitrite for the saepd sbr fig 2b the anoxic effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were 14 2 mg n l and 4 9 mg n l respectively and the no3 n concentration approached zero fig 2c this was likely related to the low activity of the anammox bacteria after inoculation hereafter the anoxic effluent nh4 n concentration gradually decreased to 4 0 mg n l and then slightly increased to 6 7 mg n l during 39 52 d due to the instability of pn in the pn sbr fig 2b and c moreover the anoxic effluent no3 n concentration increased to 6 9 mg n l resulting in a low tin removal efficiency of 77 6 fig 2d in phase ⅱ day 53 121 without the recovery of pn in the pn sbr the influent cod increased from 95 8 mg l to 141 3 mg l in order to improve the nitrogen removal performance of the pn saepd system fig 2a however with the increase in the influent c n ratio from 1 5 to 2 4 the tin removal efficiency still remained at a low level of 72 3 fig 2d the anoxic effluent no3 n concentration decreased to 2 8 mg n l and the nh4 n concentration increased to 13 5 mg n l fig 2c indicating that the anammox activity was subject to the high c n ratio the higher cod concentration facilitated the denitrification process which competed the key substrate no2 n with the anammox process cao et al 2017 in addition the high influent cod resulted in low nitrite accumulation during epd ji et al 2017 limiting the anammox activity and thereby leading to a low tin removal efficiency in order to ensure the anammox growth and suppress the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying organism an optimized saepd system comprised of the anammox granular sludge and epd floc sludge was suggested in future application in other words discharging the floc sludge could decrease the population of heterotrophic denitrifying organisms but further investigation is warranted in phase ⅲ day 122 205 the nar in the pn sbr increased to 68 9 fig 2b and the influent cod concentration of the saepd sbr declined to 102 4 mg l fig 2a the anoxic effluent nh4 n concentration decreased and then remained at 3 7 mg n l and the no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 0 5 mg n l and 1 1 mg n l respectively fig 2c as a result a high tin removal efficiency of 91 2 was achieved with an influent c n ratio of 1 7 at 15 4 c fig 2d during 154 205 d the low nar 66 1 and the high no3 n concentration 10 8 mg n l of the pn sbr effluent led to a lower no2 nh4 ratio average 0 89 at the beginning of the anoxic stage of the saepd sbr fig 2b in spite of this the nitrogen removal performance of this system stabilized at around 91 2 which might owe to the reduction of no3 n to no2 n via epd it also should be noted that the endogenous denitrification were able to reduce the no2 n or no3 n to n2 when there was excess nox n no2 n no3 n zeng et al 2003 ji et al 2018 thus due to the synergy of the anammox and epd processes the system was able to cope with non ideal initial no2 nh4 ratios demonstrating the robustness of the pn saepd system obviously in this study epd of which occurred owing to the inoculation of mature epd sludge with a nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 87 ji et al 2017 played an important role in suppling nitrite for anammox the low influent c n ratio of 1 7 led to a limitation in the organic matter supply likely benefiting the stable production of nitrite via epd ji et al 2017 2018 previous study reported that the nitrate reduction was prior to the nitrite reduction in the presence of nitrate resulting in a high nitrite accumulation during epd process ji et al 2017 this might also be the case in this study since the low nar 66 1 of the pn sbr caused excess nitrate to be transported into the saepd sbr and the anammox reaction also converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate moreover owing to the coexistence of anammox and endogenous denitrifying bacteria the produced nitrite from epd might be used immediately by anammox contributing to the high epd efficiency 3 2 contribution of the anammox pathway to tin removal under nitrite limiting conditions since almost all of the readily biodegradable cod was removed during the anaerobic stage of the saepd sbr the tin removal contribution of the pn sbr was negligible compared with the saepd sbr in this study in the anoxic stage of the saepd sbr the proportional contribution of the anammox pathway to the tin removal increased from 15 1 to 79 5 during 1 30 d and then remained at 93 6 during 31 52 d fig 3 a due to the instability of pn in the pn sbr during 31 52 d a sufficient amount of nitrate instead of nitrite was transported into the saepd sbr during the anoxic stage resulting in a decrease in the proportional contribution of the denitrification pathway with the limitation of electron donors as shown in fig 3b the nitrite provided by epd increased significantly thereby ensuring nitrogen removal via the anammox reaction with the low nitrite concentration of the influent with the increase in the influent cod concentration in phase ⅱ day 53 121 the proportional contribution of the anammox pathway decreased to 57 3 that of the denitrification pathway increased to 42 7 fig 3a this resulted in low nh4 n removal 5 1 mg n l fig 3b and low tin removal performance 72 3 of the pn saepd system fig 2d in phase ⅲ day 122 205 the contribution of the saepd sbr during the anoxic stage to tin removal of the pn saepd system reached 98 2 fig 3a among which the proportional contributions of the anammox and denitrification pathways were 77 2 and 22 8 respectively since the anammox pathway was dominant high tin removal efficiency 91 2 was achieved with a low c n ratio of 1 7 at 15 4 c fig 2d this also facilitated the nitrate removal via denitrification notably although the nitrite from the pn sbr did not meet the requirement of nh4 n removal via the anammox reaction during the anoxic stage of the saepd sbr fig 3b epd replenished the deficient nitrite and increased the proportional contribution of the anammox pathway to the tin removal thus the pn saepd system achieved stable and high nitrogen removal efficiency 91 2 and showed a unique advantage over the traditional pn anammox process which commonly exhibits fluctuations in the no2 nh4 ratio and results in low nitrogen removal efficiencies approximately 70 cao et al 2017 3 3 nutrient translation mechanism of the pn saepd system in a typical sbr cycle in order to investigate the nutrient translation pathway of the pn saepd system the ph do and the concentrations of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p in the pn sbr and saepd sbr were monitored during a typical operation cycle on day 189 fig 4 in the pn sbr owing to the inhibiting effect of nh2oh on the nob activity a significantly higher production rate of no2 n than that of no3 n was observed with the decrease in the nh4 n concentration fig 4a the ph first decreased before 150 min and began to increase after nh4 n was depleted at 150 min the reason was that acids were generated during the oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n yang et al 2007 resulting in a ph peak during the nitrification process a sharp increase in do was also observed near the minimum nh4 n concentration fig 4a because nitritation consumed 75 less oxygen than nitrification kornaros et al 2010 thus the aeration was terminated at the ph inflection point and do breakpoint using real time control thereby preventing the oxidation of the accumulated no2 n to no3 n however nob inevitably oxidized no2 n to no3 n resulting in no2 n and no3 n concentrations of 22 0 mg n l and 11 1 mg n l respectively in the effluent of the pn sbr fig 4a in the saepd sbr after feeding the cod concentration decreased from 81 5 mg l to 63 4 mg l during the anaerobic stage fig 4b due to a lack of no2 n or no3 n the decreased cod was potentially stored as endogenous carbon sources e g phas previous studies reported that gaos and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos often were enriched in the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions and could absorb and store organic substances as phas under the anaerobic condition wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2003 this might also be the case in this study moreover gaos relied solely on the consumption of glycogen to produce the required atp and nadh2 while paos mainly consumed polyphosphate for producing atp with the release of po4 3 p rubio rincón et al 2017 thus a slight increase in the po4 3 p concentration from 6 2 mg p l to 9 2 mg p l might indicate that gaos rather than paos played a predominant role in consuming exogenous carbon sources for phas synthesis in this study this also was supported by the higher abundance of gaos 3 89 than paos 0 77 in the saepd system detail see section 3 5 2 during the anoxic stage the nh4 n concentration decreased from 15 6 mg n l to 3 3 mg n l and the no2 n concentration decreased from 13 1 mg n l to 0 4 mg n l indicating that the anammox reaction had occurred a decrease in the no3 n concentration from 6 6 mg n l to 0 5 mg n l was also observed with no obvious change in the cod concentration fig 4b suggesting that denitrification had occurred and was likely driven by the endogenous carbon sources the po4 3 p concentration slightly decreased by 2 5 mg p l supporting that the endogenous denitrification were mainly driven by gaos according to the theoretical ratio 1 32 of no2 n to nh4 n for the anammox reaction strous et al 1998 the removal of 12 3 mg n l of nh4 n required 16 3 mg n l of no2 n which was higher than 12 7 mg n l of no2 n removed in this study previous study reported that epd readily occurred in an anaerobic anoxic system with the limited carbon sources among which epd bacteria could absorb and store organic substances as phas during the anaerobic period and then reduce nitrate to nitrite by using phas as carbon sources during anoxic period ji et al 2017 2018 this demonstrated that epd provided no2 n for the anammox reaction thereby improving the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies of the pn saepd system 3 4 the robustness of the saepd system with different initial no3 n no2 n ratios in order to evaluate the robustness of the saepd pathway anoxic batch tests were carried out with the biofilms obtained from the saepd sbr after the anaerobic reaction as shown in fig 5 the concentrations of removed nh4 n were 9 7 mg n l 8 9 mg n l 8 3 mg n l and 6 1 mg n l respectively in the four tests although the initial no2 n nh4 n ratio decreased from 1 09 to 0 36 with the increase in the initial no3 n no2 n ratio from 0 to 2 a slight decline 1 4 mg n l in the nh4 n removal amount was observed in batch test a c this suggested that the anammox reaction in the saepd system exhibited good robustness at initial no2 n nh4 n ratios ranging from 0 36 to 1 09 this was attributed to the nitrite production from nitrate via epd due to the absence of nitrite at the beginning of the batch test d fig 5d a lower amount of nh4 n removal was achieved and significant nitrite accumulation was observed with the decrease in nitrate at 30 min the likely reason is that epd reduced nitrate to nitrite during the anammox reaction although the by product of nitrate generated by the anammox reaction theoretically accounted for 26 of the ammonium removal strous et al 1998 no nitrate accumulation was detected in the first 180 min of each batch test owing to the role of epd fig 5 the slight accumulation of nitrate observed after 180 min fig 5a b and c might be resulted from the depletion of endogenous carbon sources which was similar with the observation reported before ji et al 2017 overall these results indicate that the saepd system has the potential to achieve complete nitrogen removal but this process requires further optimization in addition the contribution of the anammox pathway to the total nitrogen removal increased from 78 7 to 97 2 99 9 with the increase in the initial no3 n no2 n ratio from 0 to 2 or no presence of initial no2 n fig 5e the removal nox n nh4 n ratio decreased to about 1 09 which was close to the theoretical value 1 06 of the denitrifying ammonium oxidation deamox process du et al 2017 this indicated that in the presence of endogenous carbon sources the presence of nitrate attenuated the no2 n competition from denitrification and contribute to the anammox reaction in summary the proposed saepd system was able to cope with different no2 n nh4 n ratios resulting from the unstable pn potentially enhancing the robustness of the system 3 5 microbial community analysis of the pn saepd system 3 5 1 microbial community structure and dynamics in the pn sbr to better understand the mechanism of pn in this study the microbial community structure and dynamics in the pn sbr were analyzed using high throughput sequencing at the end of phase ⅰ day 50 nitrosomonas 0 15 which are proteobacteria was detected as the sole aob genus in the pn sbr fig 6 a nitrotoga and nitrospira which are nob had abundances of 0 01 and 0 30 respectively the relative abundance of nob 0 31 was much higher than that of aob 0 15 which may be the reason for the pn instability in phase ⅰ after the introduction of fna treatment in phase ⅱ the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 15 to 1 03 whereas that of nitrospira slightly decreased to 0 27 fig 6a however nitrotoga significantly increased from 0 01 to 5 05 resulting in a higher abundance of nob than aob this was consistent with a previous study which reported that nitrotoga could adapt to fna and their presence led to the failure of pn after long term fna treatment ma et al 2017b it was assumed that the presence of nitrotoga in this study was responsible for the low nar 14 5 in phase ⅱ fig 2b as shown in fig 6a the nitrotoga and nitrospira abundances decreased to 0 53 and 0 21 respectively while that of nitrosomonas increased to 2 73 in phase ⅲ this indicated that the relative abundance of aob was higher than that of nob after changing the strategy from the fna treatment to nh2oh addition which was responsible for the relatively high nitrite accumulation during this phase notably nob 0 74 did remain in the pn sbr which might have resulted in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and thereby affected the performance of pn with an undesirable nar of 66 1 fig 2b this phenomenon was also observed in other studies during the mainstream pn anammox process ma et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 indicating that the removal of excess nitrate is imperative 3 5 2 microbial community structure and dynamics in the saepd sbr in the saepd sbr the anammox bacteria were responsible for ammonium and nitrite removal and the gaos and paos were related to the nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation in this study the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia 0 83 1 46 and candidatus kuenenia 0 02 0 11 which belong to the planctomycetes phylum were detected fig 6b these two genera are usually dominant in anammox based systems especially during the treatment of domestic sewage with low levels of ammonium ali et al 2015 in phase ⅰ and ⅱ the relative abundances of the anammox bacteria remained at relatively low levels of 1 03 and 0 85 fig 6b respectively due to the low nitrite supply resulting from the instability of the pn process once the pn process was restored the abundances of anammox bacteria genera increased to 1 57 in phase ⅲ with a low temperature of 15 4 c thereby ensuring energy efficient nitrogen removal in this system this was consistent with previous studies that reported a stable anammox operation when there was enough nitrite even at 11 20 c ji et al 2019 reino et al 2018 due to the low nar 66 1 of pn nitrite accumulation during endogenous denitrification played a key role in supplying extra nitrite for the anammox reaction in this study candidatus competibacter dechloromonas and defluviicoccus which were previously reported as gaos involved in endogenous denitrification rubio rincón et al 2017 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2008 were detected with abundances of 1 97 4 01 0 18 1 98 and 0 32 0 57 respectively fig 6b the gao candidatus competibacter is assumed to be responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems rubio rincón et al 2017 in previous studies it was observed that an increase in nitrite in the early anoxic stage was driven by dechloromonas members with carbon sources of endogenous phas kim et al 2013 defluviicoccus which belongs to alphaproteobacteria was reported to likely reduce nitrate rather than nitrite wang et al 2008 our recent studies also confirmed that epd driven by gaos was feasible with a high nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of about 88 ji et al 2017 2019 moreover a significant nitrite accumulation was observed with the decrease in nitrate at 30 min during batch test d confirming the occurrence of epd in this study thus gaos with a major abundance of 3 89 4 56 might be responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in the anammox reaction in the saepd system due to their similar metabolism paos regularly co exist with gaos in the activated sludge system rubio rincón et al 2017 candidatus accumulibacter 0 51 1 09 candidatus microthrix 0 002 0 23 paracoccus 0 04 0 11 and pseudomonas 0 01 0 34 which are paos wang et al 2019 were also detected in this study fig 6b their much lower abundance than the gaos abundance was associated with the negligible phosphorous removal performance of this system supporting that gaos played a predominant role in epd process except for the abovementioned gaos and paos some genera related to ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos were detected these might utilize the complex compounds generated by normal substrate metabolism or biomass decay to grow ji et al 2018 among them denitratisoma and thauera were the top two dominant genera with relative abundances of 0 63 3 89 and 0 46 2 02 fig 6b these genera have the ability to remove nitrate during denitrification wang et al 2019 in addition thauera was reported to contain much less nir 588 hits than nar 5892 hits ma et al 2017a resulting in high nitrite accumulation during the denitrification process and thereby facilitating the anammox reaction in summary various microbial species such as anammox bacteria gaos paos and ohos co existed in the saepd system fig 6b synergistically achieved the removal of ammonium nitrite and nitrate and ensured the good robustness of this system to cope with varying no2 n nh4 n ratios 3 6 the advantages and engineering application of the pn saepd process although the traditional pn anammox process has been widely investigated in the recent three decades and successfully applied in high strength ammonium wastewaters lackner et al 2014 it still faces many challenges in practical application according to the stoichiometry of the anammox reaction du et al 2017 20 of nitrite is converted to nitrate resulting in a maximum tin removal efficiency of 89 in other words the traditional pn anammox process is not able to remove the nitrate accounting for 11 of influent tin remaining in the effluent fig 7 a which needs to be further treated to meet strict sewage discharge standards especially for domestic wastewater with low strength ammonium instability of the pn process frequently occurs under mainstream conditions cao et al 2017 this not only leads to more nitrate production from nob but also provides an undesirable ratio of no2 nh4 for the anammox process that requires a strict no2 nh4 ratio of 1 32 lotti et al 2014 thus the pn anammox process may still not be adequate for municipal wastewater treatment reino et al 2018 and poor nitrogen removal efficiency 70 is usually achieved under mainstream conditions cao et al 2017 the novel pn saepd process developed in this study is able to cope with the low nitrite accumulation of pn fig 7b thereby significantly enhancing the robustness of the mainstream anammox system the ability of the saepd system to remove nitrate represents a unique advantage of this technology over traditional pn anammox technologies in this study although 66 1 of the nar resulted in about 10 8 mg n l of nitrate to be transported into the saepd unit and the anammox reaction converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate only about 1 1 mg n l of nitrate remained in the effluent fig 2 notably epd replenishes the nitrite whose low concentration is a result of the low nitrite accumulation of the pn process this allows more flexibility regarding the no2 nh4 ratio for the anammox reaction fig 7b on the other hand when the no2 no3 nh4 ratio is greater than 1 06 excess nox is eventually reduced to n2 by endogenous denitrification thus the pn saepd process possesses great robustness without the requirement of the strict no2 nh4 ratio of 1 32 and the tin removal efficiency can reach 100 theoretically in practical applications due to the high c n ratio of 7 12 which is common in municipal wastewater cao et al 2017 it is suggested that a high rate activated sludge system that captures carbon to produce biomethane is combined with the pn saepd system previous studies reported that the c n ratio of domestic sewage pre treated via carbon capture unit is 1 4 2 8 malovanyy et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 which is adequate to meet the requirements of the system as shown in this study moreover with the different nar of pn process an optimal c n ratio could be obtained flexibly through controlling a suitable solids retention time in the carbon capture process in this case while most of the organic matter contained in municipal wastewater is captured for energy recovery the remaining organic matter is fully utilized by the pn saepd system to achieve advanced nitrogen removal with an energy saving and cost efficient way overall the pn saepd process shows great potential and is favorable for achieving efficient and energy neutral positive municipal wastewater treatment 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of a novel pn saepd process for cost effective and energy efficient municipal wastewater treatment the performance and microbial community of the pn saepd system for treating pre treated municipal wastewater which was simulated with actual domestic sewage and the final effluent were evaluated for over 205 d as the temperature decreased from 27 4 c to 15 0 c the following conclusions were drawn 1 in this process a high tin removal efficiency of 91 2 was achieved with an influent c n ratio of 1 7 although 10 8 mg n l of nitrate from the pn sbr was transported into the saepd sbr and the anammox reaction also converted 20 of nitrite to nitrate only about 1 1 mg n l of nitrate remained in the effluent this represented a unique advantage of this technology over traditional pn anammox technologies which are not able to remove nitrate present in the wastewater 2 epd replenished the nitrite whose low concentration resulted from the low nitrite accumulation 66 1 of the pn sbr thereby significantly enhancing the robustness of the mainstream anammox system with a low no2 nh4 ratio of 0 89 the contribution of the saepd sbr during the anoxic stage to the tin removal was 98 2 and the proportional contributions of the anammox and denitrification pathways were 77 2 and 22 8 respectively 3 in the pn sbr the nh2oh addition resulted in a lower relative abundance of nob than aob which ensured nitrite accumulation however some nob 0 74 did remain in the pn sbr which might have resulted in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and thereby affected the pn performance with an undesirable nar of 66 1 4 various microbial species such as anammox bacteria gaos paos and ohos co existed in the saepd sbr synergistically achieving the removal of ammonium nitrite and nitrate and ensuring the ability of this system to cope with different no2
