15290,both microplastics mps and antibiotic resistance genes args are intensively detected in waste activated sludge was however the distinctive impacts of different mps on args emergence dissemination and its potential mechanisms remain unclear in this study long term semi continuous digesters were performed to examine the profiles of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in response to two different typical mps polyethylene pe and polyvinyl chloride pvc in anaerobic sludge digestion metagenomic results show that pe and pvc mps increase args abundance by 14 8 and 23 6 in digester respectively arb are also enriched by pe and pvc mps acinetobacter sp and salmonella sp are the dominant arb further exploration reveals that pvc mps stimulates the acquisition of args by human pathogen bacteria hpb and functional microorganisms fms but pe mps doesn t network analysis shows that more args tend to co occur with hbp and fms after mps exposure and more importantly new bacteria are observed to acquire args possibly via horizontal gene flow hgf in mps stressed digester the genes involved in the hgf process including reactive oxygen species ros production cell membrane permeability extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and atp synthesis are also enhanced by mps thereby attributing to the promoted args dissemination these findings offer advanced insights into the distinctive contribution of mps to fate host dissemination of args in anaerobic sludge digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistance bacteria anaerobic sludge digestion horizontal gene flow data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the ever growing use of antibiotics causes antimicrobial resistance amr issues across the world it was reported that over 700 000 annual deaths were caused by drug resistant diseases all over the world this number was forecasted to grow to 10 million per year by 2050 who un 2019 under the most alarming scenario amr was reckoned as one of the most urgent challenges of in this century in the one health framework wastewater treatment plants wwtps are long ignored but essential battlefront to restrict antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb spread into the aquatic ecosystem walsh 2018 after being received by wwtps numerous args are concentrated into activated sludge that provides an excellent environment for arb proliferation and args dissemination via horizontal gene flow hgf zhou et al 2019 albeit waste activated sludge was is considered as one of the most reservoirs of args it is still lacking monitoring args dissemination in anaerobic was digestion calderón franco et al 2022 existing literature primarily concentrated on the presence of args in was bengtsson palme et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 while the args hosting bacteria and dissemination mechanism are poorly studied therefore it is imperative to explore the fate of args and arb in anaerobic sludge digestion thereby facilitating amr control in the environment was is a complicated cosmos embodied abundant and multi species microorganisms ju et al 2014 including human pathogen bacteria hpb and specific functional microorganisms fms bibby and peccia 2013 wei et al 2019a also a plethora of arb were detected in was such as desulfatitalea sp desulfatitalea sp and microbacterium sp zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 arb has potential to transfer args to hpb during anaerobic sludge digestion in the most hazardous scenario arb may themselves be hpb previous studies reported some hpb are conducive to capture args to form args carrying hpb a hpb i e superbugs such as bacteroidales sp and salmonella sp fang et al 2015 these a hpb endowing amr and pathogenicity readily infect humans which poses a serious threat to public health however current studies mainly focused on a hpb in manures and farm soils fahrenfeld et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 and little is touched on sludge system except for hpb fms involved in the bio methane process i e hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis are also critical for anaerobic digestion process these fms are specifically enriched and obtain a greater growth rate than other bacteria in anaerobic digesters wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 also fms require continuous communication with surrounding bacteria via hgf or other processes to complete their functional events fournier 2009 if args is favorably encoded in fms the intensive activity of fms may promote the proliferation and dissemination of args in sludge however the emergency of args carrying fms a fms is still not explored to this end horizontal gene flow hgf is recognized as an important contributor to args dissemination among different bacteria hgf process primarily includes three pathways conjugation via intercellular contact transformation via the incorporation of cell free dna and transduction completed by bacteriophages infectivity zhao et al 2021 some substances were demonstrated as facilitators for args dissemination in the environment such as metallic nanoparticles microplastics mps and chlorine jianhua et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 these external substances influence args horizontal flow through inducing biochemical processes in bacteria for example reactive oxygen species ros overproduction induced by external stress can lead to enhanced cell membrane permeability and dna damage thereby facilitating transmission of args carrying plasmids through conjugation wang et al 2021a external stimuli also promotes bacterial extracellular polymeric substances eps releasing and cell adhesion which provides a favorable situation for args dissemination via hgf flemming et al 2021 harimawan and ting 2016 these biochemical factors are closely related to hgf process attaching great importance to args dissemination in the environment mps is recognized as an emerging hotspot for args as their biofilms can selectively enrich arb in different environments liu et al 2021 however current studies only crudely demonstrated an enhanced role of mps in args emergence few concentrated on whether different mps distinctively affected the community of arb and its co occurrence with hpb and fms also the potential mechanisms of args dissemination affected by mps are still unclear the increased ros level in bacteria was proved by literature wei et al 2019a however whether the excess ros promotes args horizontal flow in anaerobic sludge digestion is also still unknown therefore the effects of different mps on args emergence arb community and dissemination mechanism require to be explored urgently currently environmental args detection is conducted by two mainstream techniques quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput metagenomic sequencing karkman et al 2018 differentiated from qpcr with limitation of existing args targets metagenomic approach acquires the whole community dna information in the sample make it possible to a board spectrum profile of args in addition metagenomic technology also presents information of the entire microbial community and functional genes thus drawing insights into the linkage of arg arb and functional modules zhao et al 2020 consequently metagenomic approach was applied in this study for fully understanding the intrinsic effects of mps on args profiles as well as their host community and mobility this study was designed to reveal whether and how different mps distinctively affect the emergence host bacteria and dissemination of args in anaerobic sludge digestion based on metagenomic analysis two of the most abundant mps in sludge i e polyethylene pe and polyvinyl chloride pvc mps alimi et al 2018 wei et al 2019b were chosen as model mps in this study with args fate in anaerobic sludge digester being assessed then the emergence and taxonomic profiles of arb in each digester were compared to explore the effect of mps on arb further to understand the environmental risks of arb induced by mps the potential of arb to be conferred pathogenicity or digestive functionality was investigated in addition functional profiles involved in the hgf process i e ros production cell membrane permeability eps secretion and atp synthesis were also explored to reveal the potential mechanism of mps affecting args horizontal flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and mps in this work was and anaerobic digested sludge ads were applied as the substrate and inoculum in anaerobic digestion respectively both of them were collected from a municipal wwtp in shanghai china after being thickened by gravity and filtering using 1 0 mm mesh sludges were stored at 4 c for subsequent use the primary characteristics of the was and ads are listed in table s1 supporting information si the pe and pvc mps with 200 um size were purchased from zhongcheng china 2 2 long term semi continuous anaerobic sludge digestion experiments environmentally relevant dosage 30 particles g ts of mps was assessed in the exposure experiments li et al 2018 three shaded anaerobic digesters with 5 l working volume were performed to explore the impacts of pe and pvc mps on the fate of args and arb three digesters were identical and equipped with a water bath thermostatic system and mechanical stirring firstly 3 5 l of ads and 1 5 l of was were fed into each digester to maintain the ads to was ratio at 2 9 based on volatile solid providing a prerequisite for digester start up boulanger et al 2012 the digesters were operated with a 25 day sludge retention time feeding 200 ml of was and simultaneously withdrawing the same volume of digested sludge for each day after all digesters achieved the convergence of biogas production and vs destruction the mps exposure experiments were started two anaerobic digesters as pe mps digester and pvc mps digester were fed with was containing pe and pvc mps of 30 particles g ts respectively the remaining digester as control was still fed with was without mps the anaerobic digesters were operated at 35 2 c and continuously stirred at 200 r min throughout the whole exposure experiments for 125 d the ph value in each digester was controlled at 7 0 0 1 with 4 mol l hcl and or 4 mol l naoh biogas yield and sludge destruction in each digester were determined every 2 5 days to ensure stable biogas performance 2 3 dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing after long term exposure experiment sludge samples were taken out from each digester the collecting procedure is illustrated in si after dna exaction using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa the purity and quantity of dna were assessed by nanodrop2000 and tbs 380 to avoid potential errors triplicate extracted dna of each sample were mixed for subsequent detection then an illumina hiseq4000 platform was performed for metagenomic sequencing each sample generated approximately 6 9 g of raw data and was deposited in the repository system table s2 finally adaptor sequences trimming and low quality raw reads including reads with ambiguous nucleotides n length 50 bp and quality score 20 were abandoned by fastp 2 4 bioinformatics analysis gene prediction the obtained clean reads were firstly assembled into contigs with a minimum contig length of 300 bp using megahit subsequently metagene was used to predict open reading frames orfs from the contigs gene sequence length 100 bp then cd hit program was used to remove the redundant orfs and built the non redundant gene catalog sequence identity 95 and coverage 90 taxonomic classification and functional annotation to determine the taxonomic classification and functional profile diamond for proteins blastp was utilized to annotate the non redundant orfs against the ncbi nr database and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database with the e value cutoff of 1e 5 for taxonomic classification the annotated orfs were subsequently calculated by megan version 5 3 furthermore the relative abundance of each taxonomic or functional profile was determined as the number of reads aligning to the orf normalized by the total metagenomic sequences reads with the unit ppm one in one million which is commended by zhao et al 2021 this calculation method would be applied in the subsequent analysis annotation of args and arb and characterization of pathogen to identify args carrying orfs a orfs the redundant orfs were searched against an args database comprehensive antibiotic resistance card database using diamond for proteins blastp with the e value cutoff of 1e 5 an orf was annotated as an a orfs when its best blastp hit with a threshold of similarity 90 and alignment length of amino acids 25 the orfs containing taxonomic classification and args were identified as potential arb like orfs liang et al 2020 furthermore the species level taxonomic profile of arb like orfs was subsequently further aligned to a reported hpb list to characterize args carrying hpb li et al 2015 2 5 other analytical methods the determinations of characteristics of sludge polysaccharide and protein were carried out according to standard methods or based on previous research zhang et al 2020 network analysis was visualized by gephi 0 9 2 heatmaps of the microbial community were accomplished by hemi 1 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 mps differently enriched args release in anaerobic sludge digestion to investigate args profiles responding mps stress during anaerobic sludge digestion args abundance in control digester without mps addition and mps stressed digesters with pe and pvc mps addition were identified using metagenomic sequencing the detailed information of all digesters metagenomic datasets are summarized in table s2 si a total of 56 predicted a orfs were identified from orfs in all samples which are assigned to 20 arg subtypes affiliated to 8 arg types table s3 si the abundances of each args type in different digesters are shown in fig 1 a it can be seen that both pe and pvc mps enriched args release in anaerobic sludge digestion the abundance of args shows at 108 2 ppm in control digester after pe and pvc mps exposure the arg abundance reaches at 124 28 and 133 75 ppm increasing by 14 8 and 23 6 respectively compared to the control digester the foremost args populations in three digesters of this study includes sulfonamide beta lactam and tetracycline resistance gene which were also reported as frequent args in wwtps huang et al 2019 ng et al 2019 all digesters contained eight types of args and the changes in args abundance for each args type are compared in fig 1b it can be found that the abundances of most args in pe and pvc mps digester are higher than that of the control digester the changes are varied with pe and pvc mps addition in the anaerobic digester with pe mps exposure five args resistant to beta lactam tetracycline mls multidrug and rifamycin increase by 5 71 111 4 compared to the control digester and multidrug witnesses the greatest increase other three types of args resistant to sulfonamide phenicol and aminoglycoside show a reduction after pe mps exposure in pvc mps digester except for rifamycin and sulfonamide resistant gene all other args are enricher and improved by 7 08 123 4 compared to control digester multidrug resistant gene achieves the highest increased efficiency of all args following by phenicol resistant gene notably phenicol resistant gene as well as aminoglycoside resistant gene increases in pvc mps digester but does not increase in pe mps digester indicating that pvc mps specifically enriches the specific args in the digester rifamycin resistant gene in pvc mps digester shows the most deduction of 55 3 compared to the control digester nonetheless the reduction of rifamycin resistant gene marginally affects the total args abundance as it only has small quantities it is worth noting that the abundances of sulfonamide resistant gene in both pe and pvc digester are less than that in the control digester which implies that mps might restrict the spread of sulfonamide resistant gene with the whole scenario most args exhibit increases in the presence of mps and pvc mps induces a larger increase than pe mps fig 1c exhibits the composition of args subtypes top 20 and their affiliated types in each digester the diversities of args types and subtypes are not altered after mps exposure but the structure of args types is changed among them sulfonamide resistant gene accounts for 39 4 of total args in control digester which is higher than that in pe and pvc mps digester 28 6 and 27 4 indicating that sulfonamide resistant gene is the most abundant args type in all digesters but its percentage restricted after mps exposure beta lactam resistant gene has the second highest percentage which composed of 17 1 22 8 and 20 7 total args in the control pe and pvc digesters it is found that the percentage of phenicol resistant gene in pvc mps digester 14 31 obviously different from other two digesters being 1 5 and 1 8 times higher than that of the control and pe mps digester respectively collectively both pe and pvc mps increase args abundance in anaerobic sludge digestion and pvc mps digester obtains a larger enrichment of args than pe mps digester abundances of most args type increase after mps exposure while sulfonamide resistant gene shows a slight decrease the reason for this inconsistent impact of mps on each type of arg is complicated possibly relevant to the difference of arb community or hgf level in different digester each type of args have its own favored host organism and args abundance is closely corelated to their potential host previous pointed that mps shifts microbial community during sludge anaerobic digestion wei et al 2019a possibly leading to the changes of arb community and args profile in addition hgf of args may contribute in the difference of args distribution in digester via disturbing traditional proliferative spread of args but whether mps affects on hgf in anaerobic sludge digester still unknown accordingly the effect of mps on arb community and args horizontal flow are further explored in the following section to reveal the potential mechanism of the changed args profile induced by mps 3 2 mps changed potential arb distribution since args can be secreted as well as transmitted by bacteria awasthi et al 2019 mak et al 2014 args carrying microbes i e arb are primary determinants of args emergence and dissemination in sludge the impacts of pe and pvc mps on the composition of potential arb in digesters were investigated using the orfs based approach as shown in fig 2 a proteobacteria is the most dominant phyla of arb in all digesters which accounts for 71 1 77 3 of the total arb population followed by bacteroidetes previous studies also demonstrated that proteobacteria was the dominant args carrier in was and soil d costa et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 that may be because major facilitator superfamily transporters are easy to be enriched in proteobacteria genome forsberg et al 2014 which contributes to the high abundance and dissemination potential of args both pe and pvc mps elevate the population of args carrying proteobacteria which increase by 5 5 and 15 5 respectively compared to control bacteroidetes is the second most abundant arb in all digesters and its abundances in pe and pvc mps digester 8 52 and 5 97 ppm are 2 70 and 1 90 folds of those in the control digester bacteroidetes is regarded as a hotspot bacteria of args since it was reported to obtain highly resistant to several antibiotic classes such as beta lactam tetracycline and macrolide niestępski et al 2020 according to these results the exposure of mps is conducive to enriching representative arb in anaerobic sludge digestion at genus level fig 2 c acinetobacter sp is the most dominant genera and accounts for 29 5 33 6 of the total arb population and 41 5 46 5 of args carrying proteobacteria indicating that acinetobacter sp is the main contributor of potential arb the composition of args carrying genera exhibits similar performance in all digesters indicating that the diversity of the arb community is not affected by mps as such the mps enriches potential arb but does not affect arb diversity in anaerobic sludge digestion furthermore the relationship between args and arb in all digesters is exhibited to explain how mps influences args emergence fig s2 each arb selectively carries its favorable args indicating that microbial analysis in digesters is useful for informing args response to arb for example acinetobacter sp as the most dominant arb is specifically involved with two args subtypes sul1 and catb8 while salmonella sp is the second abundant arb in digester and obtains two specific args subtypes sul2 and ling notably both acinetobacter sp and salmonella sp which carry sulfonamide resistant gene are restricted by mps the observation provides an explanation for deduction of sulfonamide resistance gene in mps stressed digesters presented in section 3 1 therefore mps not only increases arb abundance but also effects the diversity of args that carried by each genus 3 3 mps distinctively affected the acquisition of args by human pathogen bacteria and functional microorganisms researchers have previously verified arg transmission between environmental bacteria and hpb forsberg et al 2012 sludge microbiota has been long assumed to be a reservoir of arb as well as hpb as the intensive contact of was and wastewater that exposed to excrements and antibiotics from humans and animals ju et al 2016 herein the impacts of mps on the presence of args carrying hpb a hpb in anaerobic sludge digestion were firstly clarified according to the metagenomic results table s4 si a total of thirteen a orfs containing seven pathogenic species corresponding to seven genera were detected fig 3 a exhibits the abundance and diversity of a hpb from top 200 species in digesters of this study the total abundance of a hpb in the control digester is 43 85 ppm when the digester was exposed to pe or pvc mps the corresponding abundance increase to 44 36 and 50 55 ppm respectively indicative of the enrichment advantage of pvc mps for a hpb also mps shifts the distribution of the a hpb community in the digester fig 3a and 3b indicates that a baumannii is the most abundant a hpb accounting for 83 05 88 86 of total a hpb abundance in digesters followed by p putida and m morganii as an opportunistic nosocomial hpb in hospitals around the world antunes et al 2014 a baumannii was reported to be endowed highly mobile resistome that drives args dissemination via hgf hernández gonzález et al 2022 the presence of pvc mps enriches a baumannii in anaerobic sludge digestion as its abundance in pvc mps digester 44 92 ppm is 123 4 of that in the control digester 36 42 ppm possibly implying greater mobility of args in pvc mps digester however the enrichment of a baumannii is not observed in pe mps digester which directly induces the limited change of a hpb abundance between the control and pe mps digester previous literature indicated that certain hpb could selectively colonize mps that provide an ideal environment for hpb proliferation and gene flow gong et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the statement offers an underlying mechanism of a hpb enrichment in pvc mps digester as pvc mps selectively stimulate the enrichment of a baumannii pvc mps increases the total abundance of a hpb however some exceptions are observed such as p putida and s sonnei which are restricted by pvc mps but only accounts small proposition of a hpb hence pvc mps enriches a hpb that combines pathogenicity and amr in anaerobic sludge digestion which causes a larger risk for public health and environment safety to further illustrate the influences of mps on a hpb the distribution of args encoded in hpb is exhibited in fig 3 b and table s4 si a total of six types of args are observed in all digesters given a comprehensive view of args percentage in a hpb there is a great difference between the pvc mps and control digester while the pe mps digester has few changes this observation is consistent with corresponding changes in a hpb taxonomy between pe and pvc mps digesters sulfonamide resistant gene is the most dominant args carried by hpb in all digesters 50 11 59 77 followed by phenicol resistant gene furthermore a total of 11 args subtypes are observed to be encoded in a hpb sul1 gene as the only subtype resistant to sulfonamide undoubtedly is the most abundant args carried by a hpb followed by catb8 resistant to phenicol the percentage of sul1 carried by a hpb in the control digester 59 77 is larger than in pvc mps digester 50 11 adversely catb8 accounts for 37 86 of total args carried by a hpb in pvc mps digester which is 1 65 folds of the control digester implying that pvc mps has unequal impacts on each args types unlike pvc mps the introduction of pe mps only shows moderate changes on the structure of args type carried by a hpb interestingly three args encoded in a hpb mphe ermg and tet g are only detected in pvc and pe mps digester but not in the control digester the occurrence of novel args types possibly caused by the bacterial or environmental args flow into hpb via hgf process thereby new args may be introduced into hpb another potential explanation is gene mutation of hpb under the stimulation of mps hu et al 2021 with the elevated level of mutagenesis hpb are more likely to develop args in vivo and thus evolve into arb posing a greater risk to human health according to that mps may attach importance in enrichment of a hpb in digester via args dissemination or formation causing a greater threat to public and environmental health functional microorganisms fms are responsible for the efficient of methane production and sludge destruction in digester it has been previously indicated that microbial methane production processes in anaerobic digestion included hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis xu et al 2021 also some denitrifiers were observed during the anaerobic digester process wang et al 2021b these fms are activists with high growth rates and intensive bacterial communications in anaerobic sludge digestion fournier 2009 wang et al 2022 if fms are encoded with args the proliferation and horizontal flow of args may be accelerated however the presence of args carrying fms a fms is not clarified and whether mps exacerbates this event is still unknown herein several types of representative fms involved in anaerobic digestion i e hydrolytic bacteria short chain fatty acid scfa hydrogen producer methanogen and denitrifier were identified based on existing references barak and van rijn 2000 huang et al 2020 xu et al 2019a compare to control digester pvc mps increase a fms abundance in digester but pe mps induces a slight decrease in its abundance shown in fig 4 and table s5 si it is seen that acinetobacter sp involved in the scfas producing process is the most abundant a fms followed by klebsiella sp scfa hydrogen producer and pseudomonas sp denitrifier the presence of pvc mps enriches args carrying acinetobacter sp as its abundance in pvc mps digester reaches at 44 92 ppm which is 123 4 of the control digester however pe and pvc mps restrict the emergence of args carrying klebsiella sp which decrease by 36 57 and 35 67 respectively compared to the control digester in addition the impacts of pe and pvc mps on each genus of a fms are not universal for example pseudomonas sp is enriched in pe mps digester but restricted in pvc mps digester possibly due to its different sensitivity response to pe and pvc mps collectively mps have great impact on the distribution of a fms in digester since fms have intensive functional metabolism and contact with other bacteria in an anaerobic digester when a fms are enriched under mps stress more args can be flow into fms during the corresponding functional process furthermore the diversity and structure of args types in fms were compared as the most abundant a fms acinetobacter sp obtains the most args diversity by carrying three args types resistant to sulfonamide phenicol and multidrug notably anaerobium sp is the only methanogen observed to carry args in this study however it is only founded in mps stressed digesters but not in control digester which implies that mps might be as a stimulator for args flowing to anaerobium sp the novel a fms observed in mps stressed digesters highlights the potential of mps enhancing hgf of args to further understand whether mps facilitate more args introduced into novel specific bacteria i e a hpb and a fms the correlation between args and specific bacteria are illustrated in fig 5 seven types of args are detected in seventeen bacterial genera affiliated with hpb or fms obviously pe and pvc mps digesters obtain more nodes and edges of network analysis than the control digester implying new args arb patterns are introduced by mps for example tetracycline resistant gene is found to exist in four genera of specific bacteria anaerobium sp mannheimia sp streptococcus sp and pseudomonas sp in pe and pvc mps digester respectively but it only observed in two genera anaerobium sp and mannheimia sp in control digester the similar observation is also presented with mls resistant gene the occurrence of new hosts carrying tetracycline and mls resistant gene indicates that args is introduced into other bacteria via hgf under mps stimulation genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside tetracycline and mls are the top 3 args types that linked to hpb or fms in mps stressed digesters implying they may be easier to be carried by or transferred to specific bacteria than other args types the extra nodes representing bacteria in mps stressed digesters probably indicate that more existing args are introduced into novel bacteria via horizontal flow under mps pressure compared to control i e mannheimia sp in this study acinetobacter sp is the dominant genera that linked the most args types in all digesters and three types of args resistant to sulfonamide phenicol and multidrug are found to be encoded in acinetobacter sp except that mls resistant gene is exclusively encoded in acinetobacter sp which is only found in mps stressed digesters implying that mps may stimulate the horizontal flow of mls resistant gene between arb to acinetobacter sp notably acinetobacter sp holds a dual role of hpb and fms li et al 2015 xu et al 2019a and even was indicated as a critical member to shift arg distribution in sludge system huang et al 2019 xu et al 2019b accordingly mps has potential to stimulate args flowing into acinetobacter sp that obtains high metabolic rate and pathogenicity thereby driving args dissemination and expanding health risks in sludge it is therefore suggested that the enhanced relationship between args and specific bacteria may be responsible for the elevated args emergence and more importantly for the promoted args horizontal flow in mps stressed digesters 3 4 mps enhanced the potential of args horizontal flow horizontal gene flow hgf is a primary pathway contributing to args dissemination between microorganisms in the environment since the existence of novel arb are observed in mps stressed digesters from the above results mps is hypothesized to stimulate the bacterial acquisition of args via hgf thereby enhancing args dissemination in anaerobic sludge digestion according to that it is imperative to explore the underlying mechanisms of mps promoting args horizontal flow multiple factors were proved to facilitate args horizontal flow process including ros production cell membrane permeability eps secretion and atp synthesis guo et al 2022 therefore functional profiles involved in these factors were further investigated as follow it was reported that bacterial ros overproduction could induce sos response as well as dna damage which promotes the horizontal flow of args lu et al 2020 the increased ros level caused by mps in sludge bacteria has been experimentally demonstrated by wei et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in this work the functional profile proves the corresponding results at a molecular level as shown in fig 6 a pe and pvc mps result in an increased abundance of genes relevant to ros production arriving at 105 48 and 113 98 of the control digester respectively cell membrane is the key place for gene uptake by bacteria and its activity is closely associated with hgf processes free or plasmid carrying args require dna characterization transmembrane transport or cell fusion to complete the bacterial transformation and conjugation allen et al 2012 yu et al 2022 it was demonstrated that the enhanced cell membrane permeability could accelerate args horizontal flow wang et al 2020 according to functional profiles of metagenomic results fig 6a and 6c membrane permeability of sludge bacteria is enhanced by mps addition the abundance of genes involved in cell membrane permeability exhibit a 1 10 and 1 13 folds increase in pe and pvc mps digester respectively compared to the control digester previous experiments also indicated the cell membrane permeability were enhanced by mps based on propidium iodide pi dye or lactate dehydrogenase ldh leakage assay shi et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 these experimental results are in line with our result and imply that the functional genes are successful transcribed and translated by microorganisms besides numerous studies indicated that the type iv secretion system t4ss of the membrane system facilitated intracellular dna released and capture extracellular dna christie and vogel 2000 hamilton et al 2005 wang et al 2020 thusly contributing to args horizontal flow between bacteria it is seen from fig 6b that the functional gene associated with t4ss comprised of twelve proteins virb1 11 and vird4 which generates a macromolecular compound that across bacterial cell membranes fig 6c further implies that eight genes encoded t4ss protein were detected in this study and most of their abundance is largely elevated by the mps the most improvement is observed in the virb10 gene which increase by 146 7 and 168 1 in pe and pvc mps digester respectively as a key component of the t4ss virb10 traverses the inner and the outer membrane and is essential for substance translocating cascales and christie 2004 the enhancement of t4ss facilitates args release and further provides free extracellular args eargs introduced into other bacteria in addition to the t4ss system most of the genes associated with cell membrane permeability increase after mps exposure these results indicate that cell membrane permeability is enhanced by mps thereby promoting the horizontal flow of args eps secreted by bacteria is a complex extracellular matrix primarily comprised of polysaccharides proteins and extracellular dna eps surrounding bacteria plays an important role in facilitating hgf of bacteria guo et al 2022 as eps can bound eargs released by bacteria and increase intercellular adhesion which provides an favorable situation for the horizontal flow of args van der aa and dufrêne 2002 zou et al 2020 moreover eps even enhances nutrient capture from the extracellular environment flemming et al 2021 further supplying sufficient nutrients for bacteria to release and accept args accordingly eps attaches great importance to args horizontal flow in this study the total abundances of genes related to eps secretion are 39 30 ppm and 43 57 ppm in pe and pvc mps digester which increase by 10 20 and 22 19 respectively compared to the control digester a previous study also indicated that mps could trigger eps release by bacteria shiu et al 2020 which is consistent with our conclusions therefore eps secretion in sludge bacteria is stimulated by mps which possibly contributes to the enhancement of args presence and dissemination in digesters energy is essential for args horizontal flow of bacteria guo et al 2022 adenosine triphosphate atp is the most direct energy source in organisms thus determining the level of atp synthesis related genes helps us understand how mps promoted args dissemination compared to the control pe and pvc mps increase the abundance of atp associated genes by 21 75 and 28 79 not only with the genomic view the elevated energetic activity also proved at the mrna and protein level romano et al 2020 observed an increment of atpase related gene expression induced by pvc mps also the enhancement of atpase level mediated by mps verified by previous experiment rangasamy et al 2022 these findings suggest that the mps stimulates sludge bacteria to generate more energy for args horizontal flow the potential mechanisms of the enhanced horizontal flow of args between bacteria induced by mps are illustrated in fig 7 in the presence of mps excessive ros production results in the oxidative stress and sos response which leads to a high metabolic rate and increased atp synthesis in addition to the above mechanisms eps secretion in bacteria is also promoted by mps which strengthens intercellular adhesion and args retention van der aa and dufrêne 2002 and further provides more opportunities for args exchange collectively the levels of functional genes relevant to hgf process are enhanced in the presence of mps thusly contributing to args dissemination in the environment 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the different mps distinctively enhance the args emergence in anaerobic sludge digestion based on metagenomic sequencing analysis and pvc mps enriches more args than pe mps also mps increases arb abundance in digesters with acinetobacter sp and salmonella sp being observed to be the dominant arb and obtaining the most args diversity simultaneously the a hpb and a fms are enriched in the pvc mps digester but limitedly changed in the pe mps digesters the key factors involved in the hgf process i e ros production cell membrane permeability eps secretion and atp synthesis are also promoted by both pe and pvc mps based on functional profiles together with these favorable factors the horizontal flow of args in digesters is therefore facilitated by mps this study provides an in depth understanding of the

15290,both microplastics mps and antibiotic resistance genes args are intensively detected in waste activated sludge was however the distinctive impacts of different mps on args emergence dissemination and its potential mechanisms remain unclear in this study long term semi continuous digesters were performed to examine the profiles of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in response to two different typical mps polyethylene pe and polyvinyl chloride pvc in anaerobic sludge digestion metagenomic results show that pe and pvc mps increase args abundance by 14 8 and 23 6 in digester respectively arb are also enriched by pe and pvc mps acinetobacter sp and salmonella sp are the dominant arb further exploration reveals that pvc mps stimulates the acquisition of args by human pathogen bacteria hpb and functional microorganisms fms but pe mps doesn t network analysis shows that more args tend to co occur with hbp and fms after mps exposure and more importantly new bacteria are observed to acquire args possibly via horizontal gene flow hgf in mps stressed digester the genes involved in the hgf process including reactive oxygen species ros production cell membrane permeability extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and atp synthesis are also enhanced by mps thereby attributing to the promoted args dissemination these findings offer advanced insights into the distinctive contribution of mps to fate host dissemination of args in anaerobic sludge digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistance bacteria anaerobic sludge digestion horizontal gene flow data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the ever growing use of antibiotics causes antimicrobial resistance amr issues across the world it was reported that over 700 000 annual deaths were caused by drug resistant diseases all over the world this number was forecasted to grow to 10 million per year by 2050 who un 2019 under the most alarming scenario amr was reckoned as one of the most urgent challenges of in this century in the one health framework wastewater treatment plants wwtps are long ignored but essential battlefront to restrict antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb spread into the aquatic ecosystem walsh 2018 after being received by wwtps numerous args are concentrated into activated sludge that provides an excellent environment for arb proliferation and args dissemination via horizontal gene flow hgf zhou et al 2019 albeit waste activated sludge was is considered as one of the most reservoirs of args it is still lacking monitoring args dissemination in anaerobic was digestion calderón franco et al 2022 existing literature primarily concentrated on the presence of args in was bengtsson palme et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 while the args hosting bacteria and dissemination mechanism are poorly studied therefore it is imperative to explore the fate of args and arb in anaerobic sludge digestion thereby facilitating amr control in the environment was is a complicated cosmos embodied abundant and multi species microorganisms ju et al 2014 including human pathogen bacteria hpb and specific functional microorganisms fms bibby and peccia 2013 wei et al 2019a also a plethora of arb were detected in was such as desulfatitalea sp desulfatitalea sp and microbacterium sp zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 arb has potential to transfer args to hpb during anaerobic sludge digestion in the most hazardous scenario arb may themselves be hpb previous studies reported some hpb are conducive to capture args to form args carrying hpb a hpb i e superbugs such as bacteroidales sp and salmonella sp fang et al 2015 these a hpb endowing amr and pathogenicity readily infect humans which poses a serious threat to public health however current studies mainly focused on a hpb in manures and farm soils fahrenfeld et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 and little is touched on sludge system except for hpb fms involved in the bio methane process i e hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis are also critical for anaerobic digestion process these fms are specifically enriched and obtain a greater growth rate than other bacteria in anaerobic digesters wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 also fms require continuous communication with surrounding bacteria via hgf or other processes to complete their functional events fournier 2009 if args is favorably encoded in fms the intensive activity of fms may promote the proliferation and dissemination of args in sludge however the emergency of args carrying fms a fms is still not explored to this end horizontal gene flow hgf is recognized as an important contributor to args dissemination among different bacteria hgf process primarily includes three pathways conjugation via intercellular contact transformation via the incorporation of cell free dna and transduction completed by bacteriophages infectivity zhao et al 2021 some substances were demonstrated as facilitators for args dissemination in the environment such as metallic nanoparticles microplastics mps and chlorine jianhua et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 these external substances influence args horizontal flow through inducing biochemical processes in bacteria for example reactive oxygen species ros overproduction induced by external stress can lead to enhanced cell membrane permeability and dna damage thereby facilitating transmission of args carrying plasmids through conjugation wang et al 2021a external stimuli also promotes bacterial extracellular polymeric substances eps releasing and cell adhesion which provides a favorable situation for args dissemination via hgf flemming et al 2021 harimawan and ting 2016 these biochemical factors are closely related to hgf process attaching great importance to args dissemination in the environment mps is recognized as an emerging hotspot for args as their biofilms can selectively enrich arb in different environments liu et al 2021 however current studies only crudely demonstrated an enhanced role of mps in args emergence few concentrated on whether different mps distinctively affected the community of arb and its co occurrence with hpb and fms also the potential mechanisms of args dissemination affected by mps are still unclear the increased ros level in bacteria was proved by literature wei et al 2019a however whether the excess ros promotes args horizontal flow in anaerobic sludge digestion is also still unknown therefore the effects of different mps on args emergence arb community and dissemination mechanism require to be explored urgently currently environmental args detection is conducted by two mainstream techniques quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput metagenomic sequencing karkman et al 2018 differentiated from qpcr with limitation of existing args targets metagenomic approach acquires the whole community dna information in the sample make it possible to a board spectrum profile of args in addition metagenomic technology also presents information of the entire microbial community and functional genes thus drawing insights into the linkage of arg arb and functional modules zhao et al 2020 consequently metagenomic approach was applied in this study for fully understanding the intrinsic effects of mps on args profiles as well as their host community and mobility this study was designed to reveal whether and how different mps distinctively affect the emergence host bacteria and dissemination of args in anaerobic sludge digestion based on metagenomic analysis two of the most abundant mps in sludge i e polyethylene pe and polyvinyl chloride pvc mps alimi et al 2018 wei et al 2019b were chosen as model mps in this study with args fate in anaerobic sludge digester being assessed then the emergence and taxonomic profiles of arb in each digester were compared to explore the effect of mps on arb further to understand the environmental risks of arb induced by mps the potential of arb to be conferred pathogenicity or digestive functionality was investigated in addition functional profiles involved in the hgf process i e ros production cell membrane permeability eps secretion and atp synthesis were also explored to reveal the potential mechanism of mps affecting args horizontal flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and mps in this work was and anaerobic digested sludge ads were applied as the substrate and inoculum in anaerobic digestion respectively both of them were collected from a municipal wwtp in shanghai china after being thickened by gravity and filtering using 1 0 mm mesh sludges were stored at 4 c for subsequent use the primary characteristics of the was and ads are listed in table s1 supporting information si the pe and pvc mps with 200 um size were purchased from zhongcheng china 2 2 long term semi continuous anaerobic sludge digestion experiments environmentally relevant dosage 30 particles g ts of mps was assessed in the exposure experiments li et al 2018 three shaded anaerobic digesters with 5 l working volume were performed to explore the impacts of pe and pvc mps on the fate of args and arb three digesters were identical and equipped with a water bath thermostatic system and mechanical stirring firstly 3 5 l of ads and 1 5 l of was were fed into each digester to maintain the ads to was ratio at 2 9 based on volatile solid providing a prerequisite for digester start up boulanger et al 2012 the digesters were operated with a 25 day sludge retention time feeding 200 ml of was and simultaneously withdrawing the same volume of digested sludge for each day after all digesters achieved the convergence of biogas production and vs destruction the mps exposure experiments were started two anaerobic digesters as pe mps digester and pvc mps digester were fed with was containing pe and pvc mps of 30 particles g ts respectively the remaining digester as control was still fed with was without mps the anaerobic digesters were operated at 35 2 c and continuously stirred at 200 r min throughout the whole exposure experiments for 125 d the ph value in each digester was controlled at 7 0 0 1 with 4 mol l hcl and or 4 mol l naoh biogas yield and sludge destruction in each digester were determined every 2 5 days to ensure stable biogas performance 2 3 dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing after long term exposure experiment sludge samples were taken out from each digester the collecting procedure is illustrated in si after dna exaction using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa the purity and quantity of dna were assessed by nanodrop2000 and tbs 380 to avoid potential errors triplicate extracted dna of each sample were mixed for subsequent detection then an illumina hiseq4000 platform was performed for metagenomic sequencing each sample generated approximately 6 9 g of raw data and was deposited in the repository system table s2 finally adaptor sequences trimming and low quality raw reads including reads with ambiguous nucleotides n length 50 bp and quality score 20 were abandoned by fastp 2 4 bioinformatics analysis gene prediction the obtained clean reads were firstly assembled into contigs with a minimum contig length of 300 bp using megahit subsequently metagene was used to predict open reading frames orfs from the contigs gene sequence length 100 bp then cd hit program was used to remove the redundant orfs and built the non redundant gene catalog sequence identity 95 and coverage 90 taxonomic classification and functional annotation to determine the taxonomic classification and functional profile diamond for proteins blastp was utilized to annotate the non redundant orfs against the ncbi nr database and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database with the e value cutoff of 1e 5 for taxonomic classification the annotated orfs were subsequently calculated by megan version 5 3 furthermore the relative abundance of each taxonomic or functional profile was determined as the number of reads aligning to the orf normalized by the total metagenomic sequences reads with the unit ppm one in one million which is commended by zhao et al 2021 this calculation method would be applied in the subsequent analysis annotation of args and arb and characterization of pathogen to identify args carrying orfs a orfs the redundant orfs were searched against an args database comprehensive antibiotic resistance card database using diamond for proteins blastp with the e value cutoff of 1e 5 an orf was annotated as an a orfs when its best blastp hit with a threshold of similarity 90 and alignment length of amino acids 25 the orfs containing taxonomic classification and args were identified as potential arb like orfs liang et al 2020 furthermore the species level taxonomic profile of arb like orfs was subsequently further aligned to a reported hpb list to characterize args carrying hpb li et al 2015 2 5 other analytical methods the determinations of characteristics of sludge polysaccharide and protein were carried out according to standard methods or based on previous research zhang et al 2020 network analysis was visualized by gephi 0 9 2 heatmaps of the microbial community were accomplished by hemi 1 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 mps differently enriched args release in anaerobic sludge digestion to investigate args profiles responding mps stress during anaerobic sludge digestion args abundance in control digester without mps addition and mps stressed digesters with pe and pvc mps addition were identified using metagenomic sequencing the detailed information of all digesters metagenomic datasets are summarized in table s2 si a total of 56 predicted a orfs were identified from orfs in all samples which are assigned to 20 arg subtypes affiliated to 8 arg types table s3 si the abundances of each args type in different digesters are shown in fig 1 a it can be seen that both pe and pvc mps enriched args release in anaerobic sludge digestion the abundance of args shows at 108 2 ppm in control digester after pe and pvc mps exposure the arg abundance reaches at 124 28 and 133 75 ppm increasing by 14 8 and 23 6 respectively compared to the control digester the foremost args populations in three digesters of this study includes sulfonamide beta lactam and tetracycline resistance gene which were also reported as frequent args in wwtps huang et al 2019 ng et al 2019 all digesters contained eight types of args and the changes in args abundance for each args type are compared in fig 1b it can be found that the abundances of most args in pe and pvc mps digester are higher than that of the control digester the changes are varied with pe and pvc mps addition in the anaerobic digester with pe mps exposure five args resistant to beta lactam tetracycline mls multidrug and rifamycin increase by 5 71 111 4 compared to the control digester and multidrug witnesses the greatest increase other three types of args resistant to sulfonamide phenicol and aminoglycoside show a reduction after pe mps exposure in pvc mps digester except for rifamycin and sulfonamide resistant gene all other args are enricher and improved by 7 08 123 4 compared to control digester multidrug resistant gene achieves the highest increased efficiency of all args following by phenicol resistant gene notably phenicol resistant gene as well as aminoglycoside resistant gene increases in pvc mps digester but does not increase in pe mps digester indicating that pvc mps specifically enriches the specific args in the digester rifamycin resistant gene in pvc mps digester shows the most deduction of 55 3 compared to the control digester nonetheless the reduction of rifamycin resistant gene marginally affects the total args abundance as it only has small quantities it is worth noting that the abundances of sulfonamide resistant gene in both pe and pvc digester are less than that in the control digester which implies that mps might restrict the spread of sulfonamide resistant gene with the whole scenario most args exhibit increases in the presence of mps and pvc mps induces a larger increase than pe mps fig 1c exhibits the composition of args subtypes top 20 and their affiliated types in each digester the diversities of args types and subtypes are not altered after mps exposure but the structure of args types is changed among them sulfonamide resistant gene accounts for 39 4 of total args in control digester which is higher than that in pe and pvc mps digester 28 6 and 27 4 indicating that sulfonamide resistant gene is the most abundant args type in all digesters but its percentage restricted after mps exposure beta lactam resistant gene has the second highest percentage which composed of 17 1 22 8 and 20 7 total args in the control pe and pvc digesters it is found that the percentage of phenicol resistant gene in pvc mps digester 14 31 obviously different from other two digesters being 1 5 and 1 8 times higher than that of the control and pe mps digester respectively collectively both pe and pvc mps increase args abundance in anaerobic sludge digestion and pvc mps digester obtains a larger enrichment of args than pe mps digester abundances of most args type increase after mps exposure while sulfonamide resistant gene shows a slight decrease the reason for this inconsistent impact of mps on each type of arg is complicated possibly relevant to the difference of arb community or hgf level in different digester each type of args have its own favored host organism and args abundance is closely corelated to their potential host previous pointed that mps shifts microbial community during sludge anaerobic digestion wei et al 2019a possibly leading to the changes of arb community and args profile in addition hgf of args may contribute in the difference of args distribution in digester via disturbing traditional proliferative spread of args but whether mps affects on hgf in anaerobic sludge digester still unknown accordingly the effect of mps on arb community and args horizontal flow are further explored in the following section to reveal the potential mechanism of the changed args profile induced by mps 3 2 mps changed potential arb distribution since args can be secreted as well as transmitted by bacteria awasthi et al 2019 mak et al 2014 args carrying microbes i e arb are primary determinants of args emergence and dissemination in sludge the impacts of pe and pvc mps on the composition of potential arb in digesters were investigated using the orfs based approach as shown in fig 2 a proteobacteria is the most dominant phyla of arb in all digesters which accounts for 71 1 77 3 of the total arb population followed by bacteroidetes previous studies also demonstrated that proteobacteria was the dominant args carrier in was and soil d costa et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 that may be because major facilitator superfamily transporters are easy to be enriched in proteobacteria genome forsberg et al 2014 which contributes to the high abundance and dissemination potential of args both pe and pvc mps elevate the population of args carrying proteobacteria which increase by 5 5 and 15 5 respectively compared to control bacteroidetes is the second most abundant arb in all digesters and its abundances in pe and pvc mps digester 8 52 and 5 97 ppm are 2 70 and 1 90 folds of those in the control digester bacteroidetes is regarded as a hotspot bacteria of args since it was reported to obtain highly resistant to several antibiotic classes such as beta lactam tetracycline and macrolide niestępski et al 2020 according to these results the exposure of mps is conducive to enriching representative arb in anaerobic sludge digestion at genus level fig 2 c acinetobacter sp is the most dominant genera and accounts for 29 5 33 6 of the total arb population and 41 5 46 5 of args carrying proteobacteria indicating that acinetobacter sp is the main contributor of potential arb the composition of args carrying genera exhibits similar performance in all digesters indicating that the diversity of the arb community is not affected by mps as such the mps enriches potential arb but does not affect arb diversity in anaerobic sludge digestion furthermore the relationship between args and arb in all digesters is exhibited to explain how mps influences args emergence fig s2 each arb selectively carries its favorable args indicating that microbial analysis in digesters is useful for informing args response to arb for example acinetobacter sp as the most dominant arb is specifically involved with two args subtypes sul1 and catb8 while salmonella sp is the second abundant arb in digester and obtains two specific args subtypes sul2 and ling notably both acinetobacter sp and salmonella sp which carry sulfonamide resistant gene are restricted by mps the observation provides an explanation for deduction of sulfonamide resistance gene in mps stressed digesters presented in section 3 1 therefore mps not only increases arb abundance but also effects the diversity of args that carried by each genus 3 3 mps distinctively affected the acquisition of args by human pathogen bacteria and functional microorganisms researchers have previously verified arg transmission between environmental bacteria and hpb forsberg et al 2012 sludge microbiota has been long assumed to be a reservoir of arb as well as hpb as the intensive contact of was and wastewater that exposed to excrements and antibiotics from humans and animals ju et al 2016 herein the impacts of mps on the presence of args carrying hpb a hpb in anaerobic sludge digestion were firstly clarified according to the metagenomic results table s4 si a total of thirteen a orfs containing seven pathogenic species corresponding to seven genera were detected fig 3 a exhibits the abundance and diversity of a hpb from top 200 species in digesters of this study the total abundance of a hpb in the control digester is 43 85 ppm when the digester was exposed to pe or pvc mps the corresponding abundance increase to 44 36 and 50 55 ppm respectively indicative of the enrichment advantage of pvc mps for a hpb also mps shifts the distribution of the a hpb community in the digester fig 3a and 3b indicates that a baumannii is the most abundant a hpb accounting for 83 05 88 86 of total a hpb abundance in digesters followed by p putida and m morganii as an opportunistic nosocomial hpb in hospitals around the world antunes et al 2014 a baumannii was reported to be endowed highly mobile resistome that drives args dissemination via hgf hernández gonzález et al 2022 the presence of pvc mps enriches a baumannii in anaerobic sludge digestion as its abundance in pvc mps digester 44 92 ppm is 123 4 of that in the control digester 36 42 ppm possibly implying greater mobility of args in pvc mps digester however the enrichment of a baumannii is not observed in pe mps digester which directly induces the limited change of a hpb abundance between the control and pe mps digester previous literature indicated that certain hpb could selectively colonize mps that provide an ideal environment for hpb proliferation and gene flow gong et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the statement offers an underlying mechanism of a hpb enrichment in pvc mps digester as pvc mps selectively stimulate the enrichment of a baumannii pvc mps increases the total abundance of a hpb however some exceptions are observed such as p putida and s sonnei which are restricted by pvc mps but only accounts small proposition of a hpb hence pvc mps enriches a hpb that combines pathogenicity and amr in anaerobic sludge digestion which causes a larger risk for public health and environment safety to further illustrate the influences of mps on a hpb the distribution of args encoded in hpb is exhibited in fig 3 b and table s4 si a total of six types of args are observed in all digesters given a comprehensive view of args percentage in a hpb there is a great difference between the pvc mps and control digester while the pe mps digester has few changes this observation is consistent with corresponding changes in a hpb taxonomy between pe and pvc mps digesters sulfonamide resistant gene is the most dominant args carried by hpb in all digesters 50 11 59 77 followed by phenicol resistant gene furthermore a total of 11 args subtypes are observed to be encoded in a hpb sul1 gene as the only subtype resistant to sulfonamide undoubtedly is the most abundant args carried by a hpb followed by catb8 resistant to phenicol the percentage of sul1 carried by a hpb in the control digester 59 77 is larger than in pvc mps digester 50 11 adversely catb8 accounts for 37 86 of total args carried by a hpb in pvc mps digester which is 1 65 folds of the control digester implying that pvc mps has unequal impacts on each args types unlike pvc mps the introduction of pe mps only shows moderate changes on the structure of args type carried by a hpb interestingly three args encoded in a hpb mphe ermg and tet g are only detected in pvc and pe mps digester but not in the control digester the occurrence of novel args types possibly caused by the bacterial or environmental args flow into hpb via hgf process thereby new args may be introduced into hpb another potential explanation is gene mutation of hpb under the stimulation of mps hu et al 2021 with the elevated level of mutagenesis hpb are more likely to develop args in vivo and thus evolve into arb posing a greater risk to human health according to that mps may attach importance in enrichment of a hpb in digester via args dissemination or formation causing a greater threat to public and environmental health functional microorganisms fms are responsible for the efficient of methane production and sludge destruction in digester it has been previously indicated that microbial methane production processes in anaerobic digestion included hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis xu et al 2021 also some denitrifiers were observed during the anaerobic digester process wang et al 2021b these fms are activists with high growth rates and intensive bacterial communications in anaerobic sludge digestion fournier 2009 wang et al 2022 if fms are encoded with args the proliferation and horizontal flow of args may be accelerated however the presence of args carrying fms a fms is not clarified and whether mps exacerbates this event is still unknown herein several types of representative fms involved in anaerobic digestion i e hydrolytic bacteria short chain fatty acid scfa hydrogen producer methanogen and denitrifier were identified based on existing references barak and van rijn 2000 huang et al 2020 xu et al 2019a compare to control digester pvc mps increase a fms abundance in digester but pe mps induces a slight decrease in its abundance shown in fig 4 and table s5 si it is seen that acinetobacter sp involved in the scfas producing process is the most abundant a fms followed by klebsiella sp scfa hydrogen producer and pseudomonas sp denitrifier the presence of pvc mps enriches args carrying acinetobacter sp as its abundance in pvc mps digester reaches at 44 92 ppm which is 123 4 of the control digester however pe and pvc mps restrict the emergence of args carrying klebsiella sp which decrease by 36 57 and 35 67 respectively compared to the control digester in addition the impacts of pe and pvc mps on each genus of a fms are not universal for example pseudomonas sp is enriched in pe mps digester but restricted in pvc mps digester possibly due to its different sensitivity response to pe and pvc mps collectively mps have great impact on the distribution of a fms in digester since fms have intensive functional metabolism and contact with other bacteria in an anaerobic digester when a fms are enriched under mps stress more args can be flow into fms during the corresponding functional process furthermore the diversity and structure of args types in fms were compared as the most abundant a fms acinetobacter sp obtains the most args diversity by carrying three args types resistant to sulfonamide phenicol and multidrug notably anaerobium sp is the only methanogen observed to carry args in this study however it is only founded in mps stressed digesters but not in control digester which implies that mps might be as a stimulator for args flowing to anaerobium sp the novel a fms observed in mps stressed digesters highlights the potential of mps enhancing hgf of args to further understand whether mps facilitate more args introduced into novel specific bacteria i e a hpb and a fms the correlation between args and specific bacteria are illustrated in fig 5 seven types of args are detected in seventeen bacterial genera affiliated with hpb or fms obviously pe and pvc mps digesters obtain more nodes and edges of network analysis than the control digester implying new args arb patterns are introduced by mps for example tetracycline resistant gene is found to exist in four genera of specific bacteria anaerobium sp mannheimia sp streptococcus sp and pseudomonas sp in pe and pvc mps digester respectively but it only observed in two genera anaerobium sp and mannheimia sp in control digester the similar observation is also presented with mls resistant gene the occurrence of new hosts carrying tetracycline and mls resistant gene indicates that args is introduced into other bacteria via hgf under mps stimulation genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside tetracycline and mls are the top 3 args types that linked to hpb or fms in mps stressed digesters implying they may be easier to be carried by or transferred to specific bacteria than other args types the extra nodes representing bacteria in mps stressed digesters probably indicate that more existing args are introduced into novel bacteria via horizontal flow under mps pressure compared to control i e mannheimia sp in this study acinetobacter sp is the dominant genera that linked the most args types in all digesters and three types of args resistant to sulfonamide phenicol and multidrug are found to be encoded in acinetobacter sp except that mls resistant gene is exclusively encoded in acinetobacter sp which is only found in mps stressed digesters implying that mps may stimulate the horizontal flow of mls resistant gene between arb to acinetobacter sp notably acinetobacter sp holds a dual role of hpb and fms li et al 2015 xu et al 2019a and even was indicated as a critical member to shift arg distribution in sludge system huang et al 2019 xu et al 2019b accordingly mps has potential to stimulate args flowing into acinetobacter sp that obtains high metabolic rate and pathogenicity thereby driving args dissemination and expanding health risks in sludge it is therefore suggested that the enhanced relationship between args and specific bacteria may be responsible for the elevated args emergence and more importantly for the promoted args horizontal flow in mps stressed digesters 3 4 mps enhanced the potential of args horizontal flow horizontal gene flow hgf is a primary pathway contributing to args dissemination between microorganisms in the environment since the existence of novel arb are observed in mps stressed digesters from the above results mps is hypothesized to stimulate the bacterial acquisition of args via hgf thereby enhancing args dissemination in anaerobic sludge digestion according to that it is imperative to explore the underlying mechanisms of mps promoting args horizontal flow multiple factors were proved to facilitate args horizontal flow process including ros production cell membrane permeability eps secretion and atp synthesis guo et al 2022 therefore functional profiles involved in these factors were further investigated as follow it was reported that bacterial ros overproduction could induce sos response as well as dna damage which promotes the horizontal flow of args lu et al 2020 the increased ros level caused by mps in sludge bacteria has been experimentally demonstrated by wei et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in this work the functional profile proves the corresponding results at a molecular level as shown in fig 6 a pe and pvc mps result in an increased abundance of genes relevant to ros production arriving at 105 48 and 113 98 of the control digester respectively cell membrane is the key place for gene uptake by bacteria and its activity is closely associated with hgf processes free or plasmid carrying args require dna characterization transmembrane transport or cell fusion to complete the bacterial transformation and conjugation allen et al 2012 yu et al 2022 it was demonstrated that the enhanced cell membrane permeability could accelerate args horizontal flow wang et al 2020 according to functional profiles of metagenomic results fig 6a and 6c membrane permeability of sludge bacteria is enhanced by mps addition the abundance of genes involved in cell membrane permeability exhibit a 1 10 and 1 13 folds increase in pe and pvc mps digester respectively compared to the control digester previous experiments also indicated the cell membrane permeability were enhanced by mps based on propidium iodide pi dye or lactate dehydrogenase ldh leakage assay shi et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 these experimental results are in line with our result and imply that the functional genes are successful transcribed and translated by microorganisms besides numerous studies indicated that the type iv secretion system t4ss of the membrane system facilitated intracellular dna released and capture extracellular dna christie and vogel 2000 hamilton et al 2005 wang et al 2020 thusly contributing to args horizontal flow between bacteria it is seen from fig 6b that the functional gene associated with t4ss comprised of twelve proteins virb1 11 and vird4 which generates a macromolecular compound that across bacterial cell membranes fig 6c further implies that eight genes encoded t4ss protein were detected in this study and most of their abundance is largely elevated by the mps the most improvement is observed in the virb10 gene which increase by 146 7 and 168 1 in pe and pvc mps digester respectively as a key component of the t4ss virb10 traverses the inner and the outer membrane and is essential for substance translocating cascales and christie 2004 the enhancement of t4ss facilitates args release and further provides free extracellular args eargs introduced into other bacteria in addition to the t4ss system most of the genes associated with cell membrane permeability increase after mps exposure these results indicate that cell membrane permeability is enhanced by mps thereby promoting the horizontal flow of args eps secreted by bacteria is a complex extracellular matrix primarily comprised of polysaccharides proteins and extracellular dna eps surrounding bacteria plays an important role in facilitating hgf of bacteria guo et al 2022 as eps can bound eargs released by bacteria and increase intercellular adhesion which provides an favorable situation for the horizontal flow of args van der aa and dufrêne 2002 zou et al 2020 moreover eps even enhances nutrient capture from the extracellular environment flemming et al 2021 further supplying sufficient nutrients for bacteria to release and accept args accordingly eps attaches great importance to args horizontal flow in this study the total abundances of genes related to eps secretion are 39 30 ppm and 43 57 ppm in pe and pvc mps digester which increase by 10 20 and 22 19 respectively compared to the control digester a previous study also indicated that mps could trigger eps release by bacteria shiu et al 2020 which is consistent with our conclusions therefore eps secretion in sludge bacteria is stimulated by mps which possibly contributes to the enhancement of args presence and dissemination in digesters energy is essential for args horizontal flow of bacteria guo et al 2022 adenosine triphosphate atp is the most direct energy source in organisms thus determining the level of atp synthesis related genes helps us understand how mps promoted args dissemination compared to the control pe and pvc mps increase the abundance of atp associated genes by 21 75 and 28 79 not only with the genomic view the elevated energetic activity also proved at the mrna and protein level romano et al 2020 observed an increment of atpase related gene expression induced by pvc mps also the enhancement of atpase level mediated by mps verified by previous experiment rangasamy et al 2022 these findings suggest that the mps stimulates sludge bacteria to generate more energy for args horizontal flow the potential mechanisms of the enhanced horizontal flow of args between bacteria induced by mps are illustrated in fig 7 in the presence of mps excessive ros production results in the oxidative stress and sos response which leads to a high metabolic rate and increased atp synthesis in addition to the above mechanisms eps secretion in bacteria is also promoted by mps which strengthens intercellular adhesion and args retention van der aa and dufrêne 2002 and further provides more opportunities for args exchange collectively the levels of functional genes relevant to hgf process are enhanced in the presence of mps thusly contributing to args dissemination in the environment 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the different mps distinctively enhance the args emergence in anaerobic sludge digestion based on metagenomic sequencing analysis and pvc mps enriches more args than pe mps also mps increases arb abundance in digesters with acinetobacter sp and salmonella sp being observed to be the dominant arb and obtaining the most args diversity simultaneously the a hpb and a fms are enriched in the pvc mps digester but limitedly changed in the pe mps digesters the key factors involved in the hgf process i e ros production cell membrane permeability eps secretion and atp synthesis are also promoted by both pe and pvc mps based on functional profiles together with these favorable factors the horizontal flow of args in digesters is therefore facilitated by mps this study provides an in depth understanding of the

15291,natural organic matter nom readily interacts with nanoparticles leading to the formation of nom corona structures on their surface nom corona formation is closely related to the surface coatings and bioavailability of nanoparticles however the mechanism underlying nom corona formation on silver nanoparticles agnps remains largely unknown due to the lack of effective analytical methods for identifying the changes in the agnp surface herein the separation ability of biased cyclical electrical field flow fractionation bcyelfff for same sized polyvinyl pyrrolidone coated and poly ethylene glycol coated silver nanoparticles agnps with different electrophoretic mobilities was evaluated under various electrical conditions then the mechanism behind the nom corona formation on these agnp surfaces was elucidated based on the changes in the elution time and off line characterization of the collected fractions during their elution time in a bcyelfff run finally the survival rates of e coli exposed to polyvinyl pyrrolidone coated and poly ethylene glycol coated agnps with or without nom collected during repeated bcyelfff runs were observed to increase with increasing nom concentration clearly demonstrating the negative effect of nom corona structures on the bioavailability of agnps these findings highlight the powerful separation and isolation ability of bcyelfff in studying the transformation and fate of nanoparticles in aqueous environments graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords environmental corona silver nanoparticles ecotoxicological activity electrical field flow fractionation icpms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared with bulk materials nanomaterials with at least one nanoscale structural dimension possess extraordinary properties making them increasingly applicable in various fields such as catalysis electronics medicine and environmental applications zhou et al 2011 kamyshny and magdassi 2014 hassan et al 2017 long et al 2021 however during the usage and discharge of products containing nanoparticles these nanomaterials inevitably enter the aquatic environment hochella et al 2019 lowry et al 2012 for instance silver nanoparticles agnps are one of the most widely used nanomaterials due to their application as antibacterial agents agnps have been identified in sewage treatment plant products as well as natural surface waters kim et al 2010 wimmer et al 2018 wagner et al 2014 further studies have reported that agnps have a high surface to volume ratio and they usually interact with co existing substances in the surrounding environment furman et al 2013 gao et al 2017 among these substances ubiquitous natural organic matter nom has received considerable attention due to the potential adsorption of nom onto agnp surfaces via various forces such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions this adsorption phenomenon leads to the generation of a new surface structure referred to as environmental corona which plays a crucial role in regulating the aggregation oxidation sulfidation and uptake of agnps by organisms lowry et al 2012 yin et al 2015 levard et al 2012 xiao et al 2020 therefore elucidating the nom corona formation will be helpful for predicting the transport fate and risk assessment of agnps generally the thickness of nom corona formation on agnps is closely related to the nom concentration citrate cit coated polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp coated and poly ethylene glycol peg coated agnps are the three most extensively investigated agnps in studies focusing on their environmental behavior and risk among these agnps cit agnps are the most easily synthesized and commercially available and they also exhibit excellent dispersion ability in water due to the good reducibility and hydrophilic nature of cit molecules sousa et al 2015 zou et al 2017 cit molecules weakly bind with agnp surfaces via the oxygen atom in their carboxylate groups which can be easily replaced by other molecules containing thiols and amines such as nom therefore nom corona formation on the cit agnp surface has been well explained lau et al 2013 specifically increasing the nom corona thickness on cit agnps has been visually demonstrated by hollow fiber flow field flow fractionation tan et al 2017 in contrast to cit molecules pvp is a polymer rich in nitrogen containing functional groups and this polymer can form strong ag nitrogen covalent bonds on the surface of agnps similarly the polymer peg is usually coated on agnp surfaces through strong ag sulfur covalent bonds these covalent bonds mean that both pvp and peg coatings are difficult to replace with nom tejamaya et al 2012 ellis et al 2016 fahrina et al 2022 therefore there is currently only a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying nom corona formation on pvp agnp and peg agnp surfaces one of the barriers preventing the further elucidation of nom corona formation on these surfaces may be the lack of effective analytical methods for identifying changes in the agnp surface moreover only a limited number of studies have investigated the possible influence of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological activity of pvp agnps and peg agnps most recently xu and coworkers summarized the biological effects of nom corona formation on various aquatic organisms finding that both beneficial and inhibitory effects were previously reported xu et al 2020 one of the causes of this inconsistency in previous studies might be the low separation efficiency and poor reproducibility of the most widely used pretreatments such as ultracentrifugation for isolating agnps with nom corona from silver ions ag and their complexes bare agnps and free nom molecules moreover the significant compressive force of ultracentrifugation can destroy the intact structure of nom corona lead to adsorption of the target compound onto the ultracentrifugation tubes and result in the co elution of free nom and the agnps with nom corona during ultracentrifugation to overcome this bottleneck the development of gentle and high efficiency methods for the isolation of agnps with nom corona is urgently required for the accurate assessment of their ecotoxicological risk electrical field flow fractionation elfff is an elution based separation technique that applies an electrical field across a separation channel this technique is capable of gently separating particles based on their electrophoretic mobilities with high separation efficiency under mild conditions giddings 1993 in elfff separation occurs in an open channel without a stationary phase avoiding unwanted interaction between the target and the stationary phase which is inevitable in liquid chromatography moreover the cross section of the elfff separation channel is much larger than the narrow capillary used in capillary electrophoresis srinivas et al 2010 liu et al 2015 allowing for the processing of higher sample volumes e g several ml and the collection of fractions during eifff runs for utilization in secondary analysis techniques standard elfff usually uses a constant direct current dc voltage lower than 1 7 v to avoid significant electrolysis and bubbles gale et al 1998 elfff is therefore much safer than capillary electrophoresis which uses a voltage of several dozen kv to further improve the effective electrical field used in standard elfff gale s group developed a cyclical elfff cyelfff strategy based on both theory and experimental results they used a standard elfff channel in which alternating current ac voltages of up to 8 v peak to peak were used to produce much stronger cyclical electrical fields demonstrating excellent separation ability for colloidal particles gale and srinivas 2005 kantak et al 2006 gigault et al 2011 next the same group introduced a biased cyclical electrical field to overcome the diffusion challenges associated with gold nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm further improving the applicability of cyelfff in the characterization of nanomaterials tasci et al 2013 of note in the biased cyclical elfff bcyelfff system the biased cyclical electrical field with high frequency effectively disrupts the formation of electrical double layer on the channel walls and thus inhibits water electrolysis and bubble formation so high voltages over 1 7 v can be used overall the specific characteristics of bcyelfff such as the excellent separation ability in an open channel under mild conditions safe operation with low voltage and the accurate collection of many eluted targets mean that it is a very promising technique for studying nom corona formation on agnp surfaces and isolating agnps with nom corona for further research in this work bcyelfff was used as a potential alternative method for the simultaneous separation and isolation of agnps with nom corona first we explored whether the developed bcyelfff ultraviolet visible uv vis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icpms bcyelfff uv vis icpms system was suitable for identifying differences in the surface charge of agnps by separating the same sized agnps with different coatings i e peg and pvp under optimized conditions the second hypothesis of this study was that the nom corona formation on the agnp surface would be tracked by the bcyelfff uv vis icpms system with high separation resolution and sensitivity under the optimized electrical conditions the mechanisms underlying nom corona formation on peg agnps and pvp agnps would be elucidated based on the changes in their elution times the third hypothesis was that the agnps with nom corona collected during their elution time in repeated bcyelfff runs would have different ecotoxicological activity compared with agnps without nom corona by comparing the survival rates of e coli 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals stock solutions of different agnps peg agnps and pvp agnps with a concentration of 0 02 mg ml and a nominal size of 40 nm were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis missouri usa and their main properties were given in table 1 suwannee river nom srnom was obtained from the international humic substance society st paul minnesota usa and a stock solution was prepared by adding the srnom powder into ultrapure water 18 3 mω milli q gradient system millipore bedford massachusetts usa followed by stirring and filtering the resulting suspension as described in our previous studies yin et al 2015 shen et al 2015 the final concentration of the nom stock solution was 380 mg l c as quantified by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan all the stock solutions were stored in brown glass vials in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to use the ultrapure water was used to prepare aqueous solutions throughout the entire study including the carrier liquid in the bcyelfff system 2 2 instrumentation and operation fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the on line coupled bcyelfff uv vis icpms system this system was mainly composed of three modules including the sample introduction separation and detection modules in the sample introduction module a high pressure liquid chromatography pump 1260 agilent california usa was used to deliver the carrier liquid ultrapure water with a set flow rate through an injection valve with a 100 μl injection loop 7725i rheodyne california usa and deliver the samples to the separation module the separation module consisted of a bcyelfff channel and ac dc power supplies to apply ac dc voltage across the bcyelfff channel the bcyelfff channel was a crucial part of the separation module the structure of the bcyelfff channel was similar to that used in previous studies tasci et al 2013 petersen et al 2018 briefly a spacer with a ribbon like structure and trapezoidal ends tip to tip length 28 0 cm initial breadth 2 0 cm final breadth 1 0 cm and thickness 190 μm was sandwiched between parallel rectangular graphite plates serving both as electrodes and as channel walls the electrical field across the channel was generated by a dc power supply e3642a keysight california usa for dc voltage and a waveform generator 33500b series keysight california usa for ac voltage the detection module consisted of a uv vis spectrometer 1200 series agilent technologies palo alto california usa and an icpms system 7700 agilent technologies palo alto california usa for accurate quantification of ag species table s1 summarizes the quality assurance quality control data for icpms including calibration materials e g agnps rm 8017 obtained from the national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md usa detection limits at μg l level and the satisfactory reproducibility with relative standard deviations less than 4 and recoveries in the range of 88 4 83 9 etc in the supplementary materials other than a commercial concentric nebulizer micromist glass expansion pty ltd victoria australia usa used for sample injection for icpms all the modules were connected by peek tubing 0 25 mm 1 58 mm i d o d upchurch scientific washington usa a typical bcyelfff run was divided into three steps sample injection relaxation and elution during sample injection the sample was delivered by the carrier liquid ultrapure water from the injection valve to the inlet of the bcyelfff channel at a flow rate of 0 25 ml min for 0 7 min next the flow rate was reduced to 0 ml min and the dc power supply was turned on to trigger the relaxation step during the relaxation step an equilibrium distribution of the sample was established in the channel due to the effects of brownian motion diffusion and the dc field on the agnps after 1 min relaxation the elution step was performed as follows the flow rate was increased to 0 25 ml min the dc power supply 1 0 v was turned off and the ac power supply generated by the waveform generator was turned on to provide square wave voltage at a set amplitude frequency and duty cycle normally the electrophoretic mobility of agnps in bcyelfff strictly determines their elution order and particles with low electrophoretic mobility elute the separation channel faster than the particles with high electrophoretic mobility after separation the eluted agnps were transferred into the uv vis spectrometer 410 nm and icpms 107ag for identification and quantification after each run the ac power supply was turned off to clean the residual agnps and other co existing substances that may have adhered to the channel wall a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk equipped with a he ne laser 633 nm at an angle of 173 was used to obtain the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic mobility values of peg agnps or pvp agnps subject to incubation with or without nom a high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jem 2100f jeol co ltd japan coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds jemarm200f jeol co ltd japan operated at 200 kv was used to determine the morphologies and elements of the agnps with nom corona the hrtem samples were prepared by evaporation of solutions onto an ultrathin carbon coated copper grid in a vacuum at room temperature as described in our previous studies yin et al 2015 tan et al 2017 all the instruments used in this work were operated referring to the manufacturer s guidelines 2 3 effect of nom concentration on the environmental corona formation on agnps with different coating agents concentrations of nom varying from 0 to 50 mg l were chosen to study their effects on the environmental corona formation on the peg agnps or pvp agnp surfaces at 50 μg l of note a high concentration of peg agnps or pvp agnps i e 10 mg l was used for accurate off line characterization by the zetasizer nano zs and hrtem instruments the initial mixture solutions of agnps incubated with or without nom were adjusted to ph 7 0 using 0 01 m hydrochloric acid or 0 01 m sodium hydroxide solution and these ph adjusted solutions were stored in 1 5 ml amber glass vials cat no 5182 0717 agilent california usa with polypropylene screw caps the vials were placed on a horizontal rotator and shaken at 150 rpm and room temperature overnight all incubation experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility after overnight incubation the vials were vortexed using an ika vortex 3 ika germany and the samples in these vials were directly extracted by a 100 μl injection syringe and immediately analyzed by the bcyelfff uv vis icpms system 2 4 ecotoxicological risk of agnps with nom corona against e coli e coli was chosen as the model bacteria to assess the effect of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological risk of agnps e coli on agar slant was washed by sterilized phosphate buffer solution pbs 0 03 m to prepare a stock solution 5 105 4 5 106 cfu ml after being cultured in lb culture medium at 37 c for 24 h the whole procedure was performed according to the standard test methods for evaluation of the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product iso 11 930 2012 in preliminary experiments 0 1 mm sodium sulfide na2s was selected as the neutralizing agent to neutralize the ecotoxicological activity of agnps without inhibiting the test e coli in the culture process and 20 mg l agnps were chosen given that agnps at mg l level have been reported to show significant antibacterial activity against e coli choi et al 2008 four test groups were prepared as follows 1 5 0 ml 0 1 mm na2s and 0 1 ml stock solution of e coli 2 0 5 ml 20 mg l agnps 4 5 ml 0 1 mm na2s and 0 1 ml stock solution of e coli 3 5 0 ml 0 03 m pbs buffer solution and 0 1 ml stock solution of e coli and 4 1 0 ml 0 03 m pbs buffer solution and 1 0 ml 0 1 mm na2s after incubation at 37 c for 48 h the bacterial growth in groups 1 2 and 3 was similar but there was no bacterial growth in group 4 demonstrating the high neutralizing efficacy of 0 1 mm na2s before the ecotoxicological risk tests 0 5 and 50 mg l nom concentrations were used to obtain peg agnps or pvp agnps with different nom corona thicknesses and incubated as previously described in view of the sample volume needed to assess the ecotoxicological activity of the agnps 16 ml agnps with or without nom corona were collected during their elution times in eight repeated bcyelfff uv vis icpms runs then 5 ml of each collected sample was mixed with 0 1 ml e coli stock solution in sterilized tubes for incubation after 1 min 0 5 ml of this mixture and 4 5 ml 0 1 mm na2s were added to another sterilized tube as the positive control 0 03 m pbs buffer solution was used in parallel with the test samples one ml of the test or control solution was added to sterilized plates each assay was performed in triplicate finally the number of colonies was counted after incubation at 37 c for 48 h the survival rate was calculated using the equation a 1 a 0 100 where a 0 and a 1 are the colony forming units of the positive control and test groups respectively 2 5 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted at least three times under the same conditions and their data were expressed as the mean standard deviation for three independent experiments unless otherwise noted the statistical significance level was set at p 0 05 using t test statistics 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of bcyelfff electrical parameters to improve the separation efficiency of nps smaller than 50 nm the combination of dc and ac electrical fields was applied perpendicularly to the separation channel according to the method developed by tasci et al 2013 based on the parameters reported in previous studies tasci et al 2013 petersen et al 2018 ornthai et al 2016 the dc field was generated by setting the dc power supply at 1 v for 1 min during the stopped flow sample relaxation in the present study in preliminary experiments it was determined that the elution time of peg agnps i e 9 3 0 3 min was slightly shorter than that of pvp agnps i e 11 3 0 2 min this was mainly due to the slight difference in their zeta potentials i e ca 12 1 mv for peg agnps and ca 20 5 mv for pvp agnps at ph 7 0 and nearly identical hydrodynamic diameters i e ca 67 0 nm for peg agnps and ca 72 2 nm for pvp agnps with a polydispersity index of less than 0 25 as shown in table 1 therefore individual peg agnps and pvp agnps were used to evaluate the effects of the main operating parameters of the ac power supply instead of a mixture of both agnps the ac power supply operating parameters included the amplitude frequency and duty cycle of square wave voltages and the effects of these parameters on the retention recovery and separation resolution of peg agnps and pvp agnps were investigated by evaluating changes in the retention ratio r and peak area pa recorded by icpms the r values were defined as the ratio between the void peak retention time t 0 and the agnps peak retention time t r tasci et al 2013 shiri et al 2020 the integration of pa was performed by originpro 8 5 the resolution of separation rs was calculated using the following equation r s t r 2 t r 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 where t r1 and t r2 are the retention times of the peaks of peg agnps and pvp agnps respectively and σ1 and σ2 are the standard deviations of their corresponding peaks the voltage amplitude controlled the applied electrical field across the separation channel the effect of voltage amplitude on the retention of agnps was investigated in the range of 1 0 5 0 v with the frequency and duty cycle set at 1 0 hz and 80 respectively fig s1a and fig s1b respectively present the representative icpms fractograms of peg agnps and pvp agnps obtained at voltage amplitudes varying from 1 0 to 4 0 v for voltage amplitudes higher than 4 0 v the peak heights of the peg agnps and pvp agnps became much smaller and the peaks became significantly wider data not shown thus the accurate integration of the eluted agnps peaks was very difficult for voltage amplitudes higher than 4 0 v simultaneously the baseline signal of the uv vis detector became unstable which was probably due to the small bubbles generated during the electrolysis of the water at higher voltages gigault et al 2011 fig 2 a shows that there was a significant decrease in the r values of both pvp agnps and peg agnps at higher voltage amplitudes indicating that their retention in the separation channel increased with increasing voltage amplitude moreover the r values of pvp agnps were always smaller than those of peg agnps correspondingly pvp agnps and peg agnps achieved their maximum pa values at an amplitude voltage of 2 5 v fig s2a the significant decrease in pa values at higher amplitude voltages was potentially due to the irreversible adsorption of agnps onto the separation channel surface johann et al 2015 this was demonstrated by the small peak shown in fig s1 at a voltage of 4 0 v after turning off the ac power supply thus the amplitude voltage of 2 5 v which led to the highest rs value of 0 82 was used in subsequent experiments the frequency of the ac power supply is another important parameter determining the retention of the target in the bcyelfff channel herein the retention of peg agnps and pvp agnps was studied using the frequency in the range of 0 5 to 5 hz with a voltage amplitude and a duty cycle of 2 5 v and 80 respectively the r values shown in fig 2b decreased with increasing frequency from 0 5 to 2 hz indicating that the agnps follow the separation mode denoted mode i gale and srinivas 2005 in which the target oscillated back and forth between the accumulation wall and the middle of the separation channel according to the ac voltage cycle fig s2b shows that the frequency did not significantly influence the recovery which was consistent with the previous findings tasci et al 2013 notably frequencies of 2 hz and above led to the broadening and splitting of both the peg agnps and pvp agnps peaks as shown in fig s3 due most likely to the increased effective electrical fields at high frequencies tasci et al 2013 therefore a frequency of 1 0 hz was used in the following experiments using duty cycles greater than 50 in bcyelfff has been found to effectively overcome the diffusion induced limitation of the separation of nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm tasci et al 2013 petersen et al 2018 fig s4a shows that nearly no separation was observed for a duty cycle of 50 similar to the reported behavior of gold nanoparticles with diameters below 50 nm tasci et al 2013 as shown in fig s4b the r s values varied in the range of 1 25 1 29 as the duty cycle increased from 70 to 90 these values were significantly higher than the r s values of 1 01 achieved with a duty cycle of 60 thus a duty cycle of 80 was selected for the following experiments in summary the optimized ac parameters after the relaxation were as follows a voltage amplitude of 2 5 v a frequency of 1 0 hz and a duty cycle of 80 in particular the satisfactory rs values of the nearly identically sized peg agnps and pvp agnps which only had a slight difference in the zeta potential demonstrate the utility of bcyelfff uv vis icpms in identifying minor changes in surface charge these findings demonstrate the great potential of this developed method for characterizing the nom corona on agnp surfaces and playing a key role in the modulation of their surface properties and subsequent ecotoxicological activity 3 2 tracking nom corona formation on peg agnps and pvp agnps soluble srnom is often used as a model nom to mimic environmental coatings due to its higher solubility in solutions with medium and higher ph values caused by abundant acidic functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups tan et al 2019 thus keeping in mind that the average concentration range of nom in natural surface waters is no more than 50 mg l tan et al 2017 we studied the effect of nom concentrations of 0 2 10 20 and 50 mg l on the environmental corona formation on the peg agnps and pvp agnps both at the concentration of 50 μg l the icpms fractograms in fig 3 a show that the elution time of the peg agnps clearly increased with increasing nom concentration in contrast the elution time of the pvp agnps shown in fig 3b remained unchanged at lower nom concentrations and then slowly increased with increasing higher nom concentrations this suggests a difference between the interactions of nom with the peg and pvp coatings uv vis fractograms of the mixture of pvp agnps and nom shown in fig s5 demonstrate that the free nom molecules eluted at 6 min and this elution peak increased in intensity with increasing nom concentration however it was very difficult to discern the agnps peak because of the low sensitivity of uv vis detector making it impossible to collect the agnps with nom corona structures for further off line characterization given that only agnps with nom corona or pristine agnps if any were collected within their elution time the interference of unbound nom molecules was effectively eliminated in dynamic light scattering dls characterization using a zetasizer nano zs due to the limited sensitivity of dls 100 μl of peg agnps or pvp agnps both at a concentration of 10 mg l was injected for accurate collection for off line characterization as shown in fig s6 the dls results show that the hydrodynamic sizes of the collected peg agnps and pvp agnps were nearly unchanged with increasing nom concentration up to 20 mg l interestingly fig 3c shows that the absolute values of the electrophoretic mobility of peg agnps significantly increased in line with the increase in their elution time while those of pvp agnps slowly increased with increasing nom concentration these findings indicated that the changes in the elution times of peg agnps and pvp agnps were mainly dependent on their variation in electrophoretic mobility generally the binding of peg and pvp molecules to agnp surfaces is caused by the s and n containing groups forming s ag and n ag strong coordinate covalent bonds respectively nom molecules have been reported to directly interact with and or diffuse through pvp coatings instead of replacing pvp molecules baalousha et al 2022 nom contains a broad spectrum of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components and is negatively charged at neutral ph tan et al 2019 pvp is an uncharged polymer but the amide group in its pyrrolidone subunit is much more negatively charged and favors the dissolution of pvp the ring and polyvinyl domains of pvp molecules have been found to interact with nom lau et al 2013 with increasing nom concentration nom molecules will gradually diffuse onto areas of the agnp surface unoccupied by pvp leading to an increase in electrophoretic mobility moreover same sized agnps coated with pvp and nom or its fraction e g humic acid have been reported to have comparable zeta potentials wang et al 2018 leading to a slow change in the electrophoretic mobility of pvp agnps incubated with increasing concentrations of nom considering the comparable binding energies of peg agnps and pvp agnps 373 ev for both coated agnps nguyen et al 2018 it is safe to conclude that the nom corona on the peg agnp surface was also formed by interaction with and or diffusion through the peg coating peg is rich in hydroxyl groups and readily interacts with nom rich in oxygen containing functional groups through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects leading to the accumulation of nom onto the peg coating and subsequent diffusion onto the agnp surface therefore the absolute electrophoretic mobility of peg agnps markedly increased with increasing nom concentration as shown in fig 3c a significant increase in hydrodynamic size was observed for a nom concentration of 50 mg l compared to the agnps obtained without nom incubation as verified by the corona observed in the corresponding hrtem images fig 3d moreover we took hrtem eds images of the pvp agnps and peg agnps incubated with nom samples fig 4 and pristine pvp agnp and peg agnp samples fig s7 and tried to analyze element distribution in these two types of agnps with nom corona the elemental mapping images of nom peg agnps show that the weight percent value of n element increase to around 5 which was significantly higher than that of pristine peg agnps 0 similarly the weight percent value of s element in nom pvp agnps eds images is 8 74 which is up to three times higher than that of pristine pvp agnps 2 89 both of these findings suggest that the nom molecules have adsorbed on agnp surface to form corona in addition gaussian 16 as the calculation software was used to optimize the geometry and calculate the binding energy using the density functional theory b3lyp method with lanl2dz basis set for silver atoms and 6 311g d p basis sets for other atoms tavakol 2017 fig s8 presents the optimized structures of peg ag and pvp ag complexes the binding energies of peg monomer and pvp monomer on agnp surface were calculated to be 23 68 ev and 23 78 ev which were comparable to that of carboxylic and phenolic groups dominant in nom molecules on agnp surface 23 64 ev and 23 67 ev these calculated results confirmed that nom molecules could directly adsorb on agnp surface unoccupied peg and or molecules by instead of replacing them due to their comparable high binding energies this finding is meaningful to elucidate the different mechanism underlying nom corona formation on peg agnp and pvp agnp surfaces from that on the cit agnp surface the formation of nom corona on the surfaces of peg agnps and pvp agnps at environmentally relevant concentrations has remained unexploited so far partly due to the unavailability of effective analytical methods herein the excellent separation ability of bcyelfff demonstrates its applicability for identifying minor changes in the coating composition of agnps which can be sensitively detected by icpms moreover the agnps with corona can be effectively collected during their elution time in bcyelfff runs for accurate characterization by other techniques and for further assessment of their ecotoxicological activity 3 3 effect of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological activity of agnps in addition to the high separation resolution of the bcyelfff method this technique also had the advantage of capably separating large sample volumes as high as several ml superior to the sample volumes of capillary electrophoresis usually at the nl level srinivas et al 2010 liu et al 2015 this advantage facilitates the collection of fractionated agnps with nom corona and the elimination of interference from free nom and ionic ag species such as ag beneficial for accurately assessing the ecotoxicological activity of agnps with nom corona fig 5 a shows the uv vis fractograms of peg agnps and pvp agnps both at 2 mg l after incubation with nom concentrations of 0 5 and 50 mg l notably the r and rs values of peg agnps and pvp agnps significantly decreased with increasing nom concentration mainly due to the sample overloading effect in elfff tri et al 2000 due to the sample volume needed for achieving good repeatability in ecotoxicological activity tests a collection of 8 runs operated at the optimized bcyelfff conditions was performed within the elution time of the agnps species the ecotoxicological activity of peg agnps or pvp agnps incubated with or without nom was investigated by exposing e coli to the collected agnps species at a concentration of ca 1 mg l ag it was observed that the effects of both peg agnps and pvp agnps on the growth of e coli were noticeably dependent on the concentration of incubated nom fig 5b compared with pvp the peg coating exhibited better biocompatibility and nontoxicity na et al 2012 therefore as expected the ecotoxicological activity of peg agnps was lower than that of pvp agnps remarkably there was a significant decrease in the ecotoxicological activity of both peg agnps and pvp agnps in the presence of nom especially at the high nom concentration specifically the survival rate of e coli exposed to peg agnps and pvp agnps after incubation with 50 mg l nom increased to ca 88 3 and ca 83 5 compared to 62 8 for peg agnps and 58 1 for pvp agnps without nom incubation thus nom corona led to reduced ecotoxicological activity interestingly this trend was in line with the changes in their electrophoretic mobility displayed in fig 3c the ionic ag species and unbound nom were not collected during the bcyelfff runs so the improved survival rate of e coli was mainly due to nom corona formation on the agnp surfaces in view of the fact that the e coli were negatively charged in the lb culture medium the ecotoxicological activity of agnps was closely associated with the electrostatic repulsion of agnps with e coli and the steric hindrance effect which became dominant at 50 mg l nom sondi et al 2004 levard et al 2013 although the reduced ecotoxicological activity of agnps in the presence of nom has been extensively investigated xu et al 2020 the role of nom corona remains an open question this is mainly due to the difficulty of separating agnps with nom corona from coexisting ionic ag species such as ag or their complexes with nom the bcyelfff system provides a powerful and gentle sample pretreatment technique to selectively isolate and nondestructively collect agnps with nom corona in large quantities beneficial for enabling a deep understanding of the effects of the changes in the surface morphology of agnps on their ecotoxicological risk in aquatic ecosystems it should be noted that we here just concentrated on the effect of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological activity of agnps given that several well defined mechanisms underlying the toxicity of agnps have been proposed in vitro or in vivo in toxicological tests beer et al 2012 which mechanism is dominant in these effects requires more comprehensive studies in the future by characterizing the cell structure of e coli exposed to agnps with nom corona using electron microscopy zhao et al 2013 and confocal laser scanning microscopy haase et al 2012 kasemets et al 2019 and determining reactive oxygen species levels in e coli using electron spin resonance spectroscopy kim et al 2007 etc 4 conclusions nom corona formation leads to the formation of a new identity for pristine nanoparticles altering their environmental behavior fate and biological effects to the best of our knowledge the difference in formation ability of nom corona on the same sized agnps with different coatings at environmentally relevant concentrations was for the first time visually demonstrated owing to the excellent separation ability of bcyelfff and the high sensitivity of icpms our results showed that the corona thickness on peg agnps and pvp agnps gradually increased with increasing nom concentration based on the increase in the elution times of the agnps with nom corona although this finding was consistent with the results obtained using the widely used dls technique the interference of free nom molecules was effectively avoided due to their pre elution before the elution of agnps species interestingly the change in the elution time of peg agnps was larger than that of pvp agnps although there was a negligible difference in their hydrodynamic size the behavior observed here further expands our understanding of the role of nanoparticle coatings on the environmental corona formation in real environmental systems as well as biological systems furthermore nom corona was found to significantly improve the survival rate of e coli which was mainly due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion forces and steric hindrance effect between the agnps with nom corona and bacterial membranes this was achieved by testing the agnps collected during the bcyelfff runs which meant that the interference of ag and unbound nom was avoided moreover these findings confirm the determinant role of particulate ag species in the ecotoxicological activity of agnps beneficial for resolving the ongoing controversy about the biological effect of agnps overall the bcyelfff method developed herein provides a powerful tool for monitoring minor changes in the surface of agnps and the effective pretreatment and isolation of agnps species from complex media one limitation of this study is that nom and agnp concentrations used were above real concentrations measured in most natural waters owing to the relatively low sensitivity of icpms future studies should consider using higher sensitive detectors e g single particle icpms which are critical for extending the findings to natural waters moreover this work can be definitely extended to other nanoparticles the information reported in this work enhances our understanding of the environmental behavior and biological impacts of nanoparticles released in the environment and it is expected to be beneficial for improving public awareness and reducing public concern about nanoparticles and their products

15291,natural organic matter nom readily interacts with nanoparticles leading to the formation of nom corona structures on their surface nom corona formation is closely related to the surface coatings and bioavailability of nanoparticles however the mechanism underlying nom corona formation on silver nanoparticles agnps remains largely unknown due to the lack of effective analytical methods for identifying the changes in the agnp surface herein the separation ability of biased cyclical electrical field flow fractionation bcyelfff for same sized polyvinyl pyrrolidone coated and poly ethylene glycol coated silver nanoparticles agnps with different electrophoretic mobilities was evaluated under various electrical conditions then the mechanism behind the nom corona formation on these agnp surfaces was elucidated based on the changes in the elution time and off line characterization of the collected fractions during their elution time in a bcyelfff run finally the survival rates of e coli exposed to polyvinyl pyrrolidone coated and poly ethylene glycol coated agnps with or without nom collected during repeated bcyelfff runs were observed to increase with increasing nom concentration clearly demonstrating the negative effect of nom corona structures on the bioavailability of agnps these findings highlight the powerful separation and isolation ability of bcyelfff in studying the transformation and fate of nanoparticles in aqueous environments graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords environmental corona silver nanoparticles ecotoxicological activity electrical field flow fractionation icpms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared with bulk materials nanomaterials with at least one nanoscale structural dimension possess extraordinary properties making them increasingly applicable in various fields such as catalysis electronics medicine and environmental applications zhou et al 2011 kamyshny and magdassi 2014 hassan et al 2017 long et al 2021 however during the usage and discharge of products containing nanoparticles these nanomaterials inevitably enter the aquatic environment hochella et al 2019 lowry et al 2012 for instance silver nanoparticles agnps are one of the most widely used nanomaterials due to their application as antibacterial agents agnps have been identified in sewage treatment plant products as well as natural surface waters kim et al 2010 wimmer et al 2018 wagner et al 2014 further studies have reported that agnps have a high surface to volume ratio and they usually interact with co existing substances in the surrounding environment furman et al 2013 gao et al 2017 among these substances ubiquitous natural organic matter nom has received considerable attention due to the potential adsorption of nom onto agnp surfaces via various forces such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions this adsorption phenomenon leads to the generation of a new surface structure referred to as environmental corona which plays a crucial role in regulating the aggregation oxidation sulfidation and uptake of agnps by organisms lowry et al 2012 yin et al 2015 levard et al 2012 xiao et al 2020 therefore elucidating the nom corona formation will be helpful for predicting the transport fate and risk assessment of agnps generally the thickness of nom corona formation on agnps is closely related to the nom concentration citrate cit coated polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp coated and poly ethylene glycol peg coated agnps are the three most extensively investigated agnps in studies focusing on their environmental behavior and risk among these agnps cit agnps are the most easily synthesized and commercially available and they also exhibit excellent dispersion ability in water due to the good reducibility and hydrophilic nature of cit molecules sousa et al 2015 zou et al 2017 cit molecules weakly bind with agnp surfaces via the oxygen atom in their carboxylate groups which can be easily replaced by other molecules containing thiols and amines such as nom therefore nom corona formation on the cit agnp surface has been well explained lau et al 2013 specifically increasing the nom corona thickness on cit agnps has been visually demonstrated by hollow fiber flow field flow fractionation tan et al 2017 in contrast to cit molecules pvp is a polymer rich in nitrogen containing functional groups and this polymer can form strong ag nitrogen covalent bonds on the surface of agnps similarly the polymer peg is usually coated on agnp surfaces through strong ag sulfur covalent bonds these covalent bonds mean that both pvp and peg coatings are difficult to replace with nom tejamaya et al 2012 ellis et al 2016 fahrina et al 2022 therefore there is currently only a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying nom corona formation on pvp agnp and peg agnp surfaces one of the barriers preventing the further elucidation of nom corona formation on these surfaces may be the lack of effective analytical methods for identifying changes in the agnp surface moreover only a limited number of studies have investigated the possible influence of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological activity of pvp agnps and peg agnps most recently xu and coworkers summarized the biological effects of nom corona formation on various aquatic organisms finding that both beneficial and inhibitory effects were previously reported xu et al 2020 one of the causes of this inconsistency in previous studies might be the low separation efficiency and poor reproducibility of the most widely used pretreatments such as ultracentrifugation for isolating agnps with nom corona from silver ions ag and their complexes bare agnps and free nom molecules moreover the significant compressive force of ultracentrifugation can destroy the intact structure of nom corona lead to adsorption of the target compound onto the ultracentrifugation tubes and result in the co elution of free nom and the agnps with nom corona during ultracentrifugation to overcome this bottleneck the development of gentle and high efficiency methods for the isolation of agnps with nom corona is urgently required for the accurate assessment of their ecotoxicological risk electrical field flow fractionation elfff is an elution based separation technique that applies an electrical field across a separation channel this technique is capable of gently separating particles based on their electrophoretic mobilities with high separation efficiency under mild conditions giddings 1993 in elfff separation occurs in an open channel without a stationary phase avoiding unwanted interaction between the target and the stationary phase which is inevitable in liquid chromatography moreover the cross section of the elfff separation channel is much larger than the narrow capillary used in capillary electrophoresis srinivas et al 2010 liu et al 2015 allowing for the processing of higher sample volumes e g several ml and the collection of fractions during eifff runs for utilization in secondary analysis techniques standard elfff usually uses a constant direct current dc voltage lower than 1 7 v to avoid significant electrolysis and bubbles gale et al 1998 elfff is therefore much safer than capillary electrophoresis which uses a voltage of several dozen kv to further improve the effective electrical field used in standard elfff gale s group developed a cyclical elfff cyelfff strategy based on both theory and experimental results they used a standard elfff channel in which alternating current ac voltages of up to 8 v peak to peak were used to produce much stronger cyclical electrical fields demonstrating excellent separation ability for colloidal particles gale and srinivas 2005 kantak et al 2006 gigault et al 2011 next the same group introduced a biased cyclical electrical field to overcome the diffusion challenges associated with gold nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm further improving the applicability of cyelfff in the characterization of nanomaterials tasci et al 2013 of note in the biased cyclical elfff bcyelfff system the biased cyclical electrical field with high frequency effectively disrupts the formation of electrical double layer on the channel walls and thus inhibits water electrolysis and bubble formation so high voltages over 1 7 v can be used overall the specific characteristics of bcyelfff such as the excellent separation ability in an open channel under mild conditions safe operation with low voltage and the accurate collection of many eluted targets mean that it is a very promising technique for studying nom corona formation on agnp surfaces and isolating agnps with nom corona for further research in this work bcyelfff was used as a potential alternative method for the simultaneous separation and isolation of agnps with nom corona first we explored whether the developed bcyelfff ultraviolet visible uv vis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icpms bcyelfff uv vis icpms system was suitable for identifying differences in the surface charge of agnps by separating the same sized agnps with different coatings i e peg and pvp under optimized conditions the second hypothesis of this study was that the nom corona formation on the agnp surface would be tracked by the bcyelfff uv vis icpms system with high separation resolution and sensitivity under the optimized electrical conditions the mechanisms underlying nom corona formation on peg agnps and pvp agnps would be elucidated based on the changes in their elution times the third hypothesis was that the agnps with nom corona collected during their elution time in repeated bcyelfff runs would have different ecotoxicological activity compared with agnps without nom corona by comparing the survival rates of e coli 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals stock solutions of different agnps peg agnps and pvp agnps with a concentration of 0 02 mg ml and a nominal size of 40 nm were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis missouri usa and their main properties were given in table 1 suwannee river nom srnom was obtained from the international humic substance society st paul minnesota usa and a stock solution was prepared by adding the srnom powder into ultrapure water 18 3 mω milli q gradient system millipore bedford massachusetts usa followed by stirring and filtering the resulting suspension as described in our previous studies yin et al 2015 shen et al 2015 the final concentration of the nom stock solution was 380 mg l c as quantified by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan all the stock solutions were stored in brown glass vials in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to use the ultrapure water was used to prepare aqueous solutions throughout the entire study including the carrier liquid in the bcyelfff system 2 2 instrumentation and operation fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the on line coupled bcyelfff uv vis icpms system this system was mainly composed of three modules including the sample introduction separation and detection modules in the sample introduction module a high pressure liquid chromatography pump 1260 agilent california usa was used to deliver the carrier liquid ultrapure water with a set flow rate through an injection valve with a 100 μl injection loop 7725i rheodyne california usa and deliver the samples to the separation module the separation module consisted of a bcyelfff channel and ac dc power supplies to apply ac dc voltage across the bcyelfff channel the bcyelfff channel was a crucial part of the separation module the structure of the bcyelfff channel was similar to that used in previous studies tasci et al 2013 petersen et al 2018 briefly a spacer with a ribbon like structure and trapezoidal ends tip to tip length 28 0 cm initial breadth 2 0 cm final breadth 1 0 cm and thickness 190 μm was sandwiched between parallel rectangular graphite plates serving both as electrodes and as channel walls the electrical field across the channel was generated by a dc power supply e3642a keysight california usa for dc voltage and a waveform generator 33500b series keysight california usa for ac voltage the detection module consisted of a uv vis spectrometer 1200 series agilent technologies palo alto california usa and an icpms system 7700 agilent technologies palo alto california usa for accurate quantification of ag species table s1 summarizes the quality assurance quality control data for icpms including calibration materials e g agnps rm 8017 obtained from the national institute of standards and technology gaithersburg md usa detection limits at μg l level and the satisfactory reproducibility with relative standard deviations less than 4 and recoveries in the range of 88 4 83 9 etc in the supplementary materials other than a commercial concentric nebulizer micromist glass expansion pty ltd victoria australia usa used for sample injection for icpms all the modules were connected by peek tubing 0 25 mm 1 58 mm i d o d upchurch scientific washington usa a typical bcyelfff run was divided into three steps sample injection relaxation and elution during sample injection the sample was delivered by the carrier liquid ultrapure water from the injection valve to the inlet of the bcyelfff channel at a flow rate of 0 25 ml min for 0 7 min next the flow rate was reduced to 0 ml min and the dc power supply was turned on to trigger the relaxation step during the relaxation step an equilibrium distribution of the sample was established in the channel due to the effects of brownian motion diffusion and the dc field on the agnps after 1 min relaxation the elution step was performed as follows the flow rate was increased to 0 25 ml min the dc power supply 1 0 v was turned off and the ac power supply generated by the waveform generator was turned on to provide square wave voltage at a set amplitude frequency and duty cycle normally the electrophoretic mobility of agnps in bcyelfff strictly determines their elution order and particles with low electrophoretic mobility elute the separation channel faster than the particles with high electrophoretic mobility after separation the eluted agnps were transferred into the uv vis spectrometer 410 nm and icpms 107ag for identification and quantification after each run the ac power supply was turned off to clean the residual agnps and other co existing substances that may have adhered to the channel wall a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk equipped with a he ne laser 633 nm at an angle of 173 was used to obtain the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic mobility values of peg agnps or pvp agnps subject to incubation with or without nom a high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jem 2100f jeol co ltd japan coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds jemarm200f jeol co ltd japan operated at 200 kv was used to determine the morphologies and elements of the agnps with nom corona the hrtem samples were prepared by evaporation of solutions onto an ultrathin carbon coated copper grid in a vacuum at room temperature as described in our previous studies yin et al 2015 tan et al 2017 all the instruments used in this work were operated referring to the manufacturer s guidelines 2 3 effect of nom concentration on the environmental corona formation on agnps with different coating agents concentrations of nom varying from 0 to 50 mg l were chosen to study their effects on the environmental corona formation on the peg agnps or pvp agnp surfaces at 50 μg l of note a high concentration of peg agnps or pvp agnps i e 10 mg l was used for accurate off line characterization by the zetasizer nano zs and hrtem instruments the initial mixture solutions of agnps incubated with or without nom were adjusted to ph 7 0 using 0 01 m hydrochloric acid or 0 01 m sodium hydroxide solution and these ph adjusted solutions were stored in 1 5 ml amber glass vials cat no 5182 0717 agilent california usa with polypropylene screw caps the vials were placed on a horizontal rotator and shaken at 150 rpm and room temperature overnight all incubation experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility after overnight incubation the vials were vortexed using an ika vortex 3 ika germany and the samples in these vials were directly extracted by a 100 μl injection syringe and immediately analyzed by the bcyelfff uv vis icpms system 2 4 ecotoxicological risk of agnps with nom corona against e coli e coli was chosen as the model bacteria to assess the effect of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological risk of agnps e coli on agar slant was washed by sterilized phosphate buffer solution pbs 0 03 m to prepare a stock solution 5 105 4 5 106 cfu ml after being cultured in lb culture medium at 37 c for 24 h the whole procedure was performed according to the standard test methods for evaluation of the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product iso 11 930 2012 in preliminary experiments 0 1 mm sodium sulfide na2s was selected as the neutralizing agent to neutralize the ecotoxicological activity of agnps without inhibiting the test e coli in the culture process and 20 mg l agnps were chosen given that agnps at mg l level have been reported to show significant antibacterial activity against e coli choi et al 2008 four test groups were prepared as follows 1 5 0 ml 0 1 mm na2s and 0 1 ml stock solution of e coli 2 0 5 ml 20 mg l agnps 4 5 ml 0 1 mm na2s and 0 1 ml stock solution of e coli 3 5 0 ml 0 03 m pbs buffer solution and 0 1 ml stock solution of e coli and 4 1 0 ml 0 03 m pbs buffer solution and 1 0 ml 0 1 mm na2s after incubation at 37 c for 48 h the bacterial growth in groups 1 2 and 3 was similar but there was no bacterial growth in group 4 demonstrating the high neutralizing efficacy of 0 1 mm na2s before the ecotoxicological risk tests 0 5 and 50 mg l nom concentrations were used to obtain peg agnps or pvp agnps with different nom corona thicknesses and incubated as previously described in view of the sample volume needed to assess the ecotoxicological activity of the agnps 16 ml agnps with or without nom corona were collected during their elution times in eight repeated bcyelfff uv vis icpms runs then 5 ml of each collected sample was mixed with 0 1 ml e coli stock solution in sterilized tubes for incubation after 1 min 0 5 ml of this mixture and 4 5 ml 0 1 mm na2s were added to another sterilized tube as the positive control 0 03 m pbs buffer solution was used in parallel with the test samples one ml of the test or control solution was added to sterilized plates each assay was performed in triplicate finally the number of colonies was counted after incubation at 37 c for 48 h the survival rate was calculated using the equation a 1 a 0 100 where a 0 and a 1 are the colony forming units of the positive control and test groups respectively 2 5 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted at least three times under the same conditions and their data were expressed as the mean standard deviation for three independent experiments unless otherwise noted the statistical significance level was set at p 0 05 using t test statistics 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of bcyelfff electrical parameters to improve the separation efficiency of nps smaller than 50 nm the combination of dc and ac electrical fields was applied perpendicularly to the separation channel according to the method developed by tasci et al 2013 based on the parameters reported in previous studies tasci et al 2013 petersen et al 2018 ornthai et al 2016 the dc field was generated by setting the dc power supply at 1 v for 1 min during the stopped flow sample relaxation in the present study in preliminary experiments it was determined that the elution time of peg agnps i e 9 3 0 3 min was slightly shorter than that of pvp agnps i e 11 3 0 2 min this was mainly due to the slight difference in their zeta potentials i e ca 12 1 mv for peg agnps and ca 20 5 mv for pvp agnps at ph 7 0 and nearly identical hydrodynamic diameters i e ca 67 0 nm for peg agnps and ca 72 2 nm for pvp agnps with a polydispersity index of less than 0 25 as shown in table 1 therefore individual peg agnps and pvp agnps were used to evaluate the effects of the main operating parameters of the ac power supply instead of a mixture of both agnps the ac power supply operating parameters included the amplitude frequency and duty cycle of square wave voltages and the effects of these parameters on the retention recovery and separation resolution of peg agnps and pvp agnps were investigated by evaluating changes in the retention ratio r and peak area pa recorded by icpms the r values were defined as the ratio between the void peak retention time t 0 and the agnps peak retention time t r tasci et al 2013 shiri et al 2020 the integration of pa was performed by originpro 8 5 the resolution of separation rs was calculated using the following equation r s t r 2 t r 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 where t r1 and t r2 are the retention times of the peaks of peg agnps and pvp agnps respectively and σ1 and σ2 are the standard deviations of their corresponding peaks the voltage amplitude controlled the applied electrical field across the separation channel the effect of voltage amplitude on the retention of agnps was investigated in the range of 1 0 5 0 v with the frequency and duty cycle set at 1 0 hz and 80 respectively fig s1a and fig s1b respectively present the representative icpms fractograms of peg agnps and pvp agnps obtained at voltage amplitudes varying from 1 0 to 4 0 v for voltage amplitudes higher than 4 0 v the peak heights of the peg agnps and pvp agnps became much smaller and the peaks became significantly wider data not shown thus the accurate integration of the eluted agnps peaks was very difficult for voltage amplitudes higher than 4 0 v simultaneously the baseline signal of the uv vis detector became unstable which was probably due to the small bubbles generated during the electrolysis of the water at higher voltages gigault et al 2011 fig 2 a shows that there was a significant decrease in the r values of both pvp agnps and peg agnps at higher voltage amplitudes indicating that their retention in the separation channel increased with increasing voltage amplitude moreover the r values of pvp agnps were always smaller than those of peg agnps correspondingly pvp agnps and peg agnps achieved their maximum pa values at an amplitude voltage of 2 5 v fig s2a the significant decrease in pa values at higher amplitude voltages was potentially due to the irreversible adsorption of agnps onto the separation channel surface johann et al 2015 this was demonstrated by the small peak shown in fig s1 at a voltage of 4 0 v after turning off the ac power supply thus the amplitude voltage of 2 5 v which led to the highest rs value of 0 82 was used in subsequent experiments the frequency of the ac power supply is another important parameter determining the retention of the target in the bcyelfff channel herein the retention of peg agnps and pvp agnps was studied using the frequency in the range of 0 5 to 5 hz with a voltage amplitude and a duty cycle of 2 5 v and 80 respectively the r values shown in fig 2b decreased with increasing frequency from 0 5 to 2 hz indicating that the agnps follow the separation mode denoted mode i gale and srinivas 2005 in which the target oscillated back and forth between the accumulation wall and the middle of the separation channel according to the ac voltage cycle fig s2b shows that the frequency did not significantly influence the recovery which was consistent with the previous findings tasci et al 2013 notably frequencies of 2 hz and above led to the broadening and splitting of both the peg agnps and pvp agnps peaks as shown in fig s3 due most likely to the increased effective electrical fields at high frequencies tasci et al 2013 therefore a frequency of 1 0 hz was used in the following experiments using duty cycles greater than 50 in bcyelfff has been found to effectively overcome the diffusion induced limitation of the separation of nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm tasci et al 2013 petersen et al 2018 fig s4a shows that nearly no separation was observed for a duty cycle of 50 similar to the reported behavior of gold nanoparticles with diameters below 50 nm tasci et al 2013 as shown in fig s4b the r s values varied in the range of 1 25 1 29 as the duty cycle increased from 70 to 90 these values were significantly higher than the r s values of 1 01 achieved with a duty cycle of 60 thus a duty cycle of 80 was selected for the following experiments in summary the optimized ac parameters after the relaxation were as follows a voltage amplitude of 2 5 v a frequency of 1 0 hz and a duty cycle of 80 in particular the satisfactory rs values of the nearly identically sized peg agnps and pvp agnps which only had a slight difference in the zeta potential demonstrate the utility of bcyelfff uv vis icpms in identifying minor changes in surface charge these findings demonstrate the great potential of this developed method for characterizing the nom corona on agnp surfaces and playing a key role in the modulation of their surface properties and subsequent ecotoxicological activity 3 2 tracking nom corona formation on peg agnps and pvp agnps soluble srnom is often used as a model nom to mimic environmental coatings due to its higher solubility in solutions with medium and higher ph values caused by abundant acidic functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups tan et al 2019 thus keeping in mind that the average concentration range of nom in natural surface waters is no more than 50 mg l tan et al 2017 we studied the effect of nom concentrations of 0 2 10 20 and 50 mg l on the environmental corona formation on the peg agnps and pvp agnps both at the concentration of 50 μg l the icpms fractograms in fig 3 a show that the elution time of the peg agnps clearly increased with increasing nom concentration in contrast the elution time of the pvp agnps shown in fig 3b remained unchanged at lower nom concentrations and then slowly increased with increasing higher nom concentrations this suggests a difference between the interactions of nom with the peg and pvp coatings uv vis fractograms of the mixture of pvp agnps and nom shown in fig s5 demonstrate that the free nom molecules eluted at 6 min and this elution peak increased in intensity with increasing nom concentration however it was very difficult to discern the agnps peak because of the low sensitivity of uv vis detector making it impossible to collect the agnps with nom corona structures for further off line characterization given that only agnps with nom corona or pristine agnps if any were collected within their elution time the interference of unbound nom molecules was effectively eliminated in dynamic light scattering dls characterization using a zetasizer nano zs due to the limited sensitivity of dls 100 μl of peg agnps or pvp agnps both at a concentration of 10 mg l was injected for accurate collection for off line characterization as shown in fig s6 the dls results show that the hydrodynamic sizes of the collected peg agnps and pvp agnps were nearly unchanged with increasing nom concentration up to 20 mg l interestingly fig 3c shows that the absolute values of the electrophoretic mobility of peg agnps significantly increased in line with the increase in their elution time while those of pvp agnps slowly increased with increasing nom concentration these findings indicated that the changes in the elution times of peg agnps and pvp agnps were mainly dependent on their variation in electrophoretic mobility generally the binding of peg and pvp molecules to agnp surfaces is caused by the s and n containing groups forming s ag and n ag strong coordinate covalent bonds respectively nom molecules have been reported to directly interact with and or diffuse through pvp coatings instead of replacing pvp molecules baalousha et al 2022 nom contains a broad spectrum of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components and is negatively charged at neutral ph tan et al 2019 pvp is an uncharged polymer but the amide group in its pyrrolidone subunit is much more negatively charged and favors the dissolution of pvp the ring and polyvinyl domains of pvp molecules have been found to interact with nom lau et al 2013 with increasing nom concentration nom molecules will gradually diffuse onto areas of the agnp surface unoccupied by pvp leading to an increase in electrophoretic mobility moreover same sized agnps coated with pvp and nom or its fraction e g humic acid have been reported to have comparable zeta potentials wang et al 2018 leading to a slow change in the electrophoretic mobility of pvp agnps incubated with increasing concentrations of nom considering the comparable binding energies of peg agnps and pvp agnps 373 ev for both coated agnps nguyen et al 2018 it is safe to conclude that the nom corona on the peg agnp surface was also formed by interaction with and or diffusion through the peg coating peg is rich in hydroxyl groups and readily interacts with nom rich in oxygen containing functional groups through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects leading to the accumulation of nom onto the peg coating and subsequent diffusion onto the agnp surface therefore the absolute electrophoretic mobility of peg agnps markedly increased with increasing nom concentration as shown in fig 3c a significant increase in hydrodynamic size was observed for a nom concentration of 50 mg l compared to the agnps obtained without nom incubation as verified by the corona observed in the corresponding hrtem images fig 3d moreover we took hrtem eds images of the pvp agnps and peg agnps incubated with nom samples fig 4 and pristine pvp agnp and peg agnp samples fig s7 and tried to analyze element distribution in these two types of agnps with nom corona the elemental mapping images of nom peg agnps show that the weight percent value of n element increase to around 5 which was significantly higher than that of pristine peg agnps 0 similarly the weight percent value of s element in nom pvp agnps eds images is 8 74 which is up to three times higher than that of pristine pvp agnps 2 89 both of these findings suggest that the nom molecules have adsorbed on agnp surface to form corona in addition gaussian 16 as the calculation software was used to optimize the geometry and calculate the binding energy using the density functional theory b3lyp method with lanl2dz basis set for silver atoms and 6 311g d p basis sets for other atoms tavakol 2017 fig s8 presents the optimized structures of peg ag and pvp ag complexes the binding energies of peg monomer and pvp monomer on agnp surface were calculated to be 23 68 ev and 23 78 ev which were comparable to that of carboxylic and phenolic groups dominant in nom molecules on agnp surface 23 64 ev and 23 67 ev these calculated results confirmed that nom molecules could directly adsorb on agnp surface unoccupied peg and or molecules by instead of replacing them due to their comparable high binding energies this finding is meaningful to elucidate the different mechanism underlying nom corona formation on peg agnp and pvp agnp surfaces from that on the cit agnp surface the formation of nom corona on the surfaces of peg agnps and pvp agnps at environmentally relevant concentrations has remained unexploited so far partly due to the unavailability of effective analytical methods herein the excellent separation ability of bcyelfff demonstrates its applicability for identifying minor changes in the coating composition of agnps which can be sensitively detected by icpms moreover the agnps with corona can be effectively collected during their elution time in bcyelfff runs for accurate characterization by other techniques and for further assessment of their ecotoxicological activity 3 3 effect of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological activity of agnps in addition to the high separation resolution of the bcyelfff method this technique also had the advantage of capably separating large sample volumes as high as several ml superior to the sample volumes of capillary electrophoresis usually at the nl level srinivas et al 2010 liu et al 2015 this advantage facilitates the collection of fractionated agnps with nom corona and the elimination of interference from free nom and ionic ag species such as ag beneficial for accurately assessing the ecotoxicological activity of agnps with nom corona fig 5 a shows the uv vis fractograms of peg agnps and pvp agnps both at 2 mg l after incubation with nom concentrations of 0 5 and 50 mg l notably the r and rs values of peg agnps and pvp agnps significantly decreased with increasing nom concentration mainly due to the sample overloading effect in elfff tri et al 2000 due to the sample volume needed for achieving good repeatability in ecotoxicological activity tests a collection of 8 runs operated at the optimized bcyelfff conditions was performed within the elution time of the agnps species the ecotoxicological activity of peg agnps or pvp agnps incubated with or without nom was investigated by exposing e coli to the collected agnps species at a concentration of ca 1 mg l ag it was observed that the effects of both peg agnps and pvp agnps on the growth of e coli were noticeably dependent on the concentration of incubated nom fig 5b compared with pvp the peg coating exhibited better biocompatibility and nontoxicity na et al 2012 therefore as expected the ecotoxicological activity of peg agnps was lower than that of pvp agnps remarkably there was a significant decrease in the ecotoxicological activity of both peg agnps and pvp agnps in the presence of nom especially at the high nom concentration specifically the survival rate of e coli exposed to peg agnps and pvp agnps after incubation with 50 mg l nom increased to ca 88 3 and ca 83 5 compared to 62 8 for peg agnps and 58 1 for pvp agnps without nom incubation thus nom corona led to reduced ecotoxicological activity interestingly this trend was in line with the changes in their electrophoretic mobility displayed in fig 3c the ionic ag species and unbound nom were not collected during the bcyelfff runs so the improved survival rate of e coli was mainly due to nom corona formation on the agnp surfaces in view of the fact that the e coli were negatively charged in the lb culture medium the ecotoxicological activity of agnps was closely associated with the electrostatic repulsion of agnps with e coli and the steric hindrance effect which became dominant at 50 mg l nom sondi et al 2004 levard et al 2013 although the reduced ecotoxicological activity of agnps in the presence of nom has been extensively investigated xu et al 2020 the role of nom corona remains an open question this is mainly due to the difficulty of separating agnps with nom corona from coexisting ionic ag species such as ag or their complexes with nom the bcyelfff system provides a powerful and gentle sample pretreatment technique to selectively isolate and nondestructively collect agnps with nom corona in large quantities beneficial for enabling a deep understanding of the effects of the changes in the surface morphology of agnps on their ecotoxicological risk in aquatic ecosystems it should be noted that we here just concentrated on the effect of nom corona formation on the ecotoxicological activity of agnps given that several well defined mechanisms underlying the toxicity of agnps have been proposed in vitro or in vivo in toxicological tests beer et al 2012 which mechanism is dominant in these effects requires more comprehensive studies in the future by characterizing the cell structure of e coli exposed to agnps with nom corona using electron microscopy zhao et al 2013 and confocal laser scanning microscopy haase et al 2012 kasemets et al 2019 and determining reactive oxygen species levels in e coli using electron spin resonance spectroscopy kim et al 2007 etc 4 conclusions nom corona formation leads to the formation of a new identity for pristine nanoparticles altering their environmental behavior fate and biological effects to the best of our knowledge the difference in formation ability of nom corona on the same sized agnps with different coatings at environmentally relevant concentrations was for the first time visually demonstrated owing to the excellent separation ability of bcyelfff and the high sensitivity of icpms our results showed that the corona thickness on peg agnps and pvp agnps gradually increased with increasing nom concentration based on the increase in the elution times of the agnps with nom corona although this finding was consistent with the results obtained using the widely used dls technique the interference of free nom molecules was effectively avoided due to their pre elution before the elution of agnps species interestingly the change in the elution time of peg agnps was larger than that of pvp agnps although there was a negligible difference in their hydrodynamic size the behavior observed here further expands our understanding of the role of nanoparticle coatings on the environmental corona formation in real environmental systems as well as biological systems furthermore nom corona was found to significantly improve the survival rate of e coli which was mainly due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion forces and steric hindrance effect between the agnps with nom corona and bacterial membranes this was achieved by testing the agnps collected during the bcyelfff runs which meant that the interference of ag and unbound nom was avoided moreover these findings confirm the determinant role of particulate ag species in the ecotoxicological activity of agnps beneficial for resolving the ongoing controversy about the biological effect of agnps overall the bcyelfff method developed herein provides a powerful tool for monitoring minor changes in the surface of agnps and the effective pretreatment and isolation of agnps species from complex media one limitation of this study is that nom and agnp concentrations used were above real concentrations measured in most natural waters owing to the relatively low sensitivity of icpms future studies should consider using higher sensitive detectors e g single particle icpms which are critical for extending the findings to natural waters moreover this work can be definitely extended to other nanoparticles the information reported in this work enhances our understanding of the environmental behavior and biological impacts of nanoparticles released in the environment and it is expected to be beneficial for improving public awareness and reducing public concern about nanoparticles and their products

15292,climate change has catalyzed the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes and threatens water security in most studies the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in lakes were evaluated using field collected data from multiple indicators or spatially continuous data from one cyanobacteria related indicator nevertheless the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has clear spatial heterogeneity and is affected by numerous factors therefore we developed a multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in lakes using five spatially continuous datasets to estimate the risk level of cyanobacterial blooms at the pixel scale 250 m the spatial and temporal variations in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels from may 1 2002 to october 31 2020 were investigated for three typical eutrophic lakes in china lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi seasons and regions of high cyanobacterial bloom risk were identified for each lake environmental characteristics were discussed a long term investigation revealed that owing to its warm climate the cyanobacterial risk levels in summer and autumn were much higher than those in the other two seasons at the synoptic scale lake taihu had a lower cyanobacterial bloom risk than lakes chaohu and dianchi a further comparison found that precipitation wind speed and temperature were responsible for the differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels among the three lakes at the pixel scale the risk map indicated that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lake taihu were unevenly distributed and the cyanobacterial bloom risk of the lakeshore was higher than that of the other subregions nutrient levels played the most critical role in the regional differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in a lake while the differences of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three lakes were resulted by the climates bloom events were defined and classified as long term bloom or flash bloom according to their duration over or below a year overall this study can assist in advanced water management with a pixel scale evaluation of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacterial blooms eutrophic lakes risk assessment water management data availability the data supporting the findings of this research are available within the article and its supplementary materials 1 introduction the trophic state reflects the health level of a lake hu et al 2022 wang et al 2018 high nutrient levels are favorable for the growth of cyanobacteria and are likely to induce an excessive accumulation of cyanobacterial biomass tanvir et al 2021 yang et al 2021 nutrient enrichment eventually triggers harmful blooms under suitable meteorological conditions the accumulated cyanobacteria cells aggregate to the water surface in a short time and form dense blooms causing visible discoloration of the water huisman et al 2018 these intensive blooms pose a major risk to water security such as increasing turbidity choking the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation and producing toxicity in the water lin et al 2021 shi et al 2018 su et al 2017 as a result it threatens the safety of drinking water and affects the normal lives of the surrounding residents chen et al 2020 duan et al 2017 xu et al 2016 here the term blooms refers to the surface scums of cyanobacteria or the aggregation of cyanobacteria near the water surface due to recent climate change cyanobacterial blooms have become widespread in eutrophic freshwater lakes ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 qin et al 2021 which has aggravated the deterioration of water quality and destruction of water ecology globally thus requires an advanced risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic freshwater lakes chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a to guide water resource management xu et al 2021b most studies have estimated cyanobacterial bloom risk levels using field collected data from multiple indicators related to blooms or only one spatially continuous cyanobacterial product chen et al 2020 huang et al 2020 nevertheless the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has clear spatial heterogeneity and is affected by various factors qi et al 2018 wang et al 2022 therefore the cyanobacterial bloom risk assessment should focus on a finer scale and integrate the possible risk induced by multiple factors janssen 2019 as a low cost and high efficiency method satellite remote sensing technology provides large scale long term observations over a specific site kutser 2009 kutser et al 2006 shi et al 2019 numerous satellite sensors have been used to estimate the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes kim et al 2020 mu et al 2021 for example the floating algae index fai has been applied to detect blooms the fai can be calculated using various satellite data such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis geostationary ocean color imager goci and himawari 8 chen et al 2019 hu 2009 qi et al 2018 these satellite based cyanobacterial products have achieved large scale detection of cyanobacterial blooms at a finer scale li et al 2022 rousso et al 2020 reanalysis datasets such as era5 land data provide accurate descriptions of the climate such as precipitation wind speed and temperature of the past from local to global scales and have been adopted in disaster monitoring huang et al 2021 huang et al 2022a huang et al 2022b meanwhile most remotely sensed and reanalysis data were freely available thus it provides a rare opportunity for us to conduct a pixel scale risk assessment for cyanobacterial blooms in a lake this evaluation considers the possibility of multiple factors triggering blooms the primary objectives of this study are as follows 1 design a risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes where the cyanobacterial bloom risk is quantified with four environmental variables and one cyanobacterial variable 2 estimate the pixel scale cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three typical eutrophic lakes in china from january 2002 to october 2020 based on the risk assessment framework developed here and 3 identify the seasons and regions of high bloom risk for each lake and discuss its climate response specific advice was provided to assist in advanced cyanobacteria centered water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi are three large shallow and eutrophic lakes in the yangtze river basin of china and close to densely populated areas fig 1 they are key water sources for surrounding cities and have diverse functions such as drinking water supply agricultural irrigation tourism and recreation however these three lakes have experienced frequent cyanobacterial blooms this poses a major risk to water security and affects the normal life of the surrounding residents thus to assist in water resource management a risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi is necessary 2 2 data acquisition and preprocessing as listed in table 1 the datasets include

to evaluate the pixel scale risk level of cyanobacterial blooms which is defined as the cyanobacterial bloom risk index r i s k i fig 2 it covers five important factors namely risk indicators related to blooms including the bloom area c i trophic state t s i i land surface temperature l s t i wind speed w s i and precipitation p r e i qin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c based on the cyanobacteria knowledge du et al 2017 ma et al 2021 rousso et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 formulas of risk indicators were defined using empirical thresholds to evaluate the possibility of triggering blooms different thresholds of fai fai th lake were used to identify the intense blooming pixels fai fai th lake 100 scum and no bloom pixels fai fai th lake 0 scum in the three lakes hu 2009 hu et al 2010 the superscript of fai th lake indicates the lake the subscript indicates the threshold according to previous studies fai 0 004 taihu cao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a fai 0 0006 chaohu hu et al 2021 li et al 2020 and fai 0 dianchi jing et al 2019 mu et al 2021 were used to identify intense blooming or no bloom pixels in the three lakes in lake taihu pixels with high concentrations of suspended solids fai 0 01 and pixels with dense algal scum fai 0 002 were excluded before identification using fai 0 004 taihu the synthetic indicator tsi combines one or more water quality parameters and indirectly reflects lake eutrophication status over a longer time scale carlson 1977 in this study seasonal tsi products were used to depict lake eutrophication status lake trophic states were classified as oligotrophic 0 tsi 30 mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 and eutrophic 50 tsi 100 previous studies have revealed that high nutrient levels may trigger cyanobacterial blooms chen et al 2020 xu et al 2021a referring to the world health organization guidelines 2003 our risk assessment framework measured this risk using a tsi threshold of 30 to distinguish the trophic states below or over mesotrophic prior knowledge of cyanobacterial blooms indicates that moderately high temperatures gentle breezes and no or light rain provide suitable meteorological conditions for cyanobacterial blooms baig et al 2016 huang et al 2013 li and qin 2019 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 to develop our risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms the thresholds of temperature 25 c lst 30 c wind speed ws 3 m s and precipitation 0 mm pre 10 mm for risk identification finally the cyanobacterial bloom risk level was evaluated pixel by pixel using the formulas of the five variables related to the blooms defined in fig 2 explanations on how to match spatial information to achieve pixel scale calculations are provided in the supplementary material text s2 and fig s1 3 results 3 1 environmental condition in three lakes to evaluate and compare the environmental characteristics of the three lakes the long term averages of five environmental variables temperature wind speed precipitation trophic state and turbidity were calculated from 2002 to 2020 table 2 their data distributions are shown fig 3 the long term mean values found minor differences in precipitation among three lakes ranging from 2 73 3 36 mm however the precipitation intensity on rainy days 0 mm in lake chaohu 10 83 mm was higher than that in lakes taihu 9 12 mm and dianchi 9 08 mm according to baig et al 2016 strong rainfall 10 0 mm temporarily disrupts the bloom thus occasional strong rainfalls in lake chaohu may inhibit the aggregation of cyanobacteria to form scum on the surface of the water compared with the other two lakes the warmer climate in lake taihu was conducive to the growth of cyanobacteria in addition the wind speed in lake taihu was higher than that in lakes chaohu and dianchi the strong winds 3 5 m s may have resulted in cyanobacteria cells being hard to gather in the water wang et al 2022 however a moderate disturbance caused by a breeze accelerates the vertical migration of cyanobacteria to the water surface and forms scum hence the overall lower wind speeds in lakes chaohu and dianchi may have resulted in frequent cyanobacterial blooms the three lakes attained eutrophic levels the tsi of the three lakes ranged from 60 1 73 6 the turbidity of lake dianchi was lower than that of the other two lakes the means of the five seasonal environmental variables were calculated for each lake from 2002 to 2020 fig 4 in the three lakes the curves of each environmental variable almost overlapped except for wind speed the wind speed curves had similar shapes although their sizes were different fig 4 b consistent with the long term results the mean of the seasonal wind speeds in lake taihu was significantly higher than that of the other two lakes in all seasons the number days that may promote the formation of cyanobacterial blooms was counted for each lake fig 5 identified by the conditions of precipitation 0 10 mm wind speed 3 m s temperature 25 30 c and tsi 30 the statistical results of the three lakes showed that over 80 of the cases had suitable precipitation conditions that may trigger cyanobacterial blooms in a lake in addition the proportion of cases with suitable wind speed conditions that may trigger blooms in lake dianchi was higher than that in lakes taihu and dianchi particularly in spring and autumn close to 80 cold weather in winter limited the formation of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes 3 2 cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes 3 2 1 temporal variations of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes at synoptic scale the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms was estimated for the three lakes using the fai products 2002 2020 their interannual variations are depicted in fig 6 the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes chaohu and dianchi displayed interannual variation whereas it was relatively stable in lake taihu boxplots were used to compare the intra annual distribution of the bloom areas in the three lakes the narrower boxplots indicate that intra annual variation in the bloom area was smaller in lake taihu these stable inter and intra annual variations in the bloom area revealed that there was a strong regularity in the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu in addition dates with the maximum area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms were identified for each year for the three lakes their corresponding months and seasons were marked fig 7 in lake taihu the maximum bloom area occurred primarily in spring and winter marked with green and gray the maximum bloom areas of lakes chaohu and dianchi often occurred in summer and autumn marked with orange and yellow respectively 3 2 2 seasonal occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes at pixel scale the seasonal occurrence frequencies of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes from 2002 to 2020 are shown in fig 8 lakes taihu and chaohu showed an uneven frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in summer autumn and winter in lake taihu the northern part of the lake often experiences cyanobacterial blooms in summer and autumn while the southern part of the lake often experiences cyanobacterial blooms in winter in lake chaohu two subregions with a high occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms were the southwest lakeshore in autumn and the eastern part of the lake in winter the cyanobacterial blooms in summer occurred in the northern lakeshore cyanobacterial blooms in lake dianchi often appear in summer and autumn their occurrence frequency is distributed evenly therefore a high occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes was observed in summer and autumn they exhibited typical spatial distribution patterns 3 3 spatiotemporal characteristics of cyanobacterial bloom risk 3 3 1 annual variation of cyanobacterial bloom risk at synoptic scale cyanobacterial bloom risk levels were estimated for the three lakes at the synoptic scale using the risk assessment framework developed here the inter annual variation and intra annual distribution are depicted in fig 9 cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the three lakes ranged from 0 1 to 0 35 the risk level of lake taihu remained in a stable range with minor variations and was lower than those of lake chaohu and lake dianchi fig 9 a in addition the cyanobacterial bloom risk level of lake dianchi was higher than that of lake chaohu except in 2012 and 2014 red boxes in fig 9 b therefore the cyanobacterial bloom risk level of lake taihu had stable inter and intra annual variations compared with the other two lakes 3 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of cyanobacterial bloom risk at pixel scale cyanobacterial bloom risk maps of the three lakes are depicted for five periods spring summer autumn winter and 2002 2020 based on the risk level estimated at the pixel scale fig 10 the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels differed among the subregions of lake taihu the risk levels of the lakeshore were higher than that of the central regions particularly in autumn fig 10 a the risk maps of lakes chaohu and dianchi indicated that different subregions had similar cyanobacterial bloom risk levels where the risk levels in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter fig 10 b c according to the seasonal means of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels table 3 the risk levels of the three lakes in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter 4 discussion 4 1 rationality of the risk assessment framework and its applications many studies have been conducted to evaluate the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes bai et al 2018 carvalho et al 2011 duan et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 shan et al 2019 however these studies used diverse methods parameter settings one or more variables spatial resolution at the pixel or synoptic scale and outcomes descriptive or quantitative results thus it is difficult to validate this framework directly two studies were conducted to assist in the validation and evaluation of this framework firstly the cyanobacterial bloom risk assessment results of huang et al 2020 were used as the reference data to validate this framework the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in the three lakes evaluated in this study were quantitatively compared with those evaluated by huang et al 2020 the linear regression in fig s7 indicates that these two risk assessment results have a significant positive relationship r 0 43 p value 0 0001 this illustrates that the risk assessment framework developed here accurately estimates cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in a lake secondly two cyanobacterial applications cyanolakes and cyan were compared overall cyanolakes performed better at the user interface functionality and information it provides product quality and update frequency and their products are available for lakes worldwide the supplementary material text s2 table s2 and figs s2 s5 shows the comparison details cyanolakes is a cyanobacteria monitoring tool and mainly includes two types of cyanobacteria products directly or indirectly derived from satellites for example the chlorophyll a concentration is directly estimated using satellite based algorithms such as the maximum peak height mph algorithm matthews and bernard 2015 matthews et al 2020 matthews and odermatt 2015 the risk level to human health from cyanobacteria was indirectly evaluated from the chlorophyll a concentration using the accepted world health organization guidelines for lakes therefore cyanolakes can provide recreational advice compared with this the multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms has advantages in cyanobacteria risk evaluation which was developed based on previous knowledge of bloom issues it covers five crucial factors related to cyanobacterial blooms pixel scale cyanobacterial bloom risk levels were estimated using defined formulas this framework objectively evaluates bloom risk more comprehensively and achieves a finer spatial resolution than similar studies carvalho et al 2011 duan et al 2017 huang et al 2020 shan et al 2019 however this framework aims to evaluate cyanobacterial risk thus the fai algorithm was selected to detect cyanobacterial blooms in a lake which is simple to calculate and widely applied in most lakes it is difficult to capture cyanobacterial details in a lake and needs to be combined with other cyanobacteria algorithms such as the mph algorithm fig s5 for example it can adopt the mph algorithm to detect cyanobacterial details after risk assessment fig s6 b and provide a primary evaluation of cyanobacteria health risk levels according to the mph derived chlorophyll a concentration before a risk assessment table s2 and fig s6 a bloom risk evaluation in a lake or among lakes can help address the questions of where when and what in bloom management for example in lake taihu the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the lakeshore were higher than those of the central regions especially in autumn the location and season of high bloom risk help answer the questions of where lakeshore and when autumn and have the highest demand for cyanobacterial monitoring regarding the question what it identifies what the key concerns are for synoptic scale and national scale bloom management our investigation found that nutrient level and climate such as precipitation wind speed and temperature are responsible for the bloom risk differences in a lake or among lakes respectively this implies that climate impacts should be taken into account when comparing the bloom risks among lakes for national scale management synoptic scale management may pay more attention to the nutrient level in a lake hence this framework can help guide regional and national water management and reduce health risks 4 2 seasonal migration path of cyanobacterial blooms during the year the seasonal migration paths of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes are summarized according to the seasonal occurrence frequency of the cyanobacterial blooms mapped in fig 8 it was observed that bloom events can occur at a much longer time scale and may even last over a year we considered the criteria to define a cyanobacterial bloom event and suggested classifying the bloom events as flash bloom and long term bloom according to their duration below or over a year based on bloom severity the evolutionary processes of cyanobacterial blooms can be divided into three phases latency development and recovery to understand the mentioned definitions we discussed the characteristics of long term bloom in three lakes based on the long term observations of the bloom area from 2002 to 2020 the evolutionary processes of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes were then identified on a seasonal scale according to their severity fig 11 measured by the area coverage of the cyanobacterial blooms the seasonal evolution processes of cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu were latency spring development summer autumn and winter and recovery spring which were latency spring summer development summer autumn and winter and recovery spring in lake chaohu and latency spring development summer and autumn and recovery winter and spring in lake dianchi these results illustrate that cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes are more likely to occur in warm climates duan et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2018 since summer and autumn are often identified as the development phase with frequent blooms hu et al 2021 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 4 3 cyanobacterial bloom risk in the three lakes the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lake taihu remained stable with minor inter and intra annual variations which were lower than those of lakes chaohu and dianchi fig 9 owing to the high nutrient levels in these three lakes climate plays a crucial role in the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms wang et al 2021 we further compared the environmental conditions of the three lakes and found that the climates of lakes chaohu and dianchi were more likely to trigger cyanobacterial blooms fig 5 this revealed that warm drizzle and breeze climates had the greatest possibility of triggering cyanobacterial blooms in lakes recent evidence attests to future global warming woolway et al 2021a woolway et al 2021b the subsequent increase in bloom risks threatens the water resource security ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 xu et al 2021a in the three lakes the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter and had evident spatial distribution patterns the risk maps indicated that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lakes chaohu and dianchi presented little difference among the subregions while there were regional differences in lake taihu in lake taihu the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the lakeshore were higher than those in the central regions this may be due to the nutrient level as the lakeshore is the most eutrophic region of lake taihu xu et al 2015 and has frequent cyanobacterial blooms under suitable climates overall it showed the highest bloom risk in summer and autumn the lakeshore was the subregion of lake taihu with the highest bloom risk 5 conclusion a multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes was developed based on prior knowledge of cyanobacteria comprising five factors related to cyanobacterial blooms cyanobacterial bloom risk levels were estimated for three eutrophic lakes lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi from 2002 to 2020 at the pixel scale 250 m in china the long term analysis suggested that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the three lakes in summer and autumn were higher than those in the other two seasons the risk level of lake taihu was lower than that of lakes chaohu and dianchi the risk map showed that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lake taihu varied among subregions with the lakeshore having a higher bloom risk than the central regions further comparisons revealed that the seasonal and regional differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of a lake were affected by climate and nutrient levels respectively and the climates played critical role in the differences of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three lakes cyanobacteria are more likely to aggregate at the water surface under warm drizzle and breeze climates this reveals increasing bloom risks in eutrophic lakes due to global warming according to the seasonal occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms mapped for the three lakes it was found that the bloom event can occur at a much longer time scale and may even last over a year it was thus suggested to classify the bloom events into flash bloom and long term bloom where its evolution processes could be divided into several phases based on the bloom severity such as latency development and recovery in addition the evolution processes of long term bloom in the three lakes were specified at the seasonal scale through the mapped seasonal occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms overall these findings specify the seasons and regions of high bloom risk where proactive risk management is required to ensure water security this can guide water resource management and reduce unnecessary expenses credit

15292,climate change has catalyzed the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes and threatens water security in most studies the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in lakes were evaluated using field collected data from multiple indicators or spatially continuous data from one cyanobacteria related indicator nevertheless the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has clear spatial heterogeneity and is affected by numerous factors therefore we developed a multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in lakes using five spatially continuous datasets to estimate the risk level of cyanobacterial blooms at the pixel scale 250 m the spatial and temporal variations in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels from may 1 2002 to october 31 2020 were investigated for three typical eutrophic lakes in china lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi seasons and regions of high cyanobacterial bloom risk were identified for each lake environmental characteristics were discussed a long term investigation revealed that owing to its warm climate the cyanobacterial risk levels in summer and autumn were much higher than those in the other two seasons at the synoptic scale lake taihu had a lower cyanobacterial bloom risk than lakes chaohu and dianchi a further comparison found that precipitation wind speed and temperature were responsible for the differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels among the three lakes at the pixel scale the risk map indicated that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lake taihu were unevenly distributed and the cyanobacterial bloom risk of the lakeshore was higher than that of the other subregions nutrient levels played the most critical role in the regional differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in a lake while the differences of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three lakes were resulted by the climates bloom events were defined and classified as long term bloom or flash bloom according to their duration over or below a year overall this study can assist in advanced water management with a pixel scale evaluation of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacterial blooms eutrophic lakes risk assessment water management data availability the data supporting the findings of this research are available within the article and its supplementary materials 1 introduction the trophic state reflects the health level of a lake hu et al 2022 wang et al 2018 high nutrient levels are favorable for the growth of cyanobacteria and are likely to induce an excessive accumulation of cyanobacterial biomass tanvir et al 2021 yang et al 2021 nutrient enrichment eventually triggers harmful blooms under suitable meteorological conditions the accumulated cyanobacteria cells aggregate to the water surface in a short time and form dense blooms causing visible discoloration of the water huisman et al 2018 these intensive blooms pose a major risk to water security such as increasing turbidity choking the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation and producing toxicity in the water lin et al 2021 shi et al 2018 su et al 2017 as a result it threatens the safety of drinking water and affects the normal lives of the surrounding residents chen et al 2020 duan et al 2017 xu et al 2016 here the term blooms refers to the surface scums of cyanobacteria or the aggregation of cyanobacteria near the water surface due to recent climate change cyanobacterial blooms have become widespread in eutrophic freshwater lakes ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 qin et al 2021 which has aggravated the deterioration of water quality and destruction of water ecology globally thus requires an advanced risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic freshwater lakes chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a to guide water resource management xu et al 2021b most studies have estimated cyanobacterial bloom risk levels using field collected data from multiple indicators related to blooms or only one spatially continuous cyanobacterial product chen et al 2020 huang et al 2020 nevertheless the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has clear spatial heterogeneity and is affected by various factors qi et al 2018 wang et al 2022 therefore the cyanobacterial bloom risk assessment should focus on a finer scale and integrate the possible risk induced by multiple factors janssen 2019 as a low cost and high efficiency method satellite remote sensing technology provides large scale long term observations over a specific site kutser 2009 kutser et al 2006 shi et al 2019 numerous satellite sensors have been used to estimate the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes kim et al 2020 mu et al 2021 for example the floating algae index fai has been applied to detect blooms the fai can be calculated using various satellite data such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis geostationary ocean color imager goci and himawari 8 chen et al 2019 hu 2009 qi et al 2018 these satellite based cyanobacterial products have achieved large scale detection of cyanobacterial blooms at a finer scale li et al 2022 rousso et al 2020 reanalysis datasets such as era5 land data provide accurate descriptions of the climate such as precipitation wind speed and temperature of the past from local to global scales and have been adopted in disaster monitoring huang et al 2021 huang et al 2022a huang et al 2022b meanwhile most remotely sensed and reanalysis data were freely available thus it provides a rare opportunity for us to conduct a pixel scale risk assessment for cyanobacterial blooms in a lake this evaluation considers the possibility of multiple factors triggering blooms the primary objectives of this study are as follows 1 design a risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes where the cyanobacterial bloom risk is quantified with four environmental variables and one cyanobacterial variable 2 estimate the pixel scale cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three typical eutrophic lakes in china from january 2002 to october 2020 based on the risk assessment framework developed here and 3 identify the seasons and regions of high bloom risk for each lake and discuss its climate response specific advice was provided to assist in advanced cyanobacteria centered water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi are three large shallow and eutrophic lakes in the yangtze river basin of china and close to densely populated areas fig 1 they are key water sources for surrounding cities and have diverse functions such as drinking water supply agricultural irrigation tourism and recreation however these three lakes have experienced frequent cyanobacterial blooms this poses a major risk to water security and affects the normal life of the surrounding residents thus to assist in water resource management a risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi is necessary 2 2 data acquisition and preprocessing as listed in table 1 the datasets include

to evaluate the pixel scale risk level of cyanobacterial blooms which is defined as the cyanobacterial bloom risk index r i s k i fig 2 it covers five important factors namely risk indicators related to blooms including the bloom area c i trophic state t s i i land surface temperature l s t i wind speed w s i and precipitation p r e i qin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021c based on the cyanobacteria knowledge du et al 2017 ma et al 2021 rousso et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 formulas of risk indicators were defined using empirical thresholds to evaluate the possibility of triggering blooms different thresholds of fai fai th lake were used to identify the intense blooming pixels fai fai th lake 100 scum and no bloom pixels fai fai th lake 0 scum in the three lakes hu 2009 hu et al 2010 the superscript of fai th lake indicates the lake the subscript indicates the threshold according to previous studies fai 0 004 taihu cao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a fai 0 0006 chaohu hu et al 2021 li et al 2020 and fai 0 dianchi jing et al 2019 mu et al 2021 were used to identify intense blooming or no bloom pixels in the three lakes in lake taihu pixels with high concentrations of suspended solids fai 0 01 and pixels with dense algal scum fai 0 002 were excluded before identification using fai 0 004 taihu the synthetic indicator tsi combines one or more water quality parameters and indirectly reflects lake eutrophication status over a longer time scale carlson 1977 in this study seasonal tsi products were used to depict lake eutrophication status lake trophic states were classified as oligotrophic 0 tsi 30 mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 and eutrophic 50 tsi 100 previous studies have revealed that high nutrient levels may trigger cyanobacterial blooms chen et al 2020 xu et al 2021a referring to the world health organization guidelines 2003 our risk assessment framework measured this risk using a tsi threshold of 30 to distinguish the trophic states below or over mesotrophic prior knowledge of cyanobacterial blooms indicates that moderately high temperatures gentle breezes and no or light rain provide suitable meteorological conditions for cyanobacterial blooms baig et al 2016 huang et al 2013 li and qin 2019 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 to develop our risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms the thresholds of temperature 25 c lst 30 c wind speed ws 3 m s and precipitation 0 mm pre 10 mm for risk identification finally the cyanobacterial bloom risk level was evaluated pixel by pixel using the formulas of the five variables related to the blooms defined in fig 2 explanations on how to match spatial information to achieve pixel scale calculations are provided in the supplementary material text s2 and fig s1 3 results 3 1 environmental condition in three lakes to evaluate and compare the environmental characteristics of the three lakes the long term averages of five environmental variables temperature wind speed precipitation trophic state and turbidity were calculated from 2002 to 2020 table 2 their data distributions are shown fig 3 the long term mean values found minor differences in precipitation among three lakes ranging from 2 73 3 36 mm however the precipitation intensity on rainy days 0 mm in lake chaohu 10 83 mm was higher than that in lakes taihu 9 12 mm and dianchi 9 08 mm according to baig et al 2016 strong rainfall 10 0 mm temporarily disrupts the bloom thus occasional strong rainfalls in lake chaohu may inhibit the aggregation of cyanobacteria to form scum on the surface of the water compared with the other two lakes the warmer climate in lake taihu was conducive to the growth of cyanobacteria in addition the wind speed in lake taihu was higher than that in lakes chaohu and dianchi the strong winds 3 5 m s may have resulted in cyanobacteria cells being hard to gather in the water wang et al 2022 however a moderate disturbance caused by a breeze accelerates the vertical migration of cyanobacteria to the water surface and forms scum hence the overall lower wind speeds in lakes chaohu and dianchi may have resulted in frequent cyanobacterial blooms the three lakes attained eutrophic levels the tsi of the three lakes ranged from 60 1 73 6 the turbidity of lake dianchi was lower than that of the other two lakes the means of the five seasonal environmental variables were calculated for each lake from 2002 to 2020 fig 4 in the three lakes the curves of each environmental variable almost overlapped except for wind speed the wind speed curves had similar shapes although their sizes were different fig 4 b consistent with the long term results the mean of the seasonal wind speeds in lake taihu was significantly higher than that of the other two lakes in all seasons the number days that may promote the formation of cyanobacterial blooms was counted for each lake fig 5 identified by the conditions of precipitation 0 10 mm wind speed 3 m s temperature 25 30 c and tsi 30 the statistical results of the three lakes showed that over 80 of the cases had suitable precipitation conditions that may trigger cyanobacterial blooms in a lake in addition the proportion of cases with suitable wind speed conditions that may trigger blooms in lake dianchi was higher than that in lakes taihu and dianchi particularly in spring and autumn close to 80 cold weather in winter limited the formation of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes 3 2 cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes 3 2 1 temporal variations of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes at synoptic scale the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms was estimated for the three lakes using the fai products 2002 2020 their interannual variations are depicted in fig 6 the area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes chaohu and dianchi displayed interannual variation whereas it was relatively stable in lake taihu boxplots were used to compare the intra annual distribution of the bloom areas in the three lakes the narrower boxplots indicate that intra annual variation in the bloom area was smaller in lake taihu these stable inter and intra annual variations in the bloom area revealed that there was a strong regularity in the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu in addition dates with the maximum area coverage of cyanobacterial blooms were identified for each year for the three lakes their corresponding months and seasons were marked fig 7 in lake taihu the maximum bloom area occurred primarily in spring and winter marked with green and gray the maximum bloom areas of lakes chaohu and dianchi often occurred in summer and autumn marked with orange and yellow respectively 3 2 2 seasonal occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes at pixel scale the seasonal occurrence frequencies of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes from 2002 to 2020 are shown in fig 8 lakes taihu and chaohu showed an uneven frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in summer autumn and winter in lake taihu the northern part of the lake often experiences cyanobacterial blooms in summer and autumn while the southern part of the lake often experiences cyanobacterial blooms in winter in lake chaohu two subregions with a high occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms were the southwest lakeshore in autumn and the eastern part of the lake in winter the cyanobacterial blooms in summer occurred in the northern lakeshore cyanobacterial blooms in lake dianchi often appear in summer and autumn their occurrence frequency is distributed evenly therefore a high occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes was observed in summer and autumn they exhibited typical spatial distribution patterns 3 3 spatiotemporal characteristics of cyanobacterial bloom risk 3 3 1 annual variation of cyanobacterial bloom risk at synoptic scale cyanobacterial bloom risk levels were estimated for the three lakes at the synoptic scale using the risk assessment framework developed here the inter annual variation and intra annual distribution are depicted in fig 9 cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the three lakes ranged from 0 1 to 0 35 the risk level of lake taihu remained in a stable range with minor variations and was lower than those of lake chaohu and lake dianchi fig 9 a in addition the cyanobacterial bloom risk level of lake dianchi was higher than that of lake chaohu except in 2012 and 2014 red boxes in fig 9 b therefore the cyanobacterial bloom risk level of lake taihu had stable inter and intra annual variations compared with the other two lakes 3 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of cyanobacterial bloom risk at pixel scale cyanobacterial bloom risk maps of the three lakes are depicted for five periods spring summer autumn winter and 2002 2020 based on the risk level estimated at the pixel scale fig 10 the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels differed among the subregions of lake taihu the risk levels of the lakeshore were higher than that of the central regions particularly in autumn fig 10 a the risk maps of lakes chaohu and dianchi indicated that different subregions had similar cyanobacterial bloom risk levels where the risk levels in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter fig 10 b c according to the seasonal means of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels table 3 the risk levels of the three lakes in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter 4 discussion 4 1 rationality of the risk assessment framework and its applications many studies have been conducted to evaluate the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes bai et al 2018 carvalho et al 2011 duan et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 shan et al 2019 however these studies used diverse methods parameter settings one or more variables spatial resolution at the pixel or synoptic scale and outcomes descriptive or quantitative results thus it is difficult to validate this framework directly two studies were conducted to assist in the validation and evaluation of this framework firstly the cyanobacterial bloom risk assessment results of huang et al 2020 were used as the reference data to validate this framework the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in the three lakes evaluated in this study were quantitatively compared with those evaluated by huang et al 2020 the linear regression in fig s7 indicates that these two risk assessment results have a significant positive relationship r 0 43 p value 0 0001 this illustrates that the risk assessment framework developed here accurately estimates cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in a lake secondly two cyanobacterial applications cyanolakes and cyan were compared overall cyanolakes performed better at the user interface functionality and information it provides product quality and update frequency and their products are available for lakes worldwide the supplementary material text s2 table s2 and figs s2 s5 shows the comparison details cyanolakes is a cyanobacteria monitoring tool and mainly includes two types of cyanobacteria products directly or indirectly derived from satellites for example the chlorophyll a concentration is directly estimated using satellite based algorithms such as the maximum peak height mph algorithm matthews and bernard 2015 matthews et al 2020 matthews and odermatt 2015 the risk level to human health from cyanobacteria was indirectly evaluated from the chlorophyll a concentration using the accepted world health organization guidelines for lakes therefore cyanolakes can provide recreational advice compared with this the multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms has advantages in cyanobacteria risk evaluation which was developed based on previous knowledge of bloom issues it covers five crucial factors related to cyanobacterial blooms pixel scale cyanobacterial bloom risk levels were estimated using defined formulas this framework objectively evaluates bloom risk more comprehensively and achieves a finer spatial resolution than similar studies carvalho et al 2011 duan et al 2017 huang et al 2020 shan et al 2019 however this framework aims to evaluate cyanobacterial risk thus the fai algorithm was selected to detect cyanobacterial blooms in a lake which is simple to calculate and widely applied in most lakes it is difficult to capture cyanobacterial details in a lake and needs to be combined with other cyanobacteria algorithms such as the mph algorithm fig s5 for example it can adopt the mph algorithm to detect cyanobacterial details after risk assessment fig s6 b and provide a primary evaluation of cyanobacteria health risk levels according to the mph derived chlorophyll a concentration before a risk assessment table s2 and fig s6 a bloom risk evaluation in a lake or among lakes can help address the questions of where when and what in bloom management for example in lake taihu the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the lakeshore were higher than those of the central regions especially in autumn the location and season of high bloom risk help answer the questions of where lakeshore and when autumn and have the highest demand for cyanobacterial monitoring regarding the question what it identifies what the key concerns are for synoptic scale and national scale bloom management our investigation found that nutrient level and climate such as precipitation wind speed and temperature are responsible for the bloom risk differences in a lake or among lakes respectively this implies that climate impacts should be taken into account when comparing the bloom risks among lakes for national scale management synoptic scale management may pay more attention to the nutrient level in a lake hence this framework can help guide regional and national water management and reduce health risks 4 2 seasonal migration path of cyanobacterial blooms during the year the seasonal migration paths of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes are summarized according to the seasonal occurrence frequency of the cyanobacterial blooms mapped in fig 8 it was observed that bloom events can occur at a much longer time scale and may even last over a year we considered the criteria to define a cyanobacterial bloom event and suggested classifying the bloom events as flash bloom and long term bloom according to their duration below or over a year based on bloom severity the evolutionary processes of cyanobacterial blooms can be divided into three phases latency development and recovery to understand the mentioned definitions we discussed the characteristics of long term bloom in three lakes based on the long term observations of the bloom area from 2002 to 2020 the evolutionary processes of cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes were then identified on a seasonal scale according to their severity fig 11 measured by the area coverage of the cyanobacterial blooms the seasonal evolution processes of cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu were latency spring development summer autumn and winter and recovery spring which were latency spring summer development summer autumn and winter and recovery spring in lake chaohu and latency spring development summer and autumn and recovery winter and spring in lake dianchi these results illustrate that cyanobacterial blooms in the three lakes are more likely to occur in warm climates duan et al 2009 jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2018 since summer and autumn are often identified as the development phase with frequent blooms hu et al 2021 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 4 3 cyanobacterial bloom risk in the three lakes the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lake taihu remained stable with minor inter and intra annual variations which were lower than those of lakes chaohu and dianchi fig 9 owing to the high nutrient levels in these three lakes climate plays a crucial role in the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms wang et al 2021 we further compared the environmental conditions of the three lakes and found that the climates of lakes chaohu and dianchi were more likely to trigger cyanobacterial blooms fig 5 this revealed that warm drizzle and breeze climates had the greatest possibility of triggering cyanobacterial blooms in lakes recent evidence attests to future global warming woolway et al 2021a woolway et al 2021b the subsequent increase in bloom risks threatens the water resource security ho et al 2019 hou et al 2022 xu et al 2021a in the three lakes the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in summer and autumn were higher than those in spring and winter and had evident spatial distribution patterns the risk maps indicated that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lakes chaohu and dianchi presented little difference among the subregions while there were regional differences in lake taihu in lake taihu the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the lakeshore were higher than those in the central regions this may be due to the nutrient level as the lakeshore is the most eutrophic region of lake taihu xu et al 2015 and has frequent cyanobacterial blooms under suitable climates overall it showed the highest bloom risk in summer and autumn the lakeshore was the subregion of lake taihu with the highest bloom risk 5 conclusion a multivariable integrated risk assessment framework for cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes was developed based on prior knowledge of cyanobacteria comprising five factors related to cyanobacterial blooms cyanobacterial bloom risk levels were estimated for three eutrophic lakes lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi from 2002 to 2020 at the pixel scale 250 m in china the long term analysis suggested that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of the three lakes in summer and autumn were higher than those in the other two seasons the risk level of lake taihu was lower than that of lakes chaohu and dianchi the risk map showed that the cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of lake taihu varied among subregions with the lakeshore having a higher bloom risk than the central regions further comparisons revealed that the seasonal and regional differences in cyanobacterial bloom risk levels of a lake were affected by climate and nutrient levels respectively and the climates played critical role in the differences of cyanobacterial bloom risk levels in three lakes cyanobacteria are more likely to aggregate at the water surface under warm drizzle and breeze climates this reveals increasing bloom risks in eutrophic lakes due to global warming according to the seasonal occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms mapped for the three lakes it was found that the bloom event can occur at a much longer time scale and may even last over a year it was thus suggested to classify the bloom events into flash bloom and long term bloom where its evolution processes could be divided into several phases based on the bloom severity such as latency development and recovery in addition the evolution processes of long term bloom in the three lakes were specified at the seasonal scale through the mapped seasonal occurrence frequency of cyanobacterial blooms overall these findings specify the seasons and regions of high bloom risk where proactive risk management is required to ensure water security this can guide water resource management and reduce unnecessary expenses credit

15293,fe ii and silicate can form si fe ii co precipitates in anoxic groundwater and sediments but their phase composition and reactivity towards subsurface pollutants are largely unknown three types of si fe ii co precipitations with the same chemical composition namely si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii have been synthesized by different hydroxylation sequences in this work it was found that si fe ii iii reduce carbon tetrachloride ct much faster k1 0 04419 min 1 than si fe ii i 0 min 1 and si fe ii ii 7 860 10 4 min 1 xrd results show that the main component of si fe ii iii is ferrous silicate fesio3 which is quite different from that of si fe ii i and si fe ii ii the unique arrangement of hydroxyl coordination the less distorted octahedral structure the polyhedral morphology and the absence of si a center vacancies in si fe ii iii are responsible for its high reductive dehalogenation reactivity the highest redox activity of si fe ii iii was shown by electrochemical characterization the feii o si in si fe ii iii may stabilize the dichlorocarbene anion ccl2 which favors the transformation of ct to methane 9 2 the si fe ii co precipitates consist of countless internal electric fields and the transformation of hydroxyl and ct both consumed electrons the coexistence of hydroxyl and ct increases the electron density in the electron rich region due to their electronegativity enhancing their electron accepting capabilities this study deepens our understanding of the phase composition and electronic structure of si fe ii co precipitates which fills the gap in the reductive dehalogenation of halides by si fe ii co precipitates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords si fe ii co precipitation carbon tetrachloride internal electric field vacancy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iron fe is the fourth most abundant element in the earth s crust and exists in almost all water environments cornell and schwertmann 2003 the valence state of iron ranges from 2 to 6 but it mainly exists in the form of fe ii and fe iii in the natural environment hu et al 2022 song et al 2022 on the other hand silicon accounts for 27 7 of the earth s crust making silicon the second most abundant element after oxygen doong et al 2003 as a result silicon compounds are commonly found in soil and groundwater environments dissolved silicate is also an essential component in natural water the interaction between fe and si plays an important role in many geochemical cycles including natural weathering soil formation hydrothermal action and elemental cycling francisco et al 2020b pham et al 2012 although the interaction between fe iii and si has been studied extensively under aerobic conditions cismasu et al 2014 doelsch et al 2000 francisco et al 2016 the interaction between fe ii and si under hypoxia and reducing conditions has been rarely studied francisco et al 2020b previous studies on si fe ii interaction mainly focus on the fe ii oxidation process in the presence of si the effect of si on the phase transformation of ferrous minerals the impact of si on pollutant removal by fe ii and the effect of si on fe ii fe iii isotope fractionation francisco et al 2020a wu et al 2017 si fe ii co precipitates can be formed at room temperature under strict anoxic conditions francisco et al 2020a poorly crystallized trioctahedral fe ii phyllosilicates were observed in clay suspensions at ph 7 5 zhu and elzinga 2014 and poorly ordered si fe ii co precipitates formed by the interaction between green rust gr and silicon bearing seawater show the same structural characteristics as sheet silicates halevy et al 2017 si with tetrahedral structure can be regarded as the second shell of octahedral fe ii to form poorly ordered phyllosilicates and sio2 phase francisco et al 2020a previous studies have also shown that ph and fe ii si ratios are the decisive factors determining the structure of si fe ii co precipitate phase francisco et al 2020a in the natural groundwater environment the interaction of si and fe ii are diversified however the influence of this interaction on the structure and phase composition of si fe ii co precipitates has been largely ignored although it is known that the si fe ii co precipitate phases are phyllosilicates and sio2 the structural information of the si fe ii co precipitate at atomic scale has not been clearly understood as a result the reactivity of si fe ii co precipitate and its impact on the transformation of groundwater pollutants have been scarcely studied chlorinated organic compounds cocs are common organic pollutants in the groundwater environments carbon tetrachloride ccl4 ct is a cocs which is widely used in industry and agriculture tang et al 2019 the improper disposal and emission of ct have caused severe soil and groundwater pollution penny et al 2015 fe ii plays a vital role in the natural attenuation of ct hofstetter et al 2003 however the previous studies were performed in an iron only environment danielsen and hayes 2004 ignoring the interaction between fe ii and si in a natural subsurface environment it is reported that detrital fe ii silicates can reduce nitrate at a relatively low rate at ph ranging from 2 to 7 postma 1990 indicating si fe ii co precipitate may also have reductive reactivity towards other oxidant pollutants such as ct most studies show that si coverage inhibits the fe ii induced reductive dechlorination kohn et al 2003 yin et al 2018 but few studies demonstrate si can enhance the reductive precipitation of cr vi by fe 0 oh et al 2007 however the reactivity of si fe ii co precipitate towards cocs reduction has never been investigated the distribution of fe and si species are strongly depend on solution ph go et al 1957 jia et al 2022 the hydroxylation sequence can change the coordination environment of fe ii which lead to different distortions extent of fe ii octahedral structure consequently the electron donating ability of fe ii is altered jia et al 2022 therefore the effect of hydroxylation sequence on the reactivity of si fe ii co precipitations was studied in this work in addition the structure of si varies greatly with different forms which influence the electron density around fe ii liebau 1985 however how different si forms influence the reactivity of fe ii is not clear recent studies have shown that the difference between the dosage of si and ph can significantly change the structure and the heterogeneity of si phase francisco et al 2020b also the existence of background ions can change the structure of formed fe ii minerals jia et al 2022 which greatly influence the reactivity of fe ii jia et al 2022 therefore the effect of si forms si dosage background ions and ph on the reduction of ct by si fe ii co precipitates have been investigated the relationship between the structures and reductive dehalogenation reactivities was analyzed for various si fe ii co precipitations this work reveals the influence of si fe ii interaction on the fate of cocs which is important for the remediation of cocs contaminated groundwater 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals detailed information on chemicals is shown in text s1 all operations that require strict anaerobic conditions are carried out in an anaerobic glove box filled with 100 n2 michelona beijing china the preparation of ferrous solution was carried out according to our previous publications yin et al 2018 2 2 synthesis of si fe ii co precipitates ultrapure water was n2 bubbled for at least one hour immediately transferred into the glovebox and magnetically stirred overnight si fe ii co precipitates were synthesized by mixing si and fe ii aqueous solutions using hcl naoh for ph adjustment the hydroxylation sequence only changes the forms of si and fe and the final phs of si fe ii co precipitate suspensions are the same three types of si fe ii co precipitates designated as si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii were synthesized with different hydroxylation sequences the hydroxylation sequences for si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii are sio3 2 naoh fe

procedure for the degradation of ct is shown in supporting information text s2 the effect of different hydroxylation sequences ph si dosage si forms and the presence of nature occurring ions on ct reduction were studied each experiment was repeated at least twice 2 4 si fe ii co precipitates characterization an x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro panalytical holland was used to reveal the crystalline structure of si fe ii co precipitates the size and surface charge of si fe ii co precipitates were analyzed by a nano size zeta potential analyzer size zeta malvern panaco uk scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds zeiss merlin compact oxford instruments was used to analyze the morphology and element distribution of the samples before the reaction an electrochemical workstation was used to analyze the interfacial electron transfer properties of si fe ii co precipitates chi 630 ch instruments china the local coordination and structural

switzerland the electron donating capacity qedc mol e mol fe ii of si fe ii co precipitates was measured by mediated electrochemical oxidation meo experiments the operational conditions and detailed

dichlorocarbene ccl2 was determined according to our previous study jia et al 2022 co and h2 were quantified by a gas chromatograph gc gc3900c the parameters of the real groundwater are shown in our previous study deng et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of si fe ii co precipitates figs 1 a f and s1 reveal the morphology and element distribution of the si fe ii co precipitates the si fe ii i is solid particles with a particle size of 500 nm fig 1a and si fe ii ii has a particle size of 400 nm and a thinner thickness compared with si fe ii i fig 1b the si fe ii iii white precipitates have a polyhedral morphology and smaller particles 200 nm compared with si fe ii i and si fe ii ii fig 1c the mass percentage of surface si in si fe ii i and si fe ii ii are 3 24 and 5 00 respectively fig 1d e in contrast the mass percentage of surface si is as high as 16 05 for si fe ii iii fig 1f which is also evident in fig s1 the contents of si and o on the surface of si fe ii iii co precipitation are higher than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii fig s1 this result indicates that the surface state bands which are inherent in the surface superstructure of si in si fe ii iii are more located on the surface of the si fe ii co precipitates two dimensional bands are formed in silicon surfaces due to the presence of surface superstructure of si electrons in the bands move along the surface like carriers in the three dimensional bands hsaegawa et al 1997 the adsorbed iron atoms can also donate carriers into the surface state band hasegawa et al 1999 thus the electrical conductivity is improved leading to the high reductive activity of si fe ii iii si fe ii i and si fe ii ii were white precipitates while si fe ii iii s colors were changed from white to light gray green after aging for 20 min si fe ii i mainly consist of goethite ferrihydrite ferric chloride fesio3 feo oh and poorly crystallized sio2 well crystallized feo oh and poorly crystallized sio2 were observed in si fe ii ii the main composition of si fe ii iii were fesio3 and sio2 with slightly better crystallinity than si fe ii ii there are also apparent differences in the crystallinity of the si fe ii co precipitates formed by different hydroxylation sequences in which the crystallinity at 30 698 and 44 392 corresponding to fesio3 are the highest for si fe ii iii fig 1g according to fig 1f the content of fe is in excess of the stoichiometric fe in fesio3 thus the si fe ii co precipitates are not a pure fesio3 phase but mixed with other mineral impurities it has been reported that si fe ii co precipitates do not consist of crystallized phases and the formation of amorphous ferric silicate phases was expected francisco et al 2020b in addition the particle size of si fe ii i 8 μm is larger than that of si fe ii ii 2 0 μm and si fe ii iii 1 7 μm fig s2 the characteristics of chemical bonding of different si fe ii co precipitates samples were analyzed by ftir in the range of 400 cm 1 4500 cm 1 fig 1h the oh stretching vibration ʋoh of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups at 3630 cm 1 are observed in si fe ii ii and si free samples but not in si fe ii i lutz et al 1994 the broad peak at 3470 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of fe oh and h2o doelsch et al 2001 the latter is attributed to the strong absorption or binding of h2o that survives after dehydration manceau et al 2000 a sharp peak at 3620 cm 1 was observed exclusively in the ftir spectrum of si fe ii iii the wavenumber of this peak is different from that for oh coordinated to fe in dioctahedral phyllosilicates demonstrating the unique fe oh coordination in si fe ii iii besson and drits 1997 fe2 3oh shows oh stretching vibration at 3625 cm 1 3615 cm 1 and 3620 cm 1 in ferroactinolite grunerite and biotite respectively burns and strens 1966 therefore the absorption band at 3620 cm 1 may belong to fe2 3oh with trioctahedral coordination the peaks of 1620 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 represent the bending vibration of ho h and si o fe respectively kinsela et al 2016 the strong and wide absorption band at 1010 cm 1 represents the asymmetric stretching vibration of si o si wang et al 2018 the bands at 1010 cm 1 are consistent with the absorption maxima observed in phyllosilicates francisco et al 2020b the speak at 838 cm 1 refers to the si o apical stretching vibration which resulted from the distortion in the tetrahedral sheet russell et al 1979 the peaks at 772 cm 1 are symmetrical stretching vibrations of the si o bond and the peaks at 459 cm 1 are bending vibrations of the si o bond brylewska et al 2018 the band at 638 cm 1 is assigned to fe ii oh vibrations in the octahedral sheets which is also observed in the spectra of phyllosilicate minerals such as minnesotaite nontronite and greenalite manceau et al 2000 different hydroxylation sequences have a significant influence on the coordination of hydroxyl groups to fe ii which is demonstrated by the various crystallized phases observed by xrd the maximum absorption peak 1010 cm 1 of si falls within the range of the absorption peak of phyllosilicates combining the fe ii oh deformation band at 636 cm 1 and the xrd results a trioctahedral phyllosilicates structure is expected in si fe ii iii the broad peak at 485 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of fe o in fe oh 2 which is significantly weakened in si fe ii co precipitates the vibration intensity and position of functional groups of si fe ii co precipitates vary with the hydroxylation sequences which indicates that the coordination environment of their central fe ii is different the tga of the si fe ii co precipitate shows continuous degradation with three major mass losses at 30 1000 c fig 1i the total mass losses of si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii were 27 22 2 and 41 6 respectively the first loss 30 250 c is attributed to the loss of physisorbed water and the second loss 250 500 c is attributed to the loss of interlayered water dumas et al 2013 the third loss 500 1000 c is assigned to the dehydroxylation of si fe ii co precipitates dumas et al 2013 the weight loss caused by this dehydroxylation is 8 2 9 6 and 14 5 for si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii respectively table s1 therefore si fe ii iii contains many interlayered water molecules and surface hydroxyl groups note that surface hydroxyl groups could act as electron acceptors hadjiivanov 2014 therefore fe ii in si fe ii iii is more likely to donate electrons to surface hydroxyl groups which are supported by the reactivity data see below the mössbauer spectra of the si fe ii co precipitates with different hydroxylation sequences were obtained at 13 k fig 2 a c the mössbauer spectrum of si fe ii i shows a symmetrical doublet which belongs to fe ii 100 fig 2a the cs center shift and δeq quadrupole splitting parameters of si fe ii i are 1 237 mm s and 2 638 mm s table s2 respectively which are close to the octahedral fe ii parameters of the m1 octahedron site in orthopyroxene bancroft et al 1968 the mössbauer spectrum of si fe ii ii shows the fe ii doublet with significantly altered mössbauer parameters and the appearance of two new fe ii sextets fig 2b the cs and δeq of the fe ii doublet are 1 546 mm s and 2 539 mm s respectively the two distinct hyperfine fields hhf 217 404 koe and hhf 136 887 koe are attributed to fe ii in m2 octahedron cs 1 142 mm s ɛ quadrupole shift 0 658 mm s and m1 octahedron cs 1 235 mm s ɛ 0 981 mm s table s2 respectively j r regnard et al 1986 the mössbauer spectrum of si fe ii iii shows one fe ii doublet cs 1 237 mm s and δ eq 2 638 mm s and one fe ii sextet cs 1 087 mm s ɛ 0 774 mm s and hhf 197 616 koe figure 2c table s2 in the si fe ii ii sample the doublet fe ii sextet fe ii 1 and sextet fe ii 2 are 39 7 39 3 and 21 0 respectively figure 2b in contrast the sextet fe ii accounts for only 23 2 in the si fe ii iii sample figure 2c thus the local coordination environment around fe ii in the si fe ii co precipitates with different hydroxylation sequences varies significantly the defects of si fe ii co precipitates were analyzed by epr at room temperature fig 2d the peak at g 2 005 originates from si dangling bonds and that at g 2 02 from si vacancy somers et al 2012 the peak at g 2 001 2 004 is o vacancy qin et al 2021 which is difficult to distinguish from si vacancy previous results show that the vacancies in si crystal are easy to combine with interstitial oxygen atoms to form a si a center the si a center is a lattice vacancy with an oxygen atom bridging two of the four broken bonds associated with the vacancy and the si a center is the vacancy related to oxygen atoms corbett et al 1961 vacancies related to the si a center were detected in the si fe ii i and si fe ii ii and the intensities were weaker for the latter in contrast no si a vacancies were observed for si fe ii iii the xps survey spectra of si fe ii co precipitates are shown in fig s3a and the adventitious c1s peak 284 8 ev is used as the energy reference to compensate for the energy offset caused by charging fig s3b the o 1s xps of si fe ii co precipitates exhibits four peaks at binding energies of 530 8 531 5 531 9 and 536 5 which can be assigned to fe o si o si the bridging oxygen si o the non bridging oxygen and si o o si the peroxyl bridge li et al 1999 respectively fig s4 the proportions of different oxygen species are shown in table s3 it was found that the major oxygen species of si fe ii i and si fe ii ii was the non bridging oxygen in the si o network and the major oxygen species of si fe ii iii was the peroxyl bridge one of the signs of amorphous sio2 formation is the presence of unsaturated si o bonds non bridging oxygen aronne et al 1997 the absence of the characteristic peak of the fe si bond implies that si atoms tend to bond with surrounding o atoms rather than the central fe atoms notably the o 1s and si 2p xps peaks of si fe ii iii shift to lower binding energy compared with si fe ii i and si fe ii ii fig 2e f which demonstrates a partial electron transfer from fe ii to o and si in si fe ii iii qin et al 2022 this phenomenon is consistent with the epr data the fe ii in the si fe ii iii has a strong ability to donate electrons the values of electron donating capability qedc in the three types of si fe ii co precipitates are similar figs 2g and s5 this shows that the potential electron donating ability of fe ii in three different types of si fe ii co precipitations in the presence of strong oxidant abts is the same and the effect of structural difference on reductive reactivity may be omitted the open circuit potentials of si fe ii iii are the lowest indicating that si fe ii iii is the least stable among the studied si fe ii co precipitates fig 2h the corrosion current of the si fe ii iii is the highest 1 439 10 6a among the three samples fig 2i and table s4 which demonstrates that the si fe ii iii has the highest reductive reactivity 3 2 ct degradation by si fe ii co precipitates the si fe ii iii reduce ct to cf dcm and ch4 within 90 min but the si fe ii i and the si fe ii ii system have very weak reductive reactivities towards ct figs 3 a and s6 the kinetics of ct removal by si fe ii co precipitates can be described by pseudo first order kinetics fig s7 table s5 the ct removal rate of si fe ii iii is 0 04419 min 1 which is much higher than that of si fe ii i 0 min 1 and si fe ii ii 7 860 10 4 min 1 table s5 in addition 72 5 cf 7 6 dcm and 9 2 ch4 were produced for si fe ii iii while only 8 6 and 12 9 cf were generated for si fe ii i and si fe ii ii respectively fig 3a however si fe ii iii cannot reduce cf and dcm fig s8 a free carbanion ccl3 could decompose in water to form ccl2 and the existence of ccl2 has also been identified in the si fe ii iii system by radical trapping experiments fig s9 co is readily formed by the hydrolysis of ccl2 pliego and almeida 1996 table s6 and hcoo can be further produced by the reaction of co with oh however no hcoo was detected which demonstrated that the carbene hydrolysis ends when it is hydrolyzed to co table s6 thus the products of ch4 and cf are formed in parallel rather than in sequential reactions the production of ch4 is likely to bypass the formation of cf as an intermediate thus ch4 is mainly produced by carbene reduction and may be partially converted from co also the degradation path of ct by fe ii in the si fe ii co precipitates is consistent with our previous study fig s10 jia et al 2022 the difference of eh for si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii is not significant which demonstrates their reactivity difference is not mainly resulted from the different eh values fig 3b the utilization ratio ur 1 47 0 02 and electron selectivity es 85 1 of si fe ii iii are the highest among the three types of si fe ii co precipitates fig 3c the reduction rate of ct by si fe ii iii became slower with the increase of sio3 2 dosage from 0 to 10 mm fig s11 and the pseudo first order rate constant k1 decreased from 0 084 min 1 to 0 00672 min 1 fig 3d sio2 was found to inhibit the reduction of organic halogenated compounds and nitroaromatic compounds by its adsorption on the surface of fe ii yin et al 2018 also the excess si may form a polymeric matrix enclosing the si fe ii co precipitate pokrovski et al 2003 covering the reductive active sites the presence of sio2 in co precipitates has been confirmed by xrd fig 1g and the amount of produced sio2 in si fe ii co precipitate may increase with the increase of sio3 2 dosage boland et al 2011 the percentage of cf increased from 58 7 to 72 5 when the si dosage increased from 0 to 5 mm and then decreased to 37 3 when the si dosage was 10 mm dcm increased from 0 57 to 7 6 and then decreased to 0 ch4 increased from 1 24 to 9 2 and then decreased to 0 the products of cf dcm and ch4 all reached the maximum when the dosage of si was 5 mm the zeta potentials of si fe ii iii co precipitates decreased gradually with the increase of si dosage and the values were all positive fig 3e this indicates that the si fe ii iii co precipitates become poorly dispersed with the increase of si dosage the halogenated radical intermediates can transform to halogenated carbine anion species by electron addition mccormick and adriaens 2004 also the positively charged si fe ii surface feii o si can stabilize carbene anions regardless of the properties of these surface bound intermediates this series of continuous hydrogenation reduction can eventually form ch4 jia et al 2022 the presence of inorganic anions so4 2 co3 2 po4 3 no3 decreased the ct reduction rate constant k1 from 0 04419 min 1 to 0 03013 min 1 0 02331 min 1 0 02145 min 1 and 0 01896 min 1 respectively figs 3f and s12 the inhibitory effect is mainly due to the fact that the addition of the above inorganic anions hinders the binding of sio3 2 to fe ii which decreases the content of si fe ii iii or forms other ferrous minerals with poor reducibility wu et al 2012 the k1 increased from 0 04419 min 1 to 0 04887 min 1 in the presence of 1 mg l ha which may be resulted from the enhanced electron transfer by quinones functional groups in ha scott et al 1998 on the other hand the presence of ca2 and mg2 enhanced the removal of ct by si fe ii iii k1 is 0 04866 min 1 and 0 0519 min 1 respectively the addition of ca2 or mg2 may precipitate as casio3 or mgsio3 which favors the adsorption of ct casio3 and or mgsio3 can be regarded as coagulant agents contributing to the removal of ct cui et al 2017 the addition of fe iii inhibited the reductive dechlorination of ct k1 is 0 03087 min 1 and the sample changed from white to blue green it is expected that gr huang and hansen 2016 and or ferric silicate minerals are produced schwertmann and thalmann 1976 which results in a decreased reductive reactivity figs 3g and s13 reveal the effect of different forms of nature occurring si on the reductive dechlorination of ct when si exists as h2sio3 colloid the reductive rate of ct can reach 0 03713 min 1 the reaction rate of ct with the addition of sio2 is slightly higher than that of sio3 2 when si exists as si2o5 2 the reaction rate is the fastest 0 05254 min 1 this result is in line with a previous founding that si2o5 2 fe ii complex has a high reductive reactivity at neutral ph 6 8 cui et al 2017 when sio4 4 was co precipitated with fe ii the ct reduction rate was the lowest 0 00809 min 1 it should be noted that sio3 2 fe ii co precipitates can dechlorinate ct to more amount of ch4 the morphology of si has a significant influence on the reductive reactivity and product distribution in the si fe ii co precipitates ct system according to the tetrahedral model sidorov 2007 silicates are classified as chain silicates sio3 2 and h2sio3 framework silicates sio2 layer silicates si2o5 2 and monosilicate sio4 4 their intermolecular bond types short bridge bond asymmetric bridge short and long bond terminal non bridge bond bond length and bond angle are quite different liebau 1985 these results demonstrate that the coordination environment of fe ii is affected by the morphology of si the xps results show that the electrons donation of fe ii varies greatly under different coordination environments therefore their intermolecular bond types may be the main reason for the varied fe ii activity the reductive reactivities of si fe ii co precipitates were further evaluated in real groundwater matrices the reduction of ct by si fe ii co precipitates in real groundwater was inhibited compared with that in ultrapure water the percentage of cf dcm and ch4 decreased significantly fig 3h the presence of interfering ions in real groundwater hinders the ct reduction by si fe ii co precipitate which is in line with the influence of background ions observed in fig 3f still 40 of ct is dechlorinated by si fe ii iii k1 0 00617 min 1 indicating its high selectivity for ct reduction in real groundwater matrices figs 3h and s14 3 3 mechanism for the enhanced electron transfer 3 3 1 structural distortion internal electric field and vacancies the δeq values of fe ii doublet in si fe ii iii is relatively large among the si fe ii co precipitates table s2 for six coordinated fe ii species low extent distortion of octahedral structures results in large values of quadrupole splitting δeq bancroft et al 1968 it has been reported that more distorted fe ii polyhedrons in minerals e g epidote hibonite were corresponded to a lower δeq value burns 1994 because the symmetry of the d electron cloud distribution of the six coordinated fe ii is not coordinated with the geometry of the ligand according to the jahn taller effect pearson 1975 the degeneracy of the d orbital of fe ii is reduced and the stability is improved therefore the small distortion of the fe ii octahedral structure can improve the reductive reactivity of fe oh 2 thus the structural distortion of the fe ii octahedron of si fe ii iii is smaller than that of si fe ii i which may be related to a higher reductive activity of si fe ii iii pearson 1975 on the other hand si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii contain two and one fe ii sextet respectively table s2 a higher center shift cs value of fe ii sextets in the hyperfine interaction corresponds to a lower s electron density of fe ii murad and cashion 2004 si fe ii iii has the lowest cs value of 1 087 mm s among the si fe ii co precipitates therefore fe ii in the si fe ii iii is likely to donate more electrons to o atoms the structural distortion of the fe ii octahedron may be caused by the jahn teller effect and vacancies kato et al 2004 according to the previous research the more vacancies the smaller the distortion kato et al 2004 our results show that the concentration of vacancies decreases in the order of si fe ii i si fe ii ii si fe ii iii which is the same order for the extent of structural distortion the contradiction between our results and previous studies shows that the jahn teller effect rather than vacancies determine the structural distortion of si fe ii co precipitates the low extent of structural distortion for si fe ii iii may lead to its high reductive reactivity the electronegativity of si is greater than that of fe therefore the increased coordination number of fe after si doping may result in a large electron density around si lyu et al 2016 this spontaneously leads to a higher electron density of the lattice o2 adjacent to the lattice si and a lower electron density of the lattice o2 adjacent to the lattice fe the epr signal intensity of si fe ii co precipitates synthesized in different hydroxylation sequences is quite different indicating a diversified chemical environment of fe ii fig 2d the binding energy of the surface fe species of si fe ii co precipitates at 724 8 723 4 ev and 709 9 711 3 ev can be assigned to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of fe ii respectively fig s3a this binding energy is higher than that of fe ii in feo 722 8 and 709 8 ev confirming the electron deficient properties near the fe sites in si fe ii co precipitates graat and somers 1996 therefore the higher electron density is concentrated in the lattice o2 adjacent to the lattice si in the structure of si fe ii co precipitates lower electron density is distributed near the fe site forming countless internal electric fields gao et al 2018 the electron rich o center acts as a cathode and the lattice fe acts as a anode lyu et al 2018 the direction of the internal electric field is from the electron rich center to the electron deficient center fig 4 a d zhang et al 2021 in the presence of countless internal electric fields in the si fe ii co precipitates electrons are transferred from the electron poor region fe ii to the lattice o2 adjacent to the si fig 4e however the concentrations of si a vacancies in si fe ii co precipitates increased in the order of si fe ii iii si fe ii ii si fe ii i the electron deficient si a vacancies readily withdraw capture electrons within the si fe ii structure watkins and corbett 1961 inhibiting the possible electron transfer from fe ii to the electron rich lattice o2 which is adjacent to si atoms in other words because the electronegativity of fe ii is lower than that of si χfe ii 1 64 χsi 1 74 fe ii transfers more electrons to its adjacent o atoms oterm than si liebau 1985 fig 4e as a result the oterm transfers part of its electron density to adjacent si atoms thus the region with the highest electron density is closer to si the increase of charge density around tetrahedral si spontaneously increases the electron density of its adjacent o atoms this causes the h atom connected to the o atom get electrons first fig 4e and the hydroxyl group linked to the tetrahedral si is reduced to h2 therefore the highest reactivity of si fe ii iii is derived from its unique electronic structure fig 2 3 3 2 internal electric field enhanced by surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed ct si fe ii co precipitates alone can produce hydrogen via the oxidation of surface oh groups figs 4a c 5 a and s16 hadjiivanov 2014 the concentration of released h2 increases gradually with time also the h2 released from the si fe ii iii is relatively high at 90 min compared with si fe ii i and si fe ii ii the reason is that si fe ii iii not only has the highest amount of surface hydroxyl groups fig 1i but also has the strongest reductive strength fig 4c the addition of ct promoted the generation of hydrogen in the system fig 5b the chlorine of ct is an electrophilic group caballero garcia et al 2016 which leads to an increased electron density in the electron rich region and the oxidation of hydroxyl groups on the surface also the presence of cf and dcm promoted the production of h2 in the system fig s17 which further proves that the chlorine atoms with high electronegativity can promote the release of h2 although si fe ii i and si fe ii ii also produced hydrogen they show no reductive reactivity towards ct fig s6a b thus the possible active hydrogen intermediate which may be formed during hydrogen evolution reaction did not contribute to the ct reduction if any the surface hydroxyl groups of si fe ii co precipitates and the chlorine groups of ct are both electrophilic groups which both promote the electron donation of the electron rich region in the internal electric field on the other hand the hydroxyl groups and chlorine groups both consume the same fe ii electron source for their subsequent transformations the properties of si fe ii iii at different phs were characterized since the concentrations of surface hydroxyl groups were determined by ph ftir shows that the intensity of the oh stretching vibration of fe2 3oh at 3620 cm 1 increases with ph fig 5c the fe oh and h2ooh 3450 cm 1 stretching vibration is the strongest for the si fe ii iii synthesized at ph 5 doelsch et al 2001 two distinct h2o characteristic peaks at 3180 cm 1 and 2180 cm 1 were observed under acidic conditions the peak at 3180 cm 1 can be attributed to the first overtone in the bend due to the strong fermi resonance between the symmetrical tension and bending of h2o and the peak at 2180 cm 1 is the association band of water mccoy 2014 when dissolved sio3 2 and fe ii ions co precipitation at neutral and alkaline conditions the bending vibration of ho h shifts from 1600 cm 1 to 1620 cm 1 also the asymmetric stretching vibration of si o si shifts from 1100 cm 1 to 1010 cm 1 wang et al 2018 showing that the coordination environment of fe ii in the dissolved state is quite different from that in the solid state the open circuit potentials of si fe ii iii become more negative with the increase in ph indicating that si fe ii iii is less stable at higher phs fig s15a the arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis decreases gradually with the increase of ph fig s15b which indicates that the interfacial electron transfer rate is the fastest at ph 13 zhang et al 2019 the corrosion current at ph 13 is the highest 2 522 10 6a among all the samples which demonstrates that si fe ii iii has the highest reductive reactivity at ph 13 fig s15c and table s7 these results indicate the decrease of the electron density around fe lyu et al 2016 strengthening the internal electric field with the increased concentration of oh in addition the h2 released by si fe ii iii increases gradually with increasing ph fig 5d under the same ph conditions the production of h2 was boosted in the presence of ct fig 5e this phenomenon further proves that the increase of hydroxyl concentration and the presence of ct can enhance the internal electric field the si fe ii iii co precipitates were fully dissolved at ph 5 which led to a diminished reductive reactivity fig 5f no surface hydroxyl groups were coordinated with si fe ii under acidic conditions and the internal electric field was not formed on the other hand the reduction rate of ct by si fe ii iii increased gradually with increasing ph figs 5f and s18 and was the highest at ph 13 k1 0 88738 min 1 the increased amount of hydroxyl groups may enhance the internal electric field and promotes the electrons transfer from si fe ii iii to ct with the increase of ph si fe ii iii is mainly fesio3 with an increased crystallinity and a small amount of poorly crystallized sio2 fig 5g this phenomenon confirms the essential role of fesio3 in the reduction of ct by the si fe ii iii si fe ii iii denoted as feii o si oh is produced at ph 7 fig s19 the zeta potential of si fe ii iii gradually changed from positive to negative with the increase of ph fig 5h moreover ch4 was observed as one of the dechlorination products of ct demonstrating the ch4 can be produced by carbene hydrolysis the accumulation of co may not be further transformed into hcoo table s6 which leads to the transformation of co to ch4 li and farrell 2000 also the number of electrons donated by fe ii e0 is the sum of that consumed by ct reduction ep and by hydrogen release reaction ei fig 5i this further reveals that the surface hydroxyl groups and ct consume the same fe ii electron source for further transformations the values of ep 6 5 1021 and ei 1 3 1021 are the largest for si fe ii iii among the studied si fe ii co precipitates table s8 demonstrating the highest reductive reactivity of si fe ii iii the si exists as monosilicic acid si oh 4 in aqueous solution at ph 7 fig s19 the actual forms of dissolved si depends on the mineral composition especially its surface properties temperature ph and solution matrices mainly in low polymerization and high polymerization silicic acid molecules dietzel 2000 when silicate coexists with oh si fe ii i sio oh 3 is formed fe ii tends to combine with oh to form ferrous hydroxyl complex fhc fhc is mainly in the form of fe2 oh 3cl and the remaining fe ii are sufficient to form dissolved fe sio oh 3 2 when silicic acid in solution reaches saturation it can precipitate in the form of amorphous sio2 gunnarsson i and s 2000 this process is similar to the formation of si fe ii ii except that fe ii combines with hydroxyl groups to form fe oh 2 jia et al 2022 however the formation of si fe ii iii differs from both si fe ii i and si fe ii ii the hydroxyl groups on the surface of sio oh 3 are consumed at ph 7 5 8 fe ii coupled with si to form dissolved ferrous silicate which precipitate when the solution ph is adjusted to neutral thus hydroxylation sequence influence the formation of different species of fe and si before coupling which further affects the physical and chemical reaction of the coupling process ion competition adsorptive complexation and precipitation reaction occurred during the formation of si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii respectively the varied reactions lead to significant differences in fe ii octahedral structure electron donating capacity and vacancy concentrations of si fe ii co precipitates resulting in dramatic reactivity differences of si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii 4 environmental significance fe and si are the fourth and second abundant elements in the earth s crust the interaction between them is central to many vital geochemical processes in various natural and engineered environments doong et al 2003 johnson et al 1997 the fe si interaction in a real environment is complex a tiny variation e g hydroxylation sequences may result in dramatical difference in the microstructure and reactivity of the formed fe si co precipitates with the same chemical compositions our work shows that si fe ii iii has stronger reductive dechlorination activity for ct than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii although all three si fe ii co precipitants have the same chemical compositions fig s3a the high reductive reactivity of si fe ii iii may stem from the low extent of structural distortion low concentration of vacancies and the presence of internal electric field enhanced by surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed ct molecules this work deepens our understanding of the stability phase transformation reductive reactivity and application of si fe ii phases which are abundant in natural subsurface environment 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the diversity of structure and reactivity for si fe ii co precipitants formed in a possible natural subsurface environment the different hydroxylation sequences of si have a significant influence on the coordination environment of the redox active fe ii site significant differences in the phase compositions of si fe ii co precipitates were observed with different synthesis methods si fe ii i and si fe ii ii mainly contain amorphous fe ii and a small amount of si while si fe ii iii contains highly crystallized fesio3 mössbauer spectrum shows that the structure of fe ii octahedron in the si fe ii iii has the least distortion xps data show that the electron donating ability of fe ii in the si fe ii iii is higher than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii epr results further show si fe ii iii has no vacancy tga data shows that si fe ii iii contains many interlayered water molecules and surface hydroxyl groups electrochemical characterization shows that the si fe ii iii is more redox active than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii ferrous silicate at higher ph has higher crystallinity and more surface hydroxyl groups the existence of feii o si may stabilize ccl2 which is beneficial to carbene reduction the si fe ii co precipitates consist of countless internal electric fields and the transformation of hydroxyl groups and ct both consumed electrons however the coexistence of hydroxyl groups and ct increases the electron density in the electron rich region due to electronegativity enhancing their electron accepting capabilities the low extent of structural distortion low concentration of vacancies and the presence of an internal electric field enhanced by surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed ct molecules in si fe ii iii lead to its high reductive reactivity compared with the other si fe ii co precipitates with the same chemical composition declaration of competing interest the authors

15293,fe ii and silicate can form si fe ii co precipitates in anoxic groundwater and sediments but their phase composition and reactivity towards subsurface pollutants are largely unknown three types of si fe ii co precipitations with the same chemical composition namely si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii have been synthesized by different hydroxylation sequences in this work it was found that si fe ii iii reduce carbon tetrachloride ct much faster k1 0 04419 min 1 than si fe ii i 0 min 1 and si fe ii ii 7 860 10 4 min 1 xrd results show that the main component of si fe ii iii is ferrous silicate fesio3 which is quite different from that of si fe ii i and si fe ii ii the unique arrangement of hydroxyl coordination the less distorted octahedral structure the polyhedral morphology and the absence of si a center vacancies in si fe ii iii are responsible for its high reductive dehalogenation reactivity the highest redox activity of si fe ii iii was shown by electrochemical characterization the feii o si in si fe ii iii may stabilize the dichlorocarbene anion ccl2 which favors the transformation of ct to methane 9 2 the si fe ii co precipitates consist of countless internal electric fields and the transformation of hydroxyl and ct both consumed electrons the coexistence of hydroxyl and ct increases the electron density in the electron rich region due to their electronegativity enhancing their electron accepting capabilities this study deepens our understanding of the phase composition and electronic structure of si fe ii co precipitates which fills the gap in the reductive dehalogenation of halides by si fe ii co precipitates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords si fe ii co precipitation carbon tetrachloride internal electric field vacancy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iron fe is the fourth most abundant element in the earth s crust and exists in almost all water environments cornell and schwertmann 2003 the valence state of iron ranges from 2 to 6 but it mainly exists in the form of fe ii and fe iii in the natural environment hu et al 2022 song et al 2022 on the other hand silicon accounts for 27 7 of the earth s crust making silicon the second most abundant element after oxygen doong et al 2003 as a result silicon compounds are commonly found in soil and groundwater environments dissolved silicate is also an essential component in natural water the interaction between fe and si plays an important role in many geochemical cycles including natural weathering soil formation hydrothermal action and elemental cycling francisco et al 2020b pham et al 2012 although the interaction between fe iii and si has been studied extensively under aerobic conditions cismasu et al 2014 doelsch et al 2000 francisco et al 2016 the interaction between fe ii and si under hypoxia and reducing conditions has been rarely studied francisco et al 2020b previous studies on si fe ii interaction mainly focus on the fe ii oxidation process in the presence of si the effect of si on the phase transformation of ferrous minerals the impact of si on pollutant removal by fe ii and the effect of si on fe ii fe iii isotope fractionation francisco et al 2020a wu et al 2017 si fe ii co precipitates can be formed at room temperature under strict anoxic conditions francisco et al 2020a poorly crystallized trioctahedral fe ii phyllosilicates were observed in clay suspensions at ph 7 5 zhu and elzinga 2014 and poorly ordered si fe ii co precipitates formed by the interaction between green rust gr and silicon bearing seawater show the same structural characteristics as sheet silicates halevy et al 2017 si with tetrahedral structure can be regarded as the second shell of octahedral fe ii to form poorly ordered phyllosilicates and sio2 phase francisco et al 2020a previous studies have also shown that ph and fe ii si ratios are the decisive factors determining the structure of si fe ii co precipitate phase francisco et al 2020a in the natural groundwater environment the interaction of si and fe ii are diversified however the influence of this interaction on the structure and phase composition of si fe ii co precipitates has been largely ignored although it is known that the si fe ii co precipitate phases are phyllosilicates and sio2 the structural information of the si fe ii co precipitate at atomic scale has not been clearly understood as a result the reactivity of si fe ii co precipitate and its impact on the transformation of groundwater pollutants have been scarcely studied chlorinated organic compounds cocs are common organic pollutants in the groundwater environments carbon tetrachloride ccl4 ct is a cocs which is widely used in industry and agriculture tang et al 2019 the improper disposal and emission of ct have caused severe soil and groundwater pollution penny et al 2015 fe ii plays a vital role in the natural attenuation of ct hofstetter et al 2003 however the previous studies were performed in an iron only environment danielsen and hayes 2004 ignoring the interaction between fe ii and si in a natural subsurface environment it is reported that detrital fe ii silicates can reduce nitrate at a relatively low rate at ph ranging from 2 to 7 postma 1990 indicating si fe ii co precipitate may also have reductive reactivity towards other oxidant pollutants such as ct most studies show that si coverage inhibits the fe ii induced reductive dechlorination kohn et al 2003 yin et al 2018 but few studies demonstrate si can enhance the reductive precipitation of cr vi by fe 0 oh et al 2007 however the reactivity of si fe ii co precipitate towards cocs reduction has never been investigated the distribution of fe and si species are strongly depend on solution ph go et al 1957 jia et al 2022 the hydroxylation sequence can change the coordination environment of fe ii which lead to different distortions extent of fe ii octahedral structure consequently the electron donating ability of fe ii is altered jia et al 2022 therefore the effect of hydroxylation sequence on the reactivity of si fe ii co precipitations was studied in this work in addition the structure of si varies greatly with different forms which influence the electron density around fe ii liebau 1985 however how different si forms influence the reactivity of fe ii is not clear recent studies have shown that the difference between the dosage of si and ph can significantly change the structure and the heterogeneity of si phase francisco et al 2020b also the existence of background ions can change the structure of formed fe ii minerals jia et al 2022 which greatly influence the reactivity of fe ii jia et al 2022 therefore the effect of si forms si dosage background ions and ph on the reduction of ct by si fe ii co precipitates have been investigated the relationship between the structures and reductive dehalogenation reactivities was analyzed for various si fe ii co precipitations this work reveals the influence of si fe ii interaction on the fate of cocs which is important for the remediation of cocs contaminated groundwater 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals detailed information on chemicals is shown in text s1 all operations that require strict anaerobic conditions are carried out in an anaerobic glove box filled with 100 n2 michelona beijing china the preparation of ferrous solution was carried out according to our previous publications yin et al 2018 2 2 synthesis of si fe ii co precipitates ultrapure water was n2 bubbled for at least one hour immediately transferred into the glovebox and magnetically stirred overnight si fe ii co precipitates were synthesized by mixing si and fe ii aqueous solutions using hcl naoh for ph adjustment the hydroxylation sequence only changes the forms of si and fe and the final phs of si fe ii co precipitate suspensions are the same three types of si fe ii co precipitates designated as si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii were synthesized with different hydroxylation sequences the hydroxylation sequences for si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii are sio3 2 naoh fe ii fe ii naoh sio3 2 hcl and sio3 2 hcl fe ii naoh respectively the added concentrations of chemicals were the same and only the addition sequences were changed 2 3 degradation of ct the operation procedure for the degradation of ct is shown in supporting information text s2 the effect of different hydroxylation sequences ph si dosage si forms and the presence of nature occurring ions on ct reduction were studied each experiment was repeated at least twice 2 4 si fe ii co precipitates characterization an x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro panalytical holland was used to reveal the crystalline structure of si fe ii co precipitates the size and surface charge of si fe ii co precipitates were analyzed by a nano size zeta potential analyzer size zeta malvern panaco uk scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds zeiss merlin compact oxford instruments was used to analyze the morphology and element distribution of the samples before the reaction an electrochemical workstation was used to analyze the interfacial electron transfer properties of si fe ii co precipitates chi 630 ch instruments china the local coordination and structural distortion of fe ii in si fe ii co precipitates were analyzed by mössbauer spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 5700 was used to analyze the functional groups of si fe ii co precipitates x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi thermo fisher scientific america was used to determine the chemical states of si fe and o in si fe ii co precipitates the defects in

switzerland the electron donating capacity qedc mol e mol fe ii of si fe ii co precipitates was measured by mediated electrochemical oxidation meo experiments the operational conditions and detailed information are shown in supporting information text s3 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of ct cf chloroform hccl3 dcm dichloromethane h2ccl2 ch4 hcoo fe ii trichloromethyl radical ccl3 and dichlorocarbene ccl2 was determined according to our previous study jia et al 2022 co and h2 were quantified by a gas chromatograph gc gc3900c the parameters of the real groundwater are shown in our previous study deng et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of si fe ii co precipitates figs 1 a f and s1 reveal the morphology and element distribution of the si fe ii co precipitates the si fe ii i is solid particles with a particle size of 500 nm fig 1a and si fe ii ii has a particle size of 400 nm and a thinner thickness compared with si fe ii i fig 1b the si fe ii iii white precipitates have a polyhedral morphology and smaller particles 200 nm compared with si fe ii i and si fe ii ii fig 1c the mass percentage of surface si in si fe ii i and si fe ii ii are 3 24 and 5 00 respectively fig 1d e in contrast the mass percentage of surface si is as high as 16 05 for si fe ii iii fig 1f which is also evident in fig s1 the contents of si and o on the surface of si fe ii iii co precipitation are higher than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii fig s1 this result indicates that the surface state bands which are inherent in the surface superstructure of si in si fe ii iii are more located on the surface of the si fe ii co precipitates two dimensional bands are formed in silicon surfaces due to the presence of surface superstructure of si electrons in the bands move along the surface like carriers in the three dimensional bands hsaegawa et al 1997 the adsorbed iron atoms can also donate carriers into the surface state band hasegawa et al 1999 thus the electrical conductivity is improved leading to the high reductive activity of si fe ii iii si fe ii i and si fe ii ii were white precipitates while si fe ii iii s colors were changed from white to light gray green after aging for 20 min si fe ii i mainly consist of goethite ferrihydrite ferric chloride fesio3 feo oh and poorly crystallized sio2 well crystallized feo oh and poorly crystallized sio2 were observed in si fe ii ii the main composition of si fe ii iii were fesio3 and sio2 with slightly better crystallinity than si fe ii ii there are also apparent differences in the crystallinity of the si fe ii co precipitates formed by different hydroxylation sequences in which the crystallinity at 30 698 and 44 392 corresponding to fesio3 are the highest for si fe ii iii fig 1g according to fig 1f the content of fe is in excess of the stoichiometric fe in fesio3 thus the si fe ii co precipitates are not a pure fesio3 phase but mixed with other mineral impurities it has been reported that si fe ii co precipitates do not consist of crystallized phases and the formation of amorphous ferric silicate phases was expected francisco et al 2020b in addition the particle size of si fe ii i 8 μm is larger than that of si fe ii ii 2 0 μm and si fe ii iii 1 7 μm fig s2 the characteristics of chemical bonding of different si fe ii co precipitates samples were analyzed by ftir in the range of 400 cm 1 4500 cm 1 fig 1h the oh stretching vibration ʋoh of non hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups at 3630 cm 1 are observed in si fe ii ii and si free samples but not in si fe ii i lutz et al 1994 the broad peak at 3470 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of fe oh and h2o doelsch et al 2001 the latter is attributed to the strong absorption or binding of h2o that survives after dehydration manceau et al 2000 a sharp peak at 3620 cm 1 was observed exclusively in the ftir spectrum of si fe ii iii the wavenumber of this peak is different from that for oh coordinated to fe in dioctahedral phyllosilicates demonstrating the unique fe oh coordination in si fe ii iii besson and drits 1997 fe2 3oh shows oh stretching vibration at 3625 cm 1 3615 cm 1 and 3620 cm 1 in ferroactinolite grunerite and biotite respectively burns and strens 1966 therefore the absorption band at 3620 cm 1 may belong to fe2 3oh with trioctahedral coordination the peaks of 1620 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 represent the bending vibration of ho h and si o fe respectively kinsela et al 2016 the strong and wide absorption band at 1010 cm 1 represents the asymmetric stretching vibration of si o si wang et al 2018 the bands at 1010 cm 1 are consistent with the absorption maxima observed in phyllosilicates francisco et al 2020b the speak at 838 cm 1 refers to the si o apical stretching vibration which resulted from the distortion in the tetrahedral sheet russell et al 1979 the peaks at 772 cm 1 are symmetrical stretching vibrations of the si o bond and the peaks at 459 cm 1 are bending vibrations of the si o bond brylewska et al 2018 the band at 638 cm 1 is assigned to fe ii oh vibrations in the octahedral sheets which is also observed in the spectra of phyllosilicate minerals such as minnesotaite nontronite and greenalite manceau et al 2000 different hydroxylation sequences have a significant influence on the coordination of hydroxyl groups to fe ii which is demonstrated by the various crystallized phases observed by xrd the maximum absorption peak 1010 cm 1 of si falls within the range of the absorption peak of phyllosilicates combining the fe ii oh deformation band at 636 cm 1 and the xrd results a trioctahedral phyllosilicates structure is expected in si fe ii iii the broad peak at 485 cm 1 is the stretching vibration of fe o in fe oh 2 which is significantly weakened in si fe ii co precipitates the vibration intensity and position of functional groups of si fe ii co precipitates vary with the hydroxylation sequences which indicates that the coordination environment of their central fe ii is different the tga of the si fe ii co precipitate shows continuous degradation with three major mass losses at 30 1000 c fig 1i the total mass losses of si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii were 27 22 2 and 41 6 respectively the first loss 30 250 c is attributed to the loss of physisorbed water and the second loss 250 500 c is attributed to the loss of interlayered water dumas et al 2013 the third loss 500 1000 c is assigned to the dehydroxylation of si fe ii co precipitates dumas et al 2013 the weight loss caused by this dehydroxylation is 8 2 9 6 and 14 5 for si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii respectively table s1 therefore si fe ii iii contains many interlayered water molecules and surface hydroxyl groups note that surface hydroxyl groups could act as electron acceptors hadjiivanov 2014 therefore fe ii in si fe ii iii is more likely to donate electrons to surface hydroxyl groups which are supported by the reactivity data see below the mössbauer spectra of the si fe ii co precipitates with different hydroxylation sequences were obtained at 13 k fig 2 a c the mössbauer spectrum of si fe ii i shows a symmetrical doublet which belongs to fe ii 100 fig 2a the cs center shift and δeq quadrupole splitting parameters of si fe ii i are 1 237 mm s and 2 638 mm s table s2 respectively which are close to the octahedral fe ii parameters of the m1 octahedron site in orthopyroxene bancroft et al 1968 the mössbauer spectrum of si fe ii ii shows the fe ii doublet with significantly altered mössbauer parameters and the appearance of two new fe ii sextets fig 2b the cs and δeq of the fe ii doublet are 1 546 mm s and 2 539 mm s respectively the two distinct hyperfine fields hhf 217 404 koe and hhf 136 887 koe are attributed to fe ii in m2 octahedron cs 1 142 mm s ɛ quadrupole shift 0 658 mm s and m1 octahedron cs 1 235 mm s ɛ 0 981 mm s table s2 respectively j r regnard et al 1986 the mössbauer spectrum of si fe ii iii shows one fe ii doublet cs 1 237 mm s and δ eq 2 638 mm s and one fe ii sextet cs 1 087 mm s ɛ 0 774 mm s and hhf 197 616 koe figure 2c table s2 in the si fe ii ii sample the doublet fe ii sextet fe ii 1 and sextet fe ii 2 are 39 7 39 3 and 21 0 respectively figure 2b in contrast the sextet fe ii accounts for only 23 2 in the si fe ii iii sample figure 2c thus the local coordination environment around fe ii in the si fe ii co precipitates with different hydroxylation sequences varies significantly the defects of si fe ii co precipitates were analyzed by epr at room temperature fig 2d the peak at g 2 005 originates from si dangling bonds and that at g 2 02 from si vacancy somers et al 2012 the peak at g 2 001 2 004 is o vacancy qin et al 2021 which is difficult to distinguish from si vacancy previous results show that the vacancies in si crystal are easy to combine with interstitial oxygen atoms to form a si a center the si a center is a lattice vacancy with an oxygen atom bridging two of the four broken bonds associated with the vacancy and the si a center is the vacancy related to oxygen atoms corbett et al 1961 vacancies related to the si a center were detected in the si fe ii i and si fe ii ii and the intensities were weaker for the latter in contrast no si a vacancies were observed for si fe ii iii the xps survey spectra of si fe ii co precipitates are shown in fig s3a and the adventitious c1s peak 284 8 ev is used as the energy reference to compensate for the energy offset caused by charging fig s3b the o 1s xps of si fe ii co precipitates exhibits four peaks at binding energies of 530 8 531 5 531 9 and 536 5 which can be assigned to fe o si o si the bridging oxygen si o the non bridging oxygen and si o o si the peroxyl bridge li et al 1999 respectively fig s4 the proportions of different oxygen species are shown in table s3 it was found that the major oxygen species of si fe ii i and si fe ii ii was the non bridging oxygen in the si o network and the major oxygen species of si fe ii iii was the peroxyl bridge one of the signs of amorphous sio2 formation is the presence of unsaturated si o bonds non bridging oxygen aronne et al 1997 the absence of the characteristic peak of the fe si bond implies that si atoms tend to bond with surrounding o atoms rather than the central fe atoms notably the o 1s and si 2p xps peaks of si fe ii iii shift to lower binding energy compared with si fe ii i and si fe ii ii fig 2e f which demonstrates a partial electron transfer from fe ii to o and si in si fe ii iii qin et al 2022 this phenomenon is consistent with the epr data the fe ii in the si fe ii iii has a strong ability to donate electrons the values of electron donating capability qedc in the three types of si fe ii co precipitates are similar figs 2g and s5 this shows that the potential electron donating ability of fe ii in three different types of si fe ii co precipitations in the presence of strong oxidant abts is the same and the effect of structural difference on reductive reactivity may be omitted the open circuit potentials of si fe ii iii are the lowest indicating that si fe ii iii is the least stable among the studied si fe ii co precipitates fig 2h the corrosion current of the si fe ii iii is the highest 1 439 10 6a among the three samples fig 2i and table s4 which demonstrates that the si fe ii iii has the highest reductive reactivity 3 2 ct degradation by si fe ii co precipitates the si fe ii iii reduce ct to cf dcm and ch4 within 90 min but the si fe ii i and the si fe ii ii system have very weak reductive reactivities towards ct figs 3 a and s6 the kinetics of ct removal by si fe ii co precipitates can be described by pseudo first order kinetics fig s7 table s5 the ct removal rate of si fe ii iii is 0 04419 min 1 which is much higher than that of si fe ii i 0 min 1 and si fe ii ii 7 860 10 4 min 1 table s5 in addition 72 5 cf 7 6 dcm and 9 2 ch4 were produced for si fe ii iii while only 8 6 and 12 9 cf were generated for si fe ii i and si fe ii ii respectively fig 3a however si fe ii iii cannot reduce cf and dcm fig s8 a free carbanion ccl3 could decompose in water to form ccl2 and the existence of ccl2 has also been identified in the si fe ii iii system by radical trapping experiments fig s9 co is readily formed by the hydrolysis of ccl2 pliego and almeida 1996 table s6 and hcoo can be further produced by the reaction of co with oh however no hcoo was detected which demonstrated that the carbene hydrolysis ends when it is hydrolyzed to co table s6 thus the products of ch4 and cf are formed in parallel rather than in sequential reactions the production of ch4 is likely to bypass the formation of cf as an intermediate thus ch4 is mainly produced by carbene reduction and may be partially converted from co also the degradation path of ct by fe ii in the si fe ii co precipitates is consistent with our previous study fig s10 jia et al 2022 the difference of eh for si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii is not significant which demonstrates their reactivity difference is not mainly resulted from the different eh values fig 3b the utilization ratio ur 1 47 0 02 and electron selectivity es 85 1 of si fe ii iii are the highest among the three types of si fe ii co precipitates fig 3c the reduction rate of ct by si fe ii iii became slower with the increase of sio3 2 dosage from 0 to 10 mm fig s11 and the pseudo first order rate constant k1 decreased from 0 084 min 1 to 0 00672 min 1 fig 3d sio2 was found to inhibit the reduction of organic halogenated compounds and nitroaromatic compounds by its adsorption on the surface of fe ii yin et al 2018 also the excess si may form a polymeric matrix enclosing the si fe ii co precipitate pokrovski et al 2003 covering the reductive active sites the presence of sio2 in co precipitates has been confirmed by xrd fig 1g and the amount of produced sio2 in si fe ii co precipitate may increase with the increase of sio3 2 dosage boland et al 2011 the percentage of cf increased from 58 7 to 72 5 when the si dosage increased from 0 to 5 mm and then decreased to 37 3 when the si dosage was 10 mm dcm increased from 0 57 to 7 6 and then decreased to 0 ch4 increased from 1 24 to 9 2 and then decreased to 0 the products of cf dcm and ch4 all reached the maximum when the dosage of si was 5 mm the zeta potentials of si fe ii iii co precipitates decreased gradually with the increase of si dosage and the values were all positive fig 3e this indicates that the si fe ii iii co precipitates become poorly dispersed with the increase of si dosage the halogenated radical intermediates can transform to halogenated carbine anion species by electron addition mccormick and adriaens 2004 also the positively charged si fe ii surface feii o si can stabilize carbene anions regardless of the properties of these surface bound intermediates this series of continuous hydrogenation reduction can eventually form ch4 jia et al 2022 the presence of inorganic anions so4 2 co3 2 po4 3 no3 decreased the ct reduction rate constant k1 from 0 04419 min 1 to 0 03013 min 1 0 02331 min 1 0 02145 min 1 and 0 01896 min 1 respectively figs 3f and s12 the inhibitory effect is mainly due to the fact that the addition of the above inorganic anions hinders the binding of sio3 2 to fe ii which decreases the content of si fe ii iii or forms other ferrous minerals with poor reducibility wu et al 2012 the k1 increased from 0 04419 min 1 to 0 04887 min 1 in the presence of 1 mg l ha which may be resulted from the enhanced electron transfer by quinones functional groups in ha scott et al 1998 on the other hand the presence of ca2 and mg2 enhanced the removal of ct by si fe ii iii k1 is 0 04866 min 1 and 0 0519 min 1 respectively the addition of ca2 or mg2 may precipitate as casio3 or mgsio3 which favors the adsorption of ct casio3 and or mgsio3 can be regarded as coagulant agents contributing to the removal of ct cui et al 2017 the addition of fe iii inhibited the reductive dechlorination of ct k1 is 0 03087 min 1 and the sample changed from white to blue green it is expected that gr huang and hansen 2016 and or ferric silicate minerals are produced schwertmann and thalmann 1976 which results in a decreased reductive reactivity figs 3g and s13 reveal the effect of different forms of nature occurring si on the reductive dechlorination of ct when si exists as h2sio3 colloid the reductive rate of ct can reach 0 03713 min 1 the reaction rate of ct with the addition of sio2 is slightly higher than that of sio3 2 when si exists as si2o5 2 the reaction rate is the fastest 0 05254 min 1 this result is in line with a previous founding that si2o5 2 fe ii complex has a high reductive reactivity at neutral ph 6 8 cui et al 2017 when sio4 4 was co precipitated with fe ii the ct reduction rate was the lowest 0 00809 min 1 it should be noted that sio3 2 fe ii co precipitates can dechlorinate ct to more amount of ch4 the morphology of si has a significant influence on the reductive reactivity and product distribution in the si fe ii co precipitates ct system according to the tetrahedral model sidorov 2007 silicates are classified as chain silicates sio3 2 and h2sio3 framework silicates sio2 layer silicates si2o5 2 and monosilicate sio4 4 their intermolecular bond types short bridge bond asymmetric bridge short and long bond terminal non bridge bond bond length and bond angle are quite different liebau 1985 these results demonstrate that the coordination environment of fe ii is affected by the morphology of si the xps results show that the electrons donation of fe ii varies greatly under different coordination environments therefore their intermolecular bond types may be the main reason for the varied fe ii activity the reductive reactivities of si fe ii co precipitates were further evaluated in real groundwater matrices the reduction of ct by si fe ii co precipitates in real groundwater was inhibited compared with that in ultrapure water the percentage of cf dcm and ch4 decreased significantly fig 3h the presence of interfering ions in real groundwater hinders the ct reduction by si fe ii co precipitate which is in line with the influence of background ions observed in fig 3f still 40 of ct is dechlorinated by si fe ii iii k1 0 00617 min 1 indicating its high selectivity for ct reduction in real groundwater matrices figs 3h and s14 3 3 mechanism for the enhanced electron transfer 3 3 1 structural distortion internal electric field and vacancies the δeq values of fe ii doublet in si fe ii iii is relatively large among the si fe ii co precipitates table s2 for six coordinated fe ii species low extent distortion of octahedral structures results in large values of quadrupole splitting δeq bancroft et al 1968 it has been reported that more distorted fe ii polyhedrons in minerals e g epidote hibonite were corresponded to a lower δeq value burns 1994 because the symmetry of the d electron cloud distribution of the six coordinated fe ii is not coordinated with the geometry of the ligand according to the jahn taller effect pearson 1975 the degeneracy of the d orbital of fe ii is reduced and the stability is improved therefore the small distortion of the fe ii octahedral structure can improve the reductive reactivity of fe oh 2 thus the structural distortion of the fe ii octahedron of si fe ii iii is smaller than that of si fe ii i which may be related to a higher reductive activity of si fe ii iii pearson 1975 on the other hand si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii contain two and one fe ii sextet respectively table s2 a higher center shift cs value of fe ii sextets in the hyperfine interaction corresponds to a lower s electron density of fe ii murad and cashion 2004 si fe ii iii has the lowest cs value of 1 087 mm s among the si fe ii co precipitates therefore fe ii in the si fe ii iii is likely to donate more electrons to o atoms the structural distortion of the fe ii octahedron may be caused by the jahn teller effect and vacancies kato et al 2004 according to the previous research the more vacancies the smaller the distortion kato et al 2004 our results show that the concentration of vacancies decreases in the order of si fe ii i si fe ii ii si fe ii iii which is the same order for the extent of structural distortion the contradiction between our results and previous studies shows that the jahn teller effect rather than vacancies determine the structural distortion of si fe ii co precipitates the low extent of structural distortion for si fe ii iii may lead to its high reductive reactivity the electronegativity of si is greater than that of fe therefore the increased coordination number of fe after si doping may result in a large electron density around si lyu et al 2016 this spontaneously leads to a higher electron density of the lattice o2 adjacent to the lattice si and a lower electron density of the lattice o2 adjacent to the lattice fe the epr signal intensity of si fe ii co precipitates synthesized in different hydroxylation sequences is quite different indicating a diversified chemical environment of fe ii fig 2d the binding energy of the surface fe species of si fe ii co precipitates at 724 8 723 4 ev and 709 9 711 3 ev can be assigned to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of fe ii respectively fig s3a this binding energy is higher than that of fe ii in feo 722 8 and 709 8 ev confirming the electron deficient properties near the fe sites in si fe ii co precipitates graat and somers 1996 therefore the higher electron density is concentrated in the lattice o2 adjacent to the lattice si in the structure of si fe ii co precipitates lower electron density is distributed near the fe site forming countless internal electric fields gao et al 2018 the electron rich o center acts as a cathode and the lattice fe acts as a anode lyu et al 2018 the direction of the internal electric field is from the electron rich center to the electron deficient center fig 4 a d zhang et al 2021 in the presence of countless internal electric fields in the si fe ii co precipitates electrons are transferred from the electron poor region fe ii to the lattice o2 adjacent to the si fig 4e however the concentrations of si a vacancies in si fe ii co precipitates increased in the order of si fe ii iii si fe ii ii si fe ii i the electron deficient si a vacancies readily withdraw capture electrons within the si fe ii structure watkins and corbett 1961 inhibiting the possible electron transfer from fe ii to the electron rich lattice o2 which is adjacent to si atoms in other words because the electronegativity of fe ii is lower than that of si χfe ii 1 64 χsi 1 74 fe ii transfers more electrons to its adjacent o atoms oterm than si liebau 1985 fig 4e as a result the oterm transfers part of its electron density to adjacent si atoms thus the region with the highest electron density is closer to si the increase of charge density around tetrahedral si spontaneously increases the electron density of its adjacent o atoms this causes the h atom connected to the o atom get electrons first fig 4e and the hydroxyl group linked to the tetrahedral si is reduced to h2 therefore the highest reactivity of si fe ii iii is derived from its unique electronic structure fig 2 3 3 2 internal electric field enhanced by surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed ct si fe ii co precipitates alone can produce hydrogen via the oxidation of surface oh groups figs 4a c 5 a and s16 hadjiivanov 2014 the concentration of released h2 increases gradually with time also the h2 released from the si fe ii iii is relatively high at 90 min compared with si fe ii i and si fe ii ii the reason is that si fe ii iii not only has the highest amount of surface hydroxyl groups fig 1i but also has the strongest reductive strength fig 4c the addition of ct promoted the generation of hydrogen in the system fig 5b the chlorine of ct is an electrophilic group caballero garcia et al 2016 which leads to an increased electron density in the electron rich region and the oxidation of hydroxyl groups on the surface also the presence of cf and dcm promoted the production of h2 in the system fig s17 which further proves that the chlorine atoms with high electronegativity can promote the release of h2 although si fe ii i and si fe ii ii also produced hydrogen they show no reductive reactivity towards ct fig s6a b thus the possible active hydrogen intermediate which may be formed during hydrogen evolution reaction did not contribute to the ct reduction if any the surface hydroxyl groups of si fe ii co precipitates and the chlorine groups of ct are both electrophilic groups which both promote the electron donation of the electron rich region in the internal electric field on the other hand the hydroxyl groups and chlorine groups both consume the same fe ii electron source for their subsequent transformations the properties of si fe ii iii at different phs were characterized since the concentrations of surface hydroxyl groups were determined by ph ftir shows that the intensity of the oh stretching vibration of fe2 3oh at 3620 cm 1 increases with ph fig 5c the fe oh and h2ooh 3450 cm 1 stretching vibration is the strongest for the si fe ii iii synthesized at ph 5 doelsch et al 2001 two distinct h2o characteristic peaks at 3180 cm 1 and 2180 cm 1 were observed under acidic conditions the peak at 3180 cm 1 can be attributed to the first overtone in the bend due to the strong fermi resonance between the symmetrical tension and bending of h2o and the peak at 2180 cm 1 is the association band of water mccoy 2014 when dissolved sio3 2 and fe ii ions co precipitation at neutral and alkaline conditions the bending vibration of ho h shifts from 1600 cm 1 to 1620 cm 1 also the asymmetric stretching vibration of si o si shifts from 1100 cm 1 to 1010 cm 1 wang et al 2018 showing that the coordination environment of fe ii in the dissolved state is quite different from that in the solid state the open circuit potentials of si fe ii iii become more negative with the increase in ph indicating that si fe ii iii is less stable at higher phs fig s15a the arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis decreases gradually with the increase of ph fig s15b which indicates that the interfacial electron transfer rate is the fastest at ph 13 zhang et al 2019 the corrosion current at ph 13 is the highest 2 522 10 6a among all the samples which demonstrates that si fe ii iii has the highest reductive reactivity at ph 13 fig s15c and table s7 these results indicate the decrease of the electron density around fe lyu et al 2016 strengthening the internal electric field with the increased concentration of oh in addition the h2 released by si fe ii iii increases gradually with increasing ph fig 5d under the same ph conditions the production of h2 was boosted in the presence of ct fig 5e this phenomenon further proves that the increase of hydroxyl concentration and the presence of ct can enhance the internal electric field the si fe ii iii co precipitates were fully dissolved at ph 5 which led to a diminished reductive reactivity fig 5f no surface hydroxyl groups were coordinated with si fe ii under acidic conditions and the internal electric field was not formed on the other hand the reduction rate of ct by si fe ii iii increased gradually with increasing ph figs 5f and s18 and was the highest at ph 13 k1 0 88738 min 1 the increased amount of hydroxyl groups may enhance the internal electric field and promotes the electrons transfer from si fe ii iii to ct with the increase of ph si fe ii iii is mainly fesio3 with an increased crystallinity and a small amount of poorly crystallized sio2 fig 5g this phenomenon confirms the essential role of fesio3 in the reduction of ct by the si fe ii iii si fe ii iii denoted as feii o si oh is produced at ph 7 fig s19 the zeta potential of si fe ii iii gradually changed from positive to negative with the increase of ph fig 5h moreover ch4 was observed as one of the dechlorination products of ct demonstrating the ch4 can be produced by carbene hydrolysis the accumulation of co may not be further transformed into hcoo table s6 which leads to the transformation of co to ch4 li and farrell 2000 also the number of electrons donated by fe ii e0 is the sum of that consumed by ct reduction ep and by hydrogen release reaction ei fig 5i this further reveals that the surface hydroxyl groups and ct consume the same fe ii electron source for further transformations the values of ep 6 5 1021 and ei 1 3 1021 are the largest for si fe ii iii among the studied si fe ii co precipitates table s8 demonstrating the highest reductive reactivity of si fe ii iii the si exists as monosilicic acid si oh 4 in aqueous solution at ph 7 fig s19 the actual forms of dissolved si depends on the mineral composition especially its surface properties temperature ph and solution matrices mainly in low polymerization and high polymerization silicic acid molecules dietzel 2000 when silicate coexists with oh si fe ii i sio oh 3 is formed fe ii tends to combine with oh to form ferrous hydroxyl complex fhc fhc is mainly in the form of fe2 oh 3cl and the remaining fe ii are sufficient to form dissolved fe sio oh 3 2 when silicic acid in solution reaches saturation it can precipitate in the form of amorphous sio2 gunnarsson i and s 2000 this process is similar to the formation of si fe ii ii except that fe ii combines with hydroxyl groups to form fe oh 2 jia et al 2022 however the formation of si fe ii iii differs from both si fe ii i and si fe ii ii the hydroxyl groups on the surface of sio oh 3 are consumed at ph 7 5 8 fe ii coupled with si to form dissolved ferrous silicate which precipitate when the solution ph is adjusted to neutral thus hydroxylation sequence influence the formation of different species of fe and si before coupling which further affects the physical and chemical reaction of the coupling process ion competition adsorptive complexation and precipitation reaction occurred during the formation of si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii respectively the varied reactions lead to significant differences in fe ii octahedral structure electron donating capacity and vacancy concentrations of si fe ii co precipitates resulting in dramatic reactivity differences of si fe ii i si fe ii ii and si fe ii iii 4 environmental significance fe and si are the fourth and second abundant elements in the earth s crust the interaction between them is central to many vital geochemical processes in various natural and engineered environments doong et al 2003 johnson et al 1997 the fe si interaction in a real environment is complex a tiny variation e g hydroxylation sequences may result in dramatical difference in the microstructure and reactivity of the formed fe si co precipitates with the same chemical compositions our work shows that si fe ii iii has stronger reductive dechlorination activity for ct than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii although all three si fe ii co precipitants have the same chemical compositions fig s3a the high reductive reactivity of si fe ii iii may stem from the low extent of structural distortion low concentration of vacancies and the presence of internal electric field enhanced by surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed ct molecules this work deepens our understanding of the stability phase transformation reductive reactivity and application of si fe ii phases which are abundant in natural subsurface environment 5 conclusion this study demonstrates the diversity of structure and reactivity for si fe ii co precipitants formed in a possible natural subsurface environment the different hydroxylation sequences of si have a significant influence on the coordination environment of the redox active fe ii site significant differences in the phase compositions of si fe ii co precipitates were observed with different synthesis methods si fe ii i and si fe ii ii mainly contain amorphous fe ii and a small amount of si while si fe ii iii contains highly crystallized fesio3 mössbauer spectrum shows that the structure of fe ii octahedron in the si fe ii iii has the least distortion xps data show that the electron donating ability of fe ii in the si fe ii iii is higher than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii epr results further show si fe ii iii has no vacancy tga data shows that si fe ii iii contains many interlayered water molecules and surface hydroxyl groups electrochemical characterization shows that the si fe ii iii is more redox active than si fe ii i and si fe ii ii ferrous silicate at higher ph has higher crystallinity and more surface hydroxyl groups the existence of feii o si may stabilize ccl2 which is beneficial to carbene reduction the si fe ii co precipitates consist of countless internal electric fields and the transformation of hydroxyl groups and ct both consumed electrons however the coexistence of hydroxyl groups and ct increases the electron density in the electron rich region due to electronegativity enhancing their electron accepting capabilities the low extent of structural distortion low concentration of vacancies and the presence of an internal electric field enhanced by surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed ct molecules in si fe ii iii lead to its high reductive reactivity compared with the other si fe ii co precipitates with the same chemical composition declaration of competing interest the authors

15294,rivers are globally significant natural sources of atmospheric methane ch4 however the effect of land use changes on riverine ch4 dynamics particularly in tropical zones remain ambiguous yet important to predict and anticipate the present and future contribution of rivers to the global ch4 budget the present study examines the magnitude and drivers of riverine ch4 concentration and emission in the tropical krishna river kr basin india the large spatial variability of ch4 concentration 0 03 to 185 34 μmol l 1 and emissions 0 04 mmol m 2 d 1 to 1666 24 mmol m 2 d 1 in the kr basin was linked to the site specific features of the catchments through which rivers are draining several fold higher ch4 concentration and emission was observed for the urban river sites 64 63 53 17 µmol l 1 and 294 15 371 52 mmol m2 d 1 respectively than the agricultural 1 05 2 22 µmol l 1 and 3 45 9 72 mmol m2 d 1 respectively and forested 0 49 0 23 µmol l 1 and 1 26 0 73 mmol m2 d 1 respectively sites the concentrations of dissolved oxygen total phosphorus and chlorophyll a were significant hydrochemical variables strongly coupled with the dissolved ch4 concentrations on the other hand percentage of built up area emerged as the most important landscape level driver indicating that urbanization has an overriding effect on riverine ch4 concentration in the agriculture dominated kr basin our study supports the growing notion that tropical urban rivers are hotspot of ch4 emission furthermore we show that the pattern of increasing in riverine ch4 concentration with built up area is a general feature of asian river basins as the urban land cover and population following an exponential increase asian rivers might contribute substantially to the regional and global ch4 budget graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane tropical rivers and streams land use changes urbanization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the atmospheric concentration of methane ch4 a highly potent greenhouse gas ghg responsible for 20 of the global warming induced by all ghgs ciais et al 2013 reached its highest ever level of 1 9 ppm in 2021 despite covering only small area of the land surface rivers and streams are recognized as significant contributors towards this atmospheric ch4 build up bastviken et al 2011 stanley et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 li et al 2021 however large uncertainty exists in the current ch4 emission estimates for the global rivers and streams is attributed to the complexity induced by in river morphometry hydrology biogeochemical processing within the aquatic systems and changes in the land use pattern stanley et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 li et al 2021 at local scale the variability in riverine ch4 concentrations and thus emission is driven by the water chemistry which in turn is linked to the land use pattern of the catchments the rivers are draining through accordingly a growing number of studies showed that fluvial ch4 emissions are exacerbated by the catchment modifications particularly in terms of agriculture and urbanization begum et al 2021 xia et al 2022 borges et al 2018 stanley et al 2016 crawford and stanley 2016 since most of the asian river basins are susceptible to large scale alterations due to an exponentially growing population rivers draining through the urbanized and agricultural landscapes can be hotspots of ch4 emission the land use changes linked to agriculture and urbanization affect riverine ch4 dynamics in multiple ways first fertilizer runoff from agriculture catchments causes eutrophication in the receiving waterbodies which in turn enhances the supply of organic matter to the methanogenic zones and stimulates ch4 production abril and iversen 2002 delsontro et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 subsequently rivers and streams draining through agriculture dominated catchments are shown to emit more ch4 relative to undisturbed catchments bodmer et al 2016 mwanake et al 2022 andrews et al 2021 wu et al 2020 second sewage discharge from urbanised areas supplies nutrients and highly labile organic matter which in turn cause hypoxia in receiving waterbodies in addition to enhancing methanogenesis hu et al 2018 xia et al 2022 third several studies showed that hypoxic condition can also reduce the efficiency of methanotrophic mitigation of ch4 emissions bednařík et al 2017 bodmer et al 2020 shelley et al 2017 lastly in addition to enhancing methanogenesis in the anoxic sediments sewage itself can be a source of ch4 zou et al 2009 yu et al 2017 alshboul et al 2016 and in the areas where sewage treatment facilities are inadequate untreated sewage find its way to streams rivers and enhance riverine ch4 emissions despite the global pattern of decreasing riverine ch4 emission with increasing latitude li et al 2021 landscape modifications can alter the magnitude of ch4 emissions within a climatic zone for example ch4 emission from the cropland draining tropical rivers and streams of africa is several folds higher than the forested streams mwanake et al 2022 in the sub tropical tuojia river basin china riverine ch4 emissions increase along an increasing gradient of agricultural catchment area wu et al 2020 similarly in temperate meuse river basin riverine ch4 concentration increased exponentially with the percentage agricultural area borges et al 2018 however urbanization mediated anthropogenic disturbance exhibits a greater influence on the riverine ch4 emission than agricultural modifications for instance the urban stretches of yangtze river china exhibited 5 fold more ch4 emission 8 93 14 29 mmol m 2 d 1 than the rural areas 1 91 1 42 mmol m 2 d 1 the mixed landscape of chaohu basin china diffusive ch4 fluxes in the urban rivers 9 44 mmol m 2 d 1 were 5 1 9 8 and 10 4 times higher than the agricultural forested and mixed landscapes xia et al 2022 similarly ch4 emission from the sewage draining rivers of haihe river basin china 1 69 1 62 mmol m 2 d 1 was 3 11 times higher than the natural rivers hu et al 2018 the impact of urbanization mediated catchment modification on riverine ch4 emission is further evident from the catchment restoration efforts compared to six heavily polluted urban streams of the chongqing metropolitan area china 7 65 9 20 mmol m 2 d 1 comprehensive watershed restoration resulted 7 times reduction in ch4 emission from restored rivers wang et al 2022 in the freshwater reaches of highly polluted adyar river estuary india the average ch4 emission is 11 89 21 13 mmol m 2 d 1 rajkumar et al 2008 furthermore urban stretches of three major rivers in the asian continent river ganges river mekong and yellow river showed substantially elevated ch4 concentration than the sites with agricultural and or forested catchments begum et al 2021 together higher ch4 emission from streams and rivers draining through urbanised areas than the agricultural watersheds is a general feature of both tropical see also yu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 and temperate kuhn et al 2017 gu et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 landscapes despite the growing recognition on the importance of tropical rivers and streams on global ch4 budget li et al 2021 sawakuchi et al 2014 the effect of land use changes on riverine greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions are not well delineated for the most populous asian continent where swift land use changes are being taking place nevertheless a recent compilation showed that urbanization has an overriding effect than agricultural landscape modification on carbon dioxide emissions from inland waters wang et al 2022 yet it remains unknown how inland water ch4 emissions respond to catchment modification in the tropical asian river basins despite covering only 2 4 of the world s land surface and having only 4 of the world s freshwater resources 18 of the world s population resides in india consequently streams and rivers in the indian subcontinent are susceptible to large levels of pollution due to exponentially expanding urbanization and agricultural activities to support the burgeoning population yet our current understanding on the effects of land use changes on ch4 emission from indian rivers is limited here we examine the drivers of ch4 dynamics in a tropical indian river network with an objective to understand the magnitude and variability of ch4 concentrations and emissions and their landscape level drivers this study was conducted in the tropical krishna river basin india in which about 75 of the basin is agricultural land but the remaining portion of the landscape include the tropical rain forests rangelands and two highly urbanised metropolitan areas providing a unique fluvial network to examine the influence of land use changes on riverine ch4 emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the krishna river basin kr basin situated between 13 5 58ʺ 19 24 35ʺ n and 73 20 28ʺ 81 0 43ʺ e is the 5th largest river system in india and covers an area of 2 58 948 km2 encompassing 8 of india s total geographical area fig 1 this basin has total 74 million inhabitants with an average population density of 287 km 2 the basin boundary at the western region is characterised by the western ghats where elevation ranges from 600 m to 1903 m the interior part of the basin is a plateau with 300 to 600 m elevation with a general eastward slope majority of the basin 55 of the total area falls under the elevation zone of 500 750 m this tropical river basin is mostly semi arid and dry except for the western ghat region which is dominated by a humid climate the annual average rainfall for the basin is 840 mm of which 90 occurs between june and october biggs et al 2007 the long term average temperature 1969 to 2004 for the basin is 26 3 c while the average temperature for the month of january winter april summer and july monsoon were 22 4 c 29 5 c 26 1 c respectively wris india the rivers and streams of the kr basin originate mostly from the western ghats join the main river krishna river which finally confluence with the bay of bengal fig 1 there are five major rivers in the kr network krishna river the largest among all and main stem of the river network length 1400 km into which other tributaries join fig 1 the second largest river is the bhima river 861 km and joins with the krishna river and other rivers include the tunga bhadra river 552 km musi river 352 km and munneru river 218 km the land use land cover lulc data for the year 2021 fig 1 shows 74 4 of the basin is covered by agricultural land followed by rangeland 12 8 forest 5 6 and built up area 4 7 there was a substantial change in the lulc pattern in the kr basin for last two decades mostly in terms of built up area which is increased by 10 during 2005 2015 period while the agricultural area remained more or less constant chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 the most urbanized areas in the river network are in the upper musi river and bhima river hyderabad and pune cities respectively the two major metropolitan regions of the country with a total population of 10 3 million and 6 8 million respectively these cities discharge a large amount of treated and untreated sewage effluents into the musi and bhima rivers hyderabad city generates about 1250 million litres per day mld sewage of which only 605 mld is treated and rest of the sewage directly discharged into the musi river sultana and sultana 2021 on the other hand of the 744 mld of sewage generated in the pune city about 75 treated which mixes with untreated sewage and discharges into the upper reaches of bhima river https www pmc gov in en drainage in the agriculture dominated watershed major crops include rice jawar great millet corn pulses wheat sugarcane groundnut and grass fodder biggs et al 2007 the forest in the basin is dominated by deciduous forest 14 659 km2 followed by degraded scrub forest 5203 km2 and evergreen forests 5203 km2 2 2 sampling approach we sampled 120 locations fig 1 within the agriculture dominated kr network during the pre monsoon march of 2021 and 2022 fig s1 we selected the dry season to explore the spatial variability in ch4 concentrations and emissions since previous studies in the two tropical indian rivers river adyar and river ganges showed that ch4 concentration is highest during this period rajkumar et al 2008 begum et al 2021 but the underlying processes were not well understood here we sampled the kr network to capture the magnitude of ch4 oversaturation and emissions at a greater spatial resolution than previous studies in indian rivers to delineate the hydrochemical and landscape level drivers in the year 2021 a total of 53 sites covering 33 stations in the musi river and 20 sites in the krishna river were sampled fig s1 in march 2022 another 67 sites across 4 tributaries including wyra river n 7 munneru river n 12 tunga bhadra river n 22 bhima river n 17 and 9 sites in the upstream region of the krishna river main channel fig s1 were sampled although the field campaigns were conducted in different years they were in the month of march expecting similar environmental variability and anthropogenic disturbances influencing the riverine ch4 concentrations and emissions at each sampling site

pre evacuated vials the temperature of the water in the 140 ml syringes was also measured after equilibration to account for the ambient ch4 partial pressure pch4 calculations 2 3 laboratory analyses

the land use land cover lulc data 10 m 10 m sentinel 2 from esri the kr watershed was delineated using the hydrology toolbox of arcgis pro the lulc statistics total and percentage area of built up land agriculture area forest area rangeland area etc for the entire delineated watershed was made using arcmap ver 10 8 1 furthermore the larger kr basin was divided into sub basins using global scale sub basins boundaries of hydrosheds lehner and grill 2013 accordingly the kr basin was divided into a total of 33 sub basins with area ranging from 444 to 91 557 km2 with a large variability in lulc pattern table s1 fig s2 the channel slope of each river reach in the sub basin was calculated as the maximum minus the average elevation m of the reach divided by half the length m of the reach

transformed to attain normality and homoscedasticity the statistical analysis includes analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd honest significant difference as well as multiple linear regression mlr analysis 3 results 3 1 variability in hydrology water chemistry ch4 concentration and diffusive ch4 flux we sampled a total of 120 stations within the kr basin in the month of march 2021 and 2022 the water temperature across the study sites varied widely from 23 68 to 34 22 c table 1 the concentration of do varied from near anoxic conditions 0 10 mg l 1 to as high as 20 57 mg l 1 similarly a large variability in the concentrations of doc 1 96 43 32 mg l 1 acdom440 0 43 13 74 m 1 turbidity 0 6 66 9 ntu tp 0 20 87 94 μmoll 1 and chlorophyll a 3 6 350 05 μg l 1 was observed in the river network table 1 notably these changes were associated the site specific properties of the rivers and streams the sampling sites close to urbanized areas fig 1 in the basin exhibited significantly low do concentrations than the sites with agriculture and forested watersheds p 0 0001 tukey kramer hsd figs 2a s3 a on the other hand concentrations of doc and tp were highly significantly different and increased systematically from the forested to agricultural and urban sites figs 2 b c s3 b c similarly chlorophyll a concentration was higher in the urbanised sites relative to the sites close to the agricultural and forested areas figs 2d s3 d the streams and rivers sampled in the kr basin were consistently oversaturated with ch4 as a response to the large variability in the hydrochemistry ch4 concentration spanned four orders of magnitude 0 03 to 185 34 μmol l 1 with a mean sd concentration of 13 18 34 05 μmol l 1 median 0 55 μmol l 1 iqr 0 30 2 61 μmol l 1 table 1 the concentration of ch4 was significantly higher in urbanized sites 64 63 53 17 μmol l 1 median 49 55 μmol l 1 iqr 15 37 90 99 μmol l 1 relative to agricultural 1 05 2 22 μmol l 1 median 0 43 μmol l 1 iqr 0 24 0 80 μmol l 1 and forested sites 0 49 0 23 μmol l 1 median 0 57 μmol l 1 iqr 0 36 0 66 μmol l 1 fig 3 a fig s4 based on the air water ch4 concentration gradient water flow velocity and river channel slope the rate of diffusive ch4 flux was estimated for each sampling site the ch4 emission rates ranged widely from 0 04 mmol m 2 d 1 to 1666 24 mmol m 2 d 1 mean 58 95 197 01 mmol m 2 d 1 table 1 evidently the ch4 fluxes followed nonnormal distribution with a median rate of 1 60 mmol m 2 d 1 iqr 0 48 9 07 mmol m 2 d 1 the diffusive ch4 emission was significantly high in the urbanized areas with a mean flux rate of 294 15 371 52 mmol m2 d 1 median 144 34 mmol m2 d 1 iqr 59 29 505 39 mmol m2 d 1 than the sampling sites draining through the agricultural mean 3 45 9 72 mmol m2 d 1 median 1 07 mmol m2 d 1 iqr 0 34 3 15 mmol m2 d 1 and forested mean 1 26 0 73 mmol m2 d 1 median 1 25 mmol m2 d 1 iqr 0 78 1 88 mmol m2 d 1 areas fig 3b 3 2 hydrological and biogeochemical control of riverine ch4 concentration combining all our dataset the concentration of dissolved ch4 was unrelated to the variability in water temperature and the flow velocity fig s5 however ch4 concentration was strongly negatively correlated with do r2 0 72 p 0 0001 but positively correlated with the concentrations of doc r2 0 17 p 0 0001 tp r2 0 42 p 0 0001 and chlorophyll a r2 0 16 p 0 0001 fig 4 furthermore we explored the combined effects of various physico chemical drivers on riverine ch4 concentrations using mlr analysis with elastic net variable selection procedure and aic validation while we used all measured atmospheric and limnological variables air pressure air temperature water temperature ph do doc tp acdom440 turbidity and chlorophyll a as candidate independent variables only variables that were statistically significant in the elastic net variable selection procedure were retained in the final model accordingly the final model was ln ch4 µmol l 1 0 07 0 93 ln do 0 33 ln chlorophyll a 0 22 ln tp 6 r 2 0 80 p 0 0001 where do chlorophyll a and tp were in mg l 1 µg l 1 and µmol l 1 respectively corresponding statistical significance for individual variables were p 0 0001 for do p 0 0054 for chlorophyll a and p 0 0052 for tp fig s6 3 3 land use drivers of riverine methane concentrations the concentration of ch4 showed large spatial heterogeneity in the river network since this variability was linked to differences in the features of the immediate catchment fig 3 we further explored the land use drivers of riverine ch4 concentration in order to do so we divided the larger kr basin into sub basins using hydrosheds based sub basin delineation although the sub basin delineation divided the entire kr basin into 33 sub basins our sampling sites were distributed across 18 sub basins with large variability in lulc pattern table s1 fig s2 the sub basins catchments were dominated by agriculture land mean 75 2 range 30 95 7 followed by the rangeland mean 11 5 range 1 6 31 2 and built up area mean 5 3 range 1 4 22 8 at the sub basin scale the average ch4 concentration varied from 0 09 72 28 µmol l 1 and strongly positively correlated with the percentage of built up area r2 0 66 p 0 0001 fig 5 however a weak but negative correlation was observed between ch4 concentration and the percentage of agricultural area r2 0 30 p 0 0199 fig s7 furthermore we used mlr analysis with elastic net variable selection procedure using various lulc features see table s1 as candidate independent variables to examine the sub basin scale ch4 variability the built up area and rangeland area were the only statistically significant predictive variables and the resulting mlr model took the form of ln ch4 µmol l 1 2 30 3 03 ln built up area 1 00 ln rangeland area 7 r 2 0 80 p 0 0001 n 18 both the predictive variables were statistically significant with p 0 0001 for the percentage of built up area and p 0 0063 for rangeland area 4 discussion here we show that despite covering only a small proportion built up area plays a disproportionately large role in controlling the riverine ch4 concentrations in the agriculture dominated kr basin within this tropical river basin there are large differences in the landscape features which translated into a wide variability in the inputs of organic matter and nutrients in the fluvial networks subsequently the average ch4 concentrations and emission in the urban sites were several folds higher than the sites with the agricultural and forested catchments our data suggest that urban rivers and streams of this tropical river basins are ch4 hotspots where concentrations and emissions reach the upper limits of what has been reported in the literature stanley et al 2016 li et al 2021 stanley et al 2022 furthermore the strong correlation between ch4 concentrations and various biogeochemical proxies do doc tp and chlorophyll a emphasize the need to account for the local anthropogenic perturbations in deriving fluvial ch4 emissions the strong correlation between built up area and ch4 concentration suggests urbanization as a key land use driver of fluvial ch4 emissions and this relationship may help to estimate the current and future ch4 emissions across highly populous south east asian river basins 4 1 large variability of ch4 concentration and emission driven by catchment properties spanning across the pristine forested catchments of the western ghats agriculture dominated catchments in the middle to lower reaches and two highly urbanised areas of india hyderabad and pune the krishna river network experiences large variability in organic matter and nutrients inputs subsequently ch4 concentration in this tropical river basin varied widely from 0 03 to 185 34 μmol l 1 fig s4 the average ch4 concentration 13 18 34 05 μmol l 1 and emission 58 95 197 01 mmol m 2 d 1 in the kr basin are much higher than the values estimated for global streams and rivers by stanley et al 2016 concentration 1 35 5 16 μmol l 1 and emission 8 22 25 50 mmol m 2 d 1 li et al 2021 emission 8 40 0 72 mmol m 2 d 1 and stanley et al 2022 concentration 1 49 10 69 μmol l 1and emission 7 31 86 4 mmol m 2 d 1 similarly the median ch4 concentration and emission in the kr basin 0 55 μmol l 1 and 1 60 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively were 2 fold higher than the respective global median values of 0 25 μmol l 1 and 0 86 mmol m 2 d 1 estimated by stanley et al 2016 and 2 4 times higher than the recently updated global median concentration and fluxes of 0 20 μmol l 1 and 0 44 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively stanley et al 2022 furthermore the average ch4 emission rates estimated for the kr basin was much higher than the recently compiled average ch4 emission for the tropical rivers and streams 15 46 1 95 mmol m 2 d 1 li et al 2021 these higher ch4 emission rates estimated for the kr basin cannot be attributed to the urbanization alone for example excluding the urban hotspots the average emission rate estimates for the agricultural and forested sites 3 18 9 13 mmol m 2 d 1 were much higher than the rates reported for sub tropical streams and rivers with agricultural and forested catchments 0 09 0 15 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 03 0 03 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively andrews et al 2021 similarly the average ch4 emission in the non urban sites of the kr basin is higher than the agricultural and forested dominated sub tropical tuojia river basin 0 10 0 09 mmol m 2 d 1 wu et al 2020 and chaohu basin where agricultural and forested rivers emit ch4 at a rate of 1 85 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 91 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively xia et al 2022 the pattern of higher ch4 concentration and emissions in the urbanised river stretches than the agricultural and forested sites in the kr basin fig 3 is likely a general pattern across river basins globally see table s3 for example the urbanised reaches of tropical han river basin south korea exhibited 7 fold higher ch4 concentration than the forested river reaches jin et al 2018 the average ch4 concentration in the urbanized river sites of sub tropical chaohu basin 5 46 μmol l 1 was about 4 to 10 times higher than that of agricultural and forested rivers xia et al 2022 similarly ch4 concentration and fluxes found to increase with the extent of urbanization in the chongqing metropolitan river network wang et al 2018 the river segments draining through catchments with higher percentage of urbanised areas of the sub tropical yangtze river emits up to 6 times more ch4 than the river segments draining through less urban areas tang et al 2021 the urban rivers of chaohu basin ch4 emission is up to10 times higher than those of the non urban rivers xia et al 2022 interestingly this pattern is not only observed for the large river basins or in the tropical and sub tropical rivers for example small temperate rivers of belgium and the united states also showed a clear increase in ch4 concentration with percentage urbanized area borges et al 2018 robison et al 2022 table s3 furthermore reduction in anthropogenic inputs through catchment restoration of urbanized rivers showed substantial decline in the riverine ch4 emissions wang et al 2022 notably the average ch4 concentration in the urban sites of the kr basin 64 63 53 17 μmol l 1 fig 3a was comparable with the highly polluted urban reaches of the river ganges india 69 46 75 33 μmol l 1 and the river mekong china 48 17 115 28 μmol l 1 begum et al 2021 together pattern emerging from the kr basin and from other river basins globally table s3 consistently suggest that regardless of the size of the river basins and climatic zones urbanization induce a disproportionately large role in riverine ch4 concentrations and emission than the agricultural landscape modifications 4 2 hydrochemical drivers of riverine ch4 concentrations in the kr basin despite the wide variability in temperature 23 68 34 22 c across the study sites widely reported positive effect of temperature on ch4 concentration campeau and del giorgio 2014 crawford and stanley 2016 mcginnis et al 2016 was not observed in the kr basin during this study focussed on the spatial pattern fig s5 however lack of correlation between temperature and ch4 concentration corroborates the pattern observed for several urbanised rivers yu et al 2017 xia et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 premke et al 2020 similarly the lack of relationship between waterflow velocity and ch4 concentration in our study contradicts the pattern observed across northern rivers and streams campeau and del giorgio 2014 mcginnis et al 2016 tang et al 2021 together these results suggest that there are factors other than temperature and waterflow inducing a greater influence on the riverine ch4 concentration in this tropical river basin during the sampling accordingly the concentration of do emerged as the most important hydrochemical parameter explaining the variability of ch4 concentrations in the kr network a pattern corroborates with studies in streams and rivers transverse through diverse landscapes rulik et al 2000 andrews et al 2021 xia et al 2022 begum et al 2021 wang et al 2020 premke et al 2020 borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2022 stanley et al 2022 the pattern of increasing ch4 concentration with decreasing do in rivers is mostly attributed to the reduced methanotrophic activity under low oxygen conditions yu et al 2017 li et al 2021 in the highly urbanised river sites where we observed consistently high ch4 concentration the average do concentration was 0 43 mg l 1 range 0 10 2 24 mg l 1 the methanotrophic activity is primarily limited by the substrate ch4 availability and therefore oxidation rates increase with ch4 concentrations however unlike ch4 high do concentration is known inhibit ch4 oxidation instead the highest ch4 oxidation rates often observed at low but optimal oxygen concentrations of 0 23 1 17 mg l 1 rudd et al 1974 thottathil et al 2019 since the urbanised river sites experience high ch4 concentrations and do is within the optimal level for methanotrophy maximum oxidation rate is expected in the urban stretch of the rivers and unlikely limited by the oxygen availability therefore the extremely high ch4 concentrations observed in the urban reaches is attributable at least partly to the direct release of the untreated ch4 rich sewage from immediate vicinity of the sampling points rather than the inefficient methanotrophic ch4 consumption this seems reasonable given that capacity of the sewage treatment plants stps in the metropolitan region of hyderabad is inadequate to treat 1250 mld of sewage generated and therefore more than 50 of the untreated sewage is being released directly into the musi river sultana and sultana 2021 cpcb 2021 similarly in the city of pune 25 of untreated sewage directly released into the upper reaches of bhima river along with the treated sewage cpcb 2021 in order to examine whether sewage can be a direct source of such a high concentration of ch4 observed in the urbanized zones we sampled five stps within the kr basin our results show that both treated and untreated sewage contain substantial amount of ch4 with significantly higher concentration of ch4 in untreated 91 82 26 05 µmol l 1 than treated 37 29 29 52 µmol l 1 fig s8 sewage clearly ch4 concentration in the untreated sewage 91 82 26 05 µmol l 1 is higher than mean 64 63 53 17 μmoll 1 and median 49 55 μmoll 1 iqr 15 37 90 99 μmoll 1 concentrations across the urban river sites indicating that ch4 oversaturation in the urban river sites can be sustained at least partly by direct sewage effluents in addition to the organic matter input fuelling riverine ch4 production interestingly the high ch4 concentration in the treated sewage in the kr basin which is several folds higher than the concentration of treated wastewater across nine stps in germany 1 17 2 04 µmol l 1 alshboul et al 2016 suggests that even the release of treated sewage can enhance the riverine ch4 emissions however further studies are required to disentangle the relative importance of these two pathways riverine ch4 production versus release of ch4 rich sewage of ch4 sources in the urban rivers of the kr basin yet our data shows that an inevitable consequence of the sewage discharge is the extreme ch4 emission from the receiving rivers in response to an exponential increase of urban population 46 9 million in 2021 accounting for 35 of the total population fig s9 in india the urban sewage generation reached 62 000 mld whereas treatment capacity is only 23 277 mld cpcb 2021 the remaining 63 sewage is being discharged into the waterbodies cpcb 2021 turning the urban rivers and streams hotspots of ch4 emissions since ch4 emission rates for the urban reaches of the kr basin average 294 15 371 52 mmol m2 d 1 median 144 34 mmol m2 d 1 are towards the higher end of emissions rates reported for the global rivers and streams stanley et al 2016 li et al 2021 stanely et al 2022 urban river emissions may have large implications on the nationwide ch4 emission inventories of india we suggest that accounting for the sewage mediated urban river emissions is important for estimating total anthropogenic ch4 emissions and for the predicting the current and future ch4 emissions from indian fluvial networks furthermore we observed a strong coupling of riverine ch4 concentration with doc tp and chlorophyll a a pattern consistent with the relationship observed across rivers and streams globally hutchins et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 xia et al 2022 mwanake et al 2022 campeau and del giorgio 2014 li et al 2021 stanley et al 2022 the dissolved organic matter known to provide substrates and energy for the heterotrophic metabolism and the terminal metabolic products of which is the precursor acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen for both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis conrad 1999 therefore the strong correlation between doc and ch4 concentrations in our study suggests that doc inputs enhance ch4 production in the rivers itself and or sewage discharge supplies both doc and ch4 to the receiving waterbodies li et al 2021 marescaux et al 2018 cunada et al 2018 kim et al 2019 however in the mlr analysis do tp and chlorophyll a were emerged as the statistically significant variables and doc was not chosen to account for the ch4 variability in the final model note that the concentration of doc is often strongly negatively correlated with do in inland waters due to the strong role of doc in driving heterotrophic metabolism and subsequently resulting in do undersaturation prairie et al 2002 we observed a similar decrease in the concentration of do with increasing doc in the kr basin r2 0 50 p 0 0001 data not shown therefore the selection of do and the refusal of doc in the final model suggests that oxygen integrates multiple aspects of ch4 metabolism acts as a proxy of doc and heterotrophic metabolism which in turn influence ch4 production while partly regulating ch4 concentration itself through methanotrophic activity see thottathil et al 2019 although doc was excluded in the model tp and chlorophyll a were still significant predictor for ch4 variability a pattern widely showed across inland waters delsontro et al 2018 borges et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 stanley et al 2022 our mlr model suggest that in addition to the variability accounted for by do a proxy of organic matter supply heterotrophic metabolism and methanotrophic activity tp and chlorophyll a are still important drivers of the ch4 variability likely due to other pathways through which ch4 is related to autotrophic biomass and nutrients a likely mechanism is the ch4 production under oxic condition i e oxic ch4 production omp which is known to increase with tp and chlorophyll a concentrations donnis et al 2017 bogard et al 2014 thottathil et al 2022 however how far omp contributes towards ch4 saturation and emission in rivers and streams is remains to be studied 4 3 land use drivers of riverine ch4 concentrations we divided the larger kr basin into several sub basins and estimated the lulc pattern in each of them to understand the land use drivers of riverine ch4 concentration at sub basin scale a key outcome of this approach was the emergence of built up area as an important predictor of ch4 concentrations fig 5 across these agriculture dominated sub basins table s1 the built up area contributed only small percentage of the total landscape 2 7 in all but two sub basins where it reached up to 13 and 23 table s1 fig s2 yet the percentage of urbanized area showed a disproportionally large role in regulating riverine ch4 concentration at sub basin scale and suggest that even small scale urbanization mediated perturbations will have larger impacts on the aquatic ch4 emissions the correlation between percentage urbanized area and ch4 concentration in the kr basin is comparable to the pattern observed in the sub tropical yangtze river china wang et al 2018 furthermore we explored the consequence of further expansion of the proportion of built up area in the kr basin on riverine ch4 emissions recent modelling efforts for lulc predictions in the kr basin suggested that there will be 2 increase in the percentage of urbanised area in the kr basin by the year 2055 which will increase further to 2 5 by the year 2085 chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 given the slope of 2 26 for log log relationship between percentage built up area and ch4 concentration fig 5 the predicted 2 increase of urbanized area may lead to about 5 fold increase of ch4 concentration and thus emissions in the kr basin by 2055 due to the urbanization this increase however is reasonable given the lulc predictions showing that existing cities in the lower krishna river and upper bhima river regions figs 1 s1 hyderabad and pune are expected to have a two fold increase in area by 2055 chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 while several fold increase in ch4 emissions expected for the kr basin is due to urbanization alone the decadal temperature increase will exacerbate the ch4 emission due to the greater temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis q10 4 yvon durocher et al 2014 given that the percentage of built up area in the kr basin is relatively moderate 4 7 fig 1 compared to many other river basins of india see table s2 ch4 emission may be much higher from the urbanised reaches of other rivers the increase in ch4 concentrations with built up area and our finding of sewage as a substantial source of ch4 are particularly important for the current and future ch4 emission estimates from the fluvial networks of the total sewage generated in india 72 368 mld only 26 869 mld is treated and the remaining 63 of sewage ultimately reaches the rivers and streams cpcb 2021 since sewage generation and population are strongly positively correlated fig s10 and sewage itself is a source of ch4 fig s8 an exponentially growing urban population see fig s9 along with inadequate sewage treatment system may have huge impacts on the ch4 emission of indian inland waters therefore installation of adequate sewage treatment facilities should be a priority to improve river water quality and to reduce current and future ch4 emissions in india notably agriculture area that uniquely dominated in all sub basins 30 96 table s1 showed a negative correlation with ch4 concentration fig s7 a however this correlation cannot be considered as causation since this relationship is dependent only on one data point representing the sub basin 10 sb 10 excluding which will results in the absence of relationship between riverine ch4 concentration and agriculture area fig s7 a note that sb 10 represents the most urbanized sub basin in the kr basin pune city where percentage of built up area is 23 fig s2 table s1 subsequently the proportion of the agriculture area reduced to 30 lowest among all sub basins table s1 since built up area is the major source of organic matter and or direct source of ch4 enhancing riverine ch4 concentrations lowest agriculture area coinciding with highest percentage of built up area within the same sub basin sb 10 resulted in a negative correlation between agriculture area and ch4 concentration excluding the sub basin sb 10 the general lack of relationship between agriculture area and riverine ch4 concentration in the kr basin fig s7 a is in contrast with the positive correlation between agriculture area and ch4 concentration observed across temperate sub tropical and tropical river basins herreid et al 2021 andrews et al 2021 borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2022 however our data corroborates the pattern observed in highly urbanised yangtze river basin china where agriculture area is unrelated to riverine ch4 concentration tang et al 2021 together the uncoupling of riverine ch4 concentration and agriculture area could be a result of an overriding effect of organic matter and or sewage ch4 input from human settlements in the highly populous river basins in support to this a recent study shows that urbanization overrides agriculture productivity and hydrological delivery in enhancing the co2 emissions from inland waters wang et al 2022 however we acknowledge that sampling during high flow monsoon season may provide further insights on whether greater hydrological connectivity would result in a positive relationship between agriculture area and riverine ch4 concentration despite the large area of rivers and streams and their potential to emit ch4 in the tropical indian peninsula see li and bush 2015 quantification of ch4 concentrations and emissions in the fluvial network is scarce and fragmented premke et al 2020 begum et al 2021 rajkumar et al 2008 panneer selvam et al 2014 and upscaling is further impeded by the lack of knowledge on their landscape level drivers therefore we explored our data further to develop a mlr model for riverine ch4 concentrations using the lulc data estimated for the sampled sub basins in addition to the strong positive correlation of built up area with ch4 percentage of rangeland area 1 7 31 2 table s1 emerged as another key variable but negatively related to the riverine ch4 concentration the negative relationship between rangeland area and ch4 concentration in the mlr model suggests a decreased organic matter input into the rivers with the increasing proportion of rangeland area this relationship upholds the pattern observed in previous studies that showed lower ch4 emission from the grassland dominated rivers and the lower contribution of grasslands to the basin wide ch4 emissions garnier et al 2013 together we show that predicting riverine ch4 concentration using landscape features could help to fill the current gap on ch4 emissions from tropical indian rivers by using easily obtainable remote sensing data there are to our knowledge no similar high resolution basin wide dataset available from other indian river basins to build empirical models and upscale the regional fluvial ch4 emission which we suggest should be incorporated in future research programs we acknowledge that our dry season measurements are likely represent higher end of ch4 concentration and emission in the kr basin since the monsoonal precipitation shown to reduce ghgs emissions in the tropical rivers rajkumar et al 2008 begum et al 2021 whether the land use variables shown to drive ch4 concentrations within the kr basin in this the study may remain throughout year needs confirmation 4 4 urbanization drives riverine ch4 concentration across asian watersheds nevertheless we further explored whether the relationship between built up area and ch4 concentration observed in the kr basin is a general pattern for tropical asian rivers experiencing similar anthropogenic pressure to do so we first divided the larger basins of ganges river mekong river and cauvery river into sub basins using the hydrosheds based sub basins delineation fig s11a c next we calculated the average ch4 concentration of each of sub basin using published data begum et al 2021 premke et al 2020 fig s11 our analysis revealed a positive correlation between the percentage built up area and ch4 concentration across river basins r2 0 35 p 0 0001 fig 6 upholding the pattern observed for the kr basin thus we show that the extent of urbanization is a key driver of fluvial ch4 concentrations and emissions not only in the kr basin but in other the highly populous asian rivers however data is scarce and further studies are required for accurately quantifying and placing the growing contribution of asian fluvial networks to the global ch4 budget furthermore since urbanization could inevitably enhance the riverine ch4 oversaturation our study emphasizes the need of effective river restoration programs and adequate sewage treatment facilities to mitigate the riverine ch4 emissions 5 conclusion the extensive spatial sampling revealed hitherto unrecognised variability of ch4 concentrations and fluxes in response to site specific variability of hydrochemistry and catchment properties in the tropical kr basin in addition to the previously observed coupling of ch4 concentrations with hydrochemical variables do doc tp and chlorophyll a percentage of built up area emerged as an important land use driver of riverine ch4 dynamics furthermore we show that the relationship between built up area and ch4 concentrations shown in the kr basin is likely to be a general pattern of asian river basins we suggest that exponential increase of population and expansion of urbanization expected for the asian continent may have a large impact on aquatic ch4 emission and therefore

15294,rivers are globally significant natural sources of atmospheric methane ch4 however the effect of land use changes on riverine ch4 dynamics particularly in tropical zones remain ambiguous yet important to predict and anticipate the present and future contribution of rivers to the global ch4 budget the present study examines the magnitude and drivers of riverine ch4 concentration and emission in the tropical krishna river kr basin india the large spatial variability of ch4 concentration 0 03 to 185 34 μmol l 1 and emissions 0 04 mmol m 2 d 1 to 1666 24 mmol m 2 d 1 in the kr basin was linked to the site specific features of the catchments through which rivers are draining several fold higher ch4 concentration and emission was observed for the urban river sites 64 63 53 17 µmol l 1 and 294 15 371 52 mmol m2 d 1 respectively than the agricultural 1 05 2 22 µmol l 1 and 3 45 9 72 mmol m2 d 1 respectively and forested 0 49 0 23 µmol l 1 and 1 26 0 73 mmol m2 d 1 respectively sites the concentrations of dissolved oxygen total phosphorus and chlorophyll a were significant hydrochemical variables strongly coupled with the dissolved ch4 concentrations on the other hand percentage of built up area emerged as the most important landscape level driver indicating that urbanization has an overriding effect on riverine ch4 concentration in the agriculture dominated kr basin our study supports the growing notion that tropical urban rivers are hotspot of ch4 emission furthermore we show that the pattern of increasing in riverine ch4 concentration with built up area is a general feature of asian river basins as the urban land cover and population following an exponential increase asian rivers might contribute substantially to the regional and global ch4 budget

atmospheric concentration of methane ch4 a highly potent greenhouse gas ghg responsible for 20 of the global warming induced by all ghgs ciais et al 2013 reached its highest ever level of 1 9 ppm in 2021 despite covering only small area of the land surface rivers and streams are recognized as significant contributors towards this atmospheric ch4 build up bastviken et al 2011 stanley et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 li et al 2021 however large uncertainty exists in the current ch4 emission estimates for the global rivers and streams is attributed to the complexity induced by in river morphometry hydrology biogeochemical processing within the aquatic systems and changes in the land use pattern stanley et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 li et al 2021 at local scale the variability in riverine ch4 concentrations and thus emission is driven by the water chemistry which in turn is linked to the land use pattern of the catchments the rivers are draining through accordingly a growing number of studies showed that fluvial ch4 emissions are exacerbated by the catchment modifications particularly in terms of agriculture and urbanization begum et al 2021 xia et al 2022 borges et al 2018 stanley et al 2016 crawford and stanley 2016 since most of the asian river basins are susceptible to large scale alterations due to an exponentially growing population rivers draining through the urbanized and agricultural landscapes can be hotspots of ch4 emission the land use changes linked to agriculture and urbanization affect riverine ch4 dynamics in multiple ways first fertilizer runoff from agriculture catchments causes eutrophication in the receiving waterbodies which in turn enhances the supply of organic matter to the methanogenic zones and stimulates ch4 production abril and iversen 2002 delsontro et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 subsequently rivers and streams draining through agriculture dominated catchments are shown to emit more ch4 relative to undisturbed catchments bodmer et al 2016 mwanake et al 2022 andrews et al 2021 wu et al 2020 second sewage discharge from urbanised areas supplies nutrients and highly labile organic matter which in turn cause hypoxia in receiving waterbodies in addition to enhancing methanogenesis hu et al 2018 xia et al 2022 third several studies showed that hypoxic condition can also reduce the efficiency of methanotrophic mitigation of ch4 emissions bednařík et al 2017 bodmer et al 2020 shelley et al 2017 lastly in addition to enhancing methanogenesis in the anoxic sediments sewage itself can be a source of ch4 zou et al 2009 yu et al 2017 alshboul et al 2016 and in the areas where sewage treatment facilities are inadequate untreated sewage find its way to streams rivers and enhance riverine ch4 emissions despite the global pattern of decreasing riverine ch4 emission with increasing latitude li et al 2021 landscape modifications can alter the magnitude of ch4 emissions within a climatic zone for example ch4 emission from the cropland draining tropical rivers and streams of africa is several folds higher than the forested streams mwanake et al 2022 in the sub tropical tuojia river basin china riverine ch4 emissions increase along an increasing gradient of agricultural catchment area wu et al 2020 similarly in temperate meuse river basin riverine ch4 concentration increased exponentially with the percentage agricultural area borges et al 2018 however urbanization mediated anthropogenic disturbance exhibits a greater influence on the riverine ch4 emission than agricultural modifications for instance the urban stretches of yangtze river china exhibited 5 fold more ch4 emission 8 93 14 29 mmol m 2 d 1 than the rural areas 1 91 1 42 mmol m 2 d 1 the mixed landscape of chaohu basin china diffusive ch4 fluxes in the urban rivers 9 44 mmol m 2 d 1 were 5 1 9 8 and 10 4 times higher than the agricultural forested and mixed landscapes xia et al 2022 similarly ch4 emission from the sewage draining rivers of haihe river basin china 1 69 1 62 mmol m 2 d 1 was 3 11 times higher than the natural rivers hu et al 2018 the impact of urbanization mediated catchment modification on riverine ch4 emission is further evident from the catchment restoration efforts compared to six heavily polluted urban streams of the chongqing metropolitan area china 7 65 9 20 mmol m 2 d 1 comprehensive watershed restoration resulted 7 times reduction in ch4 emission from restored rivers wang et al 2022 in the freshwater reaches of highly polluted adyar river estuary india the average ch4 emission is 11 89 21 13 mmol m 2 d 1 rajkumar et al 2008 furthermore urban stretches of three major rivers in the asian continent river ganges river mekong and yellow river showed substantially elevated ch4 concentration than the sites with agricultural and or forested catchments begum et al 2021 together higher ch4 emission from streams and rivers draining through urbanised areas than the agricultural watersheds is a general feature of both tropical see also yu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 and temperate kuhn et al 2017 gu et al 2021 herrero ortega et al 2019 landscapes despite the growing recognition on the importance of tropical rivers and streams on global ch4 budget li et al 2021 sawakuchi et al 2014 the effect of land use changes on riverine greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions are not well delineated for the most populous asian continent where swift land use changes are being taking place nevertheless a recent compilation showed that urbanization has an overriding effect than agricultural landscape modification on carbon dioxide emissions from inland waters wang et al 2022 yet it remains unknown how inland water ch4 emissions respond to catchment modification in the tropical asian river basins despite covering only 2 4 of the world s land surface and having only 4 of the world s freshwater resources 18 of the world s population resides in india consequently streams and rivers in the indian subcontinent are susceptible to large levels of pollution due to exponentially expanding urbanization and agricultural activities to support the burgeoning population yet our current understanding on the effects of land use changes on ch4 emission from indian rivers is limited here we examine the drivers of ch4 dynamics in a tropical indian river network with an objective to understand the magnitude and variability of ch4 concentrations and emissions and their landscape level drivers this study was conducted in the tropical krishna river basin india in which about 75 of the basin is agricultural land but the remaining portion of the landscape include the tropical rain forests rangelands and two highly urbanised metropolitan areas providing a unique fluvial network to examine the influence of land use changes on riverine ch4 emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the krishna river basin kr basin situated between 13 5 58ʺ 19 24 35ʺ n and 73 20 28ʺ 81 0 43ʺ e is the 5th largest river system in india and covers an area of 2 58 948 km2 encompassing 8 of india s total geographical area fig 1 this basin has total 74 million inhabitants with an average population density of 287 km 2 the basin boundary at the western region is characterised by the western ghats where elevation ranges from 600 m to 1903 m the interior part of the basin is a plateau with 300 to 600 m elevation with a general eastward slope majority of the basin 55 of the total area falls under the elevation zone of 500 750 m this tropical river basin is mostly semi arid and dry except for the western ghat region which is dominated by a humid climate the annual average rainfall for the basin is 840 mm of which 90 occurs between june and october biggs et al 2007 the long term average temperature 1969 to 2004 for the basin is 26 3 c while the average temperature for the month of january winter april summer and july monsoon were 22 4 c 29 5 c 26 1 c respectively wris india the rivers and streams of the kr basin originate mostly from the western ghats join the main river krishna river which finally confluence with the bay of bengal fig 1 there are five major rivers in the kr network krishna river the largest among all and main stem of the river network length 1400 km into which other tributaries join fig 1 the second largest river is the bhima river 861 km and joins with the krishna river and other rivers include the tunga bhadra river 552 km musi river 352 km and munneru river 218 km the land use land cover lulc data for the year 2021 fig 1 shows 74 4 of the basin is covered by agricultural land followed by rangeland 12 8 forest 5 6 and built up area 4 7 there was a substantial change in the lulc pattern in the kr basin for last two decades mostly in terms of built up area which is increased by 10 during 2005 2015 period while the agricultural area remained more or less constant chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 the most urbanized areas in the river network are in the upper musi river and bhima river hyderabad and pune cities respectively the two major metropolitan regions of the country with a total population of 10 3 million and 6 8 million respectively these cities discharge a large amount of treated and untreated sewage effluents into the musi and bhima rivers hyderabad city generates about 1250 million litres per day mld sewage of which only 605 mld is treated and rest of the sewage directly discharged into the musi river sultana and sultana 2021 on the other hand of the 744 mld of sewage generated in the pune city about 75 treated which mixes with untreated sewage and discharges into the upper reaches of bhima river https www pmc gov in en drainage in the agriculture dominated watershed major crops include rice jawar great millet corn pulses wheat sugarcane groundnut and grass fodder biggs et al 2007 the forest in the basin is dominated by deciduous forest 14 659 km2 followed by degraded scrub forest 5203 km2 and evergreen forests 5203 km2 2 2 sampling approach we sampled 120 locations fig 1 within the agriculture dominated kr network during the pre monsoon march of 2021 and 2022 fig s1 we selected the dry season to explore the spatial variability in ch4 concentrations and emissions since previous studies in the two tropical indian rivers river adyar and river ganges showed that ch4 concentration is highest during this period rajkumar et al 2008 begum et al 2021 but the underlying processes were not well understood here we sampled the kr network to capture the magnitude of ch4 oversaturation and emissions at a greater spatial resolution than previous studies in indian rivers to delineate the hydrochemical and landscape level drivers in the year 2021 a total of 53 sites covering 33 stations in the musi river and 20 sites in the krishna river were sampled fig s1 in march 2022 another 67 sites across 4 tributaries including wyra river n 7 munneru river n 12 tunga bhadra river n 22 bhima river n 17 and 9 sites in the upstream region of the krishna river main channel fig s1 were sampled although the field campaigns were conducted in different years they were in the month of march expecting similar environmental variability and anthropogenic disturbances influencing the riverine ch4 concentrations and emissions at each sampling site

the land use land cover lulc data 10 m 10 m sentinel 2 from esri the kr watershed was delineated using the hydrology toolbox of arcgis pro the lulc statistics total and percentage area of built up land agriculture area forest area rangeland area etc for the entire delineated watershed was made using arcmap ver 10 8 1 furthermore the larger kr basin was divided into sub basins using global scale sub basins boundaries of hydrosheds lehner and grill 2013 accordingly the kr basin was divided into a total of 33 sub basins with area ranging from 444 to 91 557 km2 with a large variability in lulc pattern table s1 fig s2 the channel slope of each river reach in the sub basin was calculated as the maximum minus the average elevation m of the reach divided by half the length m of the reach

transformed to attain normality and homoscedasticity the statistical analysis includes analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd honest significant difference as well as multiple linear regression mlr analysis 3 results 3 1 variability in hydrology water chemistry ch4 concentration and diffusive ch4 flux we sampled a total of 120 stations within the kr basin in the month of march 2021 and 2022 the water temperature across the study sites varied widely from 23 68 to 34 22 c table 1 the concentration of do varied from near anoxic conditions 0 10 mg l 1 to as high as 20 57 mg l 1 similarly a large variability in the concentrations of doc 1 96 43 32 mg l 1 acdom440 0 43 13 74 m 1 turbidity 0 6 66 9 ntu tp 0 20 87 94 μmoll 1 and chlorophyll a 3 6 350 05 μg l 1 was observed in the river network table 1 notably these changes were associated the site specific properties of the rivers and streams the sampling sites close to urbanized areas fig 1 in the basin exhibited significantly low do concentrations than the sites with agriculture and forested watersheds p 0 0001 tukey kramer hsd figs 2a s3 a on the other hand concentrations of doc and tp were highly significantly different and increased systematically from the forested to agricultural and urban sites figs 2 b c s3 b c similarly chlorophyll a concentration was higher in the urbanised sites relative to the sites close to the agricultural and forested areas figs 2d s3 d the streams and rivers sampled in the kr basin were consistently oversaturated with ch4 as a response to the large variability in the hydrochemistry ch4 concentration spanned four orders of magnitude 0 03 to 185 34 μmol l 1 with a mean sd concentration of 13 18 34 05 μmol l 1 median 0 55 μmol l 1 iqr 0 30 2 61 μmol l 1 table 1 the concentration of ch4 was significantly higher in urbanized sites 64 63 53 17 μmol l 1 median 49 55 μmol l 1 iqr 15 37 90 99 μmol l 1 relative to agricultural 1 05 2 22 μmol l 1 median 0 43 μmol l 1 iqr 0 24 0 80 μmol l 1 and forested sites 0 49 0 23 μmol l 1 median 0 57 μmol l 1 iqr 0 36 0 66 μmol l 1 fig 3 a fig s4 based on the air water ch4 concentration gradient water flow velocity and river channel slope the rate of diffusive ch4 flux was estimated for each sampling site the ch4 emission rates ranged widely from 0 04 mmol m 2 d 1 to 1666 24 mmol m 2 d 1 mean 58 95 197 01 mmol m 2 d 1 table 1 evidently the ch4 fluxes followed nonnormal distribution with a median rate of 1 60 mmol m 2 d 1 iqr 0 48 9 07 mmol m 2 d 1 the diffusive ch4 emission was significantly high in the urbanized areas with a mean flux rate of 294 15 371 52 mmol m2 d 1 median 144 34 mmol m2 d 1 iqr 59 29 505 39 mmol m2 d 1 than the sampling sites draining through the agricultural mean 3 45 9 72 mmol m2 d 1 median 1 07 mmol m2 d 1 iqr 0 34 3 15 mmol m2 d 1 and forested mean 1 26 0 73 mmol m2 d 1 median 1 25 mmol m2 d 1 iqr 0 78 1 88 mmol m2 d 1 areas fig 3b 3 2 hydrological and biogeochemical control of riverine ch4 concentration combining all our dataset the concentration of dissolved ch4 was unrelated to the variability in water temperature and the flow velocity fig s5 however ch4 concentration was strongly negatively correlated with do r2 0 72 p 0 0001 but positively correlated with the concentrations of doc r2 0 17 p 0 0001 tp r2 0 42 p 0 0001 and chlorophyll a r2 0 16 p 0 0001 fig 4 furthermore we explored the combined effects of various physico chemical drivers on riverine ch4 concentrations using mlr analysis with elastic net variable selection procedure and aic validation while we used all measured atmospheric and limnological variables air pressure air temperature water temperature ph do doc tp acdom440 turbidity and chlorophyll a as candidate independent variables only variables that were statistically significant in the elastic net variable selection procedure were retained in the final model accordingly the final model was ln ch4 µmol l 1 0 07 0 93 ln do 0 33 ln chlorophyll a 0 22 ln tp 6 r 2 0 80 p 0 0001 where do chlorophyll a and tp were in mg l 1 µg l 1 and µmol l 1 respectively corresponding statistical significance for individual variables were p 0 0001 for do p 0 0054 for chlorophyll a and p 0 0052 for tp fig s6 3 3 land use drivers of riverine methane concentrations the concentration of ch4 showed large spatial heterogeneity in the river network since this variability was linked to differences in the features of the immediate catchment fig 3 we further explored the land use drivers of riverine ch4 concentration in order to do so we divided the larger kr basin into sub basins using hydrosheds based sub basin delineation although the sub basin delineation divided the entire kr basin into 33 sub basins our sampling sites were distributed across 18 sub basins with large variability in lulc pattern table s1 fig s2 the sub basins catchments were dominated by agriculture land mean 75 2 range 30 95 7 followed by the rangeland mean 11 5 range 1 6 31 2 and built up area mean 5 3 range 1 4 22 8 at the sub basin scale the average ch4 concentration varied from 0 09 72 28 µmol l 1 and strongly positively correlated with the percentage of built up area r2 0 66 p 0 0001 fig 5 however a weak but negative correlation was observed between ch4 concentration and the percentage of agricultural area r2 0 30 p 0 0199 fig s7 furthermore we used mlr analysis with elastic net variable selection procedure using various lulc features see table s1 as candidate independent variables to examine the sub basin scale ch4 variability the built up area and rangeland area were the only statistically significant predictive variables and the resulting mlr model took the form of ln ch4 µmol l 1 2 30 3 03 ln built up area 1 00 ln rangeland area 7 r 2 0 80 p 0 0001 n 18 both the predictive variables were statistically significant with p 0 0001 for the percentage of built up area and p 0 0063 for rangeland area 4 discussion here we show that despite covering only a small proportion built up area plays a disproportionately large role in controlling the riverine ch4 concentrations in the agriculture dominated kr basin within this tropical river basin there are large differences in the landscape features which translated into a wide variability in the inputs of organic matter and nutrients in the fluvial networks subsequently the average ch4 concentrations and emission in the urban sites were several folds higher than the sites with the agricultural and forested catchments our data suggest that urban rivers and streams of this tropical river basins are ch4 hotspots where concentrations and emissions reach the upper limits of what has been reported in the literature stanley et al 2016 li et al 2021 stanley et al 2022 furthermore the strong correlation between ch4 concentrations and various biogeochemical proxies do doc tp and chlorophyll a emphasize the need to account for the local anthropogenic perturbations in deriving fluvial ch4 emissions the strong correlation between built up area and ch4 concentration suggests urbanization as a key land use driver of fluvial ch4 emissions and this relationship may help to estimate the current and future ch4 emissions across highly populous south east asian river basins 4 1 large variability of ch4 concentration and emission driven by catchment properties spanning across the pristine forested catchments of the western ghats agriculture dominated catchments in the middle to lower reaches and two highly urbanised areas of india hyderabad and pune the krishna river network experiences large variability in organic matter and nutrients inputs subsequently ch4 concentration in this tropical river basin varied widely from 0 03 to 185 34 μmol l 1 fig s4 the average ch4 concentration 13 18 34 05 μmol l 1 and emission 58 95 197 01 mmol m 2 d 1 in the kr basin are much higher than the values estimated for global streams and rivers by stanley et al 2016 concentration 1 35 5 16 μmol l 1 and emission 8 22 25 50 mmol m 2 d 1 li et al 2021 emission 8 40 0 72 mmol m 2 d 1 and stanley et al 2022 concentration 1 49 10 69 μmol l 1and emission 7 31 86 4 mmol m 2 d 1 similarly the median ch4 concentration and emission in the kr basin 0 55 μmol l 1 and 1 60 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively were 2 fold higher than the respective global median values of 0 25 μmol l 1 and 0 86 mmol m 2 d 1 estimated by stanley et al 2016 and 2 4 times higher than the recently updated global median concentration and fluxes of 0 20 μmol l 1 and 0 44 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively stanley et al 2022 furthermore the average ch4 emission rates estimated for the kr basin was much higher than the recently compiled average ch4 emission for the tropical rivers and streams 15 46 1 95 mmol m 2 d 1 li et al 2021 these higher ch4 emission rates estimated for the kr basin cannot be attributed to the urbanization alone for example excluding the urban hotspots the average emission rate estimates for the agricultural and forested sites 3 18 9 13 mmol m 2 d 1 were much higher than the rates reported for sub tropical streams and rivers with agricultural and forested catchments 0 09 0 15 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 03 0 03 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively andrews et al 2021 similarly the average ch4 emission in the non urban sites of the kr basin is higher than the agricultural and forested dominated sub tropical tuojia river basin 0 10 0 09 mmol m 2 d 1 wu et al 2020 and chaohu basin where agricultural and forested rivers emit ch4 at a rate of 1 85 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 91 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively xia et al 2022 the pattern of higher ch4 concentration and emissions in the urbanised river stretches than the agricultural and forested sites in the kr basin fig 3 is likely a general pattern across river basins globally see table s3 for example the urbanised reaches of tropical han river basin south korea exhibited 7 fold higher ch4 concentration than the forested river reaches jin et al 2018 the average ch4 concentration in the urbanized river sites of sub tropical chaohu basin 5 46 μmol l 1 was about 4 to 10 times higher than that of agricultural and forested rivers xia et al 2022 similarly ch4 concentration and fluxes found to increase with the extent of urbanization in the chongqing metropolitan river network wang et al 2018 the river segments draining through catchments with higher percentage of urbanised areas of the sub tropical yangtze river emits up to 6 times more ch4 than the river segments draining through less urban areas tang et al 2021 the urban rivers of chaohu basin ch4 emission is up to10 times higher than those of the non urban rivers xia et al 2022 interestingly this pattern is not only observed for the large river basins or in the tropical and sub tropical rivers for example small temperate rivers of belgium and the united states also showed a clear increase in ch4 concentration with percentage urbanized area borges et al 2018 robison et al 2022 table s3 furthermore reduction in anthropogenic inputs through catchment restoration of urbanized rivers showed substantial decline in the riverine ch4 emissions wang et al 2022 notably the average ch4 concentration in the urban sites of the kr basin 64 63 53 17 μmol l 1 fig 3a was comparable with the highly polluted urban reaches of the river ganges india 69 46 75 33 μmol l 1 and the river mekong china 48 17 115 28 μmol l 1 begum et al 2021 together pattern emerging from the kr basin and from other river basins globally table s3 consistently suggest that regardless of the size of the river basins and climatic zones urbanization induce a disproportionately large role in riverine ch4 concentrations and emission than the agricultural landscape modifications 4 2 hydrochemical drivers of riverine ch4 concentrations in the kr basin despite the wide variability in temperature 23 68 34 22 c across the study sites widely reported positive effect of temperature on ch4 concentration campeau and del giorgio 2014 crawford and stanley 2016 mcginnis et al 2016 was not observed in the kr basin during this study focussed on the spatial pattern fig s5 however lack of correlation between temperature and ch4 concentration corroborates the pattern observed for several urbanised rivers yu et al 2017 xia et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 premke et al 2020 similarly the lack of relationship between waterflow velocity and ch4 concentration in our study contradicts the pattern observed across northern rivers and streams campeau and del giorgio 2014 mcginnis et al 2016 tang et al 2021 together these results suggest that there are factors other than temperature and waterflow inducing a greater influence on the riverine ch4 concentration in this tropical river basin during the sampling accordingly the concentration of do emerged as the most important hydrochemical parameter explaining the variability of ch4 concentrations in the kr network a pattern corroborates with studies in streams and rivers transverse through diverse landscapes rulik et al 2000 andrews et al 2021 xia et al 2022 begum et al 2021 wang et al 2020 premke et al 2020 borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2022 stanley et al 2022 the pattern of increasing ch4 concentration with decreasing do in rivers is mostly attributed to the reduced methanotrophic activity under low oxygen conditions yu et al 2017 li et al 2021 in the highly urbanised river sites where we observed consistently high ch4 concentration the average do concentration was 0 43 mg l 1 range 0 10 2 24 mg l 1 the methanotrophic activity is primarily limited by the substrate ch4 availability and therefore oxidation rates increase with ch4 concentrations however unlike ch4 high do concentration is known inhibit ch4 oxidation instead the highest ch4 oxidation rates often observed at low but optimal oxygen concentrations of 0 23 1 17 mg l 1 rudd et al 1974 thottathil et al 2019 since the urbanised river sites experience high ch4 concentrations and do is within the optimal level for methanotrophy maximum oxidation rate is expected in the urban stretch of the rivers and unlikely limited by the oxygen availability therefore the extremely high ch4 concentrations observed in the urban reaches is attributable at least partly to the direct release of the untreated ch4 rich sewage from immediate vicinity of the sampling points rather than the inefficient methanotrophic ch4 consumption this seems reasonable given that capacity of the sewage treatment plants stps in the metropolitan region of hyderabad is inadequate to treat 1250 mld of sewage generated and therefore more than 50 of the untreated sewage is being released directly into the musi river sultana and sultana 2021 cpcb 2021 similarly in the city of pune 25 of untreated sewage directly released into the upper reaches of bhima river along with the treated sewage cpcb 2021 in order to examine whether sewage can be a direct source of such a high concentration of ch4 observed in the urbanized zones we sampled five stps within the kr basin our results show that both treated and untreated sewage contain substantial amount of ch4 with significantly higher concentration of ch4 in untreated 91 82 26 05 µmol l 1 than treated 37 29 29 52 µmol l 1 fig s8 sewage clearly ch4 concentration in the untreated sewage 91 82 26 05 µmol l 1 is higher than mean 64 63 53 17 μmoll 1 and median 49 55 μmoll 1 iqr 15 37 90 99 μmoll 1 concentrations across the urban river sites indicating that ch4 oversaturation in the urban river sites can be sustained at least partly by direct sewage effluents in addition to the organic matter input fuelling riverine ch4 production interestingly the high ch4 concentration in the treated sewage in the kr basin which is several folds higher than the concentration of treated wastewater across nine stps in germany 1 17 2 04 µmol l 1 alshboul et al 2016 suggests that even the release of treated sewage can enhance the riverine ch4 emissions however further studies are required to disentangle the relative importance of these two pathways riverine ch4 production versus release of ch4 rich sewage of ch4 sources in the urban rivers of the kr basin yet our data shows that an inevitable consequence of the sewage discharge is the extreme ch4 emission from the receiving rivers in response to an exponential increase of urban population 46 9 million in 2021 accounting for 35 of the total population fig s9 in india the urban sewage generation reached 62 000 mld whereas treatment capacity is only 23 277 mld cpcb 2021 the remaining 63 sewage is being discharged into the waterbodies cpcb 2021 turning the urban rivers and streams hotspots of ch4 emissions since ch4 emission rates for the urban reaches of the kr basin average 294 15 371 52 mmol m2 d 1 median 144 34 mmol m2 d 1 are towards the higher end of emissions rates reported for the global rivers and streams stanley et al 2016 li et al 2021 stanely et al 2022 urban river emissions may have large implications on the nationwide ch4 emission inventories of india we suggest that accounting for the sewage mediated urban river emissions is important for estimating total anthropogenic ch4 emissions and for the predicting the current and future ch4 emissions from indian fluvial networks furthermore we observed a strong coupling of riverine ch4 concentration with doc tp and chlorophyll a a pattern consistent with the relationship observed across rivers and streams globally hutchins et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 xia et al 2022 mwanake et al 2022 campeau and del giorgio 2014 li et al 2021 stanley et al 2022 the dissolved organic matter known to provide substrates and energy for the heterotrophic metabolism and the terminal metabolic products of which is the precursor acetate carbon dioxide and hydrogen for both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis conrad 1999 therefore the strong correlation between doc and ch4 concentrations in our study suggests that doc inputs enhance ch4 production in the rivers itself and or sewage discharge supplies both doc and ch4 to the receiving waterbodies li et al 2021 marescaux et al 2018 cunada et al 2018 kim et al 2019 however in the mlr analysis do tp and chlorophyll a were emerged as the statistically significant variables and doc was not chosen to account for the ch4 variability in the final model note that the concentration of doc is often strongly negatively correlated with do in inland waters due to the strong role of doc in driving heterotrophic metabolism and subsequently resulting in do undersaturation prairie et al 2002 we observed a similar decrease in the concentration of do with increasing doc in the kr basin r2 0 50 p 0 0001 data not shown therefore the selection of do and the refusal of doc in the final model suggests that oxygen integrates multiple aspects of ch4 metabolism acts as a proxy of doc and heterotrophic metabolism which in turn influence ch4 production while partly regulating ch4 concentration itself through methanotrophic activity see thottathil et al 2019 although doc was excluded in the model tp and chlorophyll a were still significant predictor for ch4 variability a pattern widely showed across inland waters delsontro et al 2018 borges et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 stanley et al 2022 our mlr model suggest that in addition to the variability accounted for by do a proxy of organic matter supply heterotrophic metabolism and methanotrophic activity tp and chlorophyll a are still important drivers of the ch4 variability likely due to other pathways through which ch4 is related to autotrophic biomass and nutrients a likely mechanism is the ch4 production under oxic condition i e oxic ch4 production omp which is known to increase with tp and chlorophyll a concentrations donnis et al 2017 bogard et al 2014 thottathil et al 2022 however how far omp contributes towards ch4 saturation and emission in rivers and streams is remains to be studied 4 3 land use drivers of riverine ch4 concentrations we divided the larger kr basin into several sub basins and estimated the lulc pattern in each of them to understand the land use drivers of riverine ch4 concentration at sub basin scale a key outcome of this approach was the emergence of built up area as an important predictor of ch4 concentrations fig 5 across these agriculture dominated sub basins table s1 the built up area contributed only small percentage of the total landscape 2 7 in all but two sub basins where it reached up to 13 and 23 table s1 fig s2 yet the percentage of urbanized area showed a disproportionally large role in regulating riverine ch4 concentration at sub basin scale and suggest that even small scale urbanization mediated perturbations will have larger impacts on the aquatic ch4 emissions the correlation between percentage urbanized area and ch4 concentration in the kr basin is comparable to the pattern observed in the sub tropical yangtze river china wang et al 2018 furthermore we explored the consequence of further expansion of the proportion of built up area in the kr basin on riverine ch4 emissions recent modelling efforts for lulc predictions in the kr basin suggested that there will be 2 increase in the percentage of urbanised area in the kr basin by the year 2055 which will increase further to 2 5 by the year 2085 chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 given the slope of 2 26 for log log relationship between percentage built up area and ch4 concentration fig 5 the predicted 2 increase of urbanized area may lead to about 5 fold increase of ch4 concentration and thus emissions in the kr basin by 2055 due to the urbanization this increase however is reasonable given the lulc predictions showing that existing cities in the lower krishna river and upper bhima river regions figs 1 s1 hyderabad and pune are expected to have a two fold increase in area by 2055 chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 while several fold increase in ch4 emissions expected for the kr basin is due to urbanization alone the decadal temperature increase will exacerbate the ch4 emission due to the greater temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis q10 4 yvon durocher et al 2014 given that the percentage of built up area in the kr basin is relatively moderate 4 7 fig 1 compared to many other river basins of india see table s2 ch4 emission may be much higher from the urbanised reaches of other rivers the increase in ch4 concentrations with built up area and our finding of sewage as a substantial source of ch4 are particularly important for the current and future ch4 emission estimates from the fluvial networks of the total sewage generated in india 72 368 mld only 26 869 mld is treated and the remaining 63 of sewage ultimately reaches the rivers and streams cpcb 2021 since sewage generation and population are strongly positively correlated fig s10 and sewage itself is a source of ch4 fig s8 an exponentially growing urban population see fig s9 along with inadequate sewage treatment system may have huge impacts on the ch4 emission of indian inland waters therefore installation of adequate sewage treatment facilities should be a priority to improve river water quality and to reduce current and future ch4 emissions in india notably agriculture area that uniquely dominated in all sub basins 30 96 table s1 showed a negative correlation with ch4 concentration fig s7 a however this correlation cannot be considered as causation since this relationship is dependent only on one data point representing the sub basin 10 sb 10 excluding which will results in the absence of relationship between riverine ch4 concentration and agriculture area fig s7 a note that sb 10 represents the most urbanized sub basin in the kr basin pune city where percentage of built up area is 23 fig s2 table s1 subsequently the proportion of the agriculture area reduced to 30 lowest among all sub basins table s1 since built up area is the major source of organic matter and or direct source of ch4 enhancing riverine ch4 concentrations lowest agriculture area coinciding with highest percentage of built up area within the same sub basin sb 10 resulted in a negative correlation between agriculture area and ch4 concentration excluding the sub basin sb 10 the general lack of relationship between agriculture area and riverine ch4 concentration in the kr basin fig s7 a is in contrast with the positive correlation between agriculture area and ch4 concentration observed across temperate sub tropical and tropical river basins herreid et al 2021 andrews et al 2021 borges et al 2018 mwanake et al 2022 however our data corroborates the pattern observed in highly urbanised yangtze river basin china where agriculture area is unrelated to riverine ch4 concentration tang et al 2021 together the uncoupling of riverine ch4 concentration and agriculture area could be a result of an overriding effect of organic matter and or sewage ch4 input from human settlements in the highly populous river basins in support to this a recent study shows that urbanization overrides agriculture productivity and hydrological delivery in enhancing the co2 emissions from inland waters wang et al 2022 however we acknowledge that sampling during high flow monsoon season may provide further insights on whether greater hydrological connectivity would result in a positive relationship between agriculture area and riverine ch4 concentration despite the large area of rivers and streams and their potential to emit ch4 in the tropical indian peninsula see li and bush 2015 quantification of ch4 concentrations and emissions in the fluvial network is scarce and fragmented premke et al 2020 begum et al 2021 rajkumar et al 2008 panneer selvam et al 2014 and upscaling is further impeded by the lack of knowledge on their landscape level drivers therefore we explored our data further to develop a mlr model for riverine ch4 concentrations using the lulc data estimated for the sampled sub basins in addition to the strong positive correlation of built up area with ch4 percentage of rangeland area 1 7 31 2 table s1 emerged as another key variable but negatively related to the riverine ch4 concentration the negative relationship between rangeland area and ch4 concentration in the mlr model suggests a decreased organic matter input into the rivers with the increasing proportion of rangeland area this relationship upholds the pattern observed in previous studies that showed lower ch4 emission from the grassland dominated rivers and the lower contribution of grasslands to the basin wide ch4 emissions garnier et al 2013 together we show that predicting riverine ch4 concentration using landscape features could help to fill the current gap on ch4 emissions from tropical indian rivers by using easily obtainable remote sensing data there are to our knowledge no similar high resolution basin wide dataset available from other indian river basins to build empirical models and upscale the regional fluvial ch4 emission which we suggest should be incorporated in future research programs we acknowledge that our dry season measurements are likely represent higher end of ch4 concentration and emission in the kr basin since the monsoonal precipitation shown to reduce ghgs emissions in the tropical rivers rajkumar et al 2008 begum et al 2021 whether the land use variables shown to drive ch4 concentrations within the kr basin in this the study may remain throughout year needs confirmation 4 4 urbanization drives riverine ch4 concentration across asian watersheds nevertheless we further explored whether the relationship between built up area and ch4 concentration observed in the kr basin is a general pattern for tropical asian rivers experiencing similar anthropogenic pressure to do so we first divided the larger basins of ganges river mekong river and cauvery river into sub basins using the hydrosheds based sub basins delineation fig s11a c next we calculated the average ch4 concentration of each of sub basin using published data begum et al 2021 premke et al 2020 fig s11 our analysis revealed a positive correlation between the percentage built up area and ch4 concentration across river basins r2 0 35 p 0 0001 fig 6 upholding the pattern observed for the kr basin thus we show that the extent of urbanization is a key driver of fluvial ch4 concentrations and emissions not only in the kr basin but in other the highly populous asian rivers however data is scarce and further studies are required for accurately quantifying and placing the growing contribution of asian fluvial networks to the global ch4 budget furthermore since urbanization could inevitably enhance the riverine ch4 oversaturation our study emphasizes the need of effective river restoration programs and adequate sewage treatment facilities to mitigate the riverine ch4 emissions 5 conclusion the extensive spatial sampling revealed hitherto unrecognised variability of ch4 concentrations and fluxes in response to site specific variability of hydrochemistry and catchment properties in the tropical kr basin in addition to the previously observed coupling of ch4 concentrations with hydrochemical variables do doc tp and chlorophyll a percentage of built up area emerged as an important land use driver of riverine ch4 dynamics furthermore we show that the relationship between built up area and ch4 concentrations shown in the kr basin is likely to be a general pattern of asian river basins we suggest that exponential increase of population and expansion of urbanization expected for the asian continent may have a large impact on aquatic ch4 emission and therefore
