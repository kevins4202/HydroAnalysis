17425,although the identification of effective reactive oxygen species ros generated by plasma has been extensively studied yet the subcellular mechanism of microbial inactivation has never been clearly elucidated in plasma disinfection processes in this study subcellular mechanism of yeast cell inactivation during plasma liquid interaction was revealed in terms of comprehensive factors including cell morphology membrane permeability lipid peroxidation membrane potential intracellular redox homeostasis intracellular ros and h2o2 and antioxidant system sod cat and gsh intracellular ionic equilibrium intracellular h and k and energy metabolism mitochondrial membrane potential intracellular ca 2 and atp level the ros analysis show that oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were generated in this plasma liquid interaction system and o2 served as the precursor of 1o2 additionally the solution ph was reduced plasma can effectively inactivate yeast cells mainly via apoptosis by damaging cell membrane intracellular redox and ion homeostasis and energy metabolism as well as causing dna fragmentation ros scavengers l his d man and sod and ph buffer phosphate buffer solution pbs were employed to investigate the role of five antimicrobial factors oh 1o2 o2 h2o2 and low ph in plasma sterilization results show that they have different influences on the aforementioned cell physiological activities the oh and 1o2 contributed most to the yeast inactivation the oh mainly attacked cell membrane and increased cell membrane permeability the disturb of cell energy metabolism was mainly attributed to 1o2 the damage of cell membrane as well as extracellular low ph could break the intracellular ionic equilibrium and further reduce cell membrane potential the remarkable increase of intracellular h2o2 was mainly due to the influx of extracellular h2o2 via destroyed cell membrane which played a little role in yeast inactivation during 10 min plasma treatment these findings provide comprehensive insights into the antimicrobial mechanism of plasma which can promote the development of plasma as an alternative water disinfection strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cold atmospheric pressure plasma cap subcellular antimicrobial mechanism reactive oxygen species ros intracellular redox homeostasis intracellular ionic equilibrium energy metabolism system 1 introduction over the past two decades due to the properties of environmentally friendly and efficiency disinfection lee et al 2016 the application of cold atmospheric plasma cap on biological inactivation and as therapy for infectious diseases have been extensively researched ryu et al 2013 wu et al 2012 ma et al 2013 tian et al 2015 joubert et al 2013 apart from this cap also shown promising potential in other biomedical applications such as wound healing blood coagulation cancer treatment and neurological diseases treatment isbary et al 2013 bekeschus et al 2018 keidar 2015 jang et al 2018 in the sterilization studies of bacteria fungi and viruses it has been found that the reactive species induced by the plasma play dominant roles guo et al 2018 chen et al 2017 but as the complexity of reactive species it is still not very clear how these reactive species specifically caused the inactivation of microorganisms and whether every kinds of reactive species can cause specific damage to a particular biological structure or components or specifically disorder some certain essential physiological functions in the process of plasma treatment plasma is an ionized gas generated by high electric voltage discharge at atmospheric pressure which consists of complex reactive species electrons electric fields and ultraviolet light laroussi 2005 the reactive oxygen species ros including oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 and reactive nitrogen species rns including no onoo no2 and no3 can produced by different gas such as helium he argon ar nitrogen n2 ambient air or mixture of gasses generally speaking the rons was correlated with the working feeding or shielding ambient gasses when the ionized gas is air or part of n2 rns may be the key reactive species aboubakr et al 2016 liu et al 2017 girard et al 2016 kovačević et al 2017 jablonowski et al 2015 ito et al 2016 uchida et al 2018 in order to study the effect of ros induced by dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma on the microorganisms the plasma was generated under pure he environment in this study because of high oxidation potential ros can damage dna proteins lipids further trigger cell death in these several kinds of ros oh o2 and 1o2 belong to short lived reactive species oh the highest oxidant possesses a 2 8 ev oxidation potential but the lifetime is only 10 9 s some researchers have reported that oh is a vital factor in killing cell zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the half life of o2 is several tens of minutes it is generally believed that o2 serve as the precursor of oh xu et al 2015 wu et al 2012 kim et al 2016 as well as converted into hydroperoxyl radicals hoo in the low ph condition which can penetrate the cell membrane and damage intercellular components ikawa et al 2010 1o2 possesses a 0 65 ev oxidation potential which is also considered important in microbial inactivation planas et al 2016 yasui et al 2015 aboubakr et al 2016 h2o2 is the long lived reactive species girard et al 2016 and shen et al 2016 found the h2o2 contribute to antimicrobial ability in association with no2 in brief the short lived reactive species oh and 1o2 and long lived reactive species h2o2 can induce the death of cell but the cellular targets of every kinds of ros is not very clear and it is of great importance to verify this detailed mechanism for explore better control strategy of plasma to achieve a best application besides generating reactive oxygen species ros non thermal plasma could also lead to the acidification of treated solution the low ph can also cause the inactivation of microbes ikawa et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 but what role low ph play in the process of synergistically inducing cell death with ros is not very clear the previous researches mostly focused on some cellular structure or physiological activity changes of microbes induced by plasma for example researchers found plasma could destroy cell membrane further intracellular various macromolecules would be damaged kaneko et al 2015 2017 sasaki et al 2016 the oxidative dna damage was also be verified joshi et al 2011 itooka et al 2018 found that plasma could lead to protein aggregates and endoplasmic reticulum er stress in yeast cytoplasm the energy generation system of bacteria could also be destroyed by plasma huang et al 2020 all these cellular changes could lead to the death of microbes but the comprehensive experiments were not conducted to make sure the pivotal cellular structure or physiological activity changes in addition several studies have demonstrated plasma could trigger apoptosis both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms especially under a relative short exposure time lunov et al 2016 xu et al 2020 the model of apoptosis posit that excess extracellular chemicals interact with or enter cells and disrupt cellular homeostasis zhou et al 2019 thus it is necessary to ascertain the influence of ros generated by plasma on various intracellular homeostasis such as intracellular redox and ph homeostasis intracellular ionic equilibrium and energy metabolism intracellular ph homeostasis tightly regulates various metabolic activities in all cellular systems orij et al 2011 which was still rarely studied in the cell killing effects of non thermal plasma similarly metal ions serve as essential enzyme cofactors and perform both structural and signaling roles within cells cyert and philpott 2013 but the effect of plasma on intracellular mental ions levels was rarely researched mitochondria as an organelle for producing atp play an important role in intracellular energy metabolism which was little researched yeast as a unicellular eukaryotic model microorganism shows many similarities with bacteria and its cellular structure is simple therefore yeast is an ideal strain to study the killing effect mechanism of plasma in this study intracellular redox and ph homeostasis intracellular ionic equilibrium and intracellular energy metabolism were investigated and pearson correlation to microbial inactivation were analyzed to further reveal the mechanisms of cap induced cell death by using the biological model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae s cerevisiae due to the complexity of plasma components specific radical scavengers such as d mannitol d man superoxide dismutase sod l histidine l his as well as ph buffer phosphate buffer solution pbs were selected to comparatively explore the effect of ros on every intracellular physiological activities in this study the major ros were detected by chemical probe moreover oxidation reduction potential orp and ph were recorded to estimate its physicochemical properties the antimicrobial efficacy was examined via colony forming unit cfu count and further verified by live dead staining and scanning electron microscope sem furthermore cell membrane integrity and permeability lipid peroxidation membrane potential intracellular ph and cellular atp level were systematically investigated to reveal the subcellular mechanism of microbial inactivation in the dbd plasma system 2 experimental set up and methods 2 1 the plasma liquid interaction system the schematic diagram of plasma device is depicted in fig 1 the structure of dielectric barrier discharge dbd consists of three parts a high voltage hv electrode plate a steel hexagon shaped mesh as the ground electrode and the polytetrafluroethene ptfe dielectric sheet sandwiched between the two electrodes the chamber was filled with high purity he gas and plasma was generated in the position shown in the fig 1a and b the flow rate of helium was 1 5 l min the discharge voltage and current were measured by high voltage probe tektronix p6015a and current probe pearson electronics 2877 respectively the data of waveforms were recorded by oscilloscope teledyne wavesurfer 3000 and the discharge powers were obtained by integrating the product of voltage and current the applied voltage and discharge current are shown in the fig 1c the voltage had a peak to peak value of 5 kv and frequency of 8 khz the dissipated electrical power density was maintained at 0 07 w cm2 steadily 2 2 evaluation of the physicochemical properties of plasma treated solutions 2 2 1 the value of ph and orp the acidification of plasma treated solution is one of the major physicochemical properties orp is an indicator of the general level of rons in solutions thus the orp and ph of the solutions were immediately measured after plasma treatment 0 2 5 5 and 10 min by a multimeter ph redox mettler toledo switzerland 2 2 2 ros assay four major ros oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were analyzed in this plasma liquid system terephthalic acid ta macklin china is a well known specific probe to detect oh due to its high reaction rate coefficient k 4 3 109 m 1s 1 kanazawa et al 2011 and the product hydroxyterephthalic acid hta aladdin usa was measured by the varioskan lux thermo usa according to the fluorescence intensity excitation wavelength 310 nm and emission spectrum at 425 nm the ta solution was prepared as 2 mm ta and 5 mm naoh the standard curve of hta was shown in supporting information si fig s1 the concentration of oh in this plasma liquid system was calculated by standard curve furfuryl alcohol ffa sigma aldrich usa is extremely reactive toward 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1s 1 cote et al 2018 the decay of ffa was analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography system waters e2695alliance hplc waters usa the concentration used for detection is 1 mm the standard curve of ffa was shown in fig s2 the degradation rate of ffa was used to represent the production of 1o2 the production of o2 was detected by nitro blue tetrazolium nbt k 5 88 104m 1s 1 solarbio china o2 could react with nbt to form a blue compound with a maximum absorbance wave length at 580 nm uv mini 1240 shimadzu japan bielski et al 1980 the concentration of nbt used for dectection is 500 μm h2o2 was detected by hydrogen peroxide assay kit beyotime jiangsu china shen et al 2016 the solution after plasma treatment was added 15 μl nan3 200 mm 10 fold diluted and added the h2o2 detection reagents the absorbance was measured at 560 nm by the varioskan lux thermo usa the standard curve of h2o2 was shown in fig s3 the concentration of these ros in the sterile deionized water were immediately measured after 0 2 5 5 and 10 min plasma treatment the water without plasma treatment was set as control con 2 2 3 scavenger study to further verify the generation of these ros and investigate their interconversion in this plasma liquid system the physicochemical properties of plasma treated solutions were also measured under scavenger loaded conditions to remove the corresponding ros in this study 0 5 m d mannitol d man aladdin usa 0 25 m l histidine l his solarbio china and 100 u ml superoxide dismutase sod beyotime china were utilized to remove oh 1o2 and o2 respectively aboubakr et al 2016 ma et al 2012 wu et al 2012 0 1 m pbs ph 7 4 containing na2hpo4 nah2po4 and 0 45 mm k was used to prevent the drop of ph in the plasma treated solutions xu et al 2019 the ph orp and ros concentration of the scavengers or pbs solutions were immediately measured after 10 min plasma treatment 2 3 yeast strains growth conditions and plasma treatment the eukaryotic model yeast s cerevisiae wild type strain by4741 atcc 201 388 was used in the experiment the strain preserved in sterile glycerol solution at 80 c was activated by an overnight cultivation in yeast extract peptone adenine dextrose ypad medium by shaking at 200 rpm 30 c for about 15 h then the active strain was shifted into new ypad medium and cultivated to exponential phase the yeast suspension was about 107 colony forming unit cfu per ml and harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm 25 c for 5 min the yeast cells were then washed and resuspended in sterile deionized water for the plasma treatment the power density was kept to be about 0 07 w cm2 for sample treatment and the length of gap lg between the discharge surface and liquid surface of yeast suspensions was about 1 mm fig 1a and b the plasma treatment time was 0 2 5 5 and 10 min respectively the samples after 0 min plasma treatment was set as control con furthermore to determine the contribution of the major antimicrobial factors short lived ros of oh 1o2 and o2 and ph to yeast inactivation in liquids by plasma the plasma sterilization experiments were also conducted by adding different scavengers d man l his and sod and pbs solutions the applied concentration of d man l his sod and pbs was optimized as 0 5 m 0 25 m 100 u ml and 0 1 m respectively according to our previous studies xu et al 2019 and 2020 before plasma treatment yeast suspensions were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm and resuspended in d man l his sod and pbs solutions then the scavengers or pbs containing yeast suspensions were treated by plasma for 10 min the roles of different ros and ph in the plasma sterilization were identified by comparing the inactivation efficiency with and without the addition of different scavengers or pbs 2 4 evaluation of the physiological changes of yeast cells to investigate the antimicrobial mechanisms of plasma in liquids at the subcellular level eighteen cellular physiological parameters were measured in this study the physiological parameters examined after plasma treatment were as follows survival rate cell viability cell apoptosis cell morphology and size intracellular mda level and protein leakage intracellular ros and h2o2 intracellular antioxidants sod cat gsh mitochondrial membrane potential δψm intracellular ca2 cellular atp level phi intracellular k leakage cell membrane potential δψ chemical bonds of molecules on cell surface and dna fragmentations the details of these protocols were described in s4 s21 in si 2 5 statistical analysis data were obtained from at least three replicate experiments values from all experiments were expresses as the mean standard deviation sd statistical analysis was performed using spss statistical package 17 0 spss inc usa an analysis of variance anova was conducted to compare the effects of different plasma treatment time on every parameter and significant differences between mean values were identified by the student newman keul s multiple range test with a confidence level at p 0 05 in addition paired samples t test was employed to compare every parameter of 10 min plasma treated water with that of pbs d man sod or l his solutions after 10 min plasma treatment the difference is expressed as p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of plasma treated solutions orp measures the ability of a solution to oxidize or reduce another substance and depends upon the concentration of oxidizers and their strengths which is generally considered as an important factor affecting microbial inactivation mcferson 1993 as shown in fig 2 a the orp increased significantly over plasma treatment time compared to control 210 mv 10 min plasma treatment could significantly raise the orp to about 300 mv indicating that a large of amount of oxidizing species were generated in water after plasma treatment after adding different ros scavengers into this system the orps were all significantly decreased compared with that of 10 min plasma treated water suggesting that all of these antioxidants could eliminate the oxidizing species in the plasma liquid system to some extent and l his had the maximum scavenging effects more interestingly although pbs can t directly scavenge ros but it also decreased orp it is probably that pbs can maintain a neutral ph which is not beneficial for some ros generation in liquids besides orp ph also plays an important role in the antimicrobial properties of plasma treated liquids which can act as a catalyst for post discharge reactions and facilitate the antimicrobial effects of ros ikawa et al 2010 traylor et al 2011 oehmigen et al 2010 as shown in fig 2b the ph was significantly decreased from 7 to 4 3 during 10 min plasma treatment demonstrating that he plasma treatment can result in the water acidification pbs and l his were wonderful ph buffer that can keep a neutral environment after 10 min plasma treatment while d man and sod can only slightly relieve water acidification taken together plasma treated water has high orp and low ph which endows it with antimicrobial activity while pbs d man l his and sod weaken its oxidation activity and acidity to some extent as shown in fig 2c f four major ros oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were generated in this plasma liquid system and their concentration were all significantly increased with plasma treatment time although oh has a low diffusion capacity due to its high reactivity and short lifetime there were still a large amount of oh detected in this system which maybe derived from the gas phase oh diffusing into the liquids only a small fraction or directly generated in liquids through water cleavage by electrons uv photos energy rich metastable he or atomic oxygen o 3p via reaction 1 2 wende et al 2020 1 h 2 o aq h v e he oh h 2 h 2 o aq o 3 p aq from gas phase 2 oh in addition to the detection of ros after different plasma treatment time we also focused on the effects of pbs d man sod and l his on every ros generation in 10 min plasma treated liquids these results were comparatively analyzed with that of 10 min plasma treated water by applying the paired sample t test as shown in fig 2c d man and l his can significantly inhibit oh generation due to the fact that both d man and l his have a high reaction rate constant with oh 2 7 109 m 1s 1 and 5 109 m 1s 1 respectively wu et al al 2012 sod also has a high reaction rate constant with oh 5 3 1010 m 1s 1 but the concentration of sod used in this study was low about 0 62 μm kondeti et al 2018 thus only a small quantity of oh was scavenged by sod pbs also slightly decreased oh concentration but without significant difference probably due to the reason that h2po4 and hpo4 2 in the pbs solution can slowly react with oh 2 104 m 1s 1 and 1 5 105 m 1s 1 xie et al 2015 in the fig 2d l his can significantly inhibit 1o2 generation 3 2 107 m 1s 1 apart from this sod also reduced the concentration of 1o2 despite the high reaction rate 2 73 109 m 1s 1 between sod and 1o2 the low concentration of sod mainly act as an enzyme was not enough for the significant decrease of 1o2 concentration this implied that 1o2 was partly from o2 dismutation reaction 3 and sod prevented the production of 1o2 indirectly through increasing the occurrence of reaction 4 koppenol 1976 2001 this result is different with some studies reporting that o2 served as the precursor of oh through the haber weiss reaction 5 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2015 sod as one kind of anti oxidase remarkedly reduced o2 concentration fig 2e in contrary pbs and l his can slightly increase the concentration of o2 this may be attributed to reaction 6 the ratio of o2 to hoo is dependent on the ph value when the ph value is about 7 superoxide radical exists in the form of o2 takai et al 2013 sod not only reduced o2 concentration also increased the concentration of h2o2 through the reaction 4 fig 2f taken together the ros oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were generated in this plasma liquid system and increased in a time dependent manner meanwhile o2 probably serve as the precursor of 1o2 more importantly the four kinds of chemical agents have different functions in this system d man can only scavenge oh l his can scavenge both oh and 1o2 as well as maintain a neutral ph sod can reduce o2 and thus indirectly partly reduce 1o2 at the same time increase the concentration of h2o2 pbs can effectively maintain a neutral ph 3 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 dismutation k 4 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 4 2 h 2 o 2 sod o 2 h 2 o 2 self dismutation k 2 37 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh o h o 2 haber weiss reaction 6 o 2 h hoo pk 4 8 3 2 effects of plasma on cell viability and apoptosis it is well known that the number of viable cells determined by cfu assay is inaccurate to some extent due to the presence of viable but nonculturable vbnc cells which cannot be cultured but may still maintain metabolic activity and membrane integrity dolezalova et al 2015 thus the cell viability of yeast cells after different treatments were measured by cfu and live dead fluorescence assays the propidium iodide pi and syto 9 dye were utilized viable cells with intact membranes are stained by syto 9 whereas cells with compromised cell membranes are stained by pi quadrants q1 q2 q3 and q4 denotes dead cells red syto 9 pi membrane compromised cells blue syto 9 pi negative signals black syto 9 pi and live cells with intact cell membrane green syto 9 pi respectively as shown in fig 3 b with the increasing of plasma treatment time the live cells decreased from 95 20 to 10 89 while the dead and injured cells increased from 2 25 to 70 96 and 1 94 to 16 89 respectively this was consistent with cfu results fig 3a the survival rate was significantly p 0 05 decreased in a time dependent manner and the survival rate was 81 3 34 6 and 19 0 after 2 5 5 and 10 min plasma treatment respectively compared with 10 min plasma treatment pbs significantly increased the percentage of viable cells fig 3b but the change of cfu was not obvious fig 3a which is possibly attributed to the reason that the stable ion environment provided by pbs can preserve the osmotic pressure of cells carvalho et al 2018 and thus temporarily maintaining the cell viability this also suggested that the death caused by the plasma acid is likely to be a slow process d man or l his have a relatively better protective ability improving the percentage of viable cells in q4 from 10 89 to 59 42 and 66 77 respectively this is consistent with the cfu results and indicates that oh and 1o2 play important roles in killing yeast cells pearson correlation analysis also indicated that oh and 1o2 had higher correlation coefficient with survival rate 0 914 and 0 853 respectively the results were shown in table s1 as sod partly reduced 1o2 contents and simultaneously remarkedly raised h2o2 concentration but the percentage of viable cells were higher than that of 10 min plasma treatment revealing that h2o2 may play a little role in plasma sterilization in order to further verify this speculation yeast cells were treated by individual h2o2 solution with the same concentration of plasma treated liquids 100 200 400 and 800 μm it was found that except 800 μm h2o2 exhibiting slight antimicrobial effects about 1 the other groups had no effects on yeast cell growth indicating that h2o2 in this plasma liquid system contributes little to yeast inactivation by plasma the results were shown in fig s4 generally there are two distinct modes of cell death apoptosis or necrosis lunov et al 2016 reported that plasma could induce apoptosis or necrosis in bacteria depending on the plasma treatment time herein we also investigate how the yeast cells die after plasma treatment undergoing apoptosis or necrosis the apoptotic and necrotic cells were detected by annexin v and pi double staining in the early stages of apoptosis phosphatidylserine will exposure to the outer side of the membrane which can bind to annexin v staining as an early apoptotic marker madeo et al 1997 quadrants q1 q2 q3 and q4 denotes necrotic cell annexin v pi late apoptotic cell annexin v pi viable cell annexin v pi and early apoptotic cell annexin v pi respectively as shown in fig 3c the plasma caused apoptosis in a time dependent manner ranging from 3 15 to 65 63 and also caused necrosis 13 10 in the condition of 10 min plasma treatment in the condition of adding agents l his reduced the apoptotic rate from 65 63 to 26 18 which presented the best protective effects followed by d man which reduced the apoptotic rate to 47 97 in the pbs and sod group the apoptotic rate was 71 27 and 63 10 respectively so the variation was little compared to that of 10 min plasma treatment but the proportion of early apoptotic cells obviously increased it can be speculated that the pbs and sod slowed the proceeding of apoptotic taken together plasma can effectively inactivate yeast cells and oh and 1o2 contribute most to plasma sterilization in this system while h2o2 plays a little role moreover yeast cells underwent apoptosis after short time 2 5 and 5 min plasma treatment while long time 10 min plasma treatment could result in cell necrosis in order to explore the inactivation mechanism of yeast cells in this plasma liquid system various intracellular physiological changes were evaluated in the following experiments 3 3 effects of plasma on cell morphology and size the sem images of yeast cells after different treatments were shown in fig 4 a the morphological changes of yeast cells caused by plasma can be obviously observed compared with untreated oval and plump yeast cells plasma treatments wrinkled yeast cells or even disrupted yeast cells and produced cell debris and the damage degree was increased with plasma treatment time compared with 10 min plasma treatment d man and l his can effectively protect yeast cell morphology from plasma damage and reduce cell debris suggesting that oh and 1o2 were both important in cell morphological changes which is consist with the cell viability results it is well known that the cell wall and membrane is unavoidably damaged by ros which can oxidize unsaturated fatty acids in the lipid bilayer cleave peptide bonds and oxidize amino acid side chains causing membrane damage and cell rupture van der paal et al 2016 similarly sod reduced o2 and further diminished 1o2 thus can also relieve plasma damage to cell morphology to some extent meanwhile sod could also significantly increased h2o2 which didn t cause more severe damage indicating that h2o2 play little roles in morphological changes of yeast cells whereas pbs almost had no protective effects due to the reason that pbs cannot effectively scavenge ros furthermore the light scattering data for yeast cells after different treatments are shown in fig 4b the scattering light detectors of flow cytometer are divided into side scatter ssc and forward scatter fsc ssc is more sensitive to the refractivity of the cell cytoplasm and nuclear membrane while fsc is closely related to cell size combarros et al 2016 with the increasing of plasma treatment time the mean fsc value was significantly decreased indicating that much more cell debris located at the bottom left corner with small fsc and ssc value were generated by plasma d man l his and sod can increase fsc value compared with that of 10 min plasma treatment and followed the order l his d man sod which is consistent with sem results furtherer verifying that oh and 1o2 contribute most to the morphology alteration of yeast cells in this plasma liquid system 3 4 effects of plasma on cell membrane integrity cell membrane as the first and most important defense line can effectively protect the cells from its surrounding attacks herein the cell membrane integrity is evaluated by mda and intracellular protein leakage assays malondialdehyde mda is the lipid peroxidation product which could preferably reflect the degree of membrane lipid injury caused by plasma joshi et al 2011 as shown in fig 5 a plasma treatment significantly increased the concentration of mda p 0 05 indicating that ros in plasma treated liquids can attack cell membrane and lead to lipid peroxidation comparatively the production of mda was remarkedly inhibited when the yeast cells were treated by plasma in the presence of the three antioxidants and l his and d man had the similar inhibition effects d man reduced the mda from 233 6 to 178 0 μm mg protein and l his reduced to 173 7 μm mg protein given that both l his and d man can effectively scavenge oh it is deduced that lipid peroxidation of cell membrane caused by plasma is mainly attributed to oh rather than 1o2 the reasons may be that oh with an electrode potential of 2 8 v is most reactive and toxic species among all ros while the electrode potential of 1o2 is only 0 98 v thus oh is more easily attack the membrane and cause lipid peroxidation secondly oh and 1o2 have different reaction pathways with lipids oh driven lipid peroxidation is a catalytic process that may rapidly propagate through membranes and severely damage membranes while 1o2 oxygenation is noncatalytic and produces only one lipid hydroperoxide farmer et al 2013 sasaki et al 2016 also reported that oh is the key ros inducing cell membrane permeabilization in addition pearson correlation analysis also indicated that oh had a significant correlation with mda 0 714 the damage of cell membrane could lead to the leakage of intracellular components thus the intracellular protein leakage was measured as shown in fig 5b the protein leakage of yeast cells increased with plasma treatment time and antioxidants can significantly decreased protein leakage the change pattern of protein leakage among different treatments were similar with that of mda contents indicating that lipid peroxidation of cell membrane is responsible for the loss of cell membrane integrity 3 5 effects of plasma on intracellular redox homeostasis 3 5 1 intracellular ros and h2o2 the intracellular ros analyzed by the flow cytometry shown in fig 6 a the population 1 p1 represented the ros negative cells and p2 is the ros positive cells with the increasing of plasma treatment time the ros positive cells ascended gradually under normal conditions the internal ros is mostly from the leakage of electrons from the electron transport chain etc as the ros is toxic to cellular components the intracellular ros is maintained at low level by cell anti oxidative system the ascend of ros would fatally cause a cascade of harmful effects generally speaking internal ros could be generated by oxidative stress that can be triggered by many stimuli such as extreme ph osmotic stress acetic acid and heavy metals strich 2015 for example cr vi can stimulate ros formation during their re oxidation processes both via fenton like and haber weiss reactions feng et al 2017 similarly the formation of intracellular ros with visible light irradiated ag agbr may be through fenton or harber weiss reaction xia et al 2016 the nzvi pd particles reacted with oxygen and generated a great deal of ros in situ via two electron transfer lv et al 2017 different to the mental nanoparticles the extracellular ros produced by the plasma can lead to the oxidation of lipids mainly attributed to oh fig 5a affect the bilayer fluidity and cause lipid disorder even form transient opening of pores thereby altering the permeability of membrane to ros for this reason the entering of extracellular ros via damaged cell membrane contribute to the accumulation of intracellular ros and d man and l his can reduce the accumulation of intracellular ros due to the better protective effects on cell membrane besides the dcfh da was applied for the detection of ros chen et al 2010 the intracellular h2o2 was also measured shown in fig 6b similar to intracellular ros the intracellular h2o2 also ascended over the treatment time and the d man and l his can significantly alleviate the intracellular h2o2 more interestingly sod significantly enhanced the intracellular h2o2 it was reported that the specific aquaporin aqp could facilitate the passive diffusion of h2o2 across biological membranes yusupov et al 2018 bienert and chaumont 2014 yan et al 2015 thus the massive of extracellular h2o2 raised by sod can penetrate into the yeast cells not only through the transient opening of pores but also aqp in order to estimate the main factor accountable for intracellular h2o2 the individual h2o2 experiments at the same concentration of plasma liquid system were carried out the results were shown in fig s5 the protein leakage rate of individual 100 200 400 and 800 μm h2o2 were about 1 and there were little intracellular h2o2 generated indicating that only a small quantity of extracellular h2o2 can penetrate into the yeast cells with complete cell membrane conversely plasma treatment significantly increased intracellular protein leakage and intracellular h2o2 were obviously higher than that of individual h2o2 solutions at the same concentration moreover although 10 min 10min pbs 10min d man and 10min l his group had same extracellular h2o2 concentration about 400 μm but the intracellular h2o2 in these groups were different which had a similar changing trend with that of protein leakage rate these results indicate that the increase of intracellular h2o2 in the processing of plasma treatment could be mainly attributed to the damage of cell membrane integrity which permits the massive influx of extracellular h2o2 3 5 2 intracellular anti oxidative system the anti oxidative system is a range of defense mechanism that evolved by the organisms to eliminate ros before they attack to the intracellular constituents sies et al 2017 the major adaptive response is regulation of antioxidant levels including antioxidant enzymes e g superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat and or nonenzymatic antioxidants e g glutathione gsh sod can catalyze o2 to molecular oxygen o2 and h2o2 cat catalyzes the dismutation of h2o2 to water gsh as an antioxidant molecule has sulfhydryl sh group which can directly react with various ros in a non enzymatic manner winterbourn and metodiewa 1999 thus the intracellular redox homeostasis can be maintained by intracellular antioxidant system unfortunately when the intracellular ros accumulated and exceeded a certain threshold not only the toxic ros could not be eliminated ros would conversely disrupt the cellular antioxidative enzyme like sod or cat sun et al 2014 ultimately the intracellular redox homeostasis was broken down kikuchi et al 1997 as shown in fig 6c e sod and cat activity descended with the increasing of plasma treatment time the same tendency happened to the gsh concentration these indicated that plasma can destroy the intracellular redox homeostasis in a time dependent manner d man and l his can significantly alleviate the decrease of sod and cat activity as well as gsh concentration it implied that oh and 1o2 generated by plasma could destroy the intracellular anti oxidative system by generating excessive intracellular ros fig 6a what should be paid attention is the sod group there was a significant increase of intracellular h2o2 compared to 10 min plasma treatment but the variation of sod activity and gsh concentration was not obvious except a slight drop of cat activity this indicates that the contribution of h2o2 to the break of anti oxidative system is little it is generally believed that h2o2 as one kind of nonradical species performs major second messenger functions sies et al 2017 thus the massive h2o2 may act as a signaling molecule triggering a series of cascades reactions and don t play a role during short time 10 min plasma treatment for pbs group although the pbs make no influence on the attack of ros generated by plasma to cell membrane but the intracellular ros positive cells reduced from 36 66 to 28 53 and the disruption of anti oxidative system was inhibited this may be due to the reason that the external pbs can maintain intracellular ion homeostasis which may influence the damage progress of intracellular ros to anti oxidative system 3 6 effects of plasma on energy metabolism mitochondria are the central site for energy generation in eukaryotic cell mitochondrial dysfunction is a representative feature in apoptotic processes and mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation mmp is a crucial step in the signaling cascade hengartner 2000 mmp can be triggered by a variety of stimuli such as oxidative stress dna damage calcium furthermore the mmp could lead to the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential δψm and block atp synthesis and δψm dependent transports görlach et al 2015 carraro and bernardi 2016 in the processes of enhancement of mitochondrial permeability the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mptp is an important inducement and the accumulation of intracellular ros can cause the opening of mptp either by attacking mitochondrial membrane lipids or oxidizing the specific protein complexes simultaneously the ros can reinforce mitochondrial ca 2 overload and induce mptp opening by triggering endoplasmic reticulum er ca 2 release tajeddine 2016 thus the alteration of δψm caused by plasma in yeast cells was evaluated by jc 1 staining meanwhile intracellular ca 2 variation was detected by calcium specific fluorescent dye the cationic jc 1 usually exhibits red fluorescence when gathering in normal mitochondrial matrix in aggregates form nevertheless it is presented as monomers in the cytoplasm and emits green fluorescence if the depolarization of δψm occurs bernas and dobrucki 2002 thus the decrease of the ratio of red to green fluorescence denotes the mitochondrial depolarization as presented in fig 7 a plasma treatment significantly caused the depolarization of δψm which is probably due to the accumulation of intracellular ros compared with the 10 min plasma treatment d man did not vary the ratio of red to green differently the l his can reduce the mitochondrial depolarization this indicates that 1o2 may diffuse into the yeast cells and attack mitochondrial membrane consequently leading to depolarization of δψm while oh didn t have these effects the reason may be that 1o2 has relatively longer life span and better diffusion compared with oh moreover 1o2 also has high oxidation ability and could react with a wide range of biological targets including dna rna proteins lipid the rate constants between 1o2 and proteins side chains are higher than other cellular targets davies 2003 morgan et al 2004 aboubakr et al 2016 davies 2016 thus every kinds of alkali cation h exchangers maintaining δψm and the f1f0 atpase used for atp synthesis might be damaged by 1o2 orij et al 2011 the adding of sod can also relieve the depolarization of δψm due to the decrease of 1o2 in this plasma liquid system the fig 7b shows the intracellular ca 2 level the plasma treatment significantly caused the accumulation of intracellular ca 2 level after 2 5 min plasma treatment then ca 2 concentration was remarkedly decreased with the treatment time probably due to the damage of membrane integrity which lead to the leakage of intracellular ca 2 for the results of intracellular ca 2 level the change pattern among different additives was in accordance with the depolarization of δψm suggesting that 1o2 induced the accumulation of intracellular ca 2 furthermore excessive intracellular ros especially 1o2 and ca 2 induce the opening of mptp which causes the depolarization of δψm apart from this the opening of mptp have the potential to induce the release of proapoptotic factors including cytochrome c cyt c accordingly leading to activation of a caspase cascade and subsequent cell apoptosis mattson 2000 as the atp synthesis is the main function of mitochondria cellular atp were also analyzed the results were presented in fig 7c with the increasing of plasma treatment time the atp ascended firstly and then descended the 2 5 min plasma induced cellular atp raise may be due to the following reasons ca 2 could promote atp synthesis through stimulating enzymes in the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria which can increase metabolic rate and inevitably increase electron leakages from respiratory etc and ros levels görlach et al 2015 since the ros accumulated continuously either from plasma treatment or the respiratory process in mitochondria ultimately continuous plasma treatment lead to the reduce of cellular atp level compared with 10 min plasma treatment l his have the best effects in alleviating the reduction of cellular atp level this is consistent with the variation of δψm this indicated that l his effectively scavenge 1o2 which can cause the depolarization of δψm further interrupt atp synthesis differently d man could not alleviate the depolarization of δψm but inhibit the reduction of atp it is reported that when the cell was subjected to stress environments the adaptive responses can enhance the metabolic rate and increase the consumption of atp for example when the dna were damaged the nuclear repair enzyme poly adp ribose polymerase parp could be activated which could rapidly decrease atp levels clément and pervaiz 2001 from this standpoint d man alleviated the reduction of cellular atp level probably by reducing the consumption of atp rather than protecting atp synthesis 3 7 effects of plasma on phi potassium ions and cell membrane potential in the living cells nearly all of the physiological activities are ph dependent for example the regulation of organic transport as well as strict glycolysis process is affected by phi in the metabolic activities besides this ph can also influence the phosphorylation of proteins and charged residues of amino acid side chains which consequently leads to the changes of protein activity meanwhile ph also impacts the interactions of proteins with other proteins lipids and metabolites thus phi is tightly regulated by precise mechanism in cellular systems orij et al 2011 among the mechanisms the p type h atpase is the master regulator which is a membrane protein that can pump protons out of the cell besides vacuolar proton translocating atpases v atpases can pump protons from cytosol into vacuoles to help control phi but when the phi falls below a certain threshold cells will lose the automatic regulators or die lagadic gossmann et al 2004 generally the main source of protons in yeast cells are every kinds of carbonic and organic acids produced by energy metabolism and the protons are pumped out of the cytosol by the regulatory mechanism martínez muñoz and kane 2008 as shown in fig 8 a plasma treatment significantly influenced phi homeostasis in yeast cells 5 and 10 min plasma treatment obviously reduced phi but 2 5 min plasma treatment did not trigger obvious changes this suggests that the phi response to the plasma is later than other physiological changes such as lipid peroxidation fig 5a the damage of anti oxidative system fig 6a the depolarization of δψm and the raise of intracellular ca 2 fig 7a b it is reported that plasma acid can decrease phi but the mechanism is not clear as the palsma acid is an inorganic acid which is different from organic acid the proton discharged by the strong acid could not enter cell cytoplasm rode et al 2010 giannattasio et al 2013 q zhang et al 2016 reported that the ros produced by plasma damaged cell membrane integrity which led to the influx of protons into the cells apart from this it is found that oxidative stress can inactivate pma1 h atpase pma1p activity which weakens cell regulative ability to phi stadler et al 2001 simultaneously both pma1p and the v atpase use energy from atp hydrolysis to pump protons out of the cytosol thus the decrease of atp also depressed the regulative ability to phi pbs as a ph buffer can keep a neutral ph and further affect the phi l his could not keep a neutral ph but also alleviate the ros impairment on cell membrane consequently inhibiting the drop of phi it is also reported that h2o2 can lead a drop of phi pervaiz and clément 2002 hu et al 1998 lagadic gossmann et al 2004 but sod did not further decrease the phi indicating that h2o2 did not play a pivotal role in reduce phi in this plasma liquid system d man indirectly inhibited the decrease of phi through protecting the cell membrane from the damage of oh the intracellular potassium ions k leakage were also measured as shown in fig 8b the released k increased over the plasma treatment time apart from the intracellular k leakage induced by the damage of cell membrane integrity the suppression of na k atpase would also cause the k leakage similar to the h atpase orij et al 2011 as the pbs contained k pbs can effectively maintain the intracellular k homeostasis although the l his can protect the membrane and serve as ph buffer it didn t contain k to maintain the intracellular k homeostasis all ionic gradients over the membrane together constitute the membrane potential in yeast cells the h electrochemical and k electrochemical gradient are confirmed to maintain the membrane potential maresova et al 2006 cyert and philpott 2013 membrane potential δψ is crucially important in cell physiological processes especially the transmembrane transport novo et al 1999 a potential sensitive probe dioc2 3 was applied for measuring the variation of δψ in yeast cells after plasma treatment in this study red green mean fluorescence intensity ratio is positively correlated with δψ novo et al 2000 every flow cytometric diagram reflected the green and red fluorescence intensity of 10 000 detected cells in the different treatment groups as shown in fig 8c the untreated cell negative control revealed a normal membrane potential whose red green ratio was 0 976 while carbonyl cyanide 3 chlorophenylhy drazone cccp treated cell positive control with a fully depolarized membrane potential displayed a low red green ratio of 0 479 the red green ratios of 2 5 5 and 10 min plasma treated cells were 0 501 0 358 and 0 245 respectively these results indicated that the depolarization degree of cell membrane is positive correlated to plasma treatment time combining with the phi and intracellular k leakage results the changes of intracellular k and h caused the depolarization of membrane potential to be specific the physical damage such as holes on the cell membrane caused by ros or the disorder of the ion transport systems and the ion channels both of which can influence ion homeostasis further destroy membrane potential long et al 2015 compared with 10 min plasma treatment all of the antioxidants d man l his and sod alleviated the cell membrane depolarization suggesting that the elimination of ros can reduce their attack to the cell membrane and accordingly interrupt the cell membrane depolarization thus protect the physiological activities of yeast cells although pbs could not scavenge ros but it had the best alleviative effects on the cell membrane depolarization caused by plasma among these additives due to its capacity to maintain ion homeostasis in yeast cells 3 8 effects of plasma on molecular structure of yeast cell surface fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir can identify chemical bonds in a molecule by producing an infrared absorption spectrum which is utilized to analyze the effects of plasma on chemical groups of yeast cell surface fig 9 a shows the ftir spectra of yeast cells after different treatments according to the published literatures movasaghi et al 2008 yan et al 2018 ch3 asymmetric bending 1460 cm 1 ch2 symmetric stretching 2860 cm 1 and ch2 asymmetric stretching 2924 cm 1 represent the variation of methyl and methylene from the fatty acid components of the various membrane amphiphiles peaks at 1080 and 1240 cm 1 can be attributed to p o asymmetric and symmetric stretching of phosphodiester such as nucleic acids phosphorylated proteins or polyphosphate products respectively maquelin et al 2002 the peak at 1545 cm 1 amide ii is assigned to n h bending and c n stretching of proteins while the band at 1654 cm 1 amide i is associated with stretching vibrations of c o of proteins the peak at 1375 cm 1 can be assigned to symmetric stretching vibration of c o of carboxylate groups coo in proteins kartaschew et al 2016 additionally the peaks at 808 908 and 965 cm 1 are most likely corresponding to ch symmetry stretching vinyl ch2 ch and trans vinylene chch stretching vibrations nordin and ismail 2013 q zhang et al 2016 after plasma treatment compared with control group there were new peaks at 808 908 and 965 cm 1 indicating that plasma can alter the structure and chemical bonds of yeast cell surface the vinyl and trans vinylene might be due to the hydrogen abstraction reactions between the oh and lipids razzokov et al 2018 ki et al 2016 cui et al 2018 moreover eight representative ftir spectra of lipids 1460 2860 and 2924 cm 1 phosphodiester 1080 and 1240 cm 1 and proteins 1375 1545 and 1654 cm 1 were chosen for quantification according to the methods reported by lackmann et al 2018 as shown in fig 9b the ftir signals of lipids were all significantly increased with plasma treatment time and d man and l his can effectively decrease these signals compared with 10 min plasma treatment the reason may be that plasma can damage the cell wall covering on the cell membrane thus much more lipids can be exposed and detected by ftir after longer time plasma treatment while d man and l his can relieve cell wall damage by scavenging ros the signals related to proteins besides bands at 1375 cm 1 and phosphodiester both increased during the first 5 min plasma treatment then reduced when the treatment time prolonged to 10 min the reason may be that much more intracellular proteins and dna can release from cytoplasm and adhere on the cell surface due to cell membrane damage leading to the increase of peak intensity then the leaked proteins and dna on cell surface can be degraded for long time plasma treatment thus resulting in the decrease of peak intensity additionally the signal of peak at 1375 cm 1 was significantly increased with the plasma treatment time which may be attributed to the formation of new carbonyl groups like aldehydes ketones or acids through the abstraction of allylic hydrogen atoms and esterification by oh kartaschew et al 2016 d man and l his can remarkedly decrease the peak signal at 1375 cm 1 due to the effective elimination of oh 3 9 effects of plasma on dna structure lastly dna fragmentation of yeast cells after different treatments was analyzed using pi staining by flow cytometer the sub g1 ratio can indicate the cell percentage with extensive dna fragmentations delobel and tesnière 2014 aouida et al 2007 as shown in fig 10 compared with control group the ratio of sub g1 population was increased from 2 83 to 10 41 after plasma treatment indicating that plasma can cause dna fragmentation which is probably due to the oxidative damage of intracellular ros on dna similar results were also reported in our previous studies xu et al 2020 ma et al 2013 d man and l his can effectively alleviate the excessive generation of intracellular ros fig 6a thus significantly decreased sub g1 ratio 3 10 proposed mechanism of yeast inactivation in the plasma liquid interaction system base on the comprehensive analysis presented above pearson correlation analysis shows that yeast survival rate was significantly correlated with various intracellular physiological changes results were shown in table s2 the speculated inactivation mechanisms of plasma can be illustrated in fig 11 mainly including the following steps 1 he plasma produced a large amount of ros in the liquid and simultaneously led to the acidification of liquids 2 ros especially oh and 1o2 could cause lipid peroxidation of cell membrane and then formed transient pores in cell membrane followed by the damage of cell membrane integrity apart from this the ros might also attack the membrane proteins and damage the membrane transport system as the oh and 1o2 are non selective to the targets 3 intracellular ros accumulated through two pathways the main pathway is that ros produced by plasma may enter the cell by the transient pores in the cell membrane the other is that the external oxidative stress could also induce the cellular oxidative stress response increasing intracellular ros indirectly 4 intracellular ros exceeded the threshold that the anti oxidative system can balance and destroyed sod and cat activity 5 excess intracellular ros could attack the mitochondria and induce the accumulation of intracellular ca 2 consequently leading to the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced cellular atp level 6 the decreased cellular atp level and impaired h atpase resulted in the deprivation of phi regulative capacity accordingly reducing phi meanwhile the protons in the external liquid would move into the cell via destroyed cell membrane and decrease phi additionally the vacuolar type h atpases in the vacuole might be damaged by intracellular ros accordingly leading to the protons flow into the cytoplasm and reducing phi 7 the destroyed ions homeostasis including h k ca 2 caused the depolarization of cell membrane potential 8 apart from the destruction of organelles intracellular ros could also attack macromolecules such as dna causing the dna fragmentation ultimately all of these resulted in the physiological dysfunctions and cell death base on the results above pbs d man l his and sod have different functions during plasma sterilization in liquids shown in fig 12 a b d man scavenger for oh and l his scavenger both for oh and 1o2 could effectively alleviate ros damage to cell membrane accordingly reducing the intracellular ros moreover the lipid peroxidation of cell membrane in this study is mainly attributed to oh which is consistent with other report kaneko et al 2017 although the distinct kinds of intrcellular ros could not be distinguished it can be speculated that the mitochondrial membrane potential was possibly influenced by 1o2 the sod can raise h2o2 and then increase intracellular h2o2 which has negligible effects on physiological activities in this study the intracellular h2o2 is mainly derived from the influx of extracellular h2o2 via damaged cell membrane and plays a little role in yeast inactivation during 10 min plasma treatment which may due to the fact that the microbial inactivation by h2o2 generally needs a relative long time folmer et al 2008 hoeberichts et al 2010 pbs can maintain the phi and ions homeostasis accordingly keeping normal membrane potential but pbs could not alleviate ros damage to the cellular components 4 conclusions in conclusion this study unravels the comprehensive subcellular antimicrobial mechanism of plasma for water disinfection through the role of several key inactivation agents oh 1o2 o2 h2o2 and ph and complex physiological activities the results show that oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 are generated in this plasma water system and increased in a time dependent manner o2 serves as the precursor of 1o2 and plasma treatment leads to water acidification plasma can effectively inactivate yeast cells mainly via apoptosis by damaging cell membrane cell morphology alteration and increased lipid peroxidation and membrane permeability intracellular redox homeostasis excessive generation of intracellular ros and h2o2 and decreased sod and cat activity and gsh contents energy metabolism decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular atp level as well as increased intracellular ca2 intracellular ionic equilibrium decreased phi and cell membrane potential and increased intracellular k leakage and dna structure the results of plasma with pbs d man l his and sod demonstrate that oh and 1o2 contributes most to the yeast inactivation the oh mainly attacks cell membrane and increases cell membrane permeability the disturb of cell energy metabolism is mainly attributed to 1o2 in addition the damage of cell membrane as well as extracellular low ph could break the intracellular ionic equilibrium and further reduce cell membrane potential the remarkable increase of intracellular h2o2 is mainly due to the influx of extracellular h2o2 via destroyed cell membrane which play a little role in yeast inactivation during 10 min plasma treatment this work extends the available knowledge of the antimicrobial mechanisms of plasma in an aqueous environment which will help to promote the application of cap in water disinfection additionally based on the fact that the most important antimicrobial agents oh and 1o2 produced in this plasma liquid system are short lived and have strong oxidizing property plasma could be a novel eco friendly and high efficiency waster disinfection method declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest

17425,although the identification of effective reactive oxygen species ros generated by plasma has been extensively studied yet the subcellular mechanism of microbial inactivation has never been clearly elucidated in plasma disinfection processes in this study subcellular mechanism of yeast cell inactivation during plasma liquid interaction was revealed in terms of comprehensive factors including cell morphology membrane permeability lipid peroxidation membrane potential intracellular redox homeostasis intracellular ros and h2o2 and antioxidant system sod cat and gsh intracellular ionic equilibrium intracellular h and k and energy metabolism mitochondrial membrane potential intracellular ca 2 and atp level the ros analysis show that oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were generated in this plasma liquid interaction system and o2 served as the precursor of 1o2 additionally the solution ph was reduced plasma can effectively inactivate yeast cells mainly via apoptosis by damaging cell membrane intracellular redox and ion homeostasis and energy metabolism as well as causing dna fragmentation ros scavengers l his d man and sod and ph buffer phosphate buffer solution pbs were employed to investigate the role of five antimicrobial factors oh 1o2 o2 h2o2 and low ph in plasma sterilization results show that they have different influences on the aforementioned cell physiological activities the oh and 1o2 contributed most to the yeast inactivation the oh mainly attacked cell membrane and increased cell membrane permeability the disturb of cell energy metabolism was mainly attributed to 1o2 the damage of cell membrane as well as extracellular low ph could break the intracellular ionic equilibrium and further reduce cell membrane potential the remarkable increase of intracellular h2o2 was mainly due to the influx of extracellular h2o2 via destroyed cell membrane which played a little role in yeast inactivation during 10 min plasma treatment these findings provide comprehensive insights into the antimicrobial mechanism of plasma which can promote the development of plasma as an alternative water disinfection strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cold atmospheric pressure plasma cap subcellular antimicrobial mechanism reactive oxygen species ros intracellular redox homeostasis intracellular ionic equilibrium energy metabolism system 1 introduction over the past two decades due to the properties of environmentally friendly and efficiency disinfection lee et al 2016 the application of cold atmospheric plasma cap on biological inactivation and as therapy for infectious diseases have been extensively researched ryu et al 2013 wu et al 2012 ma et al 2013 tian et al 2015 joubert et al 2013 apart from this cap also shown promising potential in other biomedical applications such as wound healing blood coagulation cancer treatment and neurological diseases treatment isbary et al 2013 bekeschus et al 2018 keidar 2015 jang et al 2018 in the sterilization studies of bacteria fungi and viruses it has been found that the reactive species induced by the plasma play dominant roles guo et al 2018 chen et al 2017 but as the complexity of reactive species it is still not very clear how these reactive species specifically caused the inactivation of microorganisms and whether every kinds of reactive species can cause specific damage to a particular biological structure or components or specifically disorder some certain essential physiological functions in the process of plasma treatment plasma is an ionized gas generated by high electric voltage discharge at atmospheric pressure which consists of complex reactive species electrons electric fields and ultraviolet light laroussi 2005 the reactive oxygen species ros including oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 and reactive nitrogen species rns including no onoo no2 and no3 can produced by different gas such as helium he argon ar nitrogen n2 ambient air or mixture of gasses generally speaking the rons was correlated with the working feeding or shielding ambient gasses when the ionized gas is air or part of n2 rns may be the key reactive species aboubakr et al 2016 liu et al 2017 girard et al 2016 kovačević et al 2017 jablonowski et al 2015 ito et al 2016 uchida et al 2018 in order to study the effect of ros induced by dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma on the microorganisms the plasma was generated under pure he environment in this study because of high oxidation potential ros can damage dna proteins lipids further trigger cell death in these several kinds of ros oh o2 and 1o2 belong to short lived reactive species oh the highest oxidant possesses a 2 8 ev oxidation potential but the lifetime is only 10 9 s some researchers have reported that oh is a vital factor in killing cell zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the half life of o2 is several tens of minutes it is generally believed that o2 serve as the precursor of oh xu et al 2015 wu et al 2012 kim et al 2016 as well as converted into hydroperoxyl radicals hoo in the low ph condition which can penetrate the cell membrane and damage intercellular components ikawa et al 2010 1o2 possesses a 0 65 ev oxidation potential which is also considered important in microbial inactivation planas et al 2016 yasui et al 2015 aboubakr et al 2016 h2o2 is the long lived reactive species girard et al 2016 and shen et al 2016 found the h2o2 contribute to antimicrobial ability in association with no2 in brief the short lived reactive species oh and 1o2 and long lived reactive species h2o2 can induce the death of cell but the cellular targets of every kinds of ros is not very clear and it is of great importance to verify this detailed mechanism for explore better control strategy of plasma to achieve a best application besides generating reactive oxygen species ros non thermal plasma could also lead to the acidification of treated solution the low ph can also cause the inactivation of microbes ikawa et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 but what role low ph play in the process of synergistically inducing cell death with ros is not very clear the previous researches mostly focused on some cellular structure or physiological activity changes of microbes induced by plasma for example researchers found plasma could destroy cell membrane further intracellular various macromolecules would be damaged kaneko et al 2015 2017 sasaki et al 2016 the oxidative dna damage was also be verified joshi et al 2011 itooka et al 2018 found that plasma could lead to protein aggregates and endoplasmic reticulum er stress in yeast cytoplasm the energy generation system of bacteria could also be destroyed by plasma huang et al 2020 all these cellular changes could lead to the death of microbes but the comprehensive experiments were not conducted to make sure the pivotal cellular structure or physiological activity changes in addition several studies have demonstrated plasma could trigger apoptosis both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms especially under a relative short exposure time lunov et al 2016 xu et al 2020 the model of apoptosis posit that excess extracellular chemicals interact with or enter cells and disrupt cellular homeostasis zhou et al 2019 thus it is necessary to ascertain the influence of ros generated by plasma on various intracellular homeostasis such as intracellular redox and ph homeostasis intracellular ionic equilibrium and energy metabolism intracellular ph homeostasis tightly regulates various metabolic activities in all cellular systems orij et al 2011 which was still rarely studied in the cell killing effects of non thermal plasma similarly metal ions serve as essential enzyme cofactors and perform both structural and signaling roles within cells cyert and philpott 2013 but the effect of plasma on intracellular mental ions levels was rarely researched mitochondria as an organelle for producing atp play an important role in intracellular energy metabolism which was little researched yeast as a unicellular eukaryotic model microorganism shows many similarities with bacteria and its cellular structure is simple therefore yeast is an ideal strain to study the killing effect mechanism of plasma in this study intracellular redox and ph homeostasis intracellular ionic equilibrium and intracellular energy metabolism were investigated and pearson correlation to microbial inactivation were analyzed to further reveal the mechanisms of cap induced cell death by using the biological model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae s cerevisiae due to the complexity of plasma components specific radical scavengers such as d mannitol d man superoxide dismutase sod l histidine l his as well as ph buffer phosphate buffer solution pbs were selected to comparatively explore the effect of ros on every intracellular physiological activities in this study the major ros were detected by chemical probe moreover oxidation reduction potential orp and ph were recorded to estimate its physicochemical properties the antimicrobial efficacy was examined via colony forming unit cfu count and further verified by live dead staining and scanning electron microscope sem furthermore cell membrane integrity and permeability lipid peroxidation membrane potential intracellular ph and cellular atp level were systematically investigated to reveal the subcellular mechanism of microbial inactivation in the dbd plasma system 2 experimental set up and methods 2 1 the plasma liquid interaction system the schematic diagram of plasma device is depicted in fig 1 the structure of dielectric barrier discharge dbd consists of three parts a high voltage hv electrode plate a steel hexagon shaped mesh as the ground electrode and the

flow rate of helium was 1 5 l min the discharge voltage and current were measured by high voltage probe tektronix p6015a and current probe pearson electronics 2877 respectively the data of waveforms were recorded by oscilloscope teledyne wavesurfer 3000 and the discharge powers were obtained by integrating the product of voltage and current the applied voltage and discharge current are shown in

properties of plasma treated solutions 2 2 1 the value of ph and orp the acidification of plasma treated solution is one of the major physicochemical properties orp is an indicator of the general level of rons in solutions thus the orp and ph of the solutions were immediately measured after plasma treatment 0 2 5 5 and 10 min by a multimeter ph redox mettler toledo switzerland 2 2 2 ros assay four major ros oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were analyzed in this plasma liquid system terephthalic acid ta macklin china is a well known specific probe to detect oh due to its high reaction rate coefficient k

plasma liquid system was calculated by standard curve furfuryl alcohol ffa sigma aldrich usa is extremely reactive toward 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1s 1 cote et al 2018 the decay of ffa was analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography system waters e2695alliance hplc waters usa the concentration used for detection is 1 mm the standard curve of ffa was shown in fig s2 the degradation rate of ffa was used to represent the production of 1o2 the production of o2 was detected by nitro blue tetrazolium nbt k 5 88 104m 1s 1 solarbio china o2 could react with nbt to form a blue compound with a maximum absorbance wave length at 580 nm uv mini 1240 shimadzu japan bielski et al 1980 the concentration of nbt used for dectection is 500 μm h2o2 was detected by hydrogen peroxide assay kit beyotime jiangsu china shen et al 2016 the solution after plasma treatment was added 15 μl nan3 200 mm 10 fold diluted and added the h2o2 detection reagents the absorbance was measured at 560 nm by the varioskan lux thermo usa the standard curve of h2o2 was shown in fig s3 the concentration of these ros in the sterile deionized water were immediately measured after 0 2 5 5 and 10 min plasma treatment the water without plasma treatment was set as control con 2 2 3 scavenger study to further verify the generation of these ros and investigate their interconversion in this plasma liquid system the physicochemical properties of plasma treated solutions were also measured under scavenger loaded conditions to remove the corresponding ros in this study 0 5 m d mannitol d man aladdin usa 0 25 m l histidine l his solarbio china and 100 u ml superoxide dismutase sod beyotime china were utilized to remove oh 1o2 and o2 respectively aboubakr et al 2016 ma et al 2012 wu et al 2012 0 1 m pbs ph 7 4 containing na2hpo4 nah2po4 and 0 45 mm k was used to prevent the drop of ph in the plasma treated solutions xu et al 2019 the ph orp and ros concentration of the scavengers or pbs solutions were immediately measured after 10 min plasma treatment 2 3 yeast strains growth conditions and plasma treatment the eukaryotic model yeast s cerevisiae wild type strain by4741 atcc 201 388 was used in the experiment the strain preserved in sterile glycerol solution at 80 c was activated by an overnight cultivation in yeast extract peptone adenine dextrose ypad medium by shaking at 200 rpm 30 c for about 15 h then the active strain was shifted into new ypad medium and cultivated to exponential phase the yeast suspension was about 107 colony forming unit cfu per ml and harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm 25 c for 5 min the yeast cells were then washed and resuspended in sterile deionized water for the plasma treatment the power density was kept to be about 0 07 w cm2 for sample treatment and the length of gap lg between the discharge surface and liquid surface of yeast suspensions was about 1 mm fig 1a and b the plasma treatment time was 0 2 5 5 and 10 min respectively the samples after 0 min plasma treatment was set as control con furthermore to determine the contribution of the major antimicrobial factors short lived ros of oh 1o2 and o2 and ph to yeast inactivation in liquids by plasma the plasma sterilization experiments were also conducted by adding different scavengers d man l his and sod and pbs solutions the applied concentration of d man l his sod and pbs was optimized as 0 5 m 0 25 m 100 u ml and 0 1 m respectively according to our previous studies xu et al 2019 and 2020 before plasma treatment yeast suspensions were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm and resuspended in d man l his sod and pbs solutions then the scavengers or pbs containing yeast suspensions were treated by plasma for 10 min the roles of different ros and ph in the plasma sterilization were identified by comparing the inactivation efficiency with and without the addition of different scavengers or pbs 2 4 evaluation of the physiological changes of yeast cells to investigate the antimicrobial mechanisms of plasma in liquids at the subcellular level eighteen cellular physiological parameters were measured in this study the physiological parameters examined after plasma treatment were as follows survival rate cell viability cell apoptosis cell morphology and size intracellular mda level and protein leakage intracellular ros and h2o2 intracellular antioxidants sod cat gsh mitochondrial membrane potential δψm intracellular ca2 cellular atp level phi intracellular k leakage cell membrane potential δψ chemical bonds of molecules on cell surface and dna fragmentations the details of these protocols were described in s4 s21 in si 2 5 statistical analysis data were obtained from at least three replicate experiments values from all experiments were expresses as the mean standard deviation sd statistical analysis was performed using spss statistical package 17 0 spss inc usa an analysis of variance anova was conducted to compare the effects of different plasma treatment time on every parameter and significant differences between mean values were identified by the student newman keul s multiple range test with a confidence level at p 0 05 in addition paired samples t test was employed to compare every parameter of 10 min plasma treated water with that of pbs d man sod or l his solutions after 10 min plasma treatment the difference is expressed as p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of plasma treated solutions orp measures the ability of a solution to oxidize or reduce another substance and depends upon the concentration of oxidizers and their strengths which is generally considered as an important factor affecting microbial inactivation mcferson 1993 as shown in fig 2 a the orp increased significantly over plasma treatment time compared to control 210 mv 10 min plasma treatment could significantly raise the orp to about 300 mv indicating that a large of amount of oxidizing species were generated in water after plasma treatment after adding different ros scavengers into this system the orps were all significantly decreased compared with that of 10 min plasma treated water suggesting that all of these antioxidants could eliminate the oxidizing species in the plasma liquid system to some extent and l his had the maximum scavenging effects more interestingly although pbs can t directly scavenge ros but it also decreased orp it is probably that pbs can maintain a neutral ph which is not beneficial for some ros generation in liquids besides orp ph also plays an important role in the antimicrobial properties of plasma treated liquids which can act as a catalyst for post discharge reactions and facilitate the antimicrobial effects of ros ikawa et al 2010 traylor et al 2011 oehmigen et al 2010 as shown in fig 2b the ph was significantly decreased from 7 to 4 3 during 10 min plasma treatment demonstrating that he plasma treatment can result in the water acidification pbs and l his were wonderful ph buffer that can keep a neutral environment after 10 min plasma treatment while d man and sod can only slightly relieve water acidification taken together plasma treated water has high orp and low ph which endows it with antimicrobial activity while pbs d man l his and sod weaken its oxidation activity and acidity to some extent as shown in fig 2c f four major ros oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were generated in this plasma liquid system and their concentration were all significantly increased with plasma treatment time although oh has a low diffusion capacity due to its high reactivity and short lifetime there were still a large amount of oh detected in this system which maybe derived from the gas phase oh diffusing into the liquids only a small fraction or directly generated in liquids through water cleavage by electrons uv photos energy rich metastable he or atomic oxygen o 3p via reaction 1 2 wende et al 2020 1 h 2 o aq h v e he oh h 2 h 2 o aq o 3 p aq from gas phase 2 oh in addition to the detection of ros after different plasma treatment time we also focused on the effects of pbs d man sod and l his on every ros generation in 10 min plasma treated liquids these results were comparatively analyzed with that of 10 min plasma treated water by applying the paired sample t test as shown in fig 2c d man and l his can significantly inhibit oh generation due to the fact that both d man and l his have a high reaction rate constant with oh 2 7 109 m 1s 1 and 5 109 m 1s 1 respectively wu et al al 2012 sod also has a high reaction rate constant with oh 5 3 1010 m 1s 1 but the concentration of sod used in this study was low about 0 62 μm kondeti et al 2018 thus only a small quantity of oh was scavenged by sod pbs also slightly decreased oh concentration but without significant difference probably due to the reason that h2po4 and hpo4 2 in the pbs solution can slowly react with oh 2 104 m 1s 1 and 1 5 105 m 1s 1 xie et al 2015 in the fig 2d l his can significantly inhibit 1o2 generation 3 2 107 m 1s 1 apart from this sod also reduced the concentration of 1o2 despite the high reaction rate 2 73 109 m 1s 1 between sod and 1o2 the low concentration of sod mainly act as an enzyme was not enough for the significant decrease of 1o2 concentration this implied that 1o2 was partly from o2 dismutation reaction 3 and sod prevented the production of 1o2 indirectly through increasing the occurrence of reaction 4 koppenol 1976 2001 this result is different with some studies reporting that o2 served as the precursor of oh through the haber weiss reaction 5 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2015 sod as one kind of anti oxidase remarkedly reduced o2 concentration fig 2e in contrary pbs and l his can slightly increase the concentration of o2 this may be attributed to reaction 6 the ratio of o2 to hoo is dependent on the ph value when the ph value is about 7 superoxide radical exists in the form of o2 takai et al 2013 sod not only reduced o2 concentration also increased the concentration of h2o2 through the reaction 4 fig 2f taken together the ros oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 were generated in this plasma liquid system and increased in a time dependent manner meanwhile o2 probably serve as the precursor of 1o2 more importantly the four kinds of chemical agents have different functions in this system d man can only scavenge oh l his can scavenge both oh and 1o2 as well as maintain a neutral ph sod can reduce o2 and thus indirectly partly reduce 1o2 at the same time increase the concentration of h2o2 pbs can effectively maintain a neutral ph 3 2 h 2 o 2 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 dismutation k 4 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 4 2 h 2 o 2 sod o 2 h 2 o 2 self dismutation k 2 37 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 o 2 h 2 o 2 oh o h o 2 haber weiss reaction 6 o 2 h hoo pk 4 8 3 2 effects of plasma on cell viability and apoptosis it is well known that the number of viable cells determined by cfu assay is inaccurate to some extent due to the presence of viable but nonculturable vbnc cells which cannot be cultured but may still maintain metabolic activity and membrane integrity dolezalova et al 2015 thus the cell viability of yeast cells after different treatments were measured by cfu and live dead fluorescence assays the propidium iodide pi and syto 9 dye were utilized viable cells with intact membranes are stained by syto 9 whereas cells with compromised cell membranes are stained by pi quadrants q1 q2 q3 and q4 denotes dead cells red syto 9 pi membrane compromised cells blue syto 9 pi negative signals black syto 9 pi and live cells with intact cell membrane green syto 9 pi respectively as shown in fig 3 b with the increasing of plasma treatment time the live cells decreased from 95 20 to 10 89 while the dead and injured cells increased from 2 25 to 70 96 and 1 94 to 16 89 respectively this was consistent with cfu results fig 3a the survival rate was significantly p 0 05 decreased in a time dependent manner and the survival rate was 81 3 34 6 and 19 0 after 2 5 5 and 10 min plasma treatment respectively compared with 10 min plasma treatment pbs significantly increased the percentage of viable cells fig 3b but the change of cfu was not obvious fig 3a which is possibly attributed to the reason that the stable ion environment provided by pbs can preserve the osmotic pressure of cells carvalho et al 2018 and thus temporarily maintaining the cell viability this also suggested that the death caused by the plasma acid is likely to be a slow process d man or l his have a relatively better protective ability improving the percentage of viable cells in q4 from 10 89 to 59 42 and 66 77 respectively this is consistent with the cfu results and indicates that oh and 1o2 play important roles in killing yeast cells pearson correlation analysis also indicated that oh and 1o2 had higher correlation coefficient with survival rate 0 914 and 0 853 respectively the results were shown in table s1 as sod partly reduced 1o2 contents and simultaneously remarkedly raised h2o2 concentration but the percentage of viable cells were higher than that of 10 min plasma treatment revealing that h2o2 may play a little role in plasma sterilization in order to further verify this speculation yeast cells were treated by individual h2o2 solution with the same concentration of plasma treated liquids 100 200 400 and 800 μm it was found that except 800 μm h2o2 exhibiting slight antimicrobial effects about 1 the other groups had no effects on yeast cell growth indicating that h2o2 in this plasma liquid system contributes little to yeast inactivation by plasma the results were shown in fig s4 generally there are two distinct modes of cell death apoptosis or necrosis lunov et al 2016 reported that plasma could induce apoptosis or necrosis in bacteria depending on the plasma treatment time herein we also investigate how the yeast cells die after plasma treatment undergoing apoptosis or necrosis the apoptotic and necrotic cells were detected by annexin v and pi double staining in the early stages of apoptosis phosphatidylserine will exposure to the outer side of the membrane which can bind to annexin v staining as an early apoptotic marker madeo et al 1997 quadrants q1 q2 q3 and q4 denotes necrotic cell annexin v pi late apoptotic cell annexin v pi viable cell annexin v pi and early apoptotic cell annexin v pi respectively as shown in fig 3c the plasma caused apoptosis in a time dependent manner ranging from 3 15 to 65 63 and also caused necrosis 13 10 in the condition of 10 min plasma treatment in the condition of adding agents l his reduced the apoptotic rate from 65 63 to 26 18 which presented the best protective effects followed by d man which reduced the apoptotic rate to 47 97 in the pbs and sod group the apoptotic rate was 71 27 and 63 10 respectively so the variation was little compared to that of 10 min plasma treatment but the proportion of early apoptotic cells obviously increased it can be speculated that the pbs and sod slowed the proceeding of apoptotic taken together plasma can effectively inactivate yeast cells and oh and 1o2 contribute most to plasma sterilization in this system while h2o2 plays a little role moreover yeast cells underwent apoptosis after short time 2 5 and 5 min plasma treatment while long time 10 min plasma treatment could result in cell necrosis in order to explore the inactivation mechanism of yeast cells in this plasma liquid system various intracellular physiological changes were evaluated in the following experiments 3 3 effects of plasma on cell morphology and size the sem images of yeast cells after different treatments were shown in fig 4 a the morphological changes of yeast cells caused by plasma can be obviously observed compared with untreated oval and plump yeast cells plasma treatments wrinkled yeast cells or even disrupted yeast cells and produced cell debris and the damage degree was increased with plasma treatment time compared with 10 min plasma treatment d man and l his can effectively protect yeast cell morphology from plasma damage and reduce cell debris suggesting that oh and 1o2 were both important in cell morphological changes which is consist with the cell viability results it is well known that the cell wall and membrane is unavoidably damaged by ros which can oxidize unsaturated fatty acids in the lipid bilayer cleave peptide bonds and oxidize amino acid side chains causing membrane damage and cell rupture van der paal et al 2016 similarly sod reduced o2 and further diminished 1o2 thus can also relieve plasma damage to cell morphology to some extent meanwhile sod could also significantly increased h2o2 which didn t cause more severe damage indicating that h2o2 play little roles in morphological changes of yeast cells whereas pbs almost had no protective effects due to the reason that pbs cannot effectively scavenge ros furthermore the light scattering data for yeast cells after different treatments are shown in fig 4b the scattering light detectors of flow cytometer are divided into side scatter ssc and forward scatter fsc ssc is more sensitive to the refractivity of the cell cytoplasm and nuclear membrane while fsc is closely related to cell size combarros et al 2016 with the increasing of plasma treatment time the mean fsc value was significantly decreased indicating that much more cell debris located at the bottom left corner with small fsc and ssc value were generated by plasma d man l his and sod can increase fsc value compared with that of 10 min plasma treatment and followed the order l his d man sod which is consistent with sem results furtherer verifying that oh and 1o2 contribute most to the morphology alteration of yeast cells in this plasma liquid system 3 4 effects of plasma on cell membrane integrity cell membrane as the first and most important defense line can effectively protect the cells from its surrounding attacks herein the cell membrane integrity is evaluated by mda and intracellular protein leakage assays malondialdehyde mda is the lipid peroxidation product which could preferably reflect the degree of membrane lipid injury caused by plasma joshi et al 2011 as shown in fig 5 a plasma treatment significantly increased the concentration of mda p 0 05 indicating that ros in plasma treated liquids can attack cell membrane and lead to lipid peroxidation comparatively the production of mda was remarkedly inhibited when the yeast cells were treated by plasma in the presence of the three antioxidants and l his and d man had the similar inhibition effects d man reduced the mda from 233 6 to 178 0 μm mg protein and l his reduced to 173 7 μm mg protein given that both l his and d man can effectively scavenge oh it is deduced that lipid peroxidation of cell membrane caused by plasma is mainly attributed to oh rather than 1o2 the reasons may be that oh with an electrode potential of 2 8 v is most reactive and toxic species among all ros while the electrode potential of 1o2 is only 0 98 v thus oh is more easily attack the membrane and cause lipid peroxidation secondly oh and 1o2 have different reaction pathways with lipids oh driven lipid peroxidation is a catalytic process that may rapidly propagate through membranes and severely damage membranes while 1o2 oxygenation is noncatalytic and produces only one lipid hydroperoxide farmer et al 2013 sasaki et al 2016 also reported that oh is the key ros inducing cell membrane permeabilization in addition pearson correlation analysis also indicated that oh had a significant correlation with mda 0 714 the damage of cell membrane could lead to the leakage of intracellular components thus the intracellular protein leakage was measured as shown in fig 5b the protein leakage of yeast cells increased with plasma treatment time and antioxidants can significantly decreased protein leakage the change pattern of protein leakage among different treatments were similar with that of mda contents indicating that lipid peroxidation of cell membrane is responsible for the loss of cell membrane integrity 3 5 effects of plasma on intracellular redox homeostasis 3 5 1 intracellular ros and h2o2 the intracellular ros analyzed by the flow cytometry shown in fig 6 a the population 1 p1 represented the ros negative cells and p2 is the ros positive cells with the increasing of plasma treatment time the ros positive cells ascended gradually under normal conditions the internal ros is mostly from the leakage of electrons from the electron transport chain etc as the ros is toxic to cellular components the intracellular ros is maintained at low level by cell anti oxidative system the ascend of ros would fatally cause a cascade of harmful effects generally speaking internal ros could be generated by oxidative stress that can be triggered by many stimuli such as extreme ph osmotic stress acetic acid and heavy metals strich 2015 for example cr vi can stimulate ros formation during their re oxidation processes both via fenton like and haber weiss reactions feng et al 2017 similarly the formation of intracellular ros with visible light irradiated ag agbr may be through fenton or harber weiss reaction xia et al 2016 the nzvi pd particles reacted with oxygen and generated a great deal of ros in situ via two electron transfer lv et al 2017 different to the mental nanoparticles the extracellular ros produced by the plasma can lead to the oxidation of lipids mainly attributed to oh fig 5a affect the bilayer fluidity and cause lipid disorder even form transient opening of pores thereby altering the permeability of membrane to ros for this reason the entering of extracellular ros via damaged cell membrane contribute to the accumulation of intracellular ros and d man and l his can reduce the accumulation of intracellular ros due to the better protective effects on cell membrane besides the dcfh da was applied for the detection of ros chen et al 2010 the intracellular h2o2 was also measured shown in fig 6b similar to intracellular ros the intracellular h2o2 also ascended over the treatment time and the d man and l his can significantly alleviate the intracellular h2o2 more interestingly sod significantly enhanced the intracellular h2o2 it was reported that the specific aquaporin aqp could facilitate the passive diffusion of h2o2 across biological membranes yusupov et al 2018 bienert and chaumont 2014 yan et al 2015 thus the massive of extracellular h2o2 raised by sod can penetrate into the yeast cells not only through the transient opening of pores but also aqp in order to estimate the main factor accountable for intracellular h2o2 the individual h2o2 experiments at the same concentration of plasma liquid system were carried out the results were shown in fig s5 the protein leakage rate of individual 100 200 400 and 800 μm h2o2 were about 1 and there were little intracellular h2o2 generated indicating that only a small quantity of extracellular h2o2 can penetrate into the yeast cells with complete cell membrane conversely plasma treatment significantly increased intracellular protein leakage and intracellular h2o2 were obviously higher than that of individual h2o2 solutions at the same concentration moreover although 10 min 10min pbs 10min d man and 10min l his group had same extracellular h2o2 concentration about 400 μm but the intracellular h2o2 in these groups were different which had a similar changing trend with that of protein leakage rate these results indicate that the increase of intracellular h2o2 in the processing of plasma treatment could be mainly attributed to the damage of cell membrane integrity which permits the massive influx of extracellular h2o2 3 5 2 intracellular anti oxidative system the anti oxidative system is a range of defense mechanism that evolved by the organisms to eliminate ros before they attack to the intracellular constituents sies et al 2017 the major adaptive response is regulation of antioxidant levels including antioxidant enzymes e g superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat and or nonenzymatic antioxidants e g glutathione gsh sod can catalyze o2 to molecular oxygen o2 and h2o2 cat catalyzes the dismutation of h2o2 to water gsh as an antioxidant molecule has sulfhydryl sh group which can directly react with various ros in a non enzymatic manner winterbourn and metodiewa 1999 thus the intracellular redox homeostasis can be maintained by intracellular antioxidant system unfortunately when the intracellular ros accumulated and exceeded a certain threshold not only the toxic ros could not be eliminated ros would conversely disrupt the cellular antioxidative enzyme like sod or cat sun et al 2014 ultimately the intracellular redox homeostasis was broken down kikuchi et al 1997 as shown in fig 6c e sod and cat activity descended with the increasing of plasma treatment time the same tendency happened to the gsh concentration these indicated that plasma can destroy the intracellular redox homeostasis in a time dependent manner d man and l his can significantly alleviate the decrease of sod and cat activity as well as gsh concentration it implied that oh and 1o2 generated by plasma could destroy the intracellular anti oxidative system by generating excessive intracellular ros fig 6a what should be paid attention is the sod group there was a significant increase of intracellular h2o2 compared to 10 min plasma treatment but the variation of sod activity and gsh concentration was not obvious except a slight drop of cat activity this indicates that the contribution of h2o2 to the break of anti oxidative system is little it is generally believed that h2o2 as one kind of nonradical species performs major second messenger functions sies et al 2017 thus the massive h2o2 may act as a signaling molecule triggering a series of cascades reactions and don t play a role during short time 10 min plasma treatment for pbs group although the pbs make no influence on the attack of ros generated by plasma to cell membrane but the intracellular ros positive cells reduced from 36 66 to 28 53 and the disruption of anti oxidative system was inhibited this may be due to the reason that the external pbs can maintain intracellular ion homeostasis which may influence the damage progress of intracellular ros to anti oxidative system 3 6 effects of plasma on energy metabolism mitochondria are the central site for energy generation in eukaryotic cell mitochondrial dysfunction is a representative feature in apoptotic processes and mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation mmp is a crucial step in the signaling cascade hengartner 2000 mmp can be triggered by a variety of stimuli such as oxidative stress dna damage calcium furthermore the mmp could lead to the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential δψm and block atp synthesis and δψm dependent transports görlach et al 2015 carraro and bernardi 2016 in the processes of enhancement of mitochondrial permeability the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mptp is an important inducement and the accumulation of intracellular ros can cause the opening of mptp either by attacking mitochondrial membrane lipids or oxidizing the specific protein complexes simultaneously the ros can reinforce mitochondrial ca 2 overload and induce mptp opening by triggering endoplasmic reticulum er ca 2 release tajeddine 2016 thus the alteration of δψm caused by plasma in yeast cells was evaluated by jc 1 staining meanwhile intracellular ca 2 variation was detected by calcium specific fluorescent dye the cationic jc 1 usually exhibits red fluorescence when gathering in normal mitochondrial matrix in aggregates form nevertheless it is presented as monomers in the cytoplasm and emits green fluorescence if the depolarization of δψm occurs bernas and dobrucki 2002 thus the decrease of the ratio of red to green fluorescence denotes the mitochondrial depolarization as presented in fig 7 a plasma treatment significantly caused the depolarization of δψm which is probably due to the accumulation of intracellular ros compared with the 10 min plasma treatment d man did not vary the ratio of red to green differently the l his can reduce the mitochondrial depolarization this indicates that 1o2 may diffuse into the yeast cells and attack mitochondrial membrane consequently leading to depolarization of δψm while oh didn t have these effects the reason may be that 1o2 has relatively longer life span and better diffusion compared with oh moreover 1o2 also has high oxidation ability and could react with a wide range of biological targets including dna rna proteins lipid the rate constants between 1o2 and proteins side chains are higher than other cellular targets davies 2003 morgan et al 2004 aboubakr et al 2016 davies 2016 thus every kinds of alkali cation h exchangers maintaining δψm and the f1f0 atpase used for atp synthesis might be damaged by 1o2 orij et al 2011 the adding of sod can also relieve the depolarization of δψm due to the decrease of 1o2 in this plasma liquid system the fig 7b shows the intracellular ca 2 level the plasma treatment significantly caused the accumulation of intracellular ca 2 level after 2 5 min plasma treatment then ca 2 concentration was remarkedly decreased with the treatment time probably due to the damage of membrane integrity which lead to the leakage of intracellular ca 2 for the results of intracellular ca 2 level the change pattern among different additives was in accordance with the depolarization of δψm suggesting that 1o2 induced the accumulation of intracellular ca 2 furthermore excessive intracellular ros especially 1o2 and ca 2 induce the opening of mptp which causes the depolarization of δψm apart from this the opening of mptp have the potential to induce the release of proapoptotic factors including cytochrome c cyt c accordingly leading to activation of a caspase cascade and subsequent cell apoptosis mattson 2000 as the atp synthesis is the main function of mitochondria cellular atp were also analyzed the results were presented in fig 7c with the increasing of plasma treatment time the atp ascended firstly and then descended the 2 5 min plasma induced cellular atp raise may be due to the following reasons ca 2 could promote atp synthesis through stimulating enzymes in the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria which can increase metabolic rate and inevitably increase electron leakages from respiratory etc and ros levels görlach et al 2015 since the ros accumulated continuously either from plasma treatment or the respiratory process in mitochondria ultimately continuous plasma treatment lead to the reduce of cellular atp level compared with 10 min plasma treatment l his have the best effects in alleviating the reduction of cellular atp level this is consistent with the variation of δψm this indicated that l his effectively scavenge 1o2 which can cause the depolarization of δψm further interrupt atp synthesis differently d man could not alleviate the depolarization of δψm but inhibit the reduction of atp it is reported that when the cell was subjected to stress environments the adaptive responses can enhance the metabolic rate and increase the consumption of atp for example when the dna were damaged the nuclear repair enzyme poly adp ribose polymerase parp could be activated which could rapidly decrease atp levels clément and pervaiz 2001 from this standpoint d man alleviated the reduction of cellular atp level probably by reducing the consumption of atp rather than protecting atp synthesis 3 7 effects of plasma on phi potassium ions and cell membrane potential in the living cells nearly all of the physiological activities are ph dependent for example the regulation of organic transport as well as strict glycolysis process is affected by phi in the metabolic activities besides this ph can also influence the phosphorylation of proteins and charged residues of amino acid side chains which consequently leads to the changes of protein activity meanwhile ph also impacts the interactions of proteins with other proteins lipids and metabolites thus phi is tightly regulated by precise mechanism in cellular systems orij et al 2011 among the mechanisms the p type h atpase is the master regulator which is a membrane protein that can pump protons out of the cell besides vacuolar proton translocating atpases v atpases can pump protons from cytosol into vacuoles to help control phi but when the phi falls below a certain threshold cells will lose the automatic regulators or die lagadic gossmann et al 2004 generally the main source of protons in yeast cells are every kinds of carbonic and organic acids produced by energy metabolism and the protons are pumped out of the cytosol by the regulatory mechanism martínez muñoz and kane 2008 as shown in fig 8 a plasma treatment significantly influenced phi homeostasis in yeast cells 5 and 10 min plasma treatment obviously reduced phi but 2 5 min plasma treatment did not trigger obvious changes this suggests that the phi response to the plasma is later than other physiological changes such as lipid peroxidation fig 5a the damage of anti oxidative system fig 6a the depolarization of δψm and the raise of intracellular ca 2 fig 7a b it is reported that plasma acid can decrease phi but the mechanism is not clear as the palsma acid is an inorganic acid which is different from organic acid the proton discharged by the strong acid could not enter cell cytoplasm rode et al 2010 giannattasio et al 2013 q zhang et al 2016 reported that the ros produced by plasma damaged cell membrane integrity which led to the influx of protons into the cells apart from this it is found that oxidative stress can inactivate pma1 h atpase pma1p activity which weakens cell regulative ability to phi stadler et al 2001 simultaneously both pma1p and the v atpase use energy from atp hydrolysis to pump protons out of the cytosol thus the decrease of atp also depressed the regulative ability to phi pbs as a ph buffer can keep a neutral ph and further affect the phi l his could not keep a neutral ph but also alleviate the ros impairment on cell membrane consequently inhibiting the drop of phi it is also reported that h2o2 can lead a drop of phi pervaiz and clément 2002 hu et al 1998 lagadic gossmann et al 2004 but sod did not further decrease the phi indicating that h2o2 did not play a pivotal role in reduce phi in this plasma liquid system d man indirectly inhibited the decrease of phi through protecting the cell membrane from the damage of oh the intracellular potassium ions k leakage were also measured as shown in fig 8b the released k increased over the plasma treatment time apart from the intracellular k leakage induced by the damage of cell membrane integrity the suppression of na k atpase would also cause the k leakage similar to the h atpase orij et al 2011 as the pbs contained k pbs can effectively maintain the intracellular k homeostasis although the l his can protect the membrane and serve as ph buffer it didn t contain k to maintain the intracellular k homeostasis all ionic gradients over the membrane together constitute the membrane potential in yeast cells the h electrochemical and k electrochemical gradient are confirmed to maintain the membrane potential maresova et al 2006 cyert and philpott 2013 membrane potential δψ is crucially important in cell physiological processes especially the transmembrane transport novo et al 1999 a potential sensitive probe dioc2 3 was applied for measuring the variation of δψ in yeast cells after plasma treatment in this study red green mean fluorescence intensity ratio is positively correlated with δψ novo et al 2000 every flow cytometric diagram reflected the green and red fluorescence intensity of 10 000 detected cells in the different treatment groups as shown in fig 8c the untreated cell negative control revealed a normal membrane potential whose red green ratio was 0 976 while carbonyl cyanide 3 chlorophenylhy drazone cccp treated cell positive control with a fully depolarized membrane potential displayed a low red green ratio of 0 479 the red green ratios of 2 5 5 and 10 min plasma treated cells were 0 501 0 358 and 0 245 respectively these results indicated that the depolarization degree of cell membrane is positive correlated to plasma treatment time combining with the phi and intracellular k leakage results the changes of intracellular k and h caused the depolarization of membrane potential to be specific the physical damage such as holes on the cell membrane caused by ros or the disorder of the ion transport systems and the ion channels both of which can influence ion homeostasis further destroy membrane potential long et al 2015 compared with 10 min plasma treatment all of the antioxidants d man l his and sod alleviated the cell membrane depolarization suggesting that the elimination of ros can reduce their attack to the cell membrane and accordingly interrupt the cell membrane depolarization thus protect the physiological activities of yeast cells although pbs could not scavenge ros but it had the best alleviative effects on the cell membrane depolarization caused by plasma among these additives due to its capacity to maintain ion homeostasis in yeast cells 3 8 effects of plasma on molecular structure of yeast cell surface fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir can identify chemical bonds in a molecule by producing an infrared absorption spectrum which is utilized to analyze the effects of plasma on chemical groups of yeast cell surface fig 9 a shows the ftir spectra of yeast cells after different treatments according to the published literatures movasaghi et al 2008 yan et al 2018 ch3 asymmetric bending 1460 cm 1 ch2 symmetric stretching 2860 cm 1 and ch2 asymmetric stretching 2924 cm 1 represent the variation of methyl and methylene from the fatty acid components of the various membrane amphiphiles peaks at 1080 and 1240 cm 1 can be attributed to p o asymmetric and symmetric stretching of phosphodiester such as nucleic acids phosphorylated proteins or polyphosphate products respectively maquelin et al 2002 the peak at 1545 cm 1 amide ii is assigned to n h bending and c n stretching of proteins while the band at 1654 cm 1 amide i is associated with stretching vibrations of c o of proteins the peak at 1375 cm 1 can be assigned to symmetric stretching vibration of c o of carboxylate groups coo in proteins kartaschew et al 2016 additionally the peaks at 808 908 and 965 cm 1 are most likely corresponding to ch symmetry stretching vinyl ch2 ch and trans vinylene chch stretching vibrations nordin and ismail 2013 q zhang et al 2016 after plasma treatment compared with control group there were new peaks at 808 908 and 965 cm 1 indicating that plasma can alter the structure and chemical bonds of yeast cell surface the vinyl and trans vinylene might be due to the hydrogen abstraction reactions between the oh and lipids razzokov et al 2018 ki et al 2016 cui et al 2018 moreover eight representative ftir spectra of lipids 1460 2860 and 2924 cm 1 phosphodiester 1080 and 1240 cm 1 and proteins 1375 1545 and 1654 cm 1 were chosen for quantification according to the methods reported by lackmann et al 2018 as shown in fig 9b the ftir signals of lipids were all significantly increased with plasma treatment time and d man and l his can effectively decrease these signals compared with 10 min plasma treatment the reason may be that plasma can damage the cell wall covering on the cell membrane thus much more lipids can be exposed and detected by ftir after longer time plasma treatment while d man and l his can relieve cell wall damage by scavenging ros the signals related to proteins besides bands at 1375 cm 1 and phosphodiester both increased during the first 5 min plasma treatment then reduced when the treatment time prolonged to 10 min the reason may be that much more intracellular proteins and dna can release from cytoplasm and adhere on the cell surface due to cell membrane damage leading to the increase of peak intensity then the leaked proteins and dna on cell surface can be degraded for long time plasma treatment thus resulting in the decrease of peak intensity additionally the signal of peak at 1375 cm 1 was significantly increased with the plasma treatment time which may be attributed to the formation of new carbonyl groups like aldehydes ketones or acids through the abstraction of allylic hydrogen atoms and esterification by oh kartaschew et al 2016 d man and l his can remarkedly decrease the peak signal at 1375 cm 1 due to the effective elimination of oh 3 9 effects of plasma on dna structure lastly dna fragmentation of yeast cells after different treatments was analyzed using pi staining by flow cytometer the sub g1 ratio can indicate the cell percentage with extensive dna fragmentations delobel and tesnière 2014 aouida et al 2007 as shown in fig 10 compared with control group the ratio of sub g1 population was increased from 2 83 to 10 41 after plasma treatment indicating that plasma can cause dna fragmentation which is probably due to the oxidative damage of intracellular ros on dna similar results were also reported in our previous studies xu et al 2020 ma et al 2013 d man and l his can effectively alleviate the excessive generation of intracellular ros fig 6a thus significantly decreased sub g1 ratio 3 10 proposed mechanism of yeast inactivation in the plasma liquid interaction system base on the comprehensive analysis presented above pearson correlation analysis shows that yeast survival rate was significantly correlated with various intracellular physiological changes results were shown in table s2 the speculated inactivation mechanisms of plasma can be illustrated in fig 11 mainly including the following steps 1 he plasma produced a large amount of ros in the liquid and simultaneously led to the acidification of liquids 2 ros especially oh and 1o2 could cause lipid peroxidation of cell membrane and then formed transient pores in cell membrane followed by the damage of cell membrane integrity apart from this the ros might also attack the membrane proteins and damage the membrane transport system as the oh and 1o2 are non selective to the targets 3 intracellular ros accumulated through two pathways the main pathway is that ros produced by plasma may enter the cell by the transient pores in the cell membrane the other is that the external oxidative stress could also induce the cellular oxidative stress response increasing intracellular ros indirectly 4 intracellular ros exceeded the threshold that the anti oxidative system can balance and destroyed sod and cat activity 5 excess intracellular ros could attack the mitochondria and induce the accumulation of intracellular ca 2 consequently leading to the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced cellular atp level 6 the decreased cellular atp level and impaired h atpase resulted in the deprivation of phi regulative capacity accordingly reducing phi meanwhile the protons in the external liquid would move into the cell via destroyed cell membrane and decrease phi additionally the vacuolar type h atpases in the vacuole might be damaged by intracellular ros accordingly leading to the protons flow into the cytoplasm and reducing phi 7 the destroyed ions homeostasis including h k ca 2 caused the depolarization of cell membrane potential 8 apart from the destruction of organelles intracellular ros could also attack macromolecules such as dna causing the dna fragmentation ultimately all of these resulted in the physiological dysfunctions and cell death base on the results above pbs d man l his and sod have different functions during plasma sterilization in liquids shown in fig 12 a b d man scavenger for oh and l his scavenger both for oh and 1o2 could effectively alleviate ros damage to cell membrane accordingly reducing the intracellular ros moreover the lipid peroxidation of cell membrane in this study is mainly attributed to oh which is consistent with other report kaneko et al 2017 although the distinct kinds of intrcellular ros could not be distinguished it can be speculated that the mitochondrial membrane potential was possibly influenced by 1o2 the sod can raise h2o2 and then increase intracellular h2o2 which has negligible effects on physiological activities in this study the intracellular h2o2 is mainly derived from the influx of extracellular h2o2 via damaged cell membrane and plays a little role in yeast inactivation during 10 min plasma treatment which may due to the fact that the microbial inactivation by h2o2 generally needs a relative long time folmer et al 2008 hoeberichts et al 2010 pbs can maintain the phi and ions homeostasis accordingly keeping normal membrane potential but pbs could not alleviate ros damage to the cellular components 4 conclusions in conclusion this study unravels the comprehensive subcellular antimicrobial mechanism of plasma for water disinfection through the role of several key inactivation agents oh 1o2 o2 h2o2 and ph and complex physiological activities the results show that oh 1o2 o2 and h2o2 are generated in this plasma water system and increased in a time dependent manner o2 serves as the precursor of 1o2 and plasma treatment leads to water acidification plasma can effectively inactivate yeast cells mainly via apoptosis by damaging cell membrane cell morphology alteration and increased lipid peroxidation and membrane permeability intracellular redox homeostasis excessive generation of intracellular ros and h2o2 and decreased sod and cat activity and gsh contents energy metabolism decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular atp level as well as increased intracellular ca2 intracellular ionic equilibrium decreased phi and cell membrane potential and increased intracellular k leakage and dna structure the results of plasma with pbs d man l his and sod demonstrate that oh and 1o2 contributes most to the yeast inactivation the oh mainly attacks cell membrane and increases cell membrane permeability the disturb of cell energy metabolism is mainly attributed to 1o2 in addition the damage of cell membrane as well as extracellular low ph could break the intracellular ionic equilibrium and further reduce cell membrane potential the remarkable increase of intracellular h2o2 is mainly due to the influx of extracellular h2o2 via destroyed cell membrane which play a little role in yeast inactivation during 10 min plasma treatment this work extends the available knowledge of the antimicrobial mechanisms of plasma in an aqueous environment which will help to promote the application of cap in water disinfection additionally based on the fact that the most important antimicrobial agents oh and 1o2 produced in this plasma liquid system are short lived and have strong oxidizing property plasma could be a novel eco friendly and high efficiency waster disinfection method declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest

17426,while it seems indisputable that potable water contains microplastics mp the actual concentrations are much debated and reported numbers vary many orders of magnitude it is difficult to pinpoint the cause of these differences but it might be variation between waters variation between quantification methods and that some studies did not live up to rigorous analytical standards despite the urgent need to understand human exposure by drinking water there is a lack of trustable methods generating reliable data essentially proper mp assessment requires that quality assurance is in place and demonstrated that an adequate volume of drinking water is assessed and that differences in analytical methods are understood this study presents a systematic and robust approach where mp down to 6 6 µm were assessed in potable water distribution systems in terms of quantity size shape and material for the first time sub samples were analysed by two of the most validated and complementary analytical techniques µftir imaging and py gcms both methods successfully determined low contents in drinking water however µftir and py gcms identified different polymer types in samples with overall low mp content with increasing concentration of a given polymer type the values determined by the techniques became more comparable most detected mps were smaller than 150 µm and 32 were smaller than 20 µm our results indicate a potential annual uptake of less than one mp per person suggesting that drinking potable water produced at a high performance drinking water treatment plant represents a low risk for human health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords small microplastic microplastic mass quantification drinking water treatment plants human health 1 introduction we are living in the anthropocene with all kind of plastic materials omnipresent in our daily life the broad application of plastics in packaging technology constructions and other industries leads to a current global annual production of almost 360 million metric tons plasticseurope 2019 due to their durability most plastic types are poorly degradable but rather become brittle over time and subsequently fractionate into ever smaller pieces the resulting microplastics mps generally refer to plastic fragments 5 mm arthur et al 2009 barnes et al 2009 sub categories differentiating between large mp 5 mm 500 µm and small mp 500 1 µm are frequently used primpke et al 2020 during the past years there has been a rapidly growing concern about mps and researchers all over the globe started exploring their abundance composition and morphology in various matrixes using different visual and analytical tools such as ftir gcms or raman based methods for mp identification hence mps have been reliably assessed in natural and anthropogenic environments aquatic terrestrial and indoor and outdoor air alimi et al 2018 horton et al 2017 vianello et al 2019 but also in food and drinking water both bottled and tap water cox et al 2019 the omnipresence of plastics in all aspects of human life means that humans are inevitably exposed to mps on a daily basis it has been suggested that mps enter the human gastro intestine by the direct ingestion via e g contaminated nourishment or beverages causing a daily intake of mps by the human body investigations of human stool showed that at least partly what goes in goes out for mps bigger than 50 µm schwabl et al 2019 nonetheless the scientific community agrees that it becomes especially relevant to identify small 500 µm and very small 20 μm mps as mps smaller than 500 μm have been suggested capable of passing the gut wall lusher et al 2017 and mps smaller than 20 µm have been demonstrated to accumulate in the liver kidneys and guts of mice deng et al 2017 despite the implications for human health limited research has been carried out on mps in drinking water and previous studies focused primarily on mps in freshwater used for drinking water production rather than on the water directly consumed koelmans et al 2019 only a few studies focused on the quantification of mps in bottled water mason et al 2018 oßmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 or potable water kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 additionally the mp numbers reported in these studies vary by nearly 6 orders of magnitude from 0 001 to 470 mps l kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 additionally the authors sampled drinking water from different sources ground or surface water in various countries and used different tools for mp identification ranging from simple visual inspection to state of the art µftir and micro raman analyses kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 hence the discrepancy in findings points out the need for research on drinking water from different sources and countries but also the comparison of different methods used for mp identification as mentioned above several methods are currently used for mp qualification and quantification which makes a proper comparison of results throughout different studies challenging the majority of published studies refer to mps in terms of particle number within some size range löder et al 2017 such data is essential when assessing its environmental ecological or human health impacts but insufficient when assessing the mp concentration in a respective matrix here additionally the mass of mps must be quantified simon et al 2018 representing a significant analytical problem as the spectroscopic based methods are well suited for determination of chemical composition size and shape but less suited for quantification of mass liu et al 2019 thermoanalytical methods such as pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gcms generally require larger particle masses compared to vibrational microscopy orientated methods however such an approach enables the characterisation of plastics additives in the sample as well as the quantification of nanosized particles if an appropriate volume and an effective concentration step are considered information on small and very small mps is limited and its consequences to human health are far from being understood hence our primary focus was to strengthen the knowledge on mp quality and quantity including very small mps 20 µm in drinking water in terms of both mass and numbers a further intention was to compare the mp mass assessment of fpa µftir imaging and py gcms in real potable water matrices this combination of analytical approaches and this particular matrix is novel and it is the ambition that it leads to an increased confidence in the obtained results and the accuracy of both analytical techniques when assessing the content of small mps in drinking water starting at a swedish high performance drinking water treatment plant dwtp sampling locations were chosen along two drinking water distribution pipes of different age the concentration composition size and morphology as well as the related estimated mass of mps was determined by µftir and potential differences between pipe systems were assessed the identification of mps using µftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis enabled us to quantify and qualify mp content and mass in each sample and to compare these data with mp concentrations determined via py gcms recently koelmans et al 2019 pointed out that only four out of fifty reviewed studies on mps in fresh drinking and wastewater scored positive on defined quality criteria which were related to sampling sample treatment use of controls analytical procedure and polymer identification in order to ensure and control the quality of our data we 1 analysed sample triplicates and 2 analysed one blank per sampling location 3 aimed for representative sample size 4 followed highest standards during sampling storage and sample processing and 5 assessed the full sample volume using the two complementary reliable and state of the art polymer identification methods namely µftir and py gcms 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy the dwtp sydvatten ab produces and supplies drinking water to 900 000 inhabitants in the south of sweden skåne the dwtp uses surface water originating from the lake vombsjön for drinking water production in general drinking water production is based on artificial groundwater infiltration therefore raw water seeps slowly through the alluvium of gravel and sand to natural groundwater storage the so produced artificial groundwater is following pumped up and is initially aerated in order to remove iron and manganese and following calcium ions are removed by the addition of sodium hydroxide the resulting precipitate is removed by sedimentation next chemical cleaning with a minor dosage of ferrous chloride takes place followed by sand bed filtration finally the water is disinfected and pumped into the distribution network sydvatten 2016 sampling took place between may 13th and 16th 2019 our goal was to follow treated drinking water produced and supplied by the dwtp vombverket in order to cover variability in mp abundance of a similar source starting at vombverket we followed two supply pipelines 1 the pipe vombverket v björnstorp bjp genarp bjh which was built in 2011 but first taken into use in 2018 and 2 the pipeline vombverket v bonderup bop genarp boh which was built and used since 2000 the pipeline between vombverket björnstorp genarp measures 3 9 km the pipeline between vombverket bonderup genarp measures 5 km at both pipelines samples were taken in parallel one day each at a pumping station sample sets bjp and bop and the corresponding hydrants sample sets bjh and boh respectively at each station triplicates of drinking water samples were filtered in parallel through 5 μm stainless steel filters haver boecker ohg germany that were placed in custom modified stainless steel filter holders sterlitech corporation united states attached via stainless steel pipes figure s1 the inlet tube was attached directly to a water tap at the pipe or to a hydrant the water flow was adjusted to approximately 10 l min 1 a flowmeter zenner international gmbh co kg germany was connected to each of the outlet tubes of the stainless steel filtration units to determine the volume of filtered water of each replicate at each sampling position the complete setup was primed for ten minutes prior to applying filters between 200 and 1100 l of drinking water were filtered table s3 we aimed for 1 m3 sample size and the filtration was stopped earlier when stainless steel filters clogged which led to a significant reduction of the water flow after completion the filters were transferred to muffled glass petri dishes covered with 70 ethanol and stored frozen at 20 c until further processing 2 2 mitigating contamination when working with samples produced for human consumption or where mp concentrations are expected to be low it is of utmost importance to mitigate and control contamination therefore the equipment used in our study was muffled at 500 c or extensively rinsed with particle free water 0 7 µm filtered prior to use all solutions used were filtered before trough a 0 7 µm glass fibre filter in order to prevent airborne contamination sample preparation was carried out in a laminar flow bench labogene scanlaf fortuna clean bench denmark or in a lab equipped with a dustbox hochleitungsluftreiniger germany unit with hepa filter h14 7 5 m2 since contamination can never be completely excluded one blank sample was taken at each station figure s1 table s1 by using a cascade filtration consisting of a glass fibre gf filter of 0 7 µm pore size in front of the stainless steel filter furthermore wet sedimentation traps loaded with 500 ml of 0 7 µm fibreglass filtered milli q water in the py gcms room to qa qc any contamination source during analysis all blank samples were treated and analysed in parallel to the respective drinking water samples 2 3 extraction of microplastics in the laboratory samples were thawed and treated in sets of stations of three replicates each plus the respective blank sample under a laminar flow bench the stainless steel filters were transferred into muffled glass beakers and incubated in 5 sds for 24 h at 50 c subsequently filters were ultra sonicated for five minutes elmasonic s50r germany the filters were thoroughly flushed before being placed on a glass filtration unit sds was removed from the sample by flushing the beaker and the filtration unit intensively with particle free milli q water and 50 ethanol subsequently particles were flushed off the filters with particle free 50 ethanol back into the beaker beakers were immediately covered with aluminium foil to prevent evaporation the sample set of bjp contained high amounts of inorganic particles which were removed performing a density separation using a sodium polytungstate spt solution tc tungsten compounds gmbh germany ρ 1 8 g cm 3 in small glass separatory funnels by inflating air from the bottom and mixing the sample for 30 min after a settling time of 24 h the settled material was purged and the supernatant filtered on 5 µm stainless steel filter as described above the resulting particle ethanol suspension was transferred gradually into a 10 ml muffled glass vial and evaporated by using a gentle flow of nitrogen gas at 50 c turbovap biotage sweden the final sample volume was adjusted to 5 ml these sample suspensions were ultra sonicated elmasonic s50r germany and homogenised before being transferred onto a zinc selenide transmission window an aliquot corresponding to 20 52 of the sample or blank sample table s3 was transferred onto the transmission window using glass capillary pipettes covered and dried on a heating plate at 55 c 2 4 analysis via µftir imaging the abundance and chemical composition of the extracted mps from drinking water was determined using a focal plane array fpa based fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir imaging technique for this a cary 620 ftir microscope coupled with a cary 670 ir spectroscope agilent technologies usa was used to scan the entire area of the enriched zinc selenide transmission windows active diameter 10 mm active area 78 5 mm2 the microscope was equipped with a 25x cassegrain objective producing 3 3 µm pixel resolution on a 128 128 mercury cadmium telluride mct fpa detector all scans were carried out in transmission mode with a spectral range of 3750 850 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 resolution applying 30 co added scans in transmission mode a background tile was collected before each sample s scan using the same parameters but co adding 120 scans instead of 30 2 5 analysis via py gcms after investigation via µftir the remaining sub samples were submitted to py gcms analysis the remaining aliquots of each of the ethanol water suspended samples ranging from 48 80 of the initial volume were transferred onto a pre muffled fibreglass filter 0 7 µm pore size according to gomiero et al 2019 filters were folded on pre burnt pyrolysis cups and spiked with 10 µl of 25 tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah solution in water to derivatise the samples hence allowing also the determination of previously polar and or non volatile compound pyrolysis cups were covered with a muffled glass beaker and dried on a heating plate at 30 c overnight pyrolysis mass spectrometry analysis was performed following gomiero et al 2019 eight amongst the most commonly used plastic polymers such as polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa 6 6 polymethyl methacrylate pmma polycarbonate pc and polyethylene terphtalate pet were investigated mass based concentrations were calculated by fitting the obtained results onto calibration curves obtained by pyrolysing standard certified plastic polymers obtained from goodfellow ltd huntingdon england the limit of detection lod was calculated according to hermabessiere et al 2018 following an evaluation of the signal to noise ratios s n of the detected peaks at the lowest concentration levels in the calibration curves allowed the extrapolation to a 10 1 ratio pointing to the loq table s2 obtained results are reported as µg of polymer type l of sample 2 6 data handling statistics and downstream analysis the collected fpa µftir imaging data were analysed using the software simple primpke et al 2020 to automatically detect and quantify the particle content in each sample and blank sample as well as measuring each particle s size and estimating its volume and mass the size detection limit is defined by a combination of the filter size 5 µm and the detection limit of the µftir while the latter produced pixel sizes of 3 3 µm a manual examination of the ftir spectra showed that particles represented by only 1 pixel on the fpa sometimes were false positives when the particles comprised 2 3 pixels the identification could be trusted therefore the minimum particle size was set to three pixels resulting in a minimum nominal size of 6 6 µm i e a triangle of pixels with a length and width of 2 pixels 6 6 µm to evaluate the quality and reliability of our data we manually checked the respective spectra reference of representative mapped minimum and maximum sized mps of all detected polymer types figure s3 the total amount of mps per blank sample of each polymer type was subtracted from each sample of the respective sample set as only whole particles exist mp blank estimates have been rounded and negative values were set to zero for particle size analysis non corrected values were used assuming an elliptical mp shape the minor dimension was calculated from the major dimension as the longest linear distance perpendicular to the major axis simon et al 2018 to distinguish the mps morphologically from each other they were divided according to their dimensions into particles and fibres an adjusted definition provided by the world health organization for the determination of airborne fibres was used in which fibres are distinguished as objects with a length width ratio of 3 from particles with a ratio of 3 vianello et al 2019 in order to calculate mp mass the particle volume was estimated by assuming that particles are ellipsoids the third dimension was defined as 0 67 times the minor dimension respectively consequently the mass was estimated based on the resulting particle volume and the respective density of the polymer simon et al 2018 univariate analyses were carried out with ibm spss statistics 25 while all multivariate analyses were carried out with the primer 7 software package plus the add on package permanova primer eltd uk normality of the data was tested by a shapiro wilk normality test a non parametric anova kruskal wallis test was used at a significance level of p 0 05 to compare univariate groups for multivariate analysis mp numbers nmp and mp mass mmp were normalised by calculating their abundances per m3 in order to cope with undefined resemblances a dummy variable x 1 was added principal coordinates analysis pco was performed using bray curtis similarity on fourth root transformed data to visualise patterns in polymer type composition permanova with fixed factors and 9999 permutations at a significance level of p 0 05 was performed to test for statistically significant variance amongst the polymer composition between sampling locations and age of the two pipelines 3 results 3 1 monitoring contamination in parallel to each sample set one field blank was analysed to assess potential contamination the degree of contamination was estimated as the number of mps per blank sample and not the filtered water volume as the contamination sources were related to sampling processing and analysis we detected minimum mp contamination of 5 mps blank of the sample sets bjh and boh and maximum contamination of 155 mps blank of the sample set bop in general we observed an average contamination of 46 63 mps blank n 5 the polymeric composition of mps detected in all blanks was 67 pe 24 pa 5 pet 3 acrylic and 2 pp table s1 3 2 quantification of mps in drinking water using state of the art fpa µftir imaging 9 4 million spectra were generated per sample scan combining fpa µftir imaging with an automated particle detection produced in total 20 particle maps triplicates plus one blank at five stations respectively the presence of mps was evaluated by the pearson s correlation of each map pixel to a custom built spectral database figure s2 s3 containing more than 100 reference spectra liu et al 2019 all samples revealed the presence of mps figure s4 however after blank correction samples from the waterworks v were emended to zero fig 1 s5 the average number of mps m3 detected in the whole drinking water distribution system within the week of sampling was 174 405 mps m3 it ranged from a minimum of zero mps m3 at the waterworks samples v s1 v s3 to a maximum of 1219 mps m3 in one sample from the pumping station bjp fig 1a c table s3 generally the highest mp numbers have been detected in the sample set bjp with an average of 809 688 mps m3 fig 1a table s3 in contrast in samples from bjh bop and boh similar numbers of 20 13 19 14 22 19 mp m3 were estimated respectively fig 1a table s3 mp mass estimates reflect a completely different picture e g even though no nmp were estimated in the blank corrected samples from the waterworks v these showed positive mass estimates vice versa sample sets bjh and bop with moderate nmp estimates showed very low mmp estimates of 4 and 29 ng m3 respectively this effect is the result of higher lower mass estimates of mps in the blank sample of the respective sample set fig 1e table s3 in order to further assess mp mass concentration sub samples were analysed by py gcms enabling us to compare µftir based mass estimates and py gcms mass based determination of mmp we successfully measured very low concentrations with the two complementary techniques for mp analysis furthermore the estimated and determined mass concentrations were of the same order of magnitude throughout all drinking water samples and the highest mass concentration was estimated and determined for the same sample set bjp fig 1 table s3 s4 in order to test if the pipe age 8 vs 19 years had a significant effect on nmp and mmp a kruskal wallis test was conducted comparing samples from the two pipelines n 12 revealed no significant differences with respect to this parameter neither for nmp nor for estimated or determined mmp p 0 05 table s5 3 3 mp composition in drinking water microplastics identified in drinking water samples via µftir were assigned to eight different polymer groups fig 2a b except for sample set v nmp and mmp polymer composition of drinking water generally appeared heterogenic within and between various sample sets fig 2 s1 with reference to µftir quantification of nmp the sample sets bjp and boh were clearly dominated by polyester whereas the sample set bjh and bop showed a high proportion of polyamide pa fig 2 generally the highest abundances in single samples were recognised for pa 0 100 followed by polyester 0 100 and acrylic 0 29 figure s4 furthermore the sample boh s2 was dominated by pvc 50 and the sample bop s3 consisted of a high proportion of ps 29 the other polymers occurred in clearly lower proportions namely pe pu and pp fig 2 s1 using py gcms we reliably identified five out of the eight µftir identified polymer groups across all samples fig 2c polyethylene pu and acrylic compounds were not detected or below the detection limit the polymer composition ranged from one to maximum of three polymer groups within sample sets fig 2c sample set v and boh consisted solely of pvc and ps respectively all three sample sets bjp bjh and bop were dominated by polyester additionally samples of bjp consisted of pvc and pa samples of bjh consisted of pvc and pp and samples of bop consisted of pp comparing mmp µftir estimated and py gcms determined plastic types per m3 revealed that the abundance of most plastic types appeared rather random when mp numbers concentrations were low fig 2d e f vice versa when mp numbers increase the same increase could be observed in estimated and determined mass as e g for polyester at station bjp fig 2d e f the polymer composition of the various samples was compared using principle coordinate ordination pco to determine whether nmp or mmp sample sets were distinct from each other fig 2g h i samples of different stations were not clearly divided neither for nmp nor for µftir based or py gcms based mmp with the first two axes representing more than 70 of the total variation within the analysed samples in all three cases fig 2g h i however permanova revealed that there were significant differences between stations in all three cases p 0 05 table s6 a separate test of dispersion using permdisp revealed that these differences amongst sample sets were not driven by within system heterogeneities table s6 since sample replication n 3 did not allow to obtain a significant result on the level p 0 05 pairwise tests between stations were not carried out comparing samples taken at the two different pipe systems revealed no significant differences with respect to pipe age 8 vs 19 years neither for nmp nor for mmp p 0 05 table s6 3 4 size and shape of mps in drinking water to characterise size and shape of detected mps major and minor dimensions were evaluated considering both major and minor dimension we found that 32 of all mps detected were 20 µm fig 3 according to the threshold used for fibre classification length width ratio of 3 46 out of 238 19 of all detected mps were fibres hence the remaining 81 were defined as particles fig 3b the identified fibres composition was dominated by polyester 87 followed by pe 9 and a single pp fibre the biggest mp was detected in a sample of boh with 374 µm in major and 76 µm in minor dimension and consisted of polyester pet the smallest mp detected had a major dimension of 8 µm and minor dimension of 5 2 µm and was assigned to a polyester particle pet in sample bjp s1 fig 3a figure s3 a shapiro wilk test revealed that neither major nor minor dimension of the overall detected mps were normal distributed p 0 05 hence we used median values d50 to describe our data table s7 overall the size distribution of all identified mps fig 4 had d50s of 26 µm and 13 µm for the major and minor dimension respectively table s7 table s7 comprises the d10 d50 and d90 values for individual sampling sites considering only particles major dimension the size of mps detected ranged between 8 and 374 µm fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 mps in drinking water quantity and quality the primary goal of our study was to strengthen the knowledge on mp quality and quantity including very small mps 20 µm in drinking water through the combination of representative sample size quality control and assurance together with state of the art µftir imaging and py gcms mps could be qualified and quantified in all analysed drinking water of the investigated distribution system average mps concentrations were generally low between zero and 0 022 0 019 mps l except one pumping station which had considerably higher mps numbers 0 809 0 688 mps l hence our results are within the range of mp numbers reported by other studies kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 comparable to our study mintenig et al 2019 reported low mp numbers in drinking water 0 001 mps l using a µftir approach this aspect contrasts with the studies by pivokonsky et al 2018 kosuth et al 2018 and shruti et al 2020 which reported substantially higher mp numbers 6 18 and 470 mps l respectively it is important to note that these three studies only analysed small sample volumes 0 5 1 l and used either a visual staining based approach or micro raman spectroscopy making a comparison with our data hardly possible for mps identification via μftir imaging has proven efficient bergmann et al 2019 liu et al 2019 mintenig et al 2019 simon et al 2018 this technique allows scanning of large areas of filters or windows for the presence of mp and has been successfully applied down to 10 μm mp particles in the present study we further decreased this size limit by applying a 25x cassegrain objective producing 3 3 µm pixel resolution which allowed us to determine particles down to 6 6 µm this imaging technique also allows the automatisation of mp identification and has been proven as a reliable tool for mp analysis primpke et al 2020 2019 while single point ftir or raman spectroscopy for the larger particles and μftir or µraman imaging spectroscopy for the smaller particles allow high quality microplastic quantification the techniques are time consuming and require advanced analytical equipment pyrolysis gc ms hendrickson et al 2018 gomiero et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 and thermal desorption gc ms dümichen et al 2015 2019 is also an option for determining the polymer composition of the particles which has received increased attention for screening purposes where estimates suffice simple techniques such as chemical staining have been suggested and applied to some matrices shim et al 2016 maes et al 2017 however there still are many unanswered questions here amongst which plastic types this approach can target how applicable the approach is on complex matrixes and whether or not it is faster than the ftir based techniques microplastics can enter freshwater environments in various ways they can originate from degraded plastic waste industrial effluents surface run off and wastewater effluents but also from sewer overflows and atmospheric deposition horton et al 2017 müller et al 2020 in this context drinking water treatment processes are essential to ensure adequate water quality but they are not completely efficient in removing mps as mp removal ranges between 70 and 82 pivokonsky et al 2018 beside incomplete removal during water purification the deterioration of plastic equipment used during water purification or distribution is likely a source for mps in drinking water as pipes in dwtps are frequently made of pvc pp and pe mintenig et al 2019 in the present study surface water served as source for drinking water production since the raw water was not investigated we cannot evaluate the mp removal efficiency of the dwtp nevertheless since mps are generally in lower concentrations than in raw waters pivokonsky et al 2018 the low mp concentrations we found at the high performance dwtp and most of the following distribution system point towards a successful mp removal during drinking water treatment further investigations are needed in order to assess how mps concentrations in potable water can be influenced by pre treatment methods in dwp and the corresponding economic levels in particular raw water sources here we also assessed the potential differences in mp loads between two distribution pipes of different age 8 vs 19 years the investigated distribution pipes mainly consist of cement stainless steel cast iron and pe considering the low numbers of pe detected in the samples it can be concluded that ten years age difference had no significant impact on the mp loads in the distribution system this finding is supported due to the fact that water is generally not reactive with pe and that 50 to 100 year service of pe potable water pipes used for pressurised cold and or hot water were projected whelton et al 2009 however the investigated sampling locations differed significantly in their polymer composition in total we identified eight different polymer types including pa polyester acrylic pvc ps pe pu and pp in drinking water throughout all samples previously analysed drinking water samples mainly contained polyester pvc pe pa and pp particles kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 shruti et al 2020 in the present study polyester mp numbers were significantly higher at one pumping station bjp in contrast mintenig et al 2019 reported no differences in mp numbers or composition at different stages of the distribution system waterworks vs household generally airborne contamination is a likely source for polyester however given the low numbers of polyester in the blank samples contamination of our samples with polyester during sampling or processing is unlikely the high polyester loads were determined in the lowest sample volume which resulted from filter clogging by fine particulate matter neither at the dwtp before the distribution system nor at the respective hydrant such high mp abundances were recognised hence our findings suggest a short term weakness damage in the pipeline at the time of sampling presumably due to construction work or the like 4 2 mps in drinking water numbers matter but mass matters too the few existing studies that quantified mps in drinking water report numbers that vary by several orders of magnitude kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 this discrepancy indicates high variability of mp loads in drinking waters from different sources and countries however the studies are also hardly comparable due to different sampling mp extraction and identification methods where mp identification represents one of the crucial pitfalls käppler et al 2018 furthermore mp numbers are commonly reported within size classes löder et al 2017 impeding the assessment of the real mp concentration and making it impossible to compare the data to analytical techniques quantifying the polymer mass previous work has demonstrated that both atr ftir and py gcms successfully differentiate between plastic and non plastic hendrickson et al 2018 käppler et al 2018 with identification of 85 as the same polymer type käppler et al 2018 for the first time we analysed sub samples via µftir imaging and py gcms in order to compare mp concentrations ftir based mass estimates and directly determined mass concentrations we successfully determined very low mp loads in drinking water applying two µftir and py gcms and obtaining comparable concentrations with the two complementary techniques however µftir and py gcms identified different polymer types in samples with overall low mp concentrations as i e pe was detected by µftir but not by py gcms conversely with increasing mp load of a given polymer type the concentrations measured with both techniques became more comparable as was the case for polyester underrepresentation of specific plastic types due to concentrations below the respective polymer detection limit of py gcms is the most likely explanation for the differences in polymer composition observed between the different methods 4 3 mps in drinking water implications for human health using µftir imaging followed by an automated image analysis enabled us to identify the size and shape of mps down to 6 6 μm since accessible clean drinking water is one of the sustainable development goals of the united nations who 2017 it is of utmost importance to reliably investigate mps and to determine numbers concentration and size in order to understand and evaluate the potential risks related to human health considering that the annual estimated mp consumption ranges from 39 000 to 52 000 particles or 74 000 and 121 000 when inhalation is taken into account cox et al 2019 the generally low mp numbers of 0 174 mps l we found in the present study suggest that the consumption of drinking water processed by a high performance drinking water treatment plant does not particularly add to potential risks to human health however the issue of mps in products designated for human consumption received increasing attention in the last years due to the discovery of small mps translocating to inner organs deng et al 2017 in the present study mp abundance increased with decreasing size until 20 40 µm before decreasing to the smallest detectable size 10 µm the latter aspect is a consequence of the low spectra quality s n ratio when size decreases below 10 µm resulting in fewer particles positively identified as a specific polymer and or nonsysthetic particle pivokonsky et al 2018 found mps were the most abundant in the smallest detectable size class 1 10 μm accounting for up to 95 of the total numbers also shruti et al 2020 reported an increase in mps with decreasing size with 50 of mps 500 µm unfortunately the different methodologies applied in the previous study makes the comparison hardly feasible the fact that we exclusively detected mps between 8 and 374 µm and that 32 of all detected mps were smaller than 20 µm may raise concern for human health investigations of mps in fish and invertebrates suggest that mps smaller than 500 μm might pass the gut wall lusher et al 2017 and mps smaller than 20 µm can accumulate in liver kidney and gut of mice deng et al 2017 however the european food safety authority efsa classified the absorption of mps larger than 150 µm as unlikely and the absorption and uptake of mps smaller than 20 µm in total up to 0 3 for mps 150 µm into organs as overall limited efsa 2016 in order to put our results in perspective approximately 97 of the mps we detected were smaller than 150 µm in major dimension and mp numbers were on average 0 174 mps l considering a scenario with mp absorption of 0 3 and daily consumption of three litres potable water per day the annual uptake would be of less than one mp particle per person through drinking potable water hence to support a more robust human health risk assessment of mps future efforts need to be done to understand better the occurrence of plastic particles in potable water their levels as number of particles and total masses polymer type composition size and shape the latter features are of crucial importance for toxicologists to define exposure routes and tailor natural like exposure scenario to investigate realistic biological effects and define toxicity thresholds 5 conclusion this study represents a systematic and robust approach investigating mp quality quantity shape and size including very small mps 20 µm in drinking water as such it is an important step forward in understanding mp distribution and the potential implications for human health most detected mps were smaller than 150 µm and 32 were smaller than 20 µm which could potentially pose a risk to human health however our results showed very low mp loads in drinking water processed in a high performance drinking water treatment plant suggesting a low risk to human health for the first time we investigated mp loads in drinking water using two complementary techniques

17426,while it seems indisputable that potable water contains microplastics mp the actual concentrations are much debated and reported numbers vary many orders of magnitude it is difficult to pinpoint the cause of these differences but it might be variation between waters variation between quantification methods and that some studies did not live up to rigorous analytical standards despite the urgent need to understand human exposure by drinking water there is a lack of trustable methods generating reliable data essentially proper mp assessment requires that quality assurance is in place and demonstrated that an adequate volume of drinking water is assessed and that differences in analytical methods are understood this study presents a systematic and robust approach where mp down to 6 6 µm were assessed in potable water distribution systems in terms of quantity size shape and material for the first time sub samples were analysed by two of the most validated and complementary analytical techniques µftir imaging and py gcms both methods successfully determined low contents in drinking water however µftir and py gcms identified different polymer types in samples with overall low mp content with increasing concentration of a given polymer type the values determined by the techniques became more comparable most detected mps were smaller than 150 µm and 32 were smaller than 20 µm our results indicate a potential annual uptake of less than one mp per person suggesting that drinking potable water produced at a high performance drinking water treatment plant represents a low risk for human health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords small microplastic microplastic mass quantification drinking water treatment plants human health 1 introduction we are living in the anthropocene with all kind of plastic materials omnipresent in our daily life the broad application of plastics in packaging technology constructions and other industries leads to a current global annual production of almost 360 million metric tons plasticseurope 2019 due to their durability most plastic types are poorly degradable but rather become brittle over time and subsequently fractionate into ever smaller pieces the resulting microplastics mps generally refer to plastic fragments 5 mm arthur et al 2009 barnes et al 2009 sub categories differentiating between large mp 5 mm 500 µm and small mp 500 1 µm are frequently used primpke et al 2020 during the past years there has been a rapidly growing concern about mps and researchers all over the globe started exploring their abundance composition and morphology in various matrixes using different visual and analytical tools such as ftir gcms or raman based methods for mp identification hence mps have been reliably assessed in natural and anthropogenic environments aquatic terrestrial and indoor and outdoor air alimi et al 2018 horton et al 2017 vianello et al 2019 but also in food and drinking water both bottled and tap water cox et al 2019 the omnipresence of plastics in all aspects of human life means that humans are inevitably exposed to mps on a daily basis it has been suggested that mps enter the human gastro intestine by the direct ingestion via e g contaminated nourishment or beverages causing a daily intake of mps by the human body investigations of human stool showed that at least partly what goes in goes out for mps bigger than 50 µm schwabl et al 2019 nonetheless the scientific community agrees that it becomes especially relevant to identify small 500 µm and very small 20 μm mps as mps smaller than 500 μm have been suggested capable of passing the gut wall lusher et al 2017 and mps smaller than 20 µm have been demonstrated to accumulate in the liver kidneys and guts of mice deng et al 2017 despite the implications for human health limited research has been carried out on mps in drinking water and previous studies focused primarily on mps in freshwater used for drinking water production rather than on the water directly consumed koelmans et al 2019 only a few studies focused on the quantification of mps in bottled water mason et al 2018 oßmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 or potable water kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 additionally the mp numbers reported in these studies vary by nearly 6 orders of magnitude from 0 001 to 470 mps l kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 additionally the authors sampled drinking water from different sources ground or surface water in various countries and used different tools for mp identification ranging from simple visual inspection to state of the art µftir and micro raman analyses kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 hence the discrepancy in findings points out the need for research on drinking water from different sources and countries but also the comparison of different methods used for mp identification as mentioned above several methods are currently used for mp qualification and quantification which makes a proper comparison of results throughout different studies challenging the majority of published studies refer to mps in terms of particle number within some size range löder et al 2017 such data is essential when assessing its environmental ecological or human health impacts but insufficient when assessing the mp concentration in a respective matrix here additionally the mass of mps must be quantified simon et al 2018 representing a significant analytical problem as the spectroscopic based methods are well suited for determination of chemical composition size and shape but less suited for quantification of mass liu et al 2019 thermoanalytical methods such as pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gcms generally require larger particle masses compared to vibrational microscopy orientated methods however such an approach enables the characterisation of plastics additives in the sample as well as the quantification of nanosized particles if an appropriate volume and an effective concentration step are considered information on small and very small mps is limited and its consequences to human health are far from being understood hence our primary focus was to strengthen the knowledge on mp quality and quantity including very small mps 20 µm in drinking water in terms of both mass and numbers a further intention was to compare the mp mass assessment of fpa µftir imaging and py gcms in real potable water matrices this combination of analytical approaches and this particular matrix is novel and it is the ambition that it leads to an increased confidence in the obtained results and the accuracy of both analytical techniques when assessing the content of small mps in drinking water starting at a swedish high performance drinking water treatment plant dwtp sampling locations were chosen along two drinking water distribution pipes of different age the concentration composition size and morphology as well as the related estimated mass of mps was determined by µftir and potential differences between pipe systems were assessed the identification of mps using µftir microscopy followed by an automated image analysis enabled us to quantify and qualify mp content and mass in each sample and to compare these data with mp concentrations determined via py gcms recently koelmans et al 2019 pointed out that only four out of fifty reviewed studies on mps in fresh drinking and wastewater scored positive on defined quality criteria which were related to sampling sample treatment use of controls analytical procedure and polymer identification in order to ensure and control the quality of our data we 1 analysed sample triplicates and 2 analysed one blank per sampling location 3 aimed for representative sample size 4 followed highest standards during sampling storage and sample processing and 5 assessed the full sample volume using the two complementary reliable and state of the art polymer identification methods namely µftir and py gcms 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy the dwtp sydvatten ab produces and supplies drinking water to 900 000 inhabitants in the south of sweden skåne the dwtp uses surface water originating from the lake vombsjön for drinking water production in general drinking water production is based on artificial groundwater infiltration therefore raw water seeps slowly through the alluvium of gravel and sand to natural groundwater storage the so produced artificial groundwater is following pumped up and is initially aerated in order to remove iron and manganese and following calcium ions are removed by the addition of sodium hydroxide the resulting precipitate is removed by sedimentation next chemical cleaning with a minor dosage of ferrous chloride takes place followed by sand bed filtration finally the water is disinfected and pumped into the distribution network sydvatten 2016 sampling took place between may 13th and 16th 2019 our goal was to follow treated drinking water produced and supplied by the dwtp vombverket in order to cover variability in mp abundance of a similar source starting at vombverket we followed two supply pipelines 1 the pipe vombverket v björnstorp bjp genarp bjh which was built in 2011 but first taken into use in 2018 and 2 the pipeline vombverket v bonderup bop genarp boh which was built and used since 2000 the pipeline between vombverket björnstorp genarp measures 3 9 km the pipeline between vombverket bonderup genarp measures 5 km at both pipelines samples were taken in parallel one day each at a pumping station sample sets bjp and bop and the corresponding hydrants sample sets bjh and boh respectively at each station triplicates of drinking water samples were filtered in parallel through 5 μm stainless steel filters haver boecker ohg germany that were placed in custom modified stainless steel filter holders sterlitech corporation united states attached via stainless steel pipes figure s1 the inlet tube was attached directly to a water tap at the pipe or to a hydrant the water flow was adjusted to approximately 10 l min 1 a flowmeter zenner international gmbh co kg germany was connected to each of the outlet tubes of the stainless steel filtration units to determine the volume of filtered water of each replicate at each sampling position the complete setup was primed for ten minutes prior to applying filters between 200 and 1100 l of drinking water were filtered table s3 we aimed for 1 m3 sample size and the filtration was stopped earlier when stainless steel filters clogged which led to a significant reduction of the water flow after completion the filters were transferred to muffled glass petri dishes covered with 70 ethanol and stored frozen at 20 c until further processing 2 2 mitigating contamination when working with samples produced for human consumption or where mp concentrations are expected to be low it is of utmost importance to mitigate and control contamination therefore the equipment used in our study was muffled at 500 c or extensively rinsed with particle free water 0 7 µm filtered prior to use all solutions used were filtered before trough a 0 7 µm glass fibre filter in order to prevent airborne contamination sample preparation was carried out in a laminar flow bench labogene scanlaf fortuna clean bench denmark or in a lab equipped with a dustbox hochleitungsluftreiniger germany unit with hepa filter h14 7 5 m2 since contamination can never be completely excluded one blank sample was taken at each station figure s1 table s1 by using a cascade filtration consisting of a glass fibre gf filter of 0 7 µm pore size in front of the stainless steel filter furthermore wet sedimentation traps loaded with 500 ml of 0 7 µm fibreglass filtered milli q water in the py gcms room to qa qc any contamination source during analysis all blank samples were treated and analysed in parallel to the respective drinking water samples 2 3 extraction of microplastics in the laboratory samples were thawed and treated in sets of stations of three replicates each plus the respective blank sample under a laminar flow bench the stainless steel filters were transferred into muffled glass beakers and incubated in 5 sds for 24 h at 50 c subsequently filters were ultra sonicated for five minutes elmasonic s50r germany the filters were thoroughly flushed before being placed on a glass filtration unit sds was removed from the sample by flushing the beaker and the filtration unit intensively with particle free milli q water and 50 ethanol subsequently particles were flushed off the filters with particle free 50 ethanol back into the beaker beakers were immediately covered with aluminium foil to prevent evaporation the sample set of bjp contained high amounts of inorganic particles which were removed performing a density separation using a sodium polytungstate spt solution tc tungsten compounds gmbh germany ρ 1 8 g cm 3 in small glass separatory funnels by inflating air from the bottom and mixing the sample for 30 min after a settling time of 24 h the settled material was purged and the supernatant filtered on 5 µm stainless steel filter as described above the resulting particle ethanol suspension was transferred gradually into a 10 ml muffled glass vial and evaporated by using a gentle flow of nitrogen gas at 50 c turbovap biotage sweden the final sample volume was adjusted to 5 ml these sample suspensions were ultra sonicated elmasonic s50r germany and homogenised before being transferred onto a zinc selenide transmission window an aliquot corresponding to 20 52 of the sample or blank sample table s3 was transferred onto the transmission window using glass capillary pipettes covered and dried on a heating plate at 55 c 2 4 analysis via µftir imaging the abundance and chemical composition of the extracted mps from drinking water was determined using a focal plane array fpa based fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir imaging technique for this a cary 620 ftir microscope coupled with a cary 670 ir spectroscope agilent technologies usa was used to scan the entire area of the enriched zinc selenide transmission windows active diameter 10 mm active area 78 5 mm2 the microscope was equipped with a 25x cassegrain objective producing 3 3 µm pixel resolution on a 128 128 mercury cadmium telluride mct fpa detector all scans were carried out in transmission mode with a spectral range of 3750 850 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 resolution applying 30 co added scans in transmission mode a background tile was collected before each sample s scan using the same parameters but co adding 120 scans instead of 30 2 5 analysis via py gcms after investigation via µftir the remaining sub samples were submitted to py gcms analysis the remaining aliquots of each of the ethanol water suspended samples ranging from 48 80 of the initial volume were transferred onto a pre muffled fibreglass filter 0 7 µm pore size according to gomiero et al 2019 filters were folded on pre burnt pyrolysis cups and spiked with 10 µl of 25 tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah solution in water to derivatise the samples hence allowing also the determination of previously polar and or non volatile compound pyrolysis cups were covered with a muffled glass beaker and dried on a heating plate at 30 c overnight pyrolysis mass spectrometry analysis was performed following gomiero et al 2019 eight amongst the most commonly used plastic polymers such as polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyamide pa 6 6 polymethyl methacrylate pmma polycarbonate pc and polyethylene terphtalate pet were investigated mass based concentrations were calculated by fitting the obtained results onto calibration curves obtained by pyrolysing standard certified plastic polymers obtained from goodfellow ltd huntingdon england the limit of detection lod was calculated according to hermabessiere et al 2018 following an evaluation of the signal to noise ratios s n of the detected peaks at the lowest concentration levels in the calibration curves allowed the extrapolation to a 10 1 ratio pointing to the loq table s2 obtained results are reported as µg of polymer type l of sample 2 6 data handling statistics and downstream analysis the collected fpa µftir imaging data were analysed using the software simple primpke et al 2020 to automatically detect and quantify the particle content in each sample and blank sample as well as measuring each particle s size and estimating its volume and mass the size detection limit is defined by a combination of the filter size 5 µm and the detection limit of the µftir while the latter produced pixel sizes of 3 3 µm a manual examination of the ftir spectra showed that particles represented by only 1 pixel on the fpa sometimes were false positives when the particles comprised 2 3 pixels the identification could be trusted therefore the minimum particle size was set to three pixels resulting in a minimum nominal size of 6 6 µm i e a triangle of pixels with a length and width of 2 pixels 6 6 µm to evaluate the quality and reliability of our data we manually checked the respective spectra reference of representative mapped minimum and maximum sized mps of all detected polymer types figure s3 the total amount of mps per blank sample of each polymer type was subtracted from each sample of the respective sample set as only whole particles exist mp blank estimates have been rounded and negative values were set to zero for particle size analysis non corrected values were used assuming an elliptical mp shape the minor dimension was calculated from the major dimension as the longest linear distance perpendicular to the major axis simon et al 2018 to distinguish the mps morphologically from each other they were divided according to their dimensions into particles and fibres an adjusted definition provided by the world health organization for the determination of airborne fibres was used in which fibres are distinguished as objects with a length width ratio of 3 from particles with a ratio of 3 vianello et al 2019 in order to calculate mp mass the particle volume was estimated by assuming that particles are ellipsoids the third dimension was defined as 0 67 times the minor dimension respectively consequently the mass was estimated based on the resulting particle volume and the respective density of the polymer simon et al 2018 univariate analyses were carried out with ibm spss statistics 25 while all multivariate analyses were carried out with the primer 7 software package plus the add on package permanova primer eltd uk normality of the data was tested by a shapiro wilk normality test a non parametric anova kruskal wallis test was used at a significance level of p 0 05 to compare univariate groups for multivariate analysis mp numbers nmp and mp mass mmp were normalised by calculating their abundances per m3 in order to cope with undefined resemblances a dummy variable x 1 was added principal coordinates analysis pco was performed using bray curtis similarity on fourth root transformed data to visualise patterns in polymer type composition permanova with fixed factors and 9999 permutations at a significance level of p 0 05 was performed to test for statistically significant variance amongst the polymer composition between sampling locations and age of the two pipelines 3 results 3 1 monitoring contamination in parallel to each sample set one field blank was analysed to assess potential contamination the degree of contamination was estimated as the number of mps per blank sample and not the filtered water volume as the contamination sources were related to sampling processing and analysis we detected minimum mp contamination of 5 mps blank of the sample sets bjh and boh and maximum contamination of 155 mps blank of the sample set bop in general we observed an average contamination of 46 63 mps blank n 5 the polymeric composition of mps detected in all blanks was 67 pe 24 pa 5 pet 3 acrylic and 2 pp table s1 3 2 quantification of mps in drinking water using state of the art fpa µftir imaging 9 4 million spectra were generated per sample scan combining fpa µftir imaging with an automated particle detection produced in total 20 particle maps triplicates plus one blank at five stations respectively the presence of mps was evaluated by the pearson s correlation of each map pixel to a custom built spectral database figure s2 s3 containing more than 100 reference spectra liu et al 2019 all samples revealed the presence of mps figure s4 however after blank correction samples from the waterworks v were emended to zero fig 1 s5 the average number of mps m3 detected in the whole drinking water distribution system within the week of sampling was 174 405 mps m3 it ranged from a minimum of zero mps m3 at the waterworks samples v s1 v s3 to a maximum of 1219 mps m3 in one sample from the pumping station bjp fig 1a c table s3 generally the highest mp numbers have been detected in the sample set bjp with an average of 809 688 mps m3 fig 1a table s3 in contrast in samples from bjh bop and boh similar numbers of 20 13 19 14 22 19 mp m3 were estimated respectively fig 1a table s3 mp mass estimates reflect a completely different picture e g even though no nmp were estimated in the blank corrected samples from the waterworks v these showed positive mass estimates vice versa sample sets bjh and bop with moderate nmp estimates showed very low mmp estimates of 4 and 29 ng m3 respectively this effect is the result of higher lower mass estimates of mps in the blank sample of the respective sample set fig 1e table s3 in order to further assess mp mass concentration sub samples were analysed by py gcms enabling us to compare µftir based mass estimates and py gcms mass based determination of mmp we successfully measured very low concentrations with the two complementary techniques for mp analysis furthermore the estimated and determined mass concentrations were of the same order of magnitude throughout all drinking water samples and the highest mass concentration was estimated and determined for the same sample set bjp fig 1 table s3 s4 in order to test if the pipe age 8 vs 19 years had a significant effect on nmp and mmp a kruskal wallis test was conducted comparing samples from the two pipelines n 12 revealed no significant differences with respect to this parameter neither for nmp nor for estimated or determined mmp p 0 05 table s5 3 3 mp composition in drinking water microplastics identified in drinking water samples via µftir were assigned to eight different polymer groups fig 2a b except for sample set v nmp and mmp polymer composition of drinking water generally appeared heterogenic within and between various sample sets fig 2 s1 with reference to µftir quantification of nmp the sample sets bjp and boh were clearly dominated by polyester whereas the sample set bjh and bop showed a high proportion of polyamide pa fig 2 generally the highest abundances in single samples were recognised for pa 0 100 followed by polyester 0 100 and acrylic 0 29 figure s4 furthermore the sample boh s2 was dominated by pvc 50 and the sample bop s3 consisted of a high proportion of ps 29 the other polymers occurred in clearly lower proportions namely pe pu and pp fig 2 s1 using py gcms we reliably identified five out of the eight µftir identified polymer groups across all samples fig 2c polyethylene pu and acrylic compounds were not detected or below the detection limit the polymer composition ranged from one to maximum of three polymer groups within sample sets fig 2c sample set v and boh consisted solely of pvc and ps respectively all three sample sets bjp bjh and bop were dominated by polyester additionally samples of bjp consisted of pvc and pa samples of bjh consisted of pvc and pp and samples of bop consisted of pp comparing mmp µftir estimated and py gcms determined plastic types per m3 revealed that the abundance of most plastic types appeared rather random when mp numbers concentrations were low fig 2d e f vice versa when mp numbers increase the same increase could be observed in estimated and determined mass as e g for polyester at station bjp fig 2d e f the polymer composition of the various samples was compared using principle coordinate ordination pco to determine whether nmp or mmp sample sets were distinct from each other fig 2g h i samples of different stations were not clearly divided neither for nmp nor for µftir based or py gcms based mmp with the first two axes representing more than 70 of the total variation within the analysed samples in all three cases fig 2g h i however permanova revealed that there were significant differences between stations in all three cases p 0 05 table s6 a separate test of dispersion using permdisp revealed that these differences amongst sample sets were not driven by within system heterogeneities table s6 since sample replication n 3 did not allow to obtain a significant result on the level p 0 05 pairwise tests between stations were not carried out comparing samples taken at the two different pipe systems revealed no significant differences with respect to pipe age 8 vs 19 years neither for nmp nor for mmp p 0 05 table s6 3 4 size and shape of mps in drinking water to characterise size and shape of detected mps major and minor dimensions were evaluated considering both major and minor dimension we found that 32 of all mps detected were 20 µm fig 3 according to the threshold used for fibre classification length width ratio of 3 46 out of 238 19 of all detected mps were fibres hence the remaining 81 were defined as particles fig 3b the identified fibres composition was dominated by polyester 87 followed by pe 9 and a single pp fibre the biggest mp was detected in a sample of boh with 374 µm in major and 76 µm in minor dimension and consisted of polyester pet the smallest mp detected had a major dimension of 8 µm and minor dimension of 5 2 µm and was assigned to a polyester particle pet in sample bjp s1 fig 3a figure s3 a shapiro wilk test revealed that neither major nor minor dimension of the overall detected mps were normal distributed p 0 05 hence we used median values d50 to describe our data table s7 overall the size distribution of all identified mps fig 4 had d50s of 26 µm and 13 µm for the major and minor dimension respectively table s7 table s7 comprises the d10 d50 and d90 values for individual sampling sites considering only particles major dimension the size of mps detected ranged between 8 and 374 µm fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 mps in drinking water quantity and quality the primary goal of our study was to strengthen the knowledge on mp quality and quantity including very small mps 20 µm in drinking water through the combination of representative sample size quality control and assurance together with state of the art µftir imaging and py gcms mps could be qualified and quantified in all analysed drinking water of the investigated distribution system average mps concentrations were generally low between zero and 0 022 0 019 mps l except one pumping station which had considerably higher mps numbers 0 809 0 688 mps l hence our results are within the range of mp numbers reported by other studies kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 comparable to our study mintenig et al 2019 reported low mp numbers in drinking water 0 001 mps l using a µftir approach this aspect contrasts with the studies by pivokonsky et al 2018 kosuth et al 2018 and shruti et al 2020 which reported substantially higher mp numbers 6 18 and 470 mps l respectively it is important to note that these three studies only analysed small sample volumes 0 5 1 l and used either a visual staining based approach or micro raman spectroscopy making a comparison with our data hardly possible for mps identification via μftir imaging has proven efficient bergmann et al 2019 liu et al 2019 mintenig et al 2019 simon et al 2018 this technique allows scanning of large areas of filters or windows for the presence of mp and has been successfully applied down to 10 μm mp particles in the present study we further decreased this size limit by applying a 25x cassegrain objective producing 3 3 µm pixel resolution which allowed us to determine particles down to 6 6 µm this imaging technique also allows the automatisation of mp identification and has been proven as a reliable tool for mp analysis primpke et al 2020 2019 while single point ftir or raman spectroscopy for the larger particles and μftir or µraman imaging spectroscopy for the smaller particles allow high quality microplastic quantification the techniques are time consuming and require advanced analytical equipment pyrolysis gc ms hendrickson et al 2018 gomiero et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 and thermal desorption gc ms dümichen et al 2015 2019 is also an option for determining the polymer composition of the particles which has received increased attention for screening purposes where estimates suffice simple techniques such as chemical staining have been suggested and applied to some matrices shim et al 2016 maes et al 2017 however there still are many unanswered questions here amongst which plastic types this approach can target how applicable the approach is on complex matrixes and whether or not it is faster than the ftir based techniques microplastics can enter freshwater environments in various ways they can originate from degraded plastic waste industrial effluents surface run off and wastewater effluents but also from sewer overflows and atmospheric deposition horton et al 2017 müller et al 2020 in this context drinking water treatment processes are essential to ensure adequate water quality but they are not completely efficient in removing mps as mp removal ranges between 70 and 82 pivokonsky et al 2018 beside incomplete removal during water purification the deterioration of plastic equipment used during water purification or distribution is likely a source for mps in drinking water as pipes in dwtps are frequently made of pvc pp and pe mintenig et al 2019 in the present study surface water served as source for drinking water production since the raw water was not investigated we cannot evaluate the mp removal efficiency of the dwtp nevertheless since mps are generally in lower concentrations than in raw waters pivokonsky et al 2018 the low mp concentrations we found at the high performance dwtp and most of the following distribution system point towards a successful mp removal during drinking water treatment further investigations are needed in order to assess how mps concentrations in potable water can be influenced by pre treatment methods in dwp and the corresponding economic levels in particular raw water sources here we also assessed the potential differences in mp loads between two distribution pipes of different age 8 vs 19 years the investigated distribution pipes mainly consist of cement stainless steel cast iron and pe considering the low numbers of pe detected in the samples it can be concluded that ten years age difference had no significant impact on the mp loads in the distribution system this finding is supported due to the fact that water is generally not reactive with pe and that 50 to 100 year service of pe potable water pipes used for pressurised cold and or hot water were projected whelton et al 2009 however the investigated sampling locations differed significantly in their polymer composition in total we identified eight different polymer types including pa polyester acrylic pvc ps pe pu and pp in drinking water throughout all samples previously analysed drinking water samples mainly contained polyester pvc pe pa and pp particles kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 shruti et al 2020 in the present study polyester mp numbers were significantly higher at one pumping station bjp in contrast mintenig et al 2019 reported no differences in mp numbers or composition at different stages of the distribution system waterworks vs household generally airborne contamination is a likely source for polyester however given the low numbers of polyester in the blank samples contamination of our samples with polyester during sampling or processing is unlikely the high polyester loads were determined in the lowest sample volume which resulted from filter clogging by fine particulate matter neither at the dwtp before the distribution system nor at the respective hydrant such high mp abundances were recognised hence our findings suggest a short term weakness damage in the pipeline at the time of sampling presumably due to construction work or the like 4 2 mps in drinking water numbers matter but mass matters too the few existing studies that quantified mps in drinking water report numbers that vary by several orders of magnitude kosuth et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 shruti et al 2020 this discrepancy indicates high variability of mp loads in drinking waters from different sources and countries however the studies are also hardly comparable due to different sampling mp extraction and identification methods where mp identification represents one of the crucial pitfalls käppler et al 2018 furthermore mp numbers are commonly reported within size classes löder et al 2017 impeding the assessment of the real mp concentration and making it impossible to compare the data to analytical techniques quantifying the polymer mass previous work has demonstrated that both atr ftir and py gcms successfully differentiate between plastic and non plastic hendrickson et al 2018 käppler et al 2018 with identification of 85 as the same polymer type käppler et al 2018 for the first time we analysed sub samples via µftir imaging and py gcms in order to compare mp concentrations ftir based mass estimates and directly determined mass concentrations we successfully determined very low mp loads in drinking water applying two µftir and py gcms and obtaining comparable concentrations with the two complementary techniques however µftir and py gcms identified different polymer types in samples with overall low mp concentrations as i e pe was detected by µftir but not by py gcms conversely with increasing mp load of a given polymer type the concentrations measured with both techniques became more comparable as was the case for polyester underrepresentation of specific plastic types due to concentrations below the respective polymer detection limit of py gcms is the most likely explanation for the differences in polymer composition observed between the different methods 4 3 mps in drinking water implications for human health using µftir imaging followed by an automated image analysis enabled us to identify the size and shape of mps down to 6 6 μm since accessible clean drinking water is one of the sustainable development goals of the united nations who 2017 it is of utmost importance to reliably investigate mps and to determine numbers concentration and size in order to understand and evaluate the potential risks related to human health considering that the annual estimated mp consumption ranges from 39 000 to 52 000 particles or 74 000 and 121 000 when inhalation is taken into account cox et al 2019 the generally low mp numbers of 0 174 mps l we found in the present study suggest that the consumption of drinking water processed by a high performance drinking water treatment plant does not particularly add to potential risks to human health however the issue of mps in products designated for human consumption received increasing attention in the last years due to the discovery of small mps translocating to inner organs deng et al 2017 in the present study mp abundance increased with decreasing size until 20 40 µm before decreasing to the smallest detectable size 10 µm the latter aspect is a consequence of the low spectra quality s n ratio when size decreases below 10 µm resulting in fewer particles positively identified as a specific polymer and or nonsysthetic particle pivokonsky et al 2018 found mps were the most abundant in the smallest detectable size class 1 10 μm accounting for up to 95 of the total numbers also shruti et al 2020 reported an increase in mps with decreasing size with 50 of mps 500 µm unfortunately the different methodologies applied in the previous study makes the comparison hardly feasible the fact that we exclusively detected mps between 8 and 374 µm and that 32 of all detected mps were smaller than 20 µm may raise concern for human health investigations of mps in fish and invertebrates suggest that mps smaller than 500 μm might pass the gut wall lusher et al 2017 and mps smaller than 20 µm can accumulate in liver kidney and gut of mice deng et al 2017 however the european food safety authority efsa classified the absorption of mps larger than 150 µm as unlikely and the absorption and uptake of mps smaller than 20 µm in total up to 0 3 for mps 150 µm into organs as overall limited efsa 2016 in order to put our results in perspective approximately 97 of the mps we detected were smaller than 150 µm in major dimension and mp numbers were on average 0 174 mps l considering a scenario with mp absorption of 0 3 and daily consumption of three litres potable water per day the annual uptake would be of less than one mp particle per person through drinking potable water hence to support a more robust human health risk assessment of mps future efforts need to be done to understand better the occurrence of plastic particles in potable water their levels as number of particles and total masses polymer type composition size and shape the latter features are of crucial importance for toxicologists to define exposure routes and tailor natural like exposure scenario to investigate realistic biological effects and define toxicity thresholds 5 conclusion this study represents a systematic and robust approach investigating mp quality quantity shape and size including very small mps 20 µm in drinking water as such it is an important step forward in understanding mp distribution and the potential implications for human health most detected mps were smaller than 150 µm and 32 were smaller than 20 µm which could potentially pose a risk to human health however our results showed very low mp loads in drinking water processed in a high performance drinking water treatment plant suggesting a low risk to human health for the first time we investigated mp loads in drinking water using two complementary techniques

17427,chlorine dioxide clo2 is a prevalently used disinfectant alternative to chlorine due to its effectiveness in pathogen inactivation and low yields of organic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps however during clo2 generation chlorine is inevitably introduced into the obtained clo2 solution as an impurity which could compromise the merits of clo2 disinfection in this study drinking water disinfection with clo2 containing 0 25 chlorine impurity i e at cl2 to clo2 mass ratios of 0 25 was simulated and the effect of chlorine impurity on the dbp formation and developmental toxicity of the finished water was evaluated with increasing the chlorine impurity in clo2 the chlorite level kept decreasing and the chlorate level gradually increased meanwhile an unexpected trend from decline to rise was observed for the total organic halogenated dbps with the minimum level appearing at 5 chlorine impurity to unravel the mechanisms for the variations of organic halogenated dbps with chlorine impurity a quantitative kinetic model was developed to simulate the formation of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps in the clo2 disinfected drinking water the modeling results indicated that reactions involving iodide accounted for the decrease of organic halogenated dbps at a relatively low chlorine impurity level in accordance with dbp formation clo2 with 5 chlorine impurity generated less toxic drinking water than pure clo2 while significantly higher developmental toxicity was induced until the chlorine impurity reached 25 for e coli inactivation the presence of chlorine impurity enhanced the disinfection efficiency due to a synergistic effect of clo2 and chlorine therefore disinfection practices with clo2 containing low chlorine impurity e g 10 might be favored i e there is no need to eliminate low chlorine impurity in the clo2 solution while those containing high chlorine impurity should be concerned graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection

and cost effectiveness in inactivating pathogens but it may inadvertently react with natural organic matter nom anthropogenic compounds and bromide iodide ions in source waters to form halogenated

2018 he et al 2018 kimura et al 2019 yang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 rising concerns on the health risks of dbps have prompted water utilities to adopt reliable alternative disinfectants such as chlorine dioxide clo2 compared with chlorine clo2 has equal or superior disinfection efficiency is effective across a broader range of ph and can inactivate chlorine recalcitrant pathogens such as cryptosporidium parvum liu et al 2013 wen et al 2017 switching the disinfectant from chlorine to clo2 led to remarkable reductions of some organic halogenated dbps zhang et al 2000 richardson et al 2003 hua and reckhow 2007 han et al 2017 and decreased toxicity of the finished water shi et al 2009 accordingly clo2 disinfection has been increasingly applied worldwide in the u s clo2 is utilized for disinfection in approximately 900 drinking water treatment plants hendricks 2011 in europe several thousand water treatment plants have been reported to disinfect with clo2 gates et al 2009 in china clo2 is the primarily used disinfectant in small and medium sized drinking water treatment plants yao et al 2018 gan et al 2019 due to its explosive nature clo2 is unsuitable for compression or storage and is usually generated on site most commercial generators use sodium chlorite as the precursor to generate clo2 for drinking water application according to the u s environmental protection agency the purity of the generated clo2 solution should be greater than 95 usepa 1999 however aging or deviations of the generator systems may result in the contamination of clo2 by chlorine for instance the acidification of chlorite with a concentrated acid e g hydrochloric acid is a commonly used method for generating clo2 the key reaction given in eq 1 in the chlorite acid system chlorate may form if ph is not well controlled eq 2 with the resultant formation of chlorine as an impurity in the obtained clo2 solution via eq 3 usepa 1999 white 2010 a chlorine impurity of approximately 24 i e at a cl2 to clo2 mass ratio of 24 in clo2 has been reported from a pilot scale acid chlorite system veschetti et al 2005 the oxidation of chlorite by gaseous or aqueous chlorine eqs 4 5 is also widely used for clo2 generation gates et al 2009 while the practice of feeding excess chlorine and the malfunctions in pumping the feedstock chemicals may directly introduce chlorine into the obtained clo2 solution it has been reported that in some drinking water treatment plants employing the aqueous chlorine chlorite system 200 of the stoichiometrically required amount of chlorine was used aieta and berg 1986 which would cause a chlorine impurity greater than 25 eq 1 5 clo 2 4 h 4 cl o 2 c l 2 h 2 o eq 2 4 clo 2 2 h 2 cl o 2 clo 3 c l h 2 o eq 3 2 clo 3 4 h 2 c l 2 cl o 2 c l 2 2 h 2 o eq 4 2

than chlorinating agent it has been reported that compared with chlorine clo2 produced significantly lower levels of thms haas haloacetonitriles and total organic halogen tox a collective indicator for the overall formation of organic halogenated dbps zhang et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 in addition to their levels the halogen speciation of dbps is of critical importance because brominated and iodinated dbps are substantially more genotoxic cytotoxic and developmentally toxic than their chlorinated analogs yang et al 2014 wagner and plewa 2017 jiang et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 bromide and iodide are naturally present in source waters as precursors of brominated and iodinated dbps zhu and zhang 2016 dong et al 2017 with iodide concentrations typically falling within 10 15 of bromide concentrations simmons et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 bromide can be fast oxidized by chlorine kapp 8 4 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 to form hypobromous acid hobr which results in the formation of brominated dbps through reacting with nom deborde and von gunten 2008 whereas clo2 reacts with bromide at a much lower rate constant kapp 0 01 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 meanwhile inconsistent results have been reported for the relative formation potential of iodinated dbps during chlorination and clo2 disinfection bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 zhang et al 2015 in studying the disinfection with combined chlorine and clo2 synchronously zhong et al 2019 found that introducing clo2 promoted the incorporation of bromine and iodine into dbp classes such as thms and haas with increasing the bromide concentration from 0 to 100 μg l the mass concentrations of thms haas and haloacetonitriles formed in the combined chlorine and clo2 treatment were significantly enhanced from 18 to 32 24 to 31 and 4 to 8 μg l respectively kim et al 2017 few studies have reported on the formation of dbps during disinfection using clo2 with chlorine impurity hofmann et al 2004 gan et al 2016 hofmann et al 2004 focused on the formation of regulated dbps including thms haas and chlorite and chlorate in clo2 disinfection and reported a significant increase in the concentrations of thms and haas with chlorine impurity ranging from 0 to 20 gan et al 2016 investigated the formation of regulated dbps and some common dbps including chloral hydrate haloketones haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and chlorate in clo2 disinfection with 0 100 chlorine impurity their results indicated that chlorine impurity led to a decreased chlorite level and an increased chlorate level however the impact of chlorine impurity on the brominated and iodinated dbps in clo2 disinfection has remained largely unknown in addition the variations of several classes of dbps may not reflect the effect of chlorine impurity on the overall dbp formation as over 70 of tox remained unidentified for clo2 disinfection zhang et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 more importantly the toxicity of clo2 disinfected drinking water may also be affected by chlorine impurity in view of the varied composition of the dbp mixture including chlorinated brominated iodinated organic dbps and inorganic dbps which requires explicit investigation as the presence of a certain level of chlorine impurity takes place spontaneously and concomitantly when a clo2 solution is generated from a clo2 generator the question is whether it is necessary to eliminate the chlorine impurity in a clo2 solution in clo2 disinfection accordingly we aimed to answer this key question in the practical application of clo2 in drinking water disinfection as such the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chlorine impurity on the dbp formation and dbp related toxicity in drinking water disinfection with clo2 additionally the disinfection efficiency of clo2 with chlorine impurity was also inspected 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a clo2 stock solution was prepared using the standard method 4500 clo2 b apha et al 2012 in brief clo2 gas was generated by slowly adding 20 ml of h2so4 10 v v to 500 ml of a 0 5 m naclo2 solution with nitrogen 200 ml min as carrier gas the gaseous clo2 passed through a scrubber containing 600 ml of a saturated naclo2 solution to remove potential impurities followed by being absorbed in ultrapure water to verify its purity six aliquots of the clo2 stock solution were drawn three of them were added with 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the clo2 concentrations in the six aliquots were calibrated using the iodometric method apha et al 2012 as dmso reacts with chlorine but not with clo2 jiang et al 2006 the concentration difference of the aliquots with and without dmso should correspond to the concentration of chlorine impurity with details in text s1 in the supplementary data the clo2 stock solution void of chlorine impurity was stored in headspace free amber glass vials at 4 c a naocl stock solution supplied by allied signal was calibrated using the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 suwannee river nom srnom was obtained from the international humic substances society ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was provided by a water purification system cascada i pall usa other chemicals were reagent grade or higher from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation disinfection and pretreatment of simulated drinking water a simulated raw water sample was prepared by dissolving 3 mg l srnom as c 80 mg l nahco3 as caco3 2 0 mg l nabr as br and 0 20 mg l ki as i in ultrapure water and adjusting to ph 7 5 with 1 0 m hcl and naoh solutions the bromide levels in 13 surface waters in australia ranged from 0 139 to 4 13 mg l magazinovic et al 2004 the iodine levels in major u s canadian and european rivers ranged from 0 5 to 212 µg l moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 the relatively high levels of bromide and iodide were used for better study of brominated and iodinated dbps due to the rising concerns on them prior to disinfection the concentration of clo2 was determined spectrophotometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of 1150 m 1cm 1 at 360 nm hua and reckhow 2007 predetermined volumes of the naocl solution were mixed with the pure clo2 solution to obtain clo2 solutions with chlorine impurity at cl2 clo2 mass ratios of 0 5 10 17 and 25 respectively the simulated raw water was disinfected by dosing 1 5 mg l clo2 containing different levels of chlorine impurity for a 30 min contact time in the dark at room temperature the clo2 dose and contact time were selected following the common practice in drinking water disinfection with clo2 afterward the disinfectant residual was quenched by adding 105 of the stoichiometric amount of 0 1 m na2so3 to stop the disinfection and preclude the effects of the disinfectant residual on the following chemical and toxicological analyses pan et al 2019 kristiana et al 2014 studied the effect of quenching agents on the stability of several classes of dbps and recommended ascorbic acid and sodium sulfite for the analysis of organic and inorganic dbps respectively to select a suitable quenching agent quenching with sodium sulfite or ascorbic acid was conducted for the clo2 disinfected drinking water sample at an intentionally elevated dosage 150 of the stoichiometric amount and a prolonged reaction time 2 h as shown in fig s1 sodium sulfite and ascorbic acid caused no significant difference p 0 05 in the tox or chlorate level while ascorbic acid caused a significant decrease p 0 05 in the chlorite level in addition the sodium sulfite added and the reaction product formed i e sodium sulfate showed no effect on the toxicity bioassay therefore sodium sulfite was used in this study each water sample subjected to toxicity evaluation was pretreated by freeze drying which has been demonstrated to effectively retain both organic and inorganic dbps han and zhang 2018 briefly a 1 l sample aliquot was evenly transferred onto five glass petri dishes diameter 200 mm height 20 mm and prefrozen first at 18 c for 8 h and then at 36 c for 12 h the aliquot was then freeze dried to solid in a lyophilizer fd 1a 50 bilon china the solid concentrates on the five petri dishes were transferred to a 125 ml flask each petri dish was rinsed three times with acetonitrile and ultrapure water and the rinsing solutions were also transferred to the flask and then concentrated to solid following the aforementioned freeze drying procedure the obtained solid concentrate was kept at 4 c until the bioassay it is worth mentioning that because volatile dbps have been reported to contribute marginally to the developmental toxicity and the oxidative stress of dbp mixtures li et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the loss of volatile dbps during the sample pretreatment should not significantly affect the developmental toxicity of the dbp mixtures 2 3 analysis of tox chlorite and chlorate three components of tox i e total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi were determined based on the standard method 5320b apha et al 2012 except that off line ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex usa was used for measuring chloride and bromide abusallout and hua 2016 pan et al 2019 and ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry waters usa was used for measuring iodide gong et al 2018 details are given in text s2 in the tox analysis samples were adjusted to ph 2 before passing through activated carbon columns acidic conditions would allow the formation of clo2 from chlorite and chlorate eqs 1 3 which may affect the measurement of tox and thus 105 of the stoichiometric amount of 0 1 m na2so3 was added before sample acidification to reduce chlorite and chlorate the concentrations of chlorite and chlorate were determined using an ion chromatography system ics 3000 dionex usa in analysis of tox and inorganic dbps all the experimental procedures and analytical measurements were conducted in duplicate 2 4 development of a kinetic model a reaction scheme was proposed for the formation of organic halogenated dbps in clo2 disinfection as shown in fig s2 the reactions involved are shown in table 1 in the simulated drinking water reactions were initialized with clo2 toward nom reactions 1 2 and i reaction 3 nom was assumed to consist of fast reaction sites nomfast and slow reaction sites nomslow westerhoff et al 2004 echigo and minear 2006 the apparent reaction rate constants for clo2 with nomfast and nomslow were obtained from kinetic experiments detailed in text s3 on the decay of clo2 in a bromide iodide free srnom sample 3 mg l srnom as c and 80 mg l nahco3 as caco3 in ultrapure water ph 7 5 in reacting with nom clo2 mainly underwent one electron reduction to form clo2 gan et al 2019 the in situ formation of hocl has been reported in reactions of clo2 with nom and some phenolic compounds wajon et al 1982 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 a minor portion of clo2 might react with nom to generate organic chlorinated dbps cl dbps accordingly the obtained apparent rate constant for clo2 reacting with nomfast or nomslow comprised three pathways corresponding to the consumption of clo2 by forming clo2 hocl and cl dbps respectively the kinetics of hocl formation from clo2 nom reactions in the srnom sample was determined following the method outlined in rougé et al 2018 and detailed in text s3 the generation of cl dbps from clo2 was verified by comparing the tocl levels in the clo2 treated srnom sample with the absence and presence of 0 4 mm glycine text s4 glycine was used here to distinguish the contributions of clo2 and in situ formed hocl to the formation of cl dbps because glycine can quickly quench hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 but its reaction with clo2 is negligible hoigné and bader 1994 a series of inorganic redox reactions were incorporated into the reaction scheme iodine i2 produced from i oxidation by clo2 reaction 3 equilibrated to form hoi reaction 4 upon the formation of hocl in the simulated drinking water it oxidized br to form hobr bro reaction 5 and oxidized i to form hoi which was further oxidized by hocl clo to form io2 and io3 reactions 6 8 the formed hobr bro also oxidized i io and io2 to generate hoi io io2 and io3 respectively reactions 9 11 hoi and i2 were oxidized by hclo2 clo2 to form io3 reactions 12 14 in addition the oxidation of chlorite by hocl clo or hobr bro led to the production of clo3 and clo2 reactions 15 16 the rate constants for reactions 3 16 were obtained from the literature lengyel et al 1996 bichsel and von gunten 2000 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 epstein and kustin 1985 gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 furman and margerum 1998 hocl clo hobr bro hoi io and i2 may react with nom to generate halogenated dbps via electrophilic substitution or form nonhalogenated oxidation products via electron transfer criquet et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 vikesland et al 2013 which are presented as reactions 17 24 as phenolic structures were considered as the major components in nomfast echigo and minear 2006 zhai et al 2014 the intermediate halogenated dbps generated from fast reactions might also be phenolics which would further react with clo2 reactions 25 27 the auto decomposition of the formed dbps zhang et al 2013 was also incorporated reactions 28 30 the reaction rate constants of hox xo x cl br i with nomfast were determined following a previous study zhu and zhang 2016 in brief the reactivity of hox toward substituted phenolate ions was positively related to their hammett constants σσo p m deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 and the reaction rate constants for hox xo with nomfast corresponded to those with phenolic compounds at σσo p m 0 17 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore the rate constants for hox xo reacting with nomfast were obtained by establishing a hammett type correlation for hox xo with substituted phenols phenolates at ph 7 5 and by assuming σσo p m 0 17 for nomfast table s1 and fig s3 few studies have focused on the species specific reaction kinetics for i2 in studying the iodination of phenolic compounds vikesland et al 2013 found that the reactions of the substituted phenolates with i2 were 100 102 times faster than those with hoi accordingly the reaction rate constant for i2 with nomfast was assumed to be one magnitude higher than that for hoi io with nomfast the rate constants for halogenation of nomslow and transformation of formed dbps were determined by conducting kinetic experiments clo2 dose 1 5 mg l contact times from 1 min to 12 h ph 7 5 with the simulated raw water 2 5 evaluation of the comparative developmental toxicity with platynereis dumerilii a new approach for evaluating the drinking water toxicity was recently developed by combining the freeze drying pretreatment with an in vivo acute bioassay based on the embryos of a cosmopolitan marine polychaete p dumerilii han and zhang 2018 although in vivo acute toxicity bioassays may not mirror health risks directly they are a cost effective approach to revealing the comparative toxicity of individual chemicals or chemical mixtures the bioassay based on the p dumerilii embryos has been successfully applied to the toxicity evaluation of individual dbps and dbp mixtures in drinking water and wastewater effluents yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 due to its good reproducibility and high sensitivity more importantly the polychaete has high salinity tolerance which makes the bioassay compatible with the freeze drying pretreatment han and zhang 2018 the new approach can reflect not only the toxicity contribution from organic dbps but also the toxicity contribution from inorganic dbps including chlorite and chlorate as well as the synergistic effect of organic and inorganic dbps han and zhang 2018 so it was used in this study to assess the comparative developmental toxicity of dbp mixtures in the drinking water samples disinfected with clo2 containing different levels of chlorine impurity stock cultures of the polychaete were maintained and the developmental toxicity bioassay was conducted following previous studies hutchinson et al 1998 yang and zhang 2013 as detailed in text s5 prior to the bioassay toxicity test solutions were prepared by dissolving the solid concentrates of the disinfected samples pretreated with freeze drying to preclude the interferences of salinity and ph on the embryo development the toxicity test solutions were adjusted to salinity of 45 by dissolving the solid concentrates with seawater and ultrapure water and tuned to ph 7 5 0 5 by adding 0 2 m hcl and naoh yang et al 2015 han and zhang 2018 2 6 determination of the disinfection efficiency with escherichia coli the effect of chlorine impurity on the disinfection efficiency of clo2 was evaluated with e coli a commonly used indicator microorganism all the materials for the disinfection efficiency experiments were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min the preparation and enumeration of e coli followed previous studies cho et al 2010 li et al 2017 as described in text s6 disinfection was conducted in a series of disinfectant demand free phosphate buffered saline pbs 150 mm ph 7 4 solutions in the dark at 15 c with an initial e coli atcc 8739 usa concentration of 106 107 colony forming units per ml the e coli strain atcc 8739 is a well characterized standard reference material that has been widely used in studying the disinfection efficiencies and mechanisms of various disinfectants ayyildiz et al 2009 cho et al 2010 moreno andrés et al 2019 to initiate the disinfection 0 2 mg l clo2 0 01 mg l chlorine or 0 2 mg l clo2 mixed with 0 01 mg l chlorine corresponding to clo2 with 5 chlorine impurity was added to a solution containing e coli the disinfection was conducted for a series of contact times 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 s after a given contact time the disinfectant residual was quenched with an excess amount of 0 1 m na2so3 the second order reaction rate constants for sodium sulfite with chlorine and clo2 have been reported to be 2 3 108 m 1s 1 and 7 8 105 m 1s 1 respectively deborde and von gunten 2008 neta et al 1988 so the chlorine and or clo2 residuals should be quenched instantaneously the e coli before and after disinfection was enumerated using a membrane filtration method apha et al 2012 briefly 0 5 ml of the e coli sample was serially diluted 10 fold with pbs each dilution was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane which was then placed onto a petri dish containing a freshly prepared m fc medium becton dickinson co the colony forming units in a statistically meaningful range 20 80 were counted after incubation at 45 c for 24 h each batch of experiments on the disinfection efficiency was conducted in triplicate 2 7 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova at a significance level of 95 was performed to analyze the impact of chlorine impurity on the dbp formation toxicity and disinfection efficacy in clo2 disinfection 3 results and discussion 3 1 tox formation in clo2 disinfection with chlorine impurity fig 1 displays the tox formation in the drinking water treated with clo2 with chlorine impurity with increasing the chlorine impurity the tox level first decreased reached the minimum at 5 chlorine impurity p 0 05 and then increased the tox formation for clo2 with 25 chlorine impurity was 1 73 times that for pure clo2 specifically as the chlorine impurity increased from 0 to 25 the tocl level remained almost stable while the toi level did not change significantly at 0 10 of chlorine impurity p 0 05 and then decreased gradually p 0 05 the tobr level decreased as chlorine impurity varied from 0 to 5 and then increased as the chlorine impurity increased further shifting the speciation of overall halogenated dbps toward more brominated ones suppression of the toi formation with increasing chlorine impurity was mainly due to the competitive reactions of chlorine and clo2 with iodide chlorine can oxidize iodide to form hoi and then to form io3 shortening the half life of hoi for its reaction with nom criquet et al 2012 however the variations of tocl and tobr were unexpected at higher chlorine impurity levels the tocl and tobr levels had been anticipated to grow considering the existence of higher concentrations of hocl clo and hobr bro generated from chlorine reacting with bromide thus a quantitative chemical kinetic model involving the reactions among clo2 chlorine bromide iodide and nom was developed to simulate the formation of the three components of tox and to depict their variation based on the aforementioned assumptions 30 reactions table 1 responsible for the formation of organic halogenated dbps were incorporated into the kinetic model the rate constants for clo2 reacting with nom reactions 1 2 were determined by best fitting of the measured clo2 decay and in situ chlorine formation in the srnom sample at different contact times fig 2 a and the tocl concentrations in the drinking water samples at different contact times without chlorine impurity fig 2b the rate constants for the halogenation of nom via substitution or oxidation and the transformation of organic halogenated dbps reactions 17 30 were determined based on previous studies zhai and zhang 2014 zhu and zhang 2016 and by best fitting of the measured concentrations of tocl tobr and toi in the drinking water samples at different contact times and different chlorine impurity levels fig 2b c the predicted concentrations of clo2 in situ formed hocl and tox at different contact times and chlorine impurity levels were in good agreement with the experimental results with the r2 of 0 86 0 99 for the regressions of the modeled and experimental data fig s4a c the model indicated that in the clo2 disinfection both clo2 and in situ formed chlorine contributed to the formation of cl dbps text s4 fig s5 and i2 from clo2 iodide reactions and hoi io from chlorine iodide reactions bichsel and von gunten 1999 were both responsible for the formation of i dbps in addition br dbps that were reported in clo2 disinfection richardson et al 2003 yang et al 2013 might be accounted for by the in situ formed chlorine there were two sources of chlorine in the clo2 disinfected water sample the chlorine impurity present in the clo2 solution and the in situ formed chlorine from clo2 nom reactions as shown in fig 2a the chlorine formation consists of a fast initial phase followed by a slower phase reaching 4 1 μm at the contact time of 30 min corresponding to 18 of the dosed clo2 which was consistent with the results from rougé et al 2018 with the presence of bromide and iodide chlorine was preferentially consumed by iodide and then by bromide because the reaction of chlorine with iodide kapp 7 3 107 m 1s 1 was substantially faster than that with bromide kapp 8 4 102 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 which was in turn much faster than those with nom kapp nomfast 1 6 102 m 1s 1 kapp nomslow 13 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 in the clo2 disinfected water sample initially with 2 0 mg l 25 μm of bromide and 0 2 mg l 1 6 μm of iodide the total chlorine concentrations with increasing the chlorine impurity and those consumed by different reactions were determined using the kinetic model fig s6 for the samples with 0 25 chlorine impurity the oxidation of bromide 53 76 and iodide 21 46 predominantly accounted for the chlorine consumption and 1 of chlorine was converted to cl dbps therefore the increase in total chlorine concentration did not cause a significant tocl increment at 5 chlorine impurity i e 1 1 μm chlorine from the impure clo2 solution was totally consumed by iodide initial concentration at 1 6 μm rendering no hobr bro enhancement from the chlorine impurity however this could not fully account for the decrease of tobr at a relatively low level of chlorine impurity for pure clo2 disinfection most of the iodide was initially oxidized to i2 by clo2 with chlorine impurity iodide was primarily converted to hoi io by chlorine because the oxidation rate constant of iodide by chlorine was markedly higher than that by clo2 kapp 6 0 103 m 1s 1 lengyel et al 1996 i2 and hoi io might behave differently when reacting with nom despite their equilibrium it has been reported that electron transfer was the principal pathway for reactions of hoi io with nom as the majority of hoi io was reduced to iodide zhao et al 2017 the formed iodide was quickly re oxidized to hoi io by chlorine formed from clo2 nom reactions thus suppressing hobr bro and subsequent tobr formation from the in situ produced chlorine further increasing the chlorine impurity level past the initial iodide molar concentration promoted the formation of hobr bro and resulted in the gradual increase of the tobr level 3 2 effect of chlorine impurity on the formation of inorganic dbps in clo2 disinfection chlorite and chlorate are principal inorganic dbps of concern in clo2 disinfection at the 30 min contact time 65 and 6 of the dosed clo2 were converted to chlorite and chlorate respectively in the absence of chlorine impurity fig 3 which agreed with previously reported conversion ratios of 30 70 to chlorite and 0 10 to chlorate gates et al 2009 al otoum et al 2016 with chlorine impurity less chlorite but more chlorate were formed compared with those in the pure clo2 disinfected sample it has been reported that in clo2 reactions with humic substances the amount of electron donating moieties was correlated with the formation of chlorite gan et al 2019 the bromine and iodine produced from chlorine impurity tended to compete with clo2 in reacting with nom and lead to nom oxidation thus lowering the concentration of precursors for chlorite besides chlorine and bromine have been reported to oxidize chlorite to form clo2 and chlorate reactions 15 16 gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 furman and margerum 1998 as chlorine impurity increased from 0 to 25 the chlorite concentration decreased from 0 98 to 0 82 mg l corresponding to a 17 reduction in contrast the chlorate concentration increased from 0 11 to 0 16 mg l corresponding to a 46 increase the chlorite reduction was more significant than that reported in gan et al 2016 which indicated a 7 chlorite reduction with 20 chlorine impurity for a 45 min contact time the enhanced chlorite reduction might be accounted for by the presence of bromide and iodide in the water sample as shown in fig s7 the chlorite formation was well simulated by the developed model with the r2 value of 0 98 for the regression of the modeled and measured concentrations according to the model at the chlorine impurity of 25 the chlorite reduction with the presence of 2 0 mg l bromide and 0 2 mg l iodide was 3 2 times of that without bromide and iodide in the competition with clo2 to react with nom the reaction rate constants for bromine and iodine were significantly larger than those for chlorine table 1 in addition the reactions of bromine with chlorite were 1 2 orders of magnitude faster than those of chlorine with chlorite furman and margerum 1998 for the variation of chlorate it needs mentioning that due to the disproportionation of chlorine chlorate was present in the naocl stock solution and was introduced therewith to the water sample pan et al 2014 therefore the chlorate formation in the impure clo2 disinfection was obtained by subtracting the chlorate caused by the naocl stock solution from the corresponding measured concentrations fig s8 3 3 effect of chlorine impurity on the developmental toxicity of the clo2 disinfected sample figs 4 and s9 show the exposure response of the drinking water samples against the development of two batches of p dumerilii embryos table s2 lists the corresponding ec50 values i e the sample concentration factor at which point the normal development percentage was half of that in the seawater control and the r2 values for the regression analysis for the two batches of bioassays the comparative developmental toxicity was consistent for the samples with different chlorine impurity levels and the obtained ec50 values showed good reproducibility for the samples with the same chlorine impurity level compared with the pure clo2 disinfected sample the formation of organic and inorganic dbps decreased in the 5 chlorine impurity sample with significant reductions in tobr and chlorite levels and insignificant variations in tocl toi and chlorate levels in accordance with the dbp formation the developmental toxicity decreased p 0 05 with increasing the chlorine impurity to 5 further increasing the chlorine impurity caused the toxicity to increase but the toxicity was not markedly higher than that for pure clo2 disinfection until the chlorine impurity reached 25 at which the developmental toxicity increased by 49 on average the toxicity results indicated that relatively low levels of chlorine impurity in clo2 might not raise health concerns over clo2 disinfected drinking water instead it might reduce the toxicity somewhat however relatively high levels of chlorine impurity e g 25 in clo2 might induce markedly higher toxicity than pure clo2 3 4 effect of chlorine impurity on the disinfection efficiency of clo2 through plotting the log of e coli survival percentage against the contact time with disinfectants the e coli inactivation by clo2 chlorine at the cl2 clo2 mass ratio of 5 corresponding to the chlorine impurity and their mixture is presented in figs 5 and s10 the effect of chlorine impurity at 5 on the disinfection efficiency of clo2 was investigated as it was found to be favorable in controlling dbp formation and toxicity the time dependent inactivation curves followed chick s law with an initial lag phase the lag phase reflected that damages to the bacterial cells caused by disinfectants needed to accumulate before the cell death hosni et al 2011 and this also accounted for the stable survival ratio for exposure to chlorine alone according to chick s law the disinfection rate constants were determined to be 4 8 4 2 and 0 1 min 1 for clo2 with 5 chlorine impurity clo2 alone and chlorine alone fig 5 respectively the results suggested a synergistic effect of clo2 and chlorine in inactivating e coli similar results were obtained from another batch of experiments on the disinfection efficiency fig s10 the synergy might be due to their different inactivation mechanisms cho et al 2010 reported that e coli inactivation by chlorine was primarily related to the damage of intracellular components while clo2 resulted in less intracellular component damage but more significant cell surface damage by applying the chlorine containing clo2 the cell surface damage caused by clo2 might facilitate the penetration of chlorine into the cell and thus promote the interaction between chlorine and intracellular components resulting in the enhanced disinfection efficiency in addition upon the reduction of clo2 to chlorite during disinfection clo2 might be re generated from the reaction of chlorine with chlorite reaction 15 as clo2 was more effective than chlorine in the e coli inactivation at ph 7 4 cho et al 2010 the disinfection efficiency for mixed clo2 and chlorine should be higher than the summation of their individual efficiencies similar synergy resulting from the co exposure of clo2 and chlorine has also been reported in the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores hofmann et al 2004 son et al 2005 4 conclusions the dbp formation and developmental toxicity were studied for the drinking water that was disinfected by clo2 with chlorine impurity from the clo2 generation process with increasing the chlorine impurity from 0 to 25 gradually decreasing chlorite and increasing chlorate levels were observed meantime it was unexpectedly found that tox and developmental toxicity first decreased and then increased and both reached their minimum levels at around 5 chlorine impurity disinfection with chlorine containing clo2 is a complex yet interesting process with two sources of chlorine i e chlorine impurity from clo2 generation and in situ formed chlorine from clo2 nom reactions and with the generation of both hoi and i2 by developing a kinetic model for the formation of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps in clo2 disinfected drinking water the mechanisms for the variations of tox and developmental toxicity were revealed in addition a synergistic effect was identified in the e coli inactivation by clo2 and chlorine even if the chlorine concentration was only 5 of the clo2 concentration the results indicated that for the disinfection with clo2 the presence of low levels of chlorine impurity e g 10 was beneficial with regard to both disinfection efficiency and control of dbps and toxicity and extra expenditure to purify the clo2 solution was not necessary meanwhile measures should be taken by water utilities once the chlorine impurity reaches a relatively high level e g 25 in the generated clo2 solution as it may cause increased dbp formation and drinking water toxicity further studies may also be needed to examine the effect of chlorine impurity on the clo2 disinfection of different source waters and to test the applicability of the kinetic model to different source water characteristics declaration of

17427,chlorine dioxide clo2 is a prevalently used disinfectant alternative to chlorine due to its effectiveness in pathogen inactivation and low yields of organic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps however during clo2 generation chlorine is inevitably introduced into the obtained clo2 solution as an impurity which could compromise the merits of clo2 disinfection in this study drinking water disinfection with clo2 containing 0 25 chlorine impurity i e at cl2 to clo2 mass ratios of 0 25 was simulated and the effect of chlorine impurity on the dbp formation and developmental toxicity of the finished water was evaluated with increasing the chlorine impurity in clo2 the chlorite level kept decreasing and the chlorate level gradually increased meanwhile an unexpected trend from decline to rise was observed for the total organic halogenated dbps with the minimum level appearing at 5 chlorine impurity to unravel the mechanisms for the variations of organic halogenated dbps with chlorine impurity a quantitative kinetic model was developed to simulate the formation of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps in the clo2 disinfected drinking water the modeling results indicated that reactions involving iodide accounted for the decrease of organic halogenated dbps at a relatively low chlorine impurity level in accordance with dbp formation clo2 with 5 chlorine impurity generated less toxic drinking water than pure clo2 while significantly higher developmental toxicity was induced until the chlorine impurity reached 25 for e coli inactivation the presence of chlorine impurity enhanced the disinfection efficiency due to a synergistic effect of clo2 and chlorine therefore disinfection practices with clo2 containing low chlorine impurity e g 10 might be favored i e there is no need to eliminate low chlorine impurity in the clo2 solution while those containing high chlorine impurity should be concerned graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection

2018 he et al 2018 kimura et al 2019 yang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 rising concerns on the health risks of dbps have prompted water utilities to adopt reliable alternative disinfectants such as chlorine dioxide clo2 compared with chlorine clo2 has equal or superior disinfection efficiency is effective across a broader range of ph and can inactivate chlorine recalcitrant pathogens such as cryptosporidium parvum liu et al 2013 wen et al 2017 switching the disinfectant from chlorine to clo2 led to remarkable reductions of some organic halogenated dbps zhang et al 2000 richardson et al 2003 hua and reckhow 2007 han et al 2017 and decreased toxicity of the finished water shi et al 2009 accordingly clo2 disinfection has been increasingly applied worldwide in the u s clo2 is utilized for disinfection in approximately 900 drinking water treatment plants hendricks 2011 in europe several thousand water treatment plants have been reported to disinfect with clo2 gates et al 2009 in china clo2 is the primarily used disinfectant in small and medium sized drinking water treatment plants yao et al 2018 gan et al 2019 due to its explosive nature clo2 is unsuitable for compression or storage and is usually generated on site most commercial generators use sodium chlorite as the precursor to generate clo2 for drinking water application according to the u s environmental protection agency the purity of the generated clo2 solution should be greater than 95 usepa 1999 however aging or deviations of the generator systems may result in the contamination of clo2 by chlorine for instance the acidification of chlorite with a concentrated acid e g hydrochloric acid is a commonly used method for generating clo2 the key reaction given in eq 1 in the chlorite acid system chlorate may form if ph is not well controlled eq 2 with the resultant formation of chlorine as an impurity in the obtained clo2 solution via eq 3 usepa 1999 white 2010 a chlorine impurity of approximately 24 i e at a cl2 to clo2 mass ratio of 24 in clo2 has been reported from a pilot scale acid chlorite system veschetti et al 2005 the oxidation of chlorite by gaseous or aqueous chlorine eqs 4 5 is also widely used for clo2 generation gates et al 2009 while the practice of feeding excess chlorine and the malfunctions in pumping the feedstock chemicals may directly introduce chlorine into the obtained clo2 solution it has been reported that in some drinking water treatment plants employing the aqueous chlorine chlorite system 200 of the stoichiometrically required amount of chlorine was used aieta and berg 1986 which would cause a chlorine impurity greater than 25 eq 1 5 clo 2 4 h 4 cl o 2 c l 2 h 2 o eq 2 4 clo 2 2 h 2 cl o 2 clo 3 c l h 2 o eq 3 2 clo 3 4 h 2 c l 2 cl o 2 c l 2 2 h 2 o eq 4 2

than chlorinating agent it has been reported that compared with chlorine clo2 produced significantly lower levels of thms haas haloacetonitriles and total organic halogen tox a collective indicator for the overall formation of organic halogenated dbps zhang et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 in addition to their levels the halogen speciation of dbps is of critical importance because brominated and iodinated dbps are substantially more genotoxic cytotoxic and developmentally toxic than their chlorinated analogs yang et al 2014 wagner and plewa 2017 jiang et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 bromide and iodide are naturally present in source waters as precursors of brominated and iodinated dbps zhu and zhang 2016 dong et al 2017 with iodide concentrations typically falling within 10 15 of bromide concentrations simmons et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 bromide can be fast oxidized by chlorine kapp 8 4 102 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 to form hypobromous acid hobr which results in the formation of brominated dbps through reacting with nom deborde and von gunten 2008 whereas clo2 reacts with bromide at a much lower rate constant kapp 0 01 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1994 meanwhile inconsistent results have been reported for the relative formation potential of iodinated dbps during chlorination and clo2 disinfection bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 zhang et al 2015 in studying the disinfection with combined chlorine and clo2 synchronously zhong et al 2019 found that introducing clo2 promoted the incorporation of bromine and iodine into dbp classes such as thms and haas with increasing the bromide concentration from 0 to 100 μg l the mass concentrations of thms haas and haloacetonitriles formed in the combined chlorine and clo2 treatment were significantly enhanced from 18 to 32 24 to 31 and 4 to 8 μg l respectively kim et al 2017 few studies have reported on the formation of dbps during disinfection using clo2 with chlorine impurity hofmann et al 2004 gan et al 2016 hofmann et al 2004 focused on the formation of regulated dbps including thms haas and chlorite and chlorate in clo2 disinfection and reported a significant increase in the concentrations of thms and haas with chlorine impurity ranging from 0 to 20 gan et al 2016 investigated the formation of regulated dbps and some common dbps including chloral hydrate haloketones haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and chlorate in clo2 disinfection with 0 100 chlorine impurity their results indicated that chlorine impurity led to a decreased chlorite level and an increased chlorate level however the impact of chlorine impurity on the brominated and iodinated dbps in clo2 disinfection has remained largely unknown in addition the variations of several classes of dbps may not reflect the effect of chlorine impurity on the overall dbp formation as over 70 of tox remained unidentified for clo2 disinfection zhang et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2007 more importantly the toxicity of clo2 disinfected drinking water may also be affected by chlorine impurity in view of the varied composition of the dbp mixture including chlorinated brominated iodinated organic dbps and inorganic dbps which requires explicit investigation as the presence of a certain level of chlorine impurity takes place spontaneously and concomitantly when a clo2 solution is generated from a clo2 generator the question is whether it is necessary to eliminate the chlorine impurity in a clo2 solution in clo2 disinfection accordingly we aimed to answer this key question in the practical application of clo2 in drinking water disinfection as such the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chlorine impurity on the dbp formation and dbp related toxicity in drinking water disinfection with clo2 additionally the disinfection efficiency of clo2 with chlorine impurity was also inspected 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a clo2 stock solution was prepared using the standard method 4500 clo2 b apha et al 2012 in brief clo2 gas was generated by slowly adding 20 ml of h2so4 10 v v to 500 ml of a 0 5 m naclo2 solution with nitrogen 200 ml min as carrier gas the gaseous clo2 passed through a scrubber containing 600 ml of a saturated naclo2 solution to remove potential impurities followed by being absorbed in ultrapure water to verify its purity six aliquots of the clo2 stock solution were drawn three of them were added with 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the clo2 concentrations in the six aliquots were calibrated using the iodometric method apha et al 2012 as dmso reacts with chlorine but not with clo2 jiang et al 2006 the concentration difference of the aliquots with and without dmso should correspond to the concentration of chlorine impurity with details in text s1 in the supplementary data the clo2 stock solution void of chlorine impurity was stored in headspace free amber glass vials at 4 c a naocl stock solution supplied by allied signal was calibrated using the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 suwannee river nom srnom was obtained from the international humic substances society ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was provided by a water purification system cascada i pall usa other chemicals were reagent grade or higher from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation disinfection and pretreatment of simulated drinking water a simulated raw water sample was prepared by dissolving 3 mg l srnom as c 80 mg l nahco3 as caco3 2 0 mg l nabr as br and 0 20 mg l ki as i in ultrapure water and adjusting to ph 7 5 with 1 0 m hcl and naoh solutions the bromide levels in 13 surface waters in australia ranged from 0 139 to 4 13 mg l magazinovic et al 2004 the iodine levels in major u s canadian and european rivers ranged from 0 5 to 212 µg l moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 the relatively high levels of bromide and iodide were used for better study of brominated and iodinated dbps due to the rising concerns on them prior to disinfection the concentration of clo2 was determined spectrophotometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of 1150 m 1cm 1 at 360 nm hua and reckhow 2007 predetermined volumes of the naocl solution were mixed with the pure clo2 solution to obtain clo2 solutions with chlorine impurity at cl2 clo2 mass ratios of 0 5 10 17 and 25 respectively the simulated raw water was disinfected by dosing 1 5 mg l clo2 containing different levels of chlorine impurity for a 30 min contact time in the dark at room temperature the clo2 dose and contact time were selected following the common practice in drinking water disinfection with clo2 afterward the disinfectant residual was quenched by adding 105 of the stoichiometric amount of 0 1 m na2so3 to stop the disinfection and preclude the effects of the disinfectant residual on the following chemical and toxicological analyses pan et al 2019 kristiana et al 2014 studied the effect of quenching agents on the stability of several classes of dbps and recommended ascorbic acid and sodium sulfite for the analysis of organic and inorganic dbps respectively to select a suitable quenching agent quenching with sodium sulfite or ascorbic acid was conducted for the clo2 disinfected drinking water sample at an intentionally elevated dosage 150 of the stoichiometric amount and a prolonged reaction time 2 h as shown in fig s1 sodium sulfite and ascorbic acid caused no significant difference p 0 05 in the tox or chlorate level while ascorbic acid caused a significant decrease p 0 05 in the chlorite level in addition the sodium sulfite added and the reaction product formed i e sodium sulfate showed no effect on the toxicity bioassay therefore sodium sulfite was used in this study each water sample subjected to toxicity evaluation was pretreated by freeze drying which has been demonstrated to effectively retain both organic and inorganic dbps han and zhang 2018 briefly a 1 l sample aliquot was evenly transferred onto five glass petri dishes diameter 200 mm height 20 mm and prefrozen first at 18 c for 8 h and then at 36 c for 12 h the aliquot was then freeze dried to solid in a lyophilizer fd 1a 50 bilon china the solid concentrates on the five petri dishes were transferred to a 125 ml flask each petri dish was rinsed three times with acetonitrile and ultrapure water and the rinsing solutions were also transferred to the flask and then concentrated to solid following the aforementioned freeze drying procedure the obtained solid concentrate was kept at 4 c until the bioassay it is worth mentioning that because volatile dbps have been reported to contribute marginally to the developmental toxicity and the oxidative stress of dbp mixtures li et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the loss of volatile dbps during the sample pretreatment should not significantly affect the developmental toxicity of the dbp mixtures 2 3 analysis of tox chlorite and chlorate three components of tox i e total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi were determined based on the standard method 5320b apha et al 2012 except that off line ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex usa was used for measuring chloride and bromide abusallout and hua 2016 pan et al 2019 and ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry waters usa was used for measuring iodide gong et al 2018 details are given in text s2 in the tox analysis samples were adjusted to ph 2 before passing through activated carbon columns acidic conditions would allow the formation of clo2 from chlorite and chlorate eqs 1 3 which may affect the measurement of tox and thus 105 of the stoichiometric amount of 0 1 m na2so3 was added before sample acidification to reduce chlorite and chlorate the concentrations of chlorite and chlorate were determined using an ion chromatography system ics 3000 dionex usa in analysis of tox and inorganic dbps all the experimental procedures and analytical measurements were conducted in duplicate 2 4 development of a kinetic model a reaction scheme was proposed for the formation of organic halogenated dbps in clo2 disinfection as shown in fig s2 the reactions involved are shown in table 1 in the simulated drinking water reactions were initialized with clo2 toward nom reactions 1 2 and i reaction 3 nom was assumed to consist of fast reaction sites nomfast and slow reaction sites nomslow westerhoff et al 2004 echigo and minear 2006 the apparent reaction rate constants for clo2 with nomfast and nomslow were obtained from kinetic experiments detailed in text s3 on the decay of clo2 in a bromide iodide free srnom sample 3 mg l srnom as c and 80 mg l nahco3 as caco3 in ultrapure water ph 7 5 in reacting with nom clo2 mainly underwent one electron reduction to form clo2 gan et al 2019 the in situ formation of hocl has been reported in reactions of clo2 with nom and some phenolic compounds wajon et al 1982 rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 a minor portion of clo2 might react with nom to generate organic chlorinated dbps cl dbps accordingly the obtained apparent rate constant for clo2 reacting with nomfast or nomslow comprised three pathways corresponding to the consumption of clo2 by forming clo2 hocl and cl dbps respectively the kinetics of hocl formation from clo2 nom reactions in the srnom sample was determined following the method outlined in rougé et al 2018 and detailed in text s3 the generation of cl dbps from clo2 was verified by comparing the tocl levels in the clo2 treated srnom sample with the absence and presence of 0 4 mm glycine text s4 glycine was used here to distinguish the contributions of clo2 and in situ formed hocl to the formation of cl dbps because glycine can quickly quench hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 but its reaction with clo2 is negligible hoigné and bader 1994 a series of inorganic redox reactions were incorporated into the reaction scheme iodine i2 produced from i oxidation by clo2 reaction 3 equilibrated to form hoi reaction 4 upon the formation of hocl in the simulated drinking water it oxidized br to form hobr bro reaction 5 and oxidized i to form hoi which was further oxidized by hocl clo to form io2 and io3 reactions 6 8 the formed hobr bro also oxidized i io and io2 to generate hoi io io2 and io3 respectively reactions 9 11 hoi and i2 were oxidized by hclo2 clo2 to form io3 reactions 12 14 in addition the oxidation of chlorite by hocl clo or hobr bro led to the production of clo3 and clo2 reactions 15 16 the rate constants for reactions 3 16 were obtained from the literature lengyel et al 1996 bichsel and von gunten 2000 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 epstein and kustin 1985 gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 furman and margerum 1998 hocl clo hobr bro hoi io and i2 may react with nom to generate halogenated dbps via electrophilic substitution or form nonhalogenated oxidation products via electron transfer criquet et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 vikesland et al 2013 which are presented as reactions 17 24 as phenolic structures were considered as the major components in nomfast echigo and minear 2006 zhai et al 2014 the intermediate halogenated dbps generated from fast reactions might also be phenolics which would further react with clo2 reactions 25 27 the auto decomposition of the formed dbps zhang et al 2013 was also incorporated reactions 28 30 the reaction rate constants of hox xo x cl br i with nomfast were determined following a previous study zhu and zhang 2016 in brief the reactivity of hox toward substituted phenolate ions was positively related to their hammett constants σσo p m deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 and the reaction rate constants for hox xo with nomfast corresponded to those with phenolic compounds at σσo p m 0 17 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore the rate constants for hox xo reacting with nomfast were obtained by establishing a hammett type correlation for hox xo with substituted phenols phenolates at ph 7 5 and by assuming σσo p m 0 17 for nomfast table s1 and fig s3 few studies have focused on the species specific reaction kinetics for i2 in studying the iodination of phenolic compounds vikesland et al 2013 found that the reactions of the substituted phenolates with i2 were 100 102 times faster than those with hoi accordingly the reaction rate constant for i2 with nomfast was assumed to be one magnitude higher than that for hoi io with nomfast the rate constants for halogenation of nomslow and transformation of formed dbps were determined by conducting kinetic experiments clo2 dose 1 5 mg l contact times from 1 min to 12 h ph 7 5 with the simulated raw water 2 5 evaluation of the comparative developmental toxicity with platynereis dumerilii a new approach for evaluating the drinking water toxicity was recently developed by combining the freeze drying pretreatment with an in vivo acute bioassay based on the embryos of a cosmopolitan marine polychaete p dumerilii han and zhang 2018 although in vivo acute toxicity bioassays may not mirror health risks directly they are a cost effective approach to revealing the comparative toxicity of individual chemicals or chemical mixtures the bioassay based on the p dumerilii embryos has been successfully applied to the toxicity evaluation of individual dbps and dbp mixtures in drinking water and wastewater effluents yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 due to its good reproducibility and high sensitivity more importantly the polychaete has high salinity tolerance which makes the bioassay compatible with the freeze drying pretreatment han and zhang 2018 the new approach can reflect not only the toxicity contribution from organic dbps but also the toxicity contribution from inorganic dbps including chlorite and chlorate as well as the synergistic effect of organic and inorganic dbps han and zhang 2018 so it was used in this study to assess the comparative developmental toxicity of dbp mixtures in the drinking water samples disinfected with clo2 containing different levels of chlorine impurity stock cultures of the polychaete were maintained and the developmental toxicity bioassay was conducted following previous studies hutchinson et al 1998 yang and zhang 2013 as detailed in text s5 prior to the bioassay toxicity test solutions were prepared by dissolving the solid concentrates of the disinfected samples pretreated with freeze drying to preclude the interferences of salinity and ph on the embryo development the toxicity test solutions were adjusted to salinity of 45 by dissolving the solid concentrates with seawater and ultrapure water and tuned to ph 7 5 0 5 by adding 0 2 m hcl and naoh yang et al 2015 han and zhang 2018 2 6 determination of the disinfection efficiency with escherichia coli the effect of chlorine impurity on the disinfection efficiency of clo2 was evaluated with e coli a commonly used indicator microorganism all the materials for the disinfection efficiency experiments were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min the preparation and enumeration of e coli followed previous studies cho et al 2010 li et al 2017 as described in text s6 disinfection was conducted in a series of disinfectant demand free phosphate buffered saline pbs 150 mm ph 7 4 solutions in the dark at 15 c with an initial e coli atcc 8739 usa concentration of 106 107 colony forming units per ml the e coli strain atcc 8739 is a well characterized standard reference material that has been widely used in studying the disinfection efficiencies and mechanisms of various disinfectants ayyildiz et al 2009 cho et al 2010 moreno andrés et al 2019 to initiate the disinfection 0 2 mg l clo2 0 01 mg l chlorine or 0 2 mg l clo2 mixed with 0 01 mg l chlorine corresponding to clo2 with 5 chlorine impurity was added to a solution containing e coli the disinfection was conducted for a series of contact times 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 s after a given contact time the disinfectant residual was quenched with an excess amount of 0 1 m na2so3 the second order reaction rate constants for sodium sulfite with chlorine and clo2 have been reported to be 2 3 108 m 1s 1 and 7 8 105 m 1s 1 respectively deborde and von gunten 2008 neta et al 1988 so the chlorine and or clo2 residuals should be quenched instantaneously the e coli before and after disinfection was enumerated using a membrane filtration method apha et al 2012 briefly 0 5 ml of the e coli sample was serially diluted 10 fold with pbs each dilution was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane which was then placed onto a petri dish containing a freshly prepared m fc medium becton dickinson co the colony forming units in a statistically meaningful range 20 80 were counted after incubation at 45 c for 24 h each batch of experiments on the disinfection efficiency was conducted in triplicate 2 7 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova at a significance level of 95 was performed to analyze the impact of chlorine impurity on the dbp formation toxicity and disinfection efficacy in clo2 disinfection 3 results and discussion 3 1 tox formation in clo2 disinfection with chlorine impurity fig 1 displays the tox formation in the drinking water treated with clo2 with chlorine impurity with increasing the chlorine impurity the tox level first decreased reached the minimum at 5 chlorine impurity p 0 05 and then increased the tox formation for clo2 with 25 chlorine impurity was 1 73 times that for pure clo2 specifically as the chlorine impurity increased from 0 to 25 the tocl level remained almost stable while the toi level did not change significantly at 0 10 of chlorine impurity p 0 05 and then decreased gradually p 0 05 the tobr level decreased as chlorine impurity varied from 0 to 5 and then increased as the chlorine impurity increased further shifting the speciation of overall halogenated dbps toward more brominated ones suppression of the toi formation with increasing chlorine impurity was mainly due to the competitive reactions of chlorine and clo2 with iodide chlorine can oxidize iodide to form hoi and then to form io3 shortening the half life of hoi for its reaction with nom criquet et al 2012 however the variations of tocl and tobr were unexpected at higher chlorine impurity levels the tocl and tobr levels had been anticipated to grow considering the existence of higher concentrations of hocl clo and hobr bro generated from chlorine reacting with bromide thus a quantitative chemical kinetic model involving the reactions among clo2 chlorine bromide iodide and nom was developed to simulate the formation of the three components of tox and to depict their variation based on the aforementioned assumptions 30 reactions table 1 responsible for the formation of organic halogenated dbps were incorporated into the kinetic model the rate constants for clo2 reacting with nom reactions 1 2 were determined by best fitting of the measured clo2 decay and in situ chlorine formation in the srnom sample at different contact times fig 2 a and the tocl concentrations in the drinking water samples at different contact times without chlorine impurity fig 2b the rate constants for the halogenation of nom via substitution or oxidation and the transformation of organic halogenated dbps reactions 17 30 were determined based on previous studies zhai and zhang 2014 zhu and zhang 2016 and by best fitting of the measured concentrations of tocl tobr and toi in the drinking water samples at different contact times and different chlorine impurity levels fig 2b c the predicted concentrations of clo2 in situ formed hocl and tox at different contact times and chlorine impurity levels were in good agreement with the experimental results with the r2 of 0 86 0 99 for the regressions of the modeled and experimental data fig s4a c the model indicated that in the clo2 disinfection both clo2 and in situ formed chlorine contributed to the formation of cl dbps text s4 fig s5 and i2 from clo2 iodide reactions and hoi io from chlorine iodide reactions bichsel and von gunten 1999 were both responsible for the formation of i dbps in addition br dbps that were reported in clo2 disinfection richardson et al 2003 yang et al 2013 might be accounted for by the in situ formed chlorine there were two sources of chlorine in the clo2 disinfected water sample the chlorine impurity present in the clo2 solution and the in situ formed chlorine from clo2 nom reactions as shown in fig 2a the chlorine formation consists of a fast initial phase followed by a slower phase reaching 4 1 μm at the contact time of 30 min corresponding to 18 of the dosed clo2 which was consistent with the results from rougé et al 2018 with the presence of bromide and iodide chlorine was preferentially consumed by iodide and then by bromide because the reaction of chlorine with iodide kapp 7 3 107 m 1s 1 was substantially faster than that with bromide kapp 8 4 102 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 which was in turn much faster than those with nom kapp nomfast 1 6 102 m 1s 1 kapp nomslow 13 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 in the clo2 disinfected water sample initially with 2 0 mg l 25 μm of bromide and 0 2 mg l 1 6 μm of iodide the total chlorine concentrations with increasing the chlorine impurity and those consumed by different reactions were determined using the kinetic model fig s6 for the samples with 0 25 chlorine impurity the oxidation of bromide 53 76 and iodide 21 46 predominantly accounted for the chlorine consumption and 1 of chlorine was converted to cl dbps therefore the increase in total chlorine concentration did not cause a significant tocl increment at 5 chlorine impurity i e 1 1 μm chlorine from the impure clo2 solution was totally consumed by iodide initial concentration at 1 6 μm rendering no hobr bro enhancement from the chlorine impurity however this could not fully account for the decrease of tobr at a relatively low level of chlorine impurity for pure clo2 disinfection most of the iodide was initially oxidized to i2 by clo2 with chlorine impurity iodide was primarily converted to hoi io by chlorine because the oxidation rate constant of iodide by chlorine was markedly higher than that by clo2 kapp 6 0 103 m 1s 1 lengyel et al 1996 i2 and hoi io might behave differently when reacting with nom despite their equilibrium it has been reported that electron transfer was the principal pathway for reactions of hoi io with nom as the majority of hoi io was reduced to iodide zhao et al 2017 the formed iodide was quickly re oxidized to hoi io by chlorine formed from clo2 nom reactions thus suppressing hobr bro and subsequent tobr formation from the in situ produced chlorine further increasing the chlorine impurity level past the initial iodide molar concentration promoted the formation of hobr bro and resulted in the gradual increase of the tobr level 3 2 effect of chlorine impurity on the formation of inorganic dbps in clo2 disinfection chlorite and chlorate are principal inorganic dbps of concern in clo2 disinfection at the 30 min contact time 65 and 6 of the dosed clo2 were converted to chlorite and chlorate respectively in the absence of chlorine impurity fig 3 which agreed with previously reported conversion ratios of 30 70 to chlorite and 0 10 to chlorate gates et al 2009 al otoum et al 2016 with chlorine impurity less chlorite but more chlorate were formed compared with those in the pure clo2 disinfected sample it has been reported that in clo2 reactions with humic substances the amount of electron donating moieties was correlated with the formation of chlorite gan et al 2019 the bromine and iodine produced from chlorine impurity tended to compete with clo2 in reacting with nom and lead to nom oxidation thus lowering the concentration of precursors for chlorite besides chlorine and bromine have been reported to oxidize chlorite to form clo2 and chlorate reactions 15 16 gordon and tachiyashiki 1991 furman and margerum 1998 as chlorine impurity increased from 0 to 25 the chlorite concentration decreased from 0 98 to 0 82 mg l corresponding to a 17 reduction in contrast the chlorate concentration increased from 0 11 to 0 16 mg l corresponding to a 46 increase the chlorite reduction was more significant than that reported in gan et al 2016 which indicated a 7 chlorite reduction with 20 chlorine impurity for a 45 min contact time the enhanced chlorite reduction might be accounted for by the presence of bromide and iodide in the water sample as shown in fig s7 the chlorite formation was well simulated by the developed model with the r2 value of 0 98 for the regression of the modeled and measured concentrations according to the model at the chlorine impurity of 25 the chlorite reduction with the presence of 2 0 mg l bromide and 0 2 mg l iodide was 3 2 times of that without bromide and iodide in the competition with clo2 to react with nom the reaction rate constants for bromine and iodine were significantly larger than those for chlorine table 1 in addition the reactions of bromine with chlorite were 1 2 orders of magnitude faster than those of chlorine with chlorite furman and margerum 1998 for the variation of chlorate it needs mentioning that due to the disproportionation of chlorine chlorate was present in the naocl stock solution and was introduced therewith to the water sample pan et al 2014 therefore the chlorate formation in the impure clo2 disinfection was obtained by subtracting the chlorate caused by the naocl stock solution from the corresponding measured concentrations fig s8 3 3 effect of chlorine impurity on the developmental toxicity of the clo2 disinfected sample figs 4 and s9 show the exposure response of the drinking water samples against the development of two batches of p dumerilii embryos table s2 lists the corresponding ec50 values i e the sample concentration factor at which point the normal development percentage was half of that in the seawater control and the r2 values for the regression analysis for the two batches of bioassays the comparative developmental toxicity was consistent for the samples with different chlorine impurity levels and the obtained ec50 values showed good reproducibility for the samples with the same chlorine impurity level compared with the pure clo2 disinfected sample the formation of organic and inorganic dbps decreased in the 5 chlorine impurity sample with significant reductions in tobr and chlorite levels and insignificant variations in tocl toi and chlorate levels in accordance with the dbp formation the developmental toxicity decreased p 0 05 with increasing the chlorine impurity to 5 further increasing the chlorine impurity caused the toxicity to increase but the toxicity was not markedly higher than that for pure clo2 disinfection until the chlorine impurity reached 25 at which the developmental toxicity increased by 49 on average the toxicity results indicated that relatively low levels of chlorine impurity in clo2 might not raise health concerns over clo2 disinfected drinking water instead it might reduce the toxicity somewhat however relatively high levels of chlorine impurity e g 25 in clo2 might induce markedly higher toxicity than pure clo2 3 4 effect of chlorine impurity on the disinfection efficiency of clo2 through plotting the log of e coli survival percentage against the contact time with disinfectants the e coli inactivation by clo2 chlorine at the cl2 clo2 mass ratio of 5 corresponding to the chlorine impurity and their mixture is presented in figs 5 and s10 the effect of chlorine impurity at 5 on the disinfection efficiency of clo2 was investigated as it was found to be favorable in controlling dbp formation and toxicity the time dependent inactivation curves followed chick s law with an initial lag phase the lag phase reflected that damages to the bacterial cells caused by disinfectants needed to accumulate before the cell death hosni et al 2011 and this also accounted for the stable survival ratio for exposure to chlorine alone according to chick s law the disinfection rate constants were determined to be 4 8 4 2 and 0 1 min 1 for clo2 with 5 chlorine impurity clo2 alone and chlorine alone fig 5 respectively the results suggested a synergistic effect of clo2 and chlorine in inactivating e coli similar results were obtained from another batch of experiments on the disinfection efficiency fig s10 the synergy might be due to their different inactivation mechanisms cho et al 2010 reported that e coli inactivation by chlorine was primarily related to the damage of intracellular components while clo2 resulted in less intracellular component damage but more significant cell surface damage by applying the chlorine containing clo2 the cell surface damage caused by clo2 might facilitate the penetration of chlorine into the cell and thus promote the interaction between chlorine and intracellular components resulting in the enhanced disinfection efficiency in addition upon the reduction of clo2 to chlorite during disinfection clo2 might be re generated from the reaction of chlorine with chlorite reaction 15 as clo2 was more effective than chlorine in the e coli inactivation at ph 7 4 cho et al 2010 the disinfection efficiency for mixed clo2 and chlorine should be higher than the summation of their individual efficiencies similar synergy resulting from the co exposure of clo2 and chlorine has also been reported in the inactivation of bacillus subtilis spores hofmann et al 2004 son et al 2005 4 conclusions the dbp formation and developmental toxicity were studied for the drinking water that was disinfected by clo2 with chlorine impurity from the clo2 generation process with increasing the chlorine impurity from 0 to 25 gradually decreasing chlorite and increasing chlorate levels were observed meantime it was unexpectedly found that tox and developmental toxicity first decreased and then increased and both reached their minimum levels at around 5 chlorine impurity disinfection with chlorine containing clo2 is a complex yet interesting process with two sources of chlorine i e chlorine impurity from clo2 generation and in situ formed chlorine from clo2 nom reactions and with the generation of both hoi and i2 by developing a kinetic model for the formation of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps in clo2 disinfected drinking water the mechanisms for the variations of tox and developmental toxicity were revealed in addition a synergistic effect was identified in the e coli inactivation by clo2 and chlorine even if the chlorine concentration was only 5 of the clo2 concentration the results indicated that for the disinfection with clo2 the presence of low levels of chlorine impurity e g 10 was beneficial with regard to both disinfection efficiency and control of dbps and toxicity and extra expenditure to purify the clo2 solution was not necessary meanwhile measures should be taken by water utilities once the chlorine impurity reaches a relatively high level e g 25 in the generated clo2 solution as it may cause increased dbp formation and drinking water toxicity further studies may also be needed to examine the effect of chlorine impurity on the clo2 disinfection of different source waters and to test the applicability of the kinetic model to different source water characteristics declaration of

17428,lake erie harmful algal blooms and hypoxia are two major environmental problems and have severe impacts on human health aquatic ecosystems and the economy however little is known about internal loading of phosphorus p from sediments which pose a challenge for assessing the efficacy of current conservation measures on the improvement of lake water quality a modified hedley s extraction procedure was employed to analyze representative sediment samples collected from the lake erie basin for assessing sedimentary p stock potential availability for release into lake water and internal p loading inorganic and organic p in the sediments were characterized by sequential extractions in h2o 0 5 m nahco3 0 1 m naoh and 1 0 m hcl respectively in the 0 10 cm sediment total p stock was 172 191 and 170 metric tons km 2 in the western central and eastern basins respectively sedimentary p seems unlikely to contribute to internal p loading in the western basin while in the eastern basin it can potentially contribute to an internal loading of 359 metric tons p yr 1 in the central basin 41 of organic p 15 of non hcl extractable inorganic p and 9 7 of residual p in the 0 10 cm sediment is potentially available for release into lake water in the 10 20 cm sediment organic p extracted by nahco3 and naoh is also partially available the central basin potentially contributes to internal p loading at a total amount of 10 599 metric tons yr 1 internal p loading may not contribute to habs in the western basin but it can cause and maintain hypoxia in the central basin and delay the recovery of lake water quality for a lengthy time period in response to external p reduction measures keywords surface water quality lake sediment phosphorus loads lake erie internal phosphorus loading 1 introduction in the 1960s and 1970s lake erie experienced extensive cyanobacterial blooms episodically reducing dissolved oxygen and killing fish in the lake the blooms were mainly a consequence of excessive external phosphorus p loading from point sources and agricultural runoff discharge matisoff et al 2016 in response an external p load reduction program was implemented through the great lakes water quality agreement in 1972 and lake conditions had improved considerably by the mid 1980s daloğlu et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 in the mid 1990s however cyanobacterial blooms reappeared in the lake and have become increasingly extensive and frequent since then despite continuing success in achieving the target total p tp loading in most of the years maccoux et al 2016 harmful algal blooms habs pose significant risks to drinking water supplies quality of human life and economic vitality in 2014 for example toxins from lake erie habs resulted in a two day do not drink advisory to approximately half a million local residents in toledo ohio wynne and stumpf 2015 to improve lake erie water quality and reduce the public health risks the governments of canada and the united states have committed to a further 40 reduction in external tp and dissolved reactive p drp loads reaching lake erie from the maumee river and other priority tributaries usepa 2016 internal p loading may contribute to the total quantity of p delivered to the lake water column and thus retard the recovery of lake water quality penn et al 1995 evidence suggests that sediment p regeneration does occur in lake erie for example burns 1976 observed a dramatic increase in drp concentration in the hypolimnion waters of the central basin cb of lake erie when the waters became anoxic a recent study on oxygen isotopic sources of dissolved p in lake erie suggested that previously deposited p may indeed be released from sediments of cb when hypolimnetic hypoxia occurs during the period of summer stratification elsbery et al 2009 matisoff et al 2016 observed large variations in the diffusive flux of p from bottom sediments in the western basin wb of lake erie when using sediment incubation pore water concentration profile and bottom chamber methods they suggested that internal diffusive recycling of p in the wb is unlikely to trigger habs by itself in the cb internal p loading may amount to 8 20 of the total external input of p to lake erie in the sediment incubation and the pore water concentration profile studies paytan et al 2017 meanwhile matisoff et al 2016 and paytan et al 2017 also discussed the limitations of their measurement methods such as ignoring some important processes e g bioturbation by macro bentric fauna involved in the internal loading of p and great challenges of simulating lake bottom environment during the incubations in order to better estimate internal p loading in the lake one needs to directly characterize the forms of sedimentary p and assess the on site potential for releasing dissolved p into the water column forms of p in the sediments of lake erie and their nature and origins were discussed by williams et al 1976a and 1976b in the 1970s specifically sedimentary p was categorized into inorganic p pi such as apatite pi and non apatite pi napi and organic p po apatite p is of detrital sedimental rock origin and mainly derived from eroding bluffs along the north shore of the cb while both napi and po are of anthropogenic origin and can be potentially released into overlying water thereby contributing to habs pennuto et al 2014 further reported that total p concentrations in surficial sediments increased from nearshore to offshore in lake erie to our knowledge in the last four decades no further studies have been conducted to update or improve our complete understanding on sedimentary p cycling as well as to quantify the forms of sedimentary p with respect to their availability for algal growth in the lake erie filling this knowledge gap is critical for quantifying sediment p regeneration to the water column given a shift in the prevalence of p inputs from point sources to diffuse sources the recent resurgence of habs in the wb and expansion of the hypoxic zone in the cb and other changing lake conditions e g colonization by invasive dreissenid mussels and blooms of cladophora sp associated with nutrient deposition from four decades ago watson et al 2016 a modified hedley s sequential extraction procedure is widely used to separate p in soils into several fractions associated with plant availability and the chemical nature of p zhang and mackenzie 1997 compared to other sequential extraction schemes the hedley s one not only measures pi but also po considering that po plays an important role in sediment p cycling zhu et al 2013 the hedley s procedure was employed in our study to quantify sedimentary p and assess p availability for release into lake water to our knowledge this study is the first time to apply the hedley s procedure to sedimentary p cycling research of lake erie it not only provides a research tool for sedimentary p measurements but also helps better understand the nature and cycling of sedimentary p of lake erie the objectives of this study were to estimate i pi and po forms and their respective quantities in surficial lake sediments ii spatial distribution of each sediment p form in the 0 10 cm sediment of the lake erie basin iii vertical distribution of various p forms in the sediment profile and iv internal p loading in the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling in 2010 a total of 37 sites were successfully sampled for sediment cores across the lake erie basin fig 1 and table a 1 all these sampling sites are located in the areas of soft substrates according to the map of lake erie substrate types haltuch and berkman 1999 and happened to be offshore we could not collect any sediment samples in the areas of hard substrates due to the inability of the box corer to penetrate into the sediment as shown in fig 3 many nearshore areas belong to hard substrates which makes it unsuccessful to collect sediment samples from nearshore areas each soft sediment core was then split into 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm sections for chemical analysis a modified hedley s p fraction procedure was used to separate sedimentary p into eight different p fractions including h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po hcl pi and residue p the details on sediment sampling sample preparations and chemical analysis can be found in appendix a 2 2 analysis of variance and p stock and release calculations as mentioned above we could not collect hard sediment samples moreover hard substrates are unlikely to sequester p to any large extent therefore we assumed that p stock is low or nearly zero in hard substrates which were then excluded from our calculations of spatial distributions of sedimentary p n and c concentrations p stock and internal p loading in the current study regarding the details on data analysis p stock and release potential calculations and internal p loading determinations please see appendix a where the rationales for estimating internal p loading are also discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of p among sequentially extracted p fractions in the 0 10 cm sediment in surface sediments 0 10 cm tp concentrations ranged between 498 and 1180 mg kg 1 with a mean sd of 889 152 mg kg 1 fig 2 n 37 which were reasonably consistent with those previously reported in surficial sediment of nearshore lake erie 450 750 mg tp kg 1 pennuto et al 2014 williams et al 1976a reported a larger variation 188 2863 mg kg 1 in tp concentration in 48 surficial sediment samples from this lake however 90 of those samples fell within the range of 463 1387 mg kg 1 similar to the range found in the present study among the eight p fractions extracted i e h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po hcl and residual p the least pi 0 8 20 9 mg kg 1 0 1 2 3 of tp and po 0 7 5 0 mg kg 1 0 1 0 5 of tp were those extracted by deionized water these data are consistent with previous reports that h2o pi accounted for 3 of tp in the sediments collected from 44 european north american and chinese lakes zhu et al 2013 kopáček et al 2005 sedimentary nahco3 pi and po ranged between 7 159 mg kg 1 and between 0 27 mg kg 1 respectively accounting for 0 9 14 3 and 0 2 6 respectively of tp in the sediments the naoh pi fraction accounted for 0 8 20 4 of tp with concentrations ranging between 6 241 mg kg 1 compared with the h2o and nahco3 extractants the 0 1 m naoh solution extracted more po 6 129 mg kg 1 thereby accounting for 0 8 13 0 of tp the hcl pi ranging between 367 807 mg kg 1 was the most abundant p form in lake erie sediments accounting for on average 57 of tp in sediment the second most dominant p form was residual p accounting for 7 9 23 2 of tp in sediment despite the dominance of hcl pi in sediment tp no significant correlation was found between tp and hcl pi in comparison the remaining p fractions were all significantly correlated with tp in sediment r 0 34 0 84 p 0 05 data not shown even though some of the fractions only accounted for very small percentages of tp this indicates that the variations in the quantity of tp among sites are mainly caused by non hcl pi fractions i e h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po and residual p which is understandable considering that hcl pi is of natural origin and is inert leading to its relatively uniform distribution in space and time williams et al 1976b the hcl pi would not contribute much to availability of sediment p to phytoplankton due to its very low solubility burns 1976 3 2 spatial distribution of various p fractions in the 0 10 cm sediment spatial distribution of sedimentary p 0 10 cm varied with respect to p fractions and none of the fractions were distributed uniformly across the lake fig 3 on average h2o pi was the lowest in the cb mean sd of 3 2 1 2 mg kg 1 followed by the eb 7 2 5 7 mg kg 1 with the highest in the wb 8 3 5 7 mg kg 1 sedimentary h2o pi was mainly concentrated in the western portion of wb and the area surrounding ottawa county ohio including the sandusky basin and the southeast portion of the wb the high h2o pi concentrations observed in these locations reflect the fact that these areas receive about 80 of annual external p loading to the lake scavia et al 2014 however external p loading data fail to explain high h2o pi concentrations in the sediment of the eastern basin eb because this basin only receives about 10 of p loading to the lake scavia et al 2014 to the east southeast of long point high p concentrations were not only observed for the h2o pi fraction but also for all the remaining p fractions except for hcl pi the deepest region of the lake i e eb experiences the longest period of annual stratification and has high p concentrations probably because the hypolimnial water is always well oxygenated and the thermocline prevents water exchange between the epilimnion and hypolimnion locking the p in the sediment williams et al 1976b mortimer 1987 in addition surficial water flow from west to east dominates in the lake and some suspended particles containing p eventually reach eb through sediment suspension resettling cycles and gradually accumulate in the deeper areas therefore concentrated p in eb east southeast of long point could be due to the long term accumulation of p in the area patterson et al 2005 observed that the northeast nearshore of long point had the highest dreissena density and dry tissue mass in all of lake erie therefore high h2o pi and po concentrations in the northeast nearshore of long point in eb may have been due to abundant dreissenid mussels in the area which are able to remove suspended particles from the water column and release dissolved nutrients into the water column or deposited them on the nearshore lake bottom hecky et al 2004 comparing the present study with that of patterson et al 2005 shows that areas of high h2o pi generally correspond to locations where mean density and dry tissue mass of dreissena are high such an explanation for high h2o pi observed in the northeast nearshore of long point is also supported by the measurements of nitrogen n isotope δ15n signatures in suspended particulate matter in lake erie upsdell 2005 particulate n observed in the northeast nearshore of long point did not come from any other part of the lake but was most likely produced through nutrient recycling of n by dreissenid mussels we speculate that the same mechanism also applies to the observed h2o pi in this study both nahco3 pi and naoh pi exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns with high concentrations occurring in the wb and the middle part of the cb particularly along the southern shore in our view such p distribution patterns mainly reflect the combined effects of external p loading and the lake circulation patterns usdoi 1968 usepa 1984 maumee river water contributing 39 of tp loading to the lake erie and the associated particles primarily flow from west to east along the southern shore and eventually enter the cb through the middle south channels michalak et al 2013 scavia et al 2014 the sandusky river accounting for 11 of tp loading to the lake contributes the majority of sediment p in the sandusky basin and enters the lake at the southwestern corner of the cb scavia et al 2014 the detroit river water carrying almost 23 of tp loading to lake erie enters the lake at the northwestern corner michalak et al 2013 however this river contributes 90 of the water inflow to the lake which suggests that the p in the detroit river may not contribute as much to sedimentary p concentration as do the maumee and sandusky rivers in the cb both the prevailing southwest winds and the earth s rotation generate currents that cause a geostrophic transport of water toward the south shore probably causing significant p deposition into the sediment along the southern shore usepa 1984 compared with other p fractions hcl pi exhibited a unique spatial distribution pattern high concentrations along the northern shore of both the northeastern cb and the western eb including the embayment north of long point fig 3 according to kemp et al 1976 and williams et al 1976b hcl pi is mostly derived from the sediment through shoreline erosion 83 of which occurs from the bluffs along the north shore of the cb between erieau and long point it was reported that hcl pi apatite p averaged 545 mg kg 1 in 14 bluff samples collected from the north shore of lake erie accounting for about 95 of tp williams et al 1976b therefore surface transport of water and suspended particles toward the southeast subsurface transport of re suspended fine materials and upwelling adjacent to the north shore may collectively create the observed distribution pattern of sedimentary hcl pi usepa 1984 usdoi 1968 overall various po fractions e g h2o po nahco3 po and naoh po and residual p also predominated in po were all concentrated in the middle part of the cb east southeast of long point in the eb and southern part of the wb except for nahco3 po which was concentrated in the middle part of the cb the similarities reflect one or more common mechanisms controlling spatial distribution of po significant linear correlations were observed between organic c concentration and h2o po nahco3 po naoh po and residual p p 0 0001 data not shown furthermore these p fractions were also linearly related with total n in sediments p 0 0001 data not shown in fact linear relationships have been widely reported between organic c and po in lake sediments williams et al 1976a bostan et al 2000 similarly kemp and mudrochova 1972 reported that 90 of total n in sediments collected from a lake ontario sediment core was in an organic form these results suggest that organic n and p are integral components of the organic matter of the lake sediments thus it is not surprising to find similar spatial distribution patterns for organic c total n and po and residual p fig 3 and fig a 1 the measured c n ratio values ranged between 5 7 and 14 5 in our study with a median value of 9 8 fig 4 generally c n ratios are directly related to the sources of p and organic matter in lake systems kemp et al 1977 thomas et al 1991 the reported range of c n ratio is about 5 8 for freshwater phytoplankton kendall et al 2001 14 20 for aquatic macrophytes kemp et al 1977 20 546 for vascular land plants meyers and ishiwatari 1993 and generally greater than 16 for glacial materials kemp et al 1977 in our study the cb had lower c n ratios particularly in the middle of the basin fig 4 it seems that high po and residual p in the cb were primarily derived from autochthonous phytoplankton derived organic matter it is widely recognized that the wb is richer in phytoplankton than the cb and eb due to shallow waters and its major tributaries supplying nutrients allinger and reavie 2013 thus high organic and residual p along with low c n ratios in the cb suggests that suspended particles in the lake are rich in autochthonous organic matter and associated p can be transported from west to east in the lake which is consistent with a net eastward movement of water current in the lake usepa 1984 zhou et al 2015 one previous study did show that suspended particulate matter in lake erie had c n ratios of 4 7 6 9 and was primarily derived from plankton upsdell 2005 in addition shinohara et al 2012 and bostan et al 2000 reported that po accounted for significantly higher proportions of tp in suspended particles than in lake sediment our results agree with kemp et al 1977 who reported that the biggest cluster of high c n ratios of lake erie was located in the wb particularly in the area close to the mouth of the detroit river kemp et al 1977 also found that these high c n ratios in the wb were similar to those measured for the lake st clair which has a shallow water depth and a large standing crop of macrophytes therefore they suggested that the suspended materials from lake st clair are the most significant source of sediment in the wb on average the c n ratios were higher in the eb than those in the cb fig 4 it seems that the shallows created by the pennsylvania ridge which separates the two basins interrupts the continuing pattern of decreasing c n ratio from west to east this could be the case if sediment composed of plankton sources mostly settles in the cb which is possible considering that transport velocities decrease when the flow enters the wide cb the ridge may become a barrier for plankton sources p in the cb sediments to be transported to the eb the lower primary productivity in the eb and high water transparency promote the nearshore growth of macrophytes cladophora sp which derive major sources of the sediment p from the grand river valipour et al 2016 and are less related to the wb and cb the relatively steep slope and sediment resuspension cycling could transport suspended particles to settle down in the areas at the deeper end of the basin de march 1978 causing higher organic sedimentary p in these areas the areas with high po and residual p in the cb and eb overall are deep water 3 3 vertical distribution of p in sediment cores vertical distribution of sedimentary p varied among p fractions and basins table 1 in the wb we found no significant difference in the concentration of each p form among the vertical layers in the eb the only significant difference in p concentration occurred for h2o pi between 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm sections in the cb in contrast significant differences in p concentrations were observed between 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm for all p fractions except for naoh pi and hcl pi and between 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm for nahco3 po and naoh po fractions our data suggest that p deposited in the cb was more algal available than that in the eb and wb table 1 there was a decreasing trend in h2o pi concentration with depth from 0 to 20 cm in the eb but the percentage i e 38 of potential available h2o pi in total h2o pi was less than that i e 67 in the cb in particular the cb was characterized as having higher po concentrations in sediments ascribed to a large load of organic debris from phytoplankton generally po concentration declines with depth below the sediment surface due to mineralization of po shinohara et al 2012 ahlgren et al 2011 ahlgren et al 2005 joshi et al 2015 half life times of monoester p diester p and pyrophosphates were estimated to be about 23 21 and 13 y respectively ahlgren et al 2005 summer hypoxia occurs annually in the bottom of the cb and oxygen depletion rates have recently increased due to anthropogenic factors zhou et al 2013 which would further promote p release in the cb hupfer et al 2007 oscillating redox conditions caused by the recurrent presence and absence of oxygen favour the growth of some microorganisms in the surficial sediments hupfer et al 2007 these microorganisms can take up p in excess and store it intracellularly in the form of polyphosphate under oxic conditions and potentially release it into the overlying water under anoxic stress hupfer et al 2007 polyphosphate was estimated to account for up to 10 of tp in the uppermost sediment layer hupfer et al 2007 overall higher availability of sediment p with the cb is consistent with the observation that the hypolimnetic waters of the cb showed a dramatic increase in the concentration of drp when the waters became anoxic burns 1976 as expected h2o pi was the most available p fraction in the sediment 67 and 38 of this form in the 0 10 cm stratum was potentially available in the cb and eb respectively compared to that in the 10 20 cm depth table 1 however the h2o pi fraction is unlikely an important contributor to internal p loading due to its low concentration in comparison only 36 of the nahco3 pi fraction in the cb is potentially algal available but it can contribute 29 2 mg p kg 1 sediment to internal p loading about 13 times more than that with h2o pi across the three basins of the lake no significant differences in h2o pi and nahco3 pi concentration were found between 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depths indicating that both p fractions reach stable or equilibrium conditions at the 10 20 cm depth and below and will be permanently sequestered in the deep sediment regarding hcl pi it is expected to observe largely identical p concentrations in the sediment profile considering its natural origin inert nature and few temporal changes in the processes governing apatite sedimentation in lake erie williams et al 1976b our study confirms that the biogeochemical cycling of organic p plays an important role in p release into the overlying water contributing to the eutrophic status of lakes zhu et al 2013 in the 0 10 cm sediment stratum of cb 34 of h2o po 34 of nahco3 po and 18 of naoh po can be potentially released to the overlying water furthermore small proportions of nahco3 po and naoh po i e 25 and 27 respectively in the 10 20 cm depth stratum are also potentially available nevertheless it seems that both nahco3 po and naoh po can become a long term source for p release this may be related to the concentrations of various po species in each p fraction labile monoester diester phytate like p and some unknown po are present in each p fraction zhu et al 2013 however compared with the h2o po fraction the latter two po fractions contain much more phytate like p approximately 5 10 times more and unknown po species 16 20 times which are relatively refractory in the sediment zhu et al 2013 according to eq a 5 about 51 of nahco3 po and 40 of naoh po in the 0 10 cm sediment stratum can be potentially algal available similarly ahlgren et al 2005 reported that 50 60 of po contained in lake sediments was degraded and eventually released to the water column residual p in agricultural soils is generally believed to be recalcitrant and unavailable for plant uptake hedley et al 1982 however our results indicate that 9 7 of residual p in the 0 10 cm layer of sediment is potentially available for transformation and subsequent release to the bottom water søndergaard et al 1996 also found a similar proportion of the residual p in sediment could eventually become algal available 3 4 sedimentary p stocks and release and internal p loading based on the results of the present study a conceptual scheme to explain sedimentary p stocks and release to the water column of lake erie was developed fig 5 briefly the tp stock in the surficial lake sediment 0 10 cm consisting of i po i e h2o po nahco3 po and naoh po ii non hcl pi i e h2o pi nahco3 pi and naoh pi iii residual p and iv hcl pi were 197 219 and 195 metric tons km 2 in wb cb and eb respectively the potential availability of sedimentary p in the 0 10 cm sediment for release to the water column varies with basin and p fractions in the wb all sediment p fractions remain stable or in an equilibrium status while in the eb only 2 4 of non hcl pi can be released into the overlying water over time potentially contributing to the internal p loading of 359 metric tons yr 1 in the cb 41 15 and 9 7 of po non hcl pi and residual p respectively would be potentially released into the overlying water over time contributing to internal p loading of a total of 8232 metric tons yr 1 in the 0 10 cm sediment according to eq a 4 and eq a 14 in the cb the tp stock was 201 metric tons km 2 in the 10 20 cm sediment among all the measured p fractions only nahco3 po and naoh po are potentially available for release into the overlying water in this deeper sediment layer contributing to the internal p loading of 2367 metric tons yr 1 according to eq a 15 in the cb the 0 10 cm sediment overall contributes 78 of the p released from the sediment while the remaining 22 comes from the older sediment layer i e 10 20 cm these results are consistent with a report that for two swiss glacial lakes the top sediment layer deposited over the last 10 years accounted for 60 80 of the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate in the sediments while sediments older than 10 years contributed only 20 43 to sediment based mineralization rate matzinger et al 2010 according to eq a 16 lake erie may receive the internal p loading of up to 10 958 metric tons yr 1 across the three basins approximately equal to the whole lake target external p load of 11 000 metric tons yr 1 similarly nürnberg and lazerte 2016 reported that internal p load was about 0 75 1 3 times the external p load in lake winnipeg manitoba between 1999 and 2012 in lake simcoe ontario internal p load was estimated to be 45 89 of the external load nürnberg et al 2013 our internal p load estimate for the cb is higher than that 2400 metric tons yr 1 paytan et al 2017 measured in the cb using sediment core incubation experiments one of the major reasons for this discrepancy is that the core incubations accounted only for diffusive p flux in the internal p load estimate ignoring bioturbation by macro bentric fauna paytan et al 2017 in fact p flux from the sediments due to hexagenia sp may be greater than diffusive p flux chaffin and kane 2010 paytan et al 2017 in comparison our approach to estimate internal p loading does not distinguish specific individual processes e g diffusive p flux and bioturbation through which sedimentary p can be released into the overlying water instead it highlights a common consequence of all the p release processes which would lead to decreased p concentrations of the sediment as long as sedimentary p release actually occurs another reason is that paytan et al 2017 performed the core incubations at 7 c which is below the bottom water temperature of 9 18 c observed in the cb between june and october a key period of p release into lake water due to summer hypoxia schertzer et al 1987 in general the p release rate increased with increasing incubation temperature when the temperature was below 7 c p release was low or even below zero holdren and armstrong 1980 in addition paytan et al 2017 pointed out that the concentration of the overlying water increased over time during the core incubations reducing the concentration gradient and then the p flux in our study we did not measure a detectable p release from the sediment in the wb in comparison matisoff et al 2016 reported that the wb contributes to the internal p loads of 378 808 metric tons yr 1 3 7 of the 11 000 metric tons yr 1 target load for p delivery to lake erie from external sources however they pointed out that they might have overestimated the annual p fluxes because their measurements were conducted during the warmer time of the year our internal p load estimate shows that internal loading must be an important source of p in lake erie since 1980s external p loading has remained below the p reduction target in most years however tp concentration in the cb water increased with time despite irregular temporal pattern of external p loading scavia et al 2014 in our view internal p loads may contribute to the increases in lake water tp concentration in the cb large amount of internal p loads may have different impacts on habs in the wb and hypoxia in the cb compared with the majority of external p load entering the wb internal p loading occurs in the cb after the p is moved up to the upper water column due to fall overturn it would then move from west to east through the water flow therefore internal p loads in the cb may not have much chance of entering the wb and contributing to habs it is reported that habs are more likely triggered by relatively short term loads of immediately available p in the wb scavia et al 2014 thus a good control of external p loads delivered to the wb would be a key to the prevention control and mitigation of habs however the recovery of western basin water quality may be delayed due to legacy p agricultural practice changes climate change etc sharpley et al 2013 michalak et al 2013 scavia et al 2014 both hypoxic area and days are positively related to annual external p loads delivered to the wb and cb rucinski et al 2014 in order to combat the growing threat of hypoxia the annex 4 committee of the 2012 great lakes water quality agreement set updated p load reduction targets of 40 entering the wb and cb to achieve 6000 metric tons p loads yr 1 delivered into the cb according to our estimate 10 599 metric tons p yr 1 of internal p loads for the cb it may take many years to see the desired responses of lake water body even if the updated reduction target can be met by implementing appropriate p reduction measures in the cb habs are also often detected by satellites in the offshore waters but currently they are not severe environmental concerns due to short durations and limited sizes chaffin et al 2019 one may ask a question why large amount of internal p loads in the cb can not cause large habs in the cb and eb which can be explained by the following two reasons one is the p dilution effect as that the cb and eb combine to account for over 95 of water volume of the lake and hold 18 times as much water as the wb the other is that the water in the cb and eb is too cold for developing habs in most areas schertzer et al 1987 ralston et al 2014 many climate change scenarios indicate that lake erie area will become warmer due to climate change which may further increase internal p loading gibbons and bridgeman 2020 moreover lake water temperatures are expected to increase more rapidly than air temperature due to decreased ice cover gibbons and bridgeman 2020 which suggests that lake water will become more favorable rapidly for developing habs in the cb and eb therefore habs may become worsening in the cb and even eb if external p loads entering the lake is not well controlled and continue to deposit large amount of p in the sediment 4 conclusions the hedley s sequential extraction procedure was successfully used to separate sedimentary p into h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po hcl pi and residual p our study was the first time to completely determine the potential availability of each p form for release into overlying water in the wb cb and eb and based on the results to calculate internal p loads of each basin from the sediment the tp stock is 197 219 and 195 metric tons km 2 in the 0 10 cm sediment of the wb cb and eb respectively internal p loads from the 0 10 cm sediment could total 8 232 and 359 metric tons yr 1 in the cb and eb respectively while the 0 10 cm sediment unlikely release detectable p into the overlying water in the wb in the 10 20 cm sediment the tp stock of the cb is 201 metric tons km 2 and likely contributes to internal p loads of 2 367 metric tons yr 1 mainly deriving from nahco3 po and naoh po internal p loads from the sediment unlikely contributes to habs in the wb but it may cause and maintain hypoxia in the cb and delay the recovery of water body quality for a lengthy time period in response to external p reduction measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17428,lake erie harmful algal blooms and hypoxia are two major environmental problems and have severe impacts on human health aquatic ecosystems and the economy however little is known about internal loading of phosphorus p from sediments which pose a challenge for assessing the efficacy of current conservation measures on the improvement of lake water quality a modified hedley s extraction procedure was employed to analyze representative sediment samples collected from the lake erie basin for assessing sedimentary p stock potential availability for release into lake water and internal p loading inorganic and organic p in the sediments were characterized by sequential extractions in h2o 0 5 m nahco3 0 1 m naoh and 1 0 m hcl respectively in the 0 10 cm sediment total p stock was 172 191 and 170 metric tons km 2 in the western central and eastern basins respectively sedimentary p seems unlikely to contribute to internal p loading in the western basin while in the eastern basin it can potentially contribute to an internal loading of 359 metric tons p yr 1 in the central basin 41 of organic p 15 of non hcl extractable inorganic p and 9 7 of residual p in the 0 10 cm sediment is potentially available for release into lake water in the 10 20 cm sediment organic p extracted by nahco3 and naoh is also partially available the central basin potentially contributes to internal p loading at a total amount of 10 599 metric tons yr 1 internal p loading may not contribute to habs in the western basin but it can cause and maintain hypoxia in the central basin and delay the recovery of lake water quality for a lengthy time period in response to external p reduction measures keywords surface water quality lake sediment phosphorus loads lake erie internal phosphorus loading 1 introduction in the 1960s and 1970s lake erie experienced extensive cyanobacterial blooms episodically reducing dissolved oxygen and killing fish in the lake the blooms were mainly a consequence of excessive external phosphorus p loading from point sources and agricultural runoff discharge matisoff et al 2016 in response an external p load reduction program was implemented through the great lakes water quality agreement in 1972 and lake conditions had improved considerably by the mid 1980s daloğlu et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 in the mid 1990s however cyanobacterial blooms reappeared in the lake and have become increasingly extensive and frequent since then despite continuing success in achieving the target total p tp loading in most of the years maccoux et al 2016 harmful algal blooms habs pose significant risks to drinking water supplies quality of human life and economic vitality in 2014 for example toxins from lake erie habs resulted in a two day do not drink advisory to approximately half a million local residents in toledo ohio wynne and stumpf 2015 to improve lake erie water quality and reduce the public health risks the governments of canada and the united states have committed to a further 40 reduction in external tp and dissolved reactive p drp loads reaching lake erie from the maumee river and other priority tributaries usepa 2016 internal p loading may contribute to the total quantity of p delivered to the lake water column and thus retard the recovery of lake water quality penn et al 1995 evidence suggests that sediment p regeneration does occur in lake erie for example burns 1976 observed a dramatic increase in drp concentration in the hypolimnion waters of the central basin cb of lake erie when the waters became anoxic a recent study on oxygen isotopic sources of dissolved p in lake erie suggested that previously deposited p may indeed be released from sediments of cb when hypolimnetic hypoxia occurs during the period of summer stratification elsbery et al 2009 matisoff et al 2016 observed large variations in the diffusive flux of p from bottom sediments in the western basin wb of lake erie when using sediment incubation pore water concentration profile and bottom chamber methods they suggested that internal diffusive recycling of p in the wb is unlikely to trigger habs by itself in the cb internal p loading may amount to 8 20 of the total external input of p to lake erie in the sediment incubation and the pore water concentration profile studies paytan et al 2017 meanwhile matisoff et al 2016 and paytan et al 2017 also discussed the limitations of their measurement methods such as ignoring some important processes e g bioturbation by macro bentric fauna involved in the internal loading of p and great challenges of simulating lake bottom environment during the incubations in order to better estimate internal p loading in the lake one needs to directly characterize the forms of sedimentary p and assess the on site potential for releasing dissolved p into the water column forms of p in the sediments of lake erie and their nature and origins were discussed by williams et al 1976a and 1976b in the 1970s specifically sedimentary p was categorized into inorganic p pi such as apatite pi and non apatite pi napi and organic p po apatite p is of detrital sedimental rock origin and mainly derived from eroding bluffs along the north shore of the cb while both napi and po are of anthropogenic origin and can be potentially released into overlying water thereby contributing to habs pennuto et al 2014 further reported that total p concentrations in surficial sediments increased from nearshore to offshore in lake erie to our knowledge in the last four decades no further studies have been conducted to update or improve our complete understanding on sedimentary p cycling as well as to quantify the forms of sedimentary p with respect to their availability for algal growth in the lake erie filling this knowledge gap is critical for quantifying sediment p regeneration to the water column given a shift in the prevalence of p inputs from point sources to diffuse sources the recent resurgence of habs in the wb and expansion of the hypoxic zone in the cb and other changing lake conditions e g colonization by invasive dreissenid mussels and blooms of cladophora sp associated with nutrient deposition from four decades ago watson et al 2016 a modified hedley s sequential extraction procedure is widely used to separate p in soils into several fractions associated with plant availability and the chemical nature of p zhang and mackenzie 1997 compared to other sequential extraction schemes the hedley s one not only measures pi but also po considering that po plays an important role in sediment p cycling zhu et al 2013 the hedley s procedure was employed in our study to quantify sedimentary p and assess p availability for release into lake water to our knowledge this study is the first time to apply the hedley s procedure to sedimentary p cycling research of lake erie it not only provides a research tool for sedimentary p measurements but also helps better understand the nature and cycling of sedimentary p of lake erie the objectives of this study were to estimate i pi and po forms and their respective quantities in surficial lake sediments ii spatial distribution of each sediment p form in the 0 10 cm sediment of the lake erie basin iii vertical distribution of various p forms in the sediment profile and iv internal p loading in the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling in 2010 a total of 37 sites were successfully sampled for sediment cores across the lake erie basin fig 1 and table a 1 all these sampling sites are located in the areas of soft substrates according to the map of lake erie substrate types haltuch and berkman 1999 and happened to be offshore we could not collect any sediment samples in the areas of hard substrates due to the inability of the box corer to penetrate into the sediment as shown in fig 3 many nearshore areas belong to hard substrates which makes it unsuccessful to collect sediment samples from nearshore areas each soft sediment core was then split into 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm sections for chemical analysis a modified hedley s p fraction procedure was used to separate sedimentary p into eight different p fractions including h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po hcl pi and residue p the details on sediment sampling sample preparations and chemical analysis can be found in appendix a 2 2 analysis of variance and p stock and release calculations as mentioned above we could not collect hard sediment samples moreover hard substrates are unlikely to sequester p to any large extent therefore we assumed that p stock is low or nearly zero in hard substrates which were then excluded from our calculations of spatial distributions of sedimentary p n and c concentrations p stock and internal p loading in the current study regarding the details on data analysis p stock and release potential calculations and internal p loading determinations please see appendix a where the rationales for estimating internal p loading are also discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of p among sequentially extracted p fractions in the 0 10 cm sediment in surface sediments 0 10 cm tp concentrations ranged between 498 and 1180 mg kg 1 with a mean sd of 889 152 mg kg 1 fig 2 n 37 which were reasonably consistent with those previously reported in surficial sediment of nearshore lake erie 450 750 mg tp kg 1 pennuto et al 2014 williams et al 1976a reported a larger variation 188 2863 mg kg 1 in tp concentration in 48 surficial sediment samples from this lake however 90 of those samples fell within the range of 463 1387 mg kg 1 similar to the range found in the present study among the eight p fractions extracted i e h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po hcl and residual p the least pi 0 8 20 9 mg kg 1 0 1 2 3 of tp and po 0 7 5 0 mg kg 1 0 1 0 5 of tp were those extracted by deionized water these data are consistent with previous reports that h2o pi accounted for 3 of tp in the sediments collected from 44 european north american and chinese lakes zhu et al 2013 kopáček et al 2005 sedimentary nahco3 pi and po ranged between 7 159 mg kg 1 and between 0 27 mg kg 1 respectively accounting for 0 9 14 3 and 0 2 6 respectively of tp in the sediments the naoh pi fraction accounted for 0 8 20 4 of tp with concentrations ranging between 6 241 mg kg 1 compared with the h2o and nahco3 extractants the 0 1 m naoh solution extracted more po 6 129 mg kg 1 thereby accounting for 0 8 13 0 of tp the hcl pi ranging between 367 807 mg kg 1 was the most abundant p form in lake erie sediments accounting for on average 57 of tp in sediment the second most dominant p form was residual p accounting for 7 9 23 2 of tp in sediment despite the dominance of hcl pi in sediment tp no significant correlation was found between tp and hcl pi in comparison the remaining p fractions were all significantly correlated with tp in sediment r 0 34 0 84 p 0 05 data not shown even though some of the fractions only accounted for very small percentages of tp this indicates that the variations in the quantity of tp among sites are mainly caused by non hcl pi fractions i e h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po and residual p which is understandable considering that hcl pi is of natural origin and is inert leading to its relatively uniform distribution in space and time williams et al 1976b the hcl pi would not contribute much to availability of sediment p to phytoplankton due to its very low solubility burns 1976 3 2 spatial distribution of various p fractions in the 0 10 cm sediment spatial distribution of sedimentary p 0 10 cm varied with respect to p fractions and none of the fractions were distributed uniformly across the lake fig 3 on average h2o pi was the lowest in the cb mean sd of 3 2 1 2 mg kg 1 followed by the eb 7 2 5 7 mg kg 1 with the highest in the wb 8 3 5 7 mg kg 1 sedimentary h2o pi was mainly concentrated in the western portion of wb and the area surrounding ottawa county ohio including the sandusky basin and the southeast portion of the wb the high h2o pi concentrations observed in these locations reflect the fact that these areas receive about 80 of annual external p loading to the lake scavia et al 2014 however external p loading data fail to explain high h2o pi concentrations in the sediment of the eastern basin eb because this basin only receives about 10 of p loading to the lake scavia et al 2014 to the east southeast of long point high p concentrations were not only observed for the h2o pi fraction but also for all the remaining p fractions except for hcl pi the deepest region of the lake i e eb experiences the longest period of annual stratification and has high p concentrations probably because the hypolimnial water is always well oxygenated and the thermocline prevents water exchange between the epilimnion and hypolimnion locking the p in the sediment williams et al 1976b mortimer 1987 in addition surficial water flow from west to east dominates in the lake and some suspended particles containing p eventually reach eb through sediment suspension resettling cycles and gradually accumulate in the deeper areas therefore concentrated p in eb east southeast of long point could be due to the long term accumulation of p in the area patterson et al 2005 observed that the northeast nearshore of long point had the highest dreissena density and dry tissue mass in all of lake erie therefore high h2o pi and po concentrations in the northeast nearshore of long point in eb may have been due to abundant dreissenid mussels in the area which are able to remove suspended particles from the water column and release dissolved nutrients into the water column or deposited them on the nearshore lake bottom hecky et al 2004 comparing the present study with that of patterson et al 2005 shows that areas of high h2o pi generally correspond to locations where mean density and dry tissue mass of dreissena are high such an explanation for high h2o pi observed in the northeast nearshore of long point is also supported by the measurements of nitrogen n isotope δ15n signatures in suspended particulate matter in lake erie upsdell 2005 particulate n observed in the northeast nearshore of long point did not come from any other part of the lake but was most likely produced through nutrient recycling of n by dreissenid mussels we speculate that the same mechanism also applies to the observed h2o pi in this study both nahco3 pi and naoh pi exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns with high concentrations occurring in the wb and the middle part of the cb particularly along the southern shore in our view such p distribution patterns mainly reflect the combined effects of external p loading and the lake circulation patterns usdoi 1968 usepa 1984 maumee river water contributing 39 of tp loading to the lake erie and the associated particles primarily flow from west to east along the southern shore and eventually enter the cb through the middle south channels michalak et al 2013 scavia et al 2014 the sandusky river accounting for 11 of tp loading to the lake contributes the majority of sediment p in the sandusky basin and enters the lake at the southwestern corner of the cb scavia et al 2014 the detroit river water carrying almost 23 of tp loading to lake erie enters the lake at the northwestern corner michalak et al 2013 however this river contributes 90 of the water inflow to the lake which suggests that the p in the detroit river may not contribute as much to sedimentary p concentration as do the maumee and sandusky rivers in the cb both the prevailing southwest winds and the earth s rotation generate currents that cause a geostrophic transport of water toward the south shore probably causing significant p deposition into the sediment along the southern shore usepa 1984 compared with other p fractions hcl pi exhibited a unique spatial distribution pattern high concentrations along the northern shore of both the northeastern cb and the western eb including the embayment north of long point fig 3 according to kemp et al 1976 and williams et al 1976b hcl pi is mostly derived from the sediment through shoreline erosion 83 of which occurs from the bluffs along the north shore of the cb between erieau and long point it was reported that hcl pi apatite p averaged 545 mg kg 1 in 14 bluff samples collected from the north shore of lake erie accounting for about 95 of tp williams et al 1976b therefore surface transport of water and suspended particles toward the southeast subsurface transport of re suspended fine materials and upwelling adjacent to the north shore may collectively create the observed distribution pattern of sedimentary hcl pi usepa 1984 usdoi 1968 overall various po fractions e g h2o po nahco3 po and naoh po and residual p also predominated in po were all concentrated in the middle part of the cb east southeast of long point in the eb and southern part of the wb except for nahco3 po which was concentrated in the middle part of the cb the similarities reflect one or more common mechanisms controlling spatial distribution of po significant linear correlations were observed between organic c concentration and h2o po nahco3 po naoh po and residual p p 0 0001 data not shown furthermore these p fractions were also linearly related with total n in sediments p 0 0001 data not shown in fact linear relationships have been widely reported between organic c and po in lake sediments williams et al 1976a bostan et al 2000 similarly kemp and mudrochova 1972 reported that 90 of total n in sediments collected from a lake ontario sediment core was in an organic form these results suggest that organic n and p are integral components of the organic matter of the lake sediments thus it is not surprising to find similar spatial distribution patterns for organic c total n and po and residual p fig 3 and fig a 1 the measured c n ratio values ranged between 5 7 and 14 5 in our study with a median value of 9 8 fig 4 generally c n ratios are directly related to the sources of p and organic matter in lake systems kemp et al 1977 thomas et al 1991 the reported range of c n ratio is about 5 8 for freshwater phytoplankton kendall et al 2001 14 20 for aquatic macrophytes kemp et al 1977 20 546 for vascular land plants meyers and ishiwatari 1993 and generally greater than 16 for glacial materials kemp et al 1977 in our study the cb had lower c n ratios particularly in the middle of the basin fig 4 it seems that high po and residual p in the cb were primarily derived from autochthonous phytoplankton derived organic matter it is widely recognized that the wb is richer in phytoplankton than the cb and eb due to shallow waters and its major tributaries supplying nutrients allinger and reavie 2013 thus high organic and residual p along with low c n ratios in the cb suggests that suspended particles in the lake are rich in autochthonous organic matter and associated p can be transported from west to east in the lake which is consistent with a net eastward movement of water current in the lake usepa 1984 zhou et al 2015 one previous study did show that suspended particulate matter in lake erie had c n ratios of 4 7 6 9 and was primarily derived from plankton upsdell 2005 in addition shinohara et al 2012 and bostan et al 2000 reported that po accounted for significantly higher proportions of tp in suspended particles than in lake sediment our results agree with kemp et al 1977 who reported that the biggest cluster of high c n ratios of lake erie was located in the wb particularly in the area close to the mouth of the detroit river kemp et al 1977 also found that these high c n ratios in the wb were similar to those measured for the lake st clair which has a shallow water depth and a large standing crop of macrophytes therefore they suggested that the suspended materials from lake st clair are the most significant source of sediment in the wb on average the c n ratios were higher in the eb than those in the cb fig 4 it seems that the shallows created by the pennsylvania ridge which separates the two basins interrupts the continuing pattern of decreasing c n ratio from west to east this could be the case if sediment composed of plankton sources mostly settles in the cb which is possible considering that transport velocities decrease when the flow enters the wide cb the ridge may become a barrier for plankton sources p in the cb sediments to be transported to the eb the lower primary productivity in the eb and high water transparency promote the nearshore growth of macrophytes cladophora sp which derive major sources of the sediment p from the grand river valipour et al 2016 and are less related to the wb and cb the relatively steep slope and sediment resuspension cycling could transport suspended particles to settle down in the areas at the deeper end of the basin de march 1978 causing higher organic sedimentary p in these areas the areas with high po and residual p in the cb and eb overall are deep water 3 3 vertical distribution of p in sediment cores vertical distribution of sedimentary p varied among p fractions and basins table 1 in the wb we found no significant difference in the concentration of each p form among the vertical layers in the eb the only significant difference in p concentration occurred for h2o pi between 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm sections in the cb in contrast significant differences in p concentrations were observed between 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm for all p fractions except for naoh pi and hcl pi and between 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm for nahco3 po and naoh po fractions our data suggest that p deposited in the cb was more algal available than that in the eb and wb table 1 there was a decreasing trend in h2o pi concentration with depth from 0 to 20 cm in the eb but the percentage i e 38 of potential available h2o pi in total h2o pi was less than that i e 67 in the cb in particular the cb was characterized as having higher po concentrations in sediments ascribed to a large load of organic debris from phytoplankton generally po concentration declines with depth below the sediment surface due to mineralization of po shinohara et al 2012 ahlgren et al 2011 ahlgren et al 2005 joshi et al 2015 half life times of monoester p diester p and pyrophosphates were estimated to be about 23 21 and 13 y respectively ahlgren et al 2005 summer hypoxia occurs annually in the bottom of the cb and oxygen depletion rates have recently increased due to anthropogenic factors zhou et al 2013 which would further promote p release in the cb hupfer et al 2007 oscillating redox conditions caused by the recurrent presence and absence of oxygen favour the growth of some microorganisms in the surficial sediments hupfer et al 2007 these microorganisms can take up p in excess and store it intracellularly in the form of polyphosphate under oxic conditions and potentially release it into the overlying water under anoxic stress hupfer et al 2007 polyphosphate was estimated to account for up to 10 of tp in the uppermost sediment layer hupfer et al 2007 overall higher availability of sediment p with the cb is consistent with the observation that the hypolimnetic waters of the cb showed a dramatic increase in the concentration of drp when the waters became anoxic burns 1976 as expected h2o pi was the most available p fraction in the sediment 67 and 38 of this form in the 0 10 cm stratum was potentially available in the cb and eb respectively compared to that in the 10 20 cm depth table 1 however the h2o pi fraction is unlikely an important contributor to internal p loading due to its low concentration in comparison only 36 of the nahco3 pi fraction in the cb is potentially algal available but it can contribute 29 2 mg p kg 1 sediment to internal p loading about 13 times more than that with h2o pi across the three basins of the lake no significant differences in h2o pi and nahco3 pi concentration were found between 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depths indicating that both p fractions reach stable or equilibrium conditions at the 10 20 cm depth and below and will be permanently sequestered in the deep sediment regarding hcl pi it is expected to observe largely identical p concentrations in the sediment profile considering its natural origin inert nature and few temporal changes in the processes governing apatite sedimentation in lake erie williams et al 1976b our study confirms that the biogeochemical cycling of organic p plays an important role in p release into the overlying water contributing to the eutrophic status of lakes zhu et al 2013 in the 0 10 cm sediment stratum of cb 34 of h2o po 34 of nahco3 po and 18 of naoh po can be potentially released to the overlying water furthermore small proportions of nahco3 po and naoh po i e 25 and 27 respectively in the 10 20 cm depth stratum are also potentially available nevertheless it seems that both nahco3 po and naoh po can become a long term source for p release this may be related to the concentrations of various po species in each p fraction labile monoester diester phytate like p and some unknown po are present in each p fraction zhu et al 2013 however compared with the h2o po fraction the latter two po fractions contain much more phytate like p approximately 5 10 times more and unknown po species 16 20 times which are relatively refractory in the sediment zhu et al 2013 according to eq a 5 about 51 of nahco3 po and 40 of naoh po in the 0 10 cm sediment stratum can be potentially algal available similarly ahlgren et al 2005 reported that 50 60 of po contained in lake sediments was degraded and eventually released to the water column residual p in agricultural soils is generally believed to be recalcitrant and unavailable for plant uptake hedley et al 1982 however our results indicate that 9 7 of residual p in the 0 10 cm layer of sediment is potentially available for transformation and subsequent release to the bottom water søndergaard et al 1996 also found a similar proportion of the residual p in sediment could eventually become algal available 3 4 sedimentary p stocks and release and internal p loading based on the results of the present study a conceptual scheme to explain sedimentary p stocks and release to the water column of lake erie was developed fig 5 briefly the tp stock in the surficial lake sediment 0 10 cm consisting of i po i e h2o po nahco3 po and naoh po ii non hcl pi i e h2o pi nahco3 pi and naoh pi iii residual p and iv hcl pi were 197 219 and 195 metric tons km 2 in wb cb and eb respectively the potential availability of sedimentary p in the 0 10 cm sediment for release to the water column varies with basin and p fractions in the wb all sediment p fractions remain stable or in an equilibrium status while in the eb only 2 4 of non hcl pi can be released into the overlying water over time potentially contributing to the internal p loading of 359 metric tons yr 1 in the cb 41 15 and 9 7 of po non hcl pi and residual p respectively would be potentially released into the overlying water over time contributing to internal p loading of a total of 8232 metric tons yr 1 in the 0 10 cm sediment according to eq a 4 and eq a 14 in the cb the tp stock was 201 metric tons km 2 in the 10 20 cm sediment among all the measured p fractions only nahco3 po and naoh po are potentially available for release into the overlying water in this deeper sediment layer contributing to the internal p loading of 2367 metric tons yr 1 according to eq a 15 in the cb the 0 10 cm sediment overall contributes 78 of the p released from the sediment while the remaining 22 comes from the older sediment layer i e 10 20 cm these results are consistent with a report that for two swiss glacial lakes the top sediment layer deposited over the last 10 years accounted for 60 80 of the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate in the sediments while sediments older than 10 years contributed only 20 43 to sediment based mineralization rate matzinger et al 2010 according to eq a 16 lake erie may receive the internal p loading of up to 10 958 metric tons yr 1 across the three basins approximately equal to the whole lake target external p load of 11 000 metric tons yr 1 similarly nürnberg and lazerte 2016 reported that internal p load was about 0 75 1 3 times the external p load in lake winnipeg manitoba between 1999 and 2012 in lake simcoe ontario internal p load was estimated to be 45 89 of the external load nürnberg et al 2013 our internal p load estimate for the cb is higher than that 2400 metric tons yr 1 paytan et al 2017 measured in the cb using sediment core incubation experiments one of the major reasons for this discrepancy is that the core incubations accounted only for diffusive p flux in the internal p load estimate ignoring bioturbation by macro bentric fauna paytan et al 2017 in fact p flux from the sediments due to hexagenia sp may be greater than diffusive p flux chaffin and kane 2010 paytan et al 2017 in comparison our approach to estimate internal p loading does not distinguish specific individual processes e g diffusive p flux and bioturbation through which sedimentary p can be released into the overlying water instead it highlights a common consequence of all the p release processes which would lead to decreased p concentrations of the sediment as long as sedimentary p release actually occurs another reason is that paytan et al 2017 performed the core incubations at 7 c which is below the bottom water temperature of 9 18 c observed in the cb between june and october a key period of p release into lake water due to summer hypoxia schertzer et al 1987 in general the p release rate increased with increasing incubation temperature when the temperature was below 7 c p release was low or even below zero holdren and armstrong 1980 in addition paytan et al 2017 pointed out that the concentration of the overlying water increased over time during the core incubations reducing the concentration gradient and then the p flux in our study we did not measure a detectable p release from the sediment in the wb in comparison matisoff et al 2016 reported that the wb contributes to the internal p loads of 378 808 metric tons yr 1 3 7 of the 11 000 metric tons yr 1 target load for p delivery to lake erie from external sources however they pointed out that they might have overestimated the annual p fluxes because their measurements were conducted during the warmer time of the year our internal p load estimate shows that internal loading must be an important source of p in lake erie since 1980s external p loading has remained below the p reduction target in most years however tp concentration in the cb water increased with time despite irregular temporal pattern of external p loading scavia et al 2014 in our view internal p loads may contribute to the increases in lake water tp concentration in the cb large amount of internal p loads may have different impacts on habs in the wb and hypoxia in the cb compared with the majority of external p load entering the wb internal p loading occurs in the cb after the p is moved up to the upper water column due to fall overturn it would then move from west to east through the water flow therefore internal p loads in the cb may not have much chance of entering the wb and contributing to habs it is reported that habs are more likely triggered by relatively short term loads of immediately available p in the wb scavia et al 2014 thus a good control of external p loads delivered to the wb would be a key to the prevention control and mitigation of habs however the recovery of western basin water quality may be delayed due to legacy p agricultural practice changes climate change etc sharpley et al 2013 michalak et al 2013 scavia et al 2014 both hypoxic area and days are positively related to annual external p loads delivered to the wb and cb rucinski et al 2014 in order to combat the growing threat of hypoxia the annex 4 committee of the 2012 great lakes water quality agreement set updated p load reduction targets of 40 entering the wb and cb to achieve 6000 metric tons p loads yr 1 delivered into the cb according to our estimate 10 599 metric tons p yr 1 of internal p loads for the cb it may take many years to see the desired responses of lake water body even if the updated reduction target can be met by implementing appropriate p reduction measures in the cb habs are also often detected by satellites in the offshore waters but currently they are not severe environmental concerns due to short durations and limited sizes chaffin et al 2019 one may ask a question why large amount of internal p loads in the cb can not cause large habs in the cb and eb which can be explained by the following two reasons one is the p dilution effect as that the cb and eb combine to account for over 95 of water volume of the lake and hold 18 times as much water as the wb the other is that the water in the cb and eb is too cold for developing habs in most areas schertzer et al 1987 ralston et al 2014 many climate change scenarios indicate that lake erie area will become warmer due to climate change which may further increase internal p loading gibbons and bridgeman 2020 moreover lake water temperatures are expected to increase more rapidly than air temperature due to decreased ice cover gibbons and bridgeman 2020 which suggests that lake water will become more favorable rapidly for developing habs in the cb and eb therefore habs may become worsening in the cb and even eb if external p loads entering the lake is not well controlled and continue to deposit large amount of p in the sediment 4 conclusions the hedley s sequential extraction procedure was successfully used to separate sedimentary p into h2o pi h2o po nahco3 pi nahco3 po naoh pi naoh po hcl pi and residual p our study was the first time to completely determine the potential availability of each p form for release into overlying water in the wb cb and eb and based on the results to calculate internal p loads of each basin from the sediment the tp stock is 197 219 and 195 metric tons km 2 in the 0 10 cm sediment of the wb cb and eb respectively internal p loads from the 0 10 cm sediment could total 8 232 and 359 metric tons yr 1 in the cb and eb respectively while the 0 10 cm sediment unlikely release detectable p into the overlying water in the wb in the 10 20 cm sediment the tp stock of the cb is 201 metric tons km 2 and likely contributes to internal p loads of 2 367 metric tons yr 1 mainly deriving from nahco3 po and naoh po internal p loads from the sediment unlikely contributes to habs in the wb but it may cause and maintain hypoxia in the cb and delay the recovery of water body quality for a lengthy time period in response to external p reduction measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17429,the objective of this paper is to determine the importance of integrating peak demand mitigation and future energy pricing structures for process modelling of conventional water resource recovery facilities wrrfs when evaluating energy cost and control strategies the well established benchmark simulation model bsm2 is used to monitor energy usage and a detailed holistic study of different flow streams is performed in order to establish potential opportunities for flexible control of wrrf energy demand secondly a detailed framework is introduced to optimize scheduling control strategies for the reject water stream while considering peak electricity demand avoidance as well as completing a comprehensive energy cost model based on current and anticipated future energy tariff structures the reject water scheduling strategies without other active controls e g aeration revealed 63 4 average peak demand mitigation and 10 755 cumulative annual energy cost savings on a 100k population equivalent wrrf without a deterioration in effluent quality analysis of different reject water scheduling control strategies shows that reject water scheduling can be an effective tool for energy cost optimisation under alternative electricity tariff structures these strategies also deliver electricity peak demand mitigation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bsm2 demand response peak demand mitigation reject water scheduling time of use tariff water energy nexus 1 introduction the energy sector is undergoing a transformation moving away from oil coal and natural gas for electricity generation to renewable energy and distributed generation due to several driving forces including climate change public policy regulations and technological advancements the feasibility of global energy supply coming from renewable energy has been examined by jacobson and delucchi 2011 the barrier for such 100 renewable energy conversion may primarily arise from social and political aspects delucchi and jacobson 2011 but there are also a range of technical challenges to be overcome hodge et al 2020 by the end of 2018 at least 162 countries had set renewable energy policy targets for the 2020 to 2050 period murdock et al 2019 the european union has set ambitious climate and energy framework targets for 2030 in which at least a 32 share of final energy consumption should come from renewable sources european union 2018 the increased share of renewables within the energy mix requires smarter management of the electricity grid on both the generation and consumption side since the production from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is intermittent fluctuating and less predictable as indicated in o connell et al 2014 a power system with largely inflexible generation and a high share of variable renewable wind solar etc sources provides significant demand response opportunities demand response dr representing one form of demand side management dsm refers to alternation of end user behaviour in order to reduce or shift electricity consumption it is considered a promising approach to improve energy system flexibility as a means of improving the integration of renewables and reducing investment and operational costs o connell et al 2014 demand response can provide multiple benefits in terms of system operation planning and economic efficiency while reducing system marginal cost variability a time based pricing structure e g time of use tariffs peak demand charging real time pricing and extreme day pricing effectively introduces the concept of demand response to customers large energy users are expected to be incentivised by time of use tariffs which are enabled by smart meter data to shift demand consumption away from peak times when electricity prices are highest palensky and dietrich 2011 with the growth of the renewable energy source electricity res e transition in europe and elsewhere potential demand response can assist large scale wind energy integration in terms of variability mitigation and provision of system flexibility foley et al 2013 urban sewage treatment is an energy intensive process whereby the energy demand of water resource recovery facilities wrrfs typically represent about 1 of national energy consumption reardon 1994 olsson 2015 states that approximately 1 18 of urban energy consumption is used to treat and transport water and wastewater the distribution of energy consumption within conventional wastewater treatment processes varies with the size of the plant nutrient removal technologies discharge standards and intended end use of the treated effluent discharge or reuse generally the major energy intensive systems are aeration sludge treatment and pumping respectively with aeration accounting for around 40 70 with the remaining 10 30 for sludge treatment and 5 20 for pumping maktabifard et al 2018 as large energy users municipal wrrfs could potentially participate in demand side management by modifying their energy consumption patterns whereby peak demand charges are reduced while providing knock on benefits to the energy grid particularly in the form of demand shaping and load flexibility demand side management from industrial end users such as wrrfs could reduce the risk of forecast errors and real time events and therefore provide flexibility for energy system dispatch and ensure efficient and secure power system operation eirgrid 2019 in addition the importance of considering pricing structures while adjusting process control strategies in water resource recovery facilities has been demonstrated by aymerich et al 2015 state of the art wrrf implementations regulate aeration and pumping lekov et al 2009 and utilise available capacity vijay 2015 in the sewage system during dry weather periods as measures to realize demand response most case studies aghajanzadeh et al 2015 giberti et al 2019 schäfer et al 2017 have employed load curtailment for a certain period e g 30 min 2 h as load response however a demand response program can also be realized through price based actions electricity market signals from various pricing structures together with optimization of the energy cost can also promote demand shaping aymerich et al 2015 nevertheless wrrf operators may have concerns about demand response actions on effluent quality therefore it is necessary to develop dr strategies which avoid the risk of effluent violations while optimizing the energy cost the reject water obtained from digested sludge dewatering and drying is normally recycled within a wrrf the reject water stream typically contains up to 25 of the total nitrogen tn load although it generally represents less than 2 of the total influent flow janus and van der roest 1997 this internal flow is characterised by relatively high temperatures high ammonia concentration and specific treatment requirements the reject water line is highly energy intensive in the context of treatment requirements when it is recycled back to the aeration tanks however due to its high concentration and low volume it can be stored for relativity short periods in order to enable a more energy flexible wrrf this can bring benefits including effluent quality improvements a reduction in peak energy demand and consequent lower electricity costs the objective of this paper is to apply modelling to study the energy flexibility within a wrrf through controlled scheduling of sludge reject water in a long term plant wide and dynamic context control strategies on reject water of the sludge line are implemented over the default bsm2 open loop settings without active controls previously published studies where advanced energy cost models were simulated in wrrfs such as that by aymerich et al 2015 focussed on aeration control here we focus on an alternative scheduling strategy that has the potential to provide benefits to the wrrf and the energy supplier through peak demand mitigation a systematic analysis is conducted for the proposed scheduling control strategies relating to energy performance but under the constraint of meeting wastewater treatment standards three energy pricing structures based upon the irish energy market are used for evaluating energy costs the proposed reject water scheduling strategies are designed to allow peak demand mitigation effluent quality improvement and potential energy cost savings meanwhile implementation of the scheduling strategies within an existing benchmark wrrf improves understanding of the interactions between acceptable wrrf operation and energy optimization 2 methods 2 1 benchmark simulation model no 2 implementation benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 is a simulation framework which enables plant wide control strategies to be implemented and evaluated within a standard wrrf which includes primary settling activated sludge system including anoxic and aerobic reactors and a secondary final clarifier anaerobic digester sludge thickener and dewatering unit etc gernaey et al 2014 a dynamic influent file at 15 min intervals over 609 days was generated using a phenomenological model gernaey et al 2011 which considers the impact of seasonal factors ambient temperature and weather influence dry rain and storm weather in addition evaluation criteria jeppsson et al 2007 can be applied to analyse the influent effluent quality violation of effluent pollutant limits operational cost chemical consumption energy consumption and sludge disposal controller performance assessment and risk assessment influent index quality iqi effluent quality index eqi and operational cost index oci are the main evaluation criteria employed gernaey et al 2014 the effluent quality requirement corresponds to limits defined in the benchmark model as follows ntot 18 g n m3 chemical oxygen demand cod 100 g cod m3 snh ammonia 4 g n m3 total suspended solid tss 30 g

percentile thresholds are defined for the effluent concentration levels for the upper boundary of each required parameter all evaluation criteria were assessed for the final 364 days within the 609 days of the bsm2 time profile gernaey et al 2014 in this study the bsm2 model was implemented using biowin 5 3 envirosim canada which supports monitoring simulation control and data recording parameter settings in biowin 5 3 have been adjusted based on default open loop control without active controls the schematic layout of the bsm2 plant is shown in the supplementary material fig s1 2 2 energy pricing structure in order to assess the demand response performance of various control strategies three electricity pricing structures were prepared according to historical irish data published in 2017 table 1 eurostat 2018 semo 2018 for this study fixed day night and dynamic pricing structures were used to explore potential flexibility on energy cost that reject water scheduling could bring the day night pricing is referred to eurostat 2018 and dynamic pricing was assumed from semo 2018 the mean value of the dynamic pricing and day night pricing in 2017 p was defined as the rate of fixed unit electricity pricing across a 364 day evaluation period all the pricing structures have taken taxes and levies into account in this study half hourly ex post initial price ep2 historical data from 2017 was acquired from the single electricity market sem in ireland semo 2018 the ep2 price represents the final system marginal price smp and is published four days after the trading day in order to produce the initial settlement statements and generate weekly invoicing semo 2015 considering that the bsm2 results are generated in 15 min intervals the mean value of two half hourly ep2 smp was inserted in between correspondingly as smp ti in the dynamic pricing profile from the average smp of 2017 fig 1 two price peaks at 09 30 in the morning and 18 00 in the early evening are observed and in general these two time periods can be considered when a wrrf should attempt to mitigate its demand consumption as the dynamic energy tariff optimization and reject water scheduling control are both time based it is beneficial to devise operational strategies to mitigate against the price peaks in fig 1 excess electricity generated from a wastewater resource recovery facility can potentially be sold to the energy grid copeland and carter 2017 venkatesh and abdi 2013 normally the price for wastewater generated energy is low without financial incentives power et al 2014 however incentives for commercialization of biogas from wrrfs varies regionally in this study it is assumed that electricity production from the sludge digester via its chp generator in the bsm2 wrrf could be sold back to the grid at the same price as the system electricity marginal cost three types of pricing structures were generated including fixed pricing day night pricing and dynamic pricing with pricing structures for an illustrative week shown in fig 2 the dynamic pricing structure assumed here aims to simulate potential electricity pricing in a future energy market for wrrfs with smart metering 2 3 reject water outflow scheduling strategies design the process diagram of figu 3 introduces the optimization pathway of the reject water scheduling strategies in this study each timestep marks the start of a 15 min tank emptying period and the control strategies have also been designed based on 15 min timesteps to be consistent with the bsm2 model five influent characteristics influent flow rate cod load tn load cod concentration tn concentration together with iqi and power demand were taken as potential control indicators for reject water scheduling in the context of demand response it is the intention to evaluate the most effective control indicators along with the best strategies for reject water scheduling control the chosen key performance indicators kpis include effluent quality power demand during peak hours the probability of peak demand occurrence and the total energy cost under the three pricing structures in order to determine appropriate reject water scheduling control indicators diurnal averages of the influent flow total cod tn concentrations cod load tn load were considered the variation in diurnal average influent flow as an example is used to illustrate how the scheduling strategies were proposed in this profile fig 4 the minimum point representing the minimum flow across a day is at 06 00 and the local minimum point representing the minimum flow in the afternoon is at 15 15 eight hours of sustained low influent flow occur from 23 45 to 07 30 three strategies exemplifying the influent flow as shown in fig 4 were used to design the scheduling scenarios and they can be explained as follows strategy a s a empty the reject water tank during the period 23 45 07 30 8 h when the influent flow is consistently low for eight hours during the night strategy b s b empty reject water tank during the period 23 45 05 45 6 h 15 min when influent flow is low but avoid releasing reject water before the influent flow shows a tendency to rise at 06 00 power demand of wastewater treatment starts to increase in parallel with influent flow rate strategy c s c feed reject water back during 23 45 05 45 6 h 15 min and subsequently 14 00 15 30 1 h 45 min the following day which is based on s b but in addition reject water feeding occurs during the lowest influent hours in the afternoon in order to obtain a total daily eight hour scheduling as a comparison to s a eighteen scenarios were designed based on the above strategies according to fluctuations in the influent flow rate cod concentration tn concentration cod load tn load power demand and iqi following the same methodology as explained for the above influent flow example with strategies a c however not all options are presented here due to insignificant demand response effects either from an energy cost aspect or peak power mitigation efficiency as aeration energy corresponds to around 40 60 of total power demand olsson and andrews 1978 it represents the largest share as a single item across all energy consumption sources including pumping mixing heating etc thus aeration is considered as the main opportunity for power demand response flexibility in bsm2 the returned reject water passes through the primary settler and two anoxic tanks before entering the aeration tanks considering the hydraulic retention time hrt of the primary settling and anoxic tanks there is some time delay before the reject water reaches the aeration tank where the main energy consumption processes i e organic matter and ammonium oxidation occur thus the scheduling strategy should not only consider the wastewater influent characteristics but also recognize the total hrt for units located prior to the first aeration tank in principle the reject water flow could be directed to either the primary clarifier or to the activated sludge tank however for clarity this paper focusses only on the former the total hydraulic retention time of these units including the primary settler and two anoxic tanks was recorded in biowin 5 3 and a trendline with a high correlation between the influent flow rate and hydraulic retention time was obtained from the data of 609 days as shown in fig 5 a correlation equation was generated to quantitatively describe the relation between hrt in those three units and influent flow rate the hydraulic retention time for reject water scheduling was estimated from the correlation equation at 1 75 h for a bsm2 steady state influent flow of 20 648 m3 day as the bsm2 default setting accordingly strategy d is designed as follows strategy d s d feed reject water back between 22 00 and 04 00 based upon s b being brought forward by 1 75 h the hrt is not estimated during ramping periods due to fluctuating influent flow causing hrt variations the reject water feeding patterns of the six strategies including the bsm2 default and night emptying are shown in table 3 and fig 6 the scheduling pattern of each strategy is designed for 24 h duration and remains the same diurnally across the 609 days of simulation 3 results thirty two scenarios including the bsm2 default reject water bypassing sixteen scenarios designed in alignment with strategy a c and fifteen scenarios based on s d were simulated and analysed the reject water tank emptying time slots of these thirty one scenarios as presented in supplementary material table s1 were designed from seven control indicators and four scheduling strategies according to the optimization pathway in fig 3 there is one optimal control indicator of each control strategy to illustrate most improvements over bsm2 open loop case as introduced in section 2 3 the strategies from a to d are designed and linked progressively only four scenarios designed which reflected strategies a d based on the control indicators of influent flowrate tn load as same time frame shown in table 2 were selected to illustrate the effect of the reject water scheduling strategies the bsm2 default open loop case in which the reject water bypasses the storage tank and is combined with the inlet of the clarifier as a constant flow rate will be referred to as the base scenario as it represents conventional operation generally 3 1 wastewater treatment performance several of the criteria listed in table 4 have been used to compare the effectiveness of the various strategies across 364 days of evaluation it can be seen from table 4 that s c with the lowest eqi is the most effective strategy in terms of improving effluent quality table 4 also presents the violation time and 95 percentiles of effluent parameters under the different reject water scheduling strategies the reject water scheduling strategies provided the opportunity to reduce both the frequency and magnitude of violations for effluent tn and ammonia generally the violation time and 95 percentile levels from reject water scheduling control are improved table 4 except for the tss violation time of scenario s c which lasts 0 25 h longer than the bsm2 default 3 2 peak demand shifting analysis as introduced in section 2 2 the peak electrical energy demand typically occurs twice a day during the morning around 09 30 and evening 18 00 a bsm2 night emptying scenario for reject water scheduling has a significant effect on power demand mitigation in the evening period at 18 00 when it reduces the power demand from 32 7 kw to 10 3 kw in comparison with the bsm2 default table 5 despite the effectiveness of power demand shifting in the evening the bsm2 night emptying scenario has a drawback in the morning when it increases the demand to 79 kw from 54 5 kw therefore the night emptying scenario cannot be considered as an appropriate scheduling strategy for the purpose of peak demand scheduling in scenario s d the reject water scheduling pattern was designed based on the influent flow rate and considered the hrt of the tanks prior to the aeration tanks in order to achieve more precise control of the aeration energy the reject water flow was halted before the wrrf inflow tended to rise which could reduce the power demand during the morning peak by 38 5 from 54 5 kw to 33 5 kw and for the evening peak by 63 4 from 32 7 to 12 0 kw in comparison with the bsm2 default based on quarter hour averaging for the power demand evaluation s d is the only scenario among six to provide improvements on peak demand reduction in both morning and evening peak demand shifting despite an increased total energy demand of 5190 kwh 1 8 relative to the bsm2 default scenario across the one year evaluation although the bsm2 default offers the possibility to reduce total power demand there are potential impacts on effluent quality since it fails to provide a better effluent quality indicated by eqi violation time and 95 percentiles table 4 in contrast s c provides the possibility of both total power demand reduction and effluent quality enhancement however the increase in power demand at 18 00 demonstrates drawbacks for peak demand control during the evening table 5 the diurnal average power demand for each scenario is shown in fig 7 which reflects the typical power demand of each scenario and therefore reveals the characteristic effect of each shifting strategy it should be noted that power demand values below zero represents periods when power generation from the biogas generator exceeds the power consumption it can be observed from fig 7 that the five scenarios other than bsm2 default show an increase in power demand from 01 00 until 06 30 which illustrates the shifting of power demand towards midnight these shifting scenarios are intended to shift the power demand curve towards night time so that wastewater treatment operations can benefit from a cheaper energy price it can also be observed from fig 7 that the daytime power demand is lower than the default for the shifting scenarios starting at 09 00 09 30 10 30 and 10 45 for the night emptying and strategy a c respectively and ending at 1 00 at night the power demand for each scenario has been recorded and grouped by power range in table 6 with the frequency count in each range calculated as a cumulative percentile to reflect the probability of specific power demand over the full 364 days of evaluation across all the strategies s b presents the highest cumulative percentile below 50 kw 70 3 while the bsm2 default scenario offers 61 3 s d has the lowest probability 4 4 of power demand exceeding 100 kw compared to 9 3 in the of bsm2 default scenario table 6 these results as presented in table 6 further supports the hypothesis that the scheduling strategy can have a significant effect on mitigating power demand the distributions of the power demand frequency over the 364 days 34 944 timesteps in total are illustrated in fig 8 for the six scenarios the bsm2 default scenario power demand frequency distribution curve gives the most platykurtic flat distribution among all curves the platykurtic distribution of the default bsm2 scenario represents a large share of the power demand under 25 kw and over 50 kw whereas the other scenarios show a more concentrated distribution between 25 kw and 50 kw these findings for the power demand frequency distribution support results from cumulative percentiles that the designed reject water shifting scenarios s a to d decrease the probability of the peak power demand above 50 kw as well as over 100 kw and therefore improve upon the power demand profile compared to the bsm2 default scenario however the similarities between the s b and s d strategies make it difficult to precisely compare advantages and disadvantages from the distribution curve given that the central tendency of s d lies towards higher power demand yet also with a higher incidence at negative power in order to further understand differences between the various power demand frequency distributions a statistical analysis was performed by assessing factors such as skewness and kurtosis mcsharry et al 2005 it can be observed from fig 8 that s b and s d realized higher frequency at lower power demand which is consistent with relatively high kurtosis for these two scenarios table 7 even though s b and s d share the same mean value for the power demand s b stands out with its higher skewness smaller maximum value and lower standard deviation confirming the effectiveness of such a shifting scenario and the corresponding strategy over power demand mitigation furthermore s c achieved the lowest maximum power demand but failed to maintain a higher kurtosis or a lower mean value overall analysis of the skewness and kurtosis provided an effective tool to evaluate the power demand distribution 3 3 cumulative energy cost in addition to the effectiveness of reducing the peak electrical demand the reject water shifting strategies also reveal the influence of total energy cost under different pricing structures the results of the total energy cost analysis over 364 days of evaluation for the selected reject water shifting scenarios are shown in table 8 the bsm2 night emptying scenario shows the lowest overall cost for the fixed pricing scheme nevertheless s c reduced the energy cost relative to the bsm2 default for all three pricing structures s d reduces the total energy cost by 12 7 under day night pricing and by 12 1 under dynamic pricing scheme as compared to the bsm2 night emptying scenario in summary the shifting scenarios including bsm2 night emptying all provide a significant improvement in the energy cost under day night and dynamic pricing structures compared to the bsm2 default scenario overall s c improves the effluent quality reduces the total energy consumption and provides potential to decrease the energy cost for three presumed pricing structures compared to the bsm2 default in addition s d provides the lowest cost under day night pricing and dynamic pricing schemes across all scenarios besides s d provides the best solution for morning peak demand mitigation and is also effective in reducing the evening peak demand 4 discussion reject water storage has previously been proposed as a control mechanism to reduce ammonia load into the activated sludge system jeppsson et al 2007 however there have been no studies to date on how reject water scheduling influences the combination of plant performance power demand and electricity cost this paper demonstrates an approach to control reject water load shifting with the objective of analysing power demand response as well as providing energy flexibility for wastewater treatment systems overall the four strategies s a to s d were designed with the purpose of reducing the peak electrical demand the design upgrade of reject water scheduling demonstrates the variation from the control indicator selection emptying during night emptying storage tank during both night and afternoon to hrt considered emptying in particular s d demonstrates potential for energy cost reductions under both day night and dynamic pricing structures moreover the results show a good balance between the objectives of i satisfying effluent quality standards ii reducing the peak power demand and iii reducing the total electricity cost the strategy of s c could thus form the basis of an operational action plan in a more sophisticated energy market 4 1 wastewater treatment dr control performance the bsm2 night emptying scenario has previously been studied together with aeration optimization control barbu et al 2018 although it was found to degrade the effluent quality index eqi if implemented without other supporting control strategies jeppsson et al 2007 such as do control influent bypass control etc night emptying presents the lowest total energy consumption for the one year evaluation period but with the downside of reduced effluent quality 4 5 on eqi kg day across all the control strategies the night emptying scenario by itself failed to avoid the risk of worsening eqi compared to the bsm2 default scenario in jeppsson et al 2007 and in this study with the aim of peak demand shifting however s c and s d were found to enable peak demand shifting as well as satisfy eqi requirements in this study it was shown that reject water time based scheduling control has generally improved the effluent quality particularly the effluent ammonia concentration a guarentee of wastewater treatment performance and effluent quality is an essential pre condition for any of the strategies presented in this study most reject water scheduling control strategies enhance the nitrogen relevant parameters such as tn and snh in the effluent which could be explained as the reject water shifting balances the nitrogen load and makes better utilization of the nitrogen removal capacity and efficiency in the wrrf system this reflects the principle behind reject water control and peak demand shifting which represents a more holistic approach to wrrf operations based on existing case studies from usa aghajanzadeh et al 2015 lekov at al 2009 thompson et al 2010 and germany schäfer et al 2017 alternative dr strategies such as explioiting load shifting availability from the shutting down of equipment such as blowers lift pumps effluent pumps and centrifuge installation of variable frequency drive vfd and cogeneration of biogas could provide up to 60 of energy flexibility in the context of total plant demand however the high dependency of these strategies on sewer system storage capacity and risks of increased effluent turbidity due to shutting down processes and equipment creates uncertainty when implementing time critical demand response measures within wrrfs in addition some dr controls are situation specific for example the large open area of the secondary settling tank provides an additional oxygen source for aerobic bioreactions when the blower is switched off as part of a dr response in the donald m somers water pollution control plant california vijay et al 2015 a further example is that adequate sewer system storage offers load shifting flexibility for influent lift pumping in the water pollution control plant san francisco aghajanzadeh et al 2015 yet both of the dr controls mentioned for the secondary settling tank or sewer system require adequate infrastructure support which is not applicable for most exisiting urban wastewater water treament facilities therefore reject water scheduling control makes demand response more achievable and widely applicable with process water equipment commonly present in urban water treatment systems for future studies control strategies such as do control nhx or phosphorus p concentration as the control indicator could be incorporated in order to design dynamic tariff optimization and dr control for wrrfs 4 2 peak demand mitigation and energy cost optimization one of the initial objectives of the study was to identify the impact of reject water scheduling on power demand mitigation the results indicate that the shifting scenarios are effective in reducing the morning and evening peak demands based on the control strategies presented in this study 38 5 and 63 4 power demand reduction compared to average power demand in the morning and evening peak respectively could be archieved without sacrificing effluent quality however only s d reduces both peaks from the yearly average energy consumption profile the daily peak demand periods for bsm2 occur at approximately 11 30 and 20 30 unlike the peak times of an energy system ireland which occur here at approximately 09 30 and 18 00 the demand profile from wastewater treatment processes is delayed in comparison to the system power demand therefore reject water shifting strategies can exploit the difference between the electrical peak demand and that of the wrrfs themselves to take advantage of wrrf capacity at lower electricity tariff time periods this study also had the objective of analysing peak demand shifting in the context of an energy system such as in ireland practical implementation of the reject water load shifting strategy described here will be partly dependent on the electricity tariff structure for example the fixed price tariff applied here was based upon the mean value of day night and dynamic pricing tariffs whereas it is normally a result of a negotiated contract between the wrrf and the electricity supplier the electricity cost under the fixed price scheme did not show an overall advantage over the other pricing structures since it was based upon a conservative hypothesis that the fixed price to be as the mean value of the system marginal price smp in addition the dynamic pricing structure followed the smp of the irish electricity market although such a dynamic pricing structure is not as yet a concept applied in practice since real time pricing has not yet been implemented however it is plausible to assume that such a pricing structure or a variant thereof could become a reality in the future in the context of significant renewable energy generation and the rollout of advanced metering infrastructure ami although strategy s b achieves increased cumulative power demand percentiles below 50 kw 70 3 indicating that a lower power demand occurs more frequently this does not lead to reduced energy consumption or lower energy costs one of the reasons for this is that increased cumulative percentiles above 100 kw 4 6 cannot be neglected since there is a strong impact on the total energy consumption and energy cost especially with a dynamic pricing structure the increased energy cost reveals the necessity to develop more dynamic control approaches and better understanding and forecasting of future energy pricing 4 3 limitations and perspectives since wastewater treatment plants normally pay the industrial electricity price it is important to understand more about how the price is formed as well as energy market operations dereli et al 2020 as mentioned in the introduction energy electricity markets are transitioning into an environment of greater complexity in pricing with extra charging or billing options such as peak demand charges hypothetically wrrfs can implement demand response programs operating in restricted sympathy with a price based input recognising that the real time price may differ from the day ahead price particularly in a power system which contains a high share of variable renewables a real time reject water shifting strategy that takes into account a varying electricity price could improve the precision and accuracy on wrrf control in order to better balance effluent quality and energy cost furthermore whether the savings obtained from providing demand reponse activities as well as price differentials in dynamic tariffs can compensate for the necessary cost on infrastructure and enabling controls and communications becomes a priority concern o connell et al 2014 for wrrf operators wrrf operators could consider having other control strategies i e do and nhx controls to couple with reject water scheduling for a long term and plant wide energy saving and demand response performance in addition application of the shifting strategies and the real case scenario could be further developed to obtain the required capabilities more automatically the shifting strategies illustrated here could be refined based upon influent profile features such as weather holiday periods or day of the week similarly introducing remote upstream sensors for the influent flow characteristics or influent forecasting could be introduced to improve reject water shifting as part of real time monitoring or day ahead forecast control the reject water shifting strategy presented here adopted a systems approach considering the management of wastewater treatment energy effieciency operational cost and power system interactions assessment tools for demand response in wastewater treatment processes could be further developed including consideration of related carbon emissions social behaviour impact from the upper stream of sewer demand response water resourse management for the water food energy nexus etc the selection and optimization over reject water strategies can be further determined with the balance of multi objectives tradeoff upon stakeholder preferences regulation of water and wastewater treatment is a critical part of the energy system and is becoming a more stringent requirement consequently the energy demand for water and wastewater treatment is a critical portion of demand for wrrfs in order to implement a demand response program within wrrfs for example reject water scheduling strategies as in this paper must consider the regulation variance i e effluent limits and requirement geographically and spatially as well as the potential challenges and barriers from the energy transition in the power system it will also be meaningful to study the impact of the demand response from wrrfs on the power system kirchem et al 2020 5 conclusion the control of reject water in a waste water resource recovery facility a low volume but high nitrogen containing stream has been demonstrated to provide demand response potential while also improving effluent quality and potentially providing electricity cost savings in the context of a time of use price tariff overall reject water scheduling control strategies indicate the potential to reduce peak power demand lower long term electricity costs under different pricing structures maintaining effluent quality at an acceptable standard this study has illustrated several reject water shifting strategies and presented a potential methodology for wrrf operators to apply as a tool to mitigate peak demand and achieve electricity cost savings future studies on dynamic scheduling strategies could examine real time monitoring or day

17429,the objective of this paper is to determine the importance of integrating peak demand mitigation and future energy pricing structures for process modelling of conventional water resource recovery facilities wrrfs when evaluating energy cost and control strategies the well established benchmark simulation model bsm2 is used to monitor energy usage and a detailed holistic study of different flow streams is performed in order to establish potential opportunities for flexible control of wrrf energy demand secondly a detailed framework is introduced to optimize scheduling control strategies for the reject water stream while considering peak electricity demand avoidance as well as completing a comprehensive energy cost model based on current and anticipated future energy tariff structures the reject water scheduling strategies without other active controls e g aeration revealed 63 4 average peak demand mitigation and 10 755 cumulative annual energy cost savings on a 100k population equivalent wrrf without a deterioration in effluent quality analysis of different reject water scheduling control strategies shows that reject water scheduling can be an effective tool for energy cost optimisation under alternative electricity tariff structures these strategies also deliver electricity peak demand mitigation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bsm2 demand response peak demand mitigation reject water scheduling time of use tariff water energy nexus 1 introduction the energy sector is undergoing a transformation moving away from oil coal and natural gas for electricity generation to renewable energy and distributed generation due to several driving forces including climate change public policy regulations and technological advancements the feasibility of global energy supply coming from renewable energy has been examined by jacobson and delucchi 2011 the barrier for such 100 renewable energy conversion may primarily arise from social and political aspects delucchi and jacobson 2011 but there are also a range of technical challenges to be overcome hodge et al 2020 by the end of 2018 at least 162 countries had set renewable energy policy targets for the 2020 to 2050 period murdock et al 2019 the european union has set ambitious climate and energy framework targets for 2030 in which at least a 32 share of final energy consumption should come from renewable sources european union 2018 the increased share of renewables within the energy mix requires smarter management of the electricity grid on both the generation and consumption side since the production from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar is intermittent fluctuating and less predictable as indicated in o connell et al 2014 a power system with largely inflexible generation and a high share of variable renewable wind solar etc sources provides significant demand response opportunities demand response dr representing one form of demand side management dsm refers to alternation of end user behaviour in order to reduce or shift electricity consumption it is considered a promising approach to improve energy system flexibility as a means of improving the integration of renewables and reducing investment and operational costs o connell et al 2014 demand response can provide multiple benefits in terms of system operation planning and economic efficiency while reducing system marginal cost variability a time based pricing structure e g time of use tariffs peak demand charging real time pricing and extreme day pricing effectively introduces the concept of demand response to customers large energy users are expected to be incentivised by time of use tariffs which are enabled by smart meter data to shift demand consumption away from peak times when electricity prices are highest palensky and dietrich 2011 with the growth of the renewable energy source electricity res e transition in europe and elsewhere potential demand response can assist large scale wind energy integration in terms of variability mitigation and provision of system flexibility foley et al 2013 urban sewage treatment is an energy intensive process whereby the energy demand of water resource recovery facilities wrrfs typically represent about 1 of national energy consumption reardon 1994 olsson 2015 states that approximately 1 18 of urban energy consumption is used to treat and transport water and wastewater the distribution of energy consumption within conventional wastewater treatment processes varies with the size of the plant nutrient removal technologies discharge standards and intended end use of the treated effluent discharge or reuse generally the major energy intensive systems are aeration sludge treatment and pumping respectively with aeration accounting for around 40 70 with the remaining 10 30 for sludge treatment and 5 20 for pumping maktabifard et al 2018 as large energy users municipal wrrfs could potentially participate in demand side management by modifying their energy consumption patterns whereby peak demand charges are reduced while providing knock on benefits to the energy grid particularly in the form of demand shaping and load flexibility demand side management from industrial end users such as wrrfs could reduce the risk of forecast errors and real time events and therefore provide flexibility for energy system dispatch and ensure efficient and secure power system operation eirgrid 2019 in addition the importance of considering pricing structures while adjusting process control strategies in water resource recovery facilities has been demonstrated by aymerich et al 2015 state of the art wrrf implementations regulate aeration and pumping lekov et al 2009 and utilise available capacity vijay 2015 in the sewage system during dry weather periods as measures to realize demand response most case studies aghajanzadeh et al 2015 giberti et al 2019 schäfer et al 2017 have employed load curtailment for a certain period e g 30 min 2 h as load response however a demand response program can also be realized through price based actions electricity market signals from various pricing structures together with optimization of the energy cost can also promote demand shaping aymerich et al 2015 nevertheless wrrf operators may have concerns about demand response actions on effluent quality therefore it is necessary to develop dr strategies which avoid the risk of effluent violations while optimizing the energy cost the reject water obtained from digested sludge dewatering and drying is normally recycled within a wrrf the reject water stream typically contains up to 25 of the total nitrogen tn load although it generally represents less than 2 of the total influent flow janus and van der roest 1997 this internal flow is characterised by relatively high temperatures high ammonia concentration and specific treatment requirements the reject water line is highly energy intensive in the context of treatment requirements when it is recycled back to the aeration tanks however due to its high concentration and low volume it can be stored for relativity short periods in order to enable a more energy flexible wrrf this can bring benefits including effluent quality improvements a reduction in peak energy demand and consequent lower electricity costs the objective of this paper is to apply modelling to study the energy flexibility within a wrrf through controlled scheduling of sludge reject water in a long term plant wide and dynamic context control strategies on reject water of the sludge line are implemented over the default bsm2 open loop settings without active controls previously published studies where advanced energy cost models were simulated in wrrfs such as that by aymerich et al 2015 focussed on aeration control here we focus on an alternative scheduling strategy that has the potential to provide benefits to the wrrf and the energy supplier through peak demand mitigation a systematic analysis is conducted for the proposed scheduling control strategies relating to energy performance but under the constraint of meeting wastewater treatment standards three energy pricing structures based upon the irish energy market are used for evaluating energy costs the proposed reject water scheduling strategies are designed to allow peak demand mitigation effluent quality improvement and potential energy cost savings meanwhile implementation of the scheduling strategies within an existing benchmark wrrf improves understanding of the interactions between acceptable wrrf operation and energy optimization 2 methods 2 1 benchmark simulation model no 2 implementation benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 is a simulation framework which enables plant wide control strategies to be implemented and evaluated within a standard wrrf which includes primary settling activated sludge system including anoxic and aerobic reactors and a secondary final clarifier anaerobic digester sludge thickener and dewatering unit etc gernaey et al 2014 a dynamic influent file at 15 min intervals over 609 days was generated using a phenomenological model gernaey et al 2011 which considers the impact of seasonal factors ambient temperature and weather influence dry rain and storm weather in addition evaluation criteria jeppsson et al 2007 can be applied to analyse the influent effluent quality violation of effluent pollutant limits operational cost chemical consumption energy consumption and sludge disposal controller performance assessment and risk assessment influent index quality iqi effluent quality index eqi and operational cost index oci are the main evaluation criteria employed gernaey et al 2014 the effluent quality requirement corresponds to limits defined in the benchmark model as follows ntot 18 g n m3 chemical oxygen demand cod 100 g cod m3 snh ammonia 4 g n m3 total suspended solid tss 30 g

percentile thresholds are defined for the effluent concentration levels for the upper boundary of each required parameter all evaluation criteria were assessed for the final 364 days within the 609 days of the bsm2 time profile gernaey et al 2014 in this study the bsm2 model was implemented using biowin 5 3 envirosim canada which supports monitoring simulation control and data recording parameter settings in biowin 5 3 have been adjusted based on default open loop control without active controls the schematic layout of the bsm2 plant is shown in the supplementary material fig s1 2 2

could bring the day night pricing is referred to eurostat 2018 and dynamic pricing was assumed from semo 2018 the mean value of the dynamic pricing and day night pricing in 2017 p was defined as the rate of fixed unit electricity pricing across a 364 day evaluation period all the pricing structures have taken taxes and levies into account in this study half hourly ex post initial price ep2 historical data from 2017 was acquired from the single electricity market sem in ireland semo 2018 the ep2 price represents the final system marginal price smp and is published four days after the trading day in order to produce the initial settlement statements and generate weekly invoicing semo 2015 considering that the bsm2 results are generated in 15 min intervals the mean value of two half hourly ep2 smp was inserted in between correspondingly as smp ti in the dynamic pricing profile from the average smp of 2017 fig 1 two price peaks at 09 30 in the morning and 18 00 in the early evening are observed and in general these two time periods can be considered when a wrrf should attempt to mitigate its demand consumption as the dynamic energy tariff optimization and reject water scheduling control are both time based it is beneficial to devise operational strategies to mitigate against the price peaks in fig 1 excess electricity generated from a wastewater resource recovery facility can potentially be sold to the energy grid copeland and carter 2017 venkatesh and abdi 2013 normally the price for wastewater generated energy is low without financial incentives power et al 2014 however incentives for commercialization of biogas from wrrfs varies regionally in this study it is assumed that electricity production from the sludge digester via its chp generator in the bsm2 wrrf could be sold back to the grid at the same price as the system electricity marginal cost three types of pricing structures were generated including fixed pricing day night pricing and dynamic pricing with pricing structures for an illustrative week shown in fig 2 the dynamic pricing structure assumed here aims to simulate potential electricity pricing in a future energy market for wrrfs with smart metering 2 3 reject water outflow scheduling strategies design the process diagram of figu 3 introduces the optimization pathway of the reject water scheduling strategies in this study each timestep marks the start of a 15 min tank emptying period and the control strategies have also been designed based on 15 min timesteps to be consistent with the bsm2 model five influent characteristics influent flow rate cod load tn load cod concentration tn concentration together with iqi and power demand were taken as potential control indicators for reject water scheduling in the context of demand response it is the intention to evaluate the most effective control indicators along with the best strategies for reject water scheduling control the chosen key performance indicators kpis include effluent quality power demand during peak hours the probability of peak demand occurrence and the total energy cost under the three pricing structures in order to determine appropriate reject water scheduling control indicators diurnal averages of the influent flow total cod tn concentrations cod load tn load were considered the variation in diurnal average influent flow as an example is used to illustrate how the scheduling strategies were proposed in this profile fig 4 the minimum point representing the minimum flow across a day is at 06 00 and the local minimum point representing the minimum flow in the afternoon is at 15 15 eight hours of sustained low influent flow occur from 23 45 to 07 30 three strategies exemplifying the influent flow as shown in fig 4 were used to design the scheduling scenarios and they can be explained as follows strategy a s a empty the reject water tank during the period 23 45 07 30 8 h when the influent flow is consistently low for eight hours during the night strategy b s b empty reject water tank during the period 23 45 05 45 6 h 15 min when influent flow is low but avoid releasing reject water before the influent flow shows a tendency to rise at 06 00 power demand of wastewater treatment starts to increase in parallel with influent flow rate strategy c s c feed reject water back during 23 45 05 45 6 h 15 min and subsequently 14 00 15 30 1 h 45 min the following day which is based on s b but in addition reject water feeding occurs during the lowest influent hours in the afternoon in order to obtain a total daily eight hour scheduling as a comparison to s a eighteen scenarios were designed based on the above strategies according to fluctuations in the influent flow rate cod concentration tn concentration cod load tn load power demand and iqi following the same methodology as explained for the above influent flow example with strategies a c however not all options are presented here due to insignificant demand response effects either from an energy cost aspect or peak power mitigation efficiency as aeration energy corresponds to around 40 60 of total power demand olsson and andrews 1978 it represents the largest share as a single item across all energy consumption sources including pumping mixing heating etc thus aeration is considered as the main opportunity for power demand response flexibility in bsm2 the returned reject water passes through the primary settler and two anoxic tanks before entering the aeration tanks considering the hydraulic retention time hrt of the primary settling and anoxic tanks there is some time delay before the reject water reaches the aeration tank where the main energy consumption processes i e organic matter and ammonium oxidation occur thus the scheduling strategy should not only consider the wastewater influent characteristics but also recognize the total hrt for units located prior to the first aeration tank in principle the reject water flow could be directed to either the primary clarifier or to the activated sludge tank however for clarity this paper focusses only on the former the total hydraulic retention time of these units including the primary settler and two anoxic tanks was recorded in biowin 5 3 and a trendline with a high correlation between the influent flow rate and hydraulic retention time was obtained from the data of 609 days as shown in fig 5 a correlation equation was generated to quantitatively describe the relation between hrt in those three units and influent flow rate the hydraulic retention time for reject water scheduling was estimated from the correlation equation at 1 75 h for a bsm2 steady state influent flow of 20 648 m3 day as the bsm2 default setting accordingly strategy d is designed as follows strategy d s d feed reject water back between 22 00 and 04 00 based upon s b being brought forward by 1 75 h the hrt is not estimated during ramping periods due to fluctuating influent flow causing hrt variations the reject water feeding patterns of the six strategies including the bsm2 default and night emptying are shown in table 3 and fig 6 the scheduling pattern of each strategy is designed for 24 h duration and remains the same diurnally across the 609 days of simulation 3 results thirty two scenarios including the bsm2 default reject water bypassing sixteen scenarios designed in alignment with strategy a c and fifteen scenarios based on s d were simulated and analysed the reject water tank emptying time slots of these thirty one scenarios as presented in supplementary material table s1 were designed from seven control indicators and four scheduling strategies according to the optimization pathway in fig 3 there is one optimal control indicator of each control strategy to illustrate most improvements over bsm2 open loop case as introduced in section 2 3 the strategies from a to d are designed and linked progressively only four scenarios designed which reflected strategies a d based on the control indicators of influent flowrate tn load as same time frame shown in table 2 were selected to illustrate the effect of the reject water scheduling strategies the bsm2 default open loop case in which the reject water bypasses the storage tank and is combined with the inlet of the clarifier as a constant flow rate will be referred to as the base scenario as it represents conventional operation generally 3 1 wastewater treatment performance several of the criteria listed in table 4 have been used to compare the effectiveness of the various strategies across 364 days of evaluation it can be seen from table 4 that s c with the lowest eqi is the most effective strategy in terms of improving effluent quality table 4 also presents the violation time and 95 percentiles of effluent parameters under the different reject water scheduling strategies the reject water scheduling strategies provided the opportunity to reduce both the frequency and magnitude of violations for effluent tn and ammonia generally the violation time and 95 percentile levels from reject water scheduling control are improved table 4 except for the tss violation time of scenario s c which lasts 0 25 h longer than the bsm2 default 3 2 peak demand shifting analysis as introduced in section 2 2 the peak electrical energy demand typically occurs twice a day during the morning around 09 30 and evening 18 00 a bsm2 night emptying scenario for reject water scheduling has a significant effect on power demand mitigation in the evening period at 18 00 when it reduces the power demand from 32 7 kw to 10 3 kw in comparison with the bsm2 default table 5 despite the effectiveness of power demand shifting in the evening the bsm2 night emptying scenario has a drawback in the morning when it increases the demand to 79 kw from 54 5 kw therefore the night emptying scenario cannot be considered as an appropriate scheduling strategy for the purpose of peak demand scheduling in scenario s d the reject water scheduling pattern was designed based on the influent flow rate and considered the hrt of the tanks prior to the aeration tanks in order to achieve more precise control of the aeration energy the reject water flow was halted before the wrrf inflow tended to rise which could reduce the power demand during the morning peak by 38 5 from 54 5 kw to 33 5 kw and for the evening peak by 63 4 from 32 7 to 12 0 kw in comparison with the bsm2 default based on quarter hour averaging for the power demand evaluation s d is the only scenario among six to provide improvements on peak demand reduction in both morning and evening peak demand shifting despite an increased total energy demand of 5190 kwh 1 8 relative to the bsm2 default scenario across the one year evaluation although the bsm2 default offers the possibility to reduce total power demand there are potential impacts on effluent quality since it fails to provide a better effluent quality indicated by eqi violation time and 95 percentiles table 4 in contrast s c provides the possibility of both total power demand reduction and effluent quality enhancement however the increase in power demand at 18 00 demonstrates drawbacks for peak demand control during the evening table 5 the diurnal average power demand for each scenario is shown in fig 7 which reflects the typical power demand of each scenario and therefore reveals the characteristic effect of each shifting strategy it should be noted that power demand values below zero represents periods when power generation from the biogas generator exceeds the power consumption it can be observed from fig 7 that the five scenarios other than bsm2 default show an increase in power demand from 01 00 until 06 30 which illustrates the shifting of power demand towards midnight these shifting scenarios are intended to shift the power demand curve towards night time so that wastewater treatment operations can benefit from a cheaper energy price it can also be observed from fig 7 that the daytime power demand is lower than the default for the shifting scenarios starting at 09 00 09 30 10 30 and 10 45 for the night emptying and strategy a c respectively and ending at 1 00 at night the power demand for each scenario has been recorded and grouped by power range in table 6 with the frequency count in each range calculated as a cumulative percentile to reflect the probability of specific power demand over the full 364 days of evaluation across all the strategies s b presents the highest cumulative percentile below 50 kw 70 3 while the bsm2 default scenario offers 61 3 s d has the lowest probability 4 4 of power demand exceeding 100 kw compared to 9 3 in the of bsm2 default scenario table 6 these results as presented in table 6 further supports the hypothesis that the scheduling strategy can have a significant effect on mitigating power demand the distributions of the power demand frequency over the 364 days 34 944 timesteps in total are illustrated in fig 8 for the six scenarios the bsm2 default scenario power demand frequency distribution curve gives the most platykurtic flat distribution among all curves the platykurtic distribution of the default bsm2 scenario represents a large share of the power demand under 25 kw and over 50 kw whereas the other scenarios show a more concentrated distribution between 25 kw and 50 kw these findings for the power demand frequency distribution support results from cumulative percentiles that the designed reject water shifting scenarios s a to d decrease the probability of the peak power demand above 50 kw as well as over 100 kw and therefore improve upon the power demand profile compared to the bsm2 default scenario however the similarities between the s b and s d strategies make it difficult to precisely compare advantages and disadvantages from the distribution curve given that the central tendency of s d lies towards higher power demand yet also with a higher incidence at negative power in order to further understand differences between the various power demand frequency distributions a statistical analysis was performed by assessing factors such as skewness and kurtosis mcsharry et al 2005 it can be observed from fig 8 that s b and s d realized higher frequency at lower power demand which is consistent with relatively high kurtosis for these two scenarios table 7 even though s b and s d share the same mean value for the power demand s b stands out with its higher skewness smaller maximum value and lower standard deviation confirming the effectiveness of such a shifting scenario and the corresponding strategy over power demand mitigation furthermore s c achieved the lowest maximum power demand but failed to maintain a higher kurtosis or a lower mean value overall analysis of the skewness and kurtosis provided an effective tool to evaluate the power demand distribution 3 3 cumulative energy cost in addition to the effectiveness of reducing the peak electrical demand the reject water shifting strategies also reveal the influence of total energy cost under different pricing structures the results of the total energy cost analysis over 364 days of evaluation for the selected reject water shifting scenarios are shown in table 8 the bsm2 night emptying scenario shows the lowest overall cost for the fixed pricing scheme nevertheless s c reduced the energy cost relative to the bsm2 default for all three pricing structures s d reduces the total energy cost by 12 7 under day night pricing and by 12 1 under dynamic pricing scheme as compared to the bsm2 night emptying scenario in summary the shifting scenarios including bsm2 night emptying all provide a significant improvement in the energy cost under day night and dynamic pricing structures compared to the bsm2 default scenario overall s c improves the effluent quality reduces the total energy consumption and provides potential to decrease the energy cost for three presumed pricing structures compared to the bsm2 default in addition s d provides the lowest cost under day night pricing and dynamic pricing schemes across all scenarios besides s d provides the best solution for morning peak demand mitigation and is also effective in reducing the evening peak demand 4 discussion reject water storage has previously been proposed as a control mechanism to reduce ammonia load into the activated sludge system jeppsson et al 2007 however there have been no studies to date on how reject water scheduling influences the combination of plant performance power demand and electricity cost this paper demonstrates an approach to control reject water load shifting with the objective of analysing power demand response as well as providing energy flexibility for wastewater treatment systems overall the four strategies s a to s d were designed with the purpose of reducing the peak electrical demand the design upgrade of reject water scheduling demonstrates the variation from the control indicator selection emptying during night emptying storage tank during both night and afternoon to hrt considered emptying in particular s d demonstrates potential for energy cost reductions under both day night and dynamic pricing structures moreover the results show a good balance between the objectives of i satisfying effluent quality standards ii reducing the peak power demand and iii reducing the total electricity cost the strategy of s c could thus form the basis of an operational action plan in a more sophisticated energy market 4 1 wastewater treatment dr control performance the bsm2 night emptying scenario has previously been studied together with aeration optimization control barbu et al 2018 although it was found to degrade the effluent quality index eqi if implemented without other supporting control strategies jeppsson et al 2007 such as do control influent bypass control etc night emptying presents the lowest total energy consumption for the one year evaluation period but with the downside of reduced effluent quality 4 5 on eqi kg day across all the control strategies the night emptying scenario by itself failed to avoid the risk of worsening eqi compared to the bsm2 default scenario in jeppsson et al 2007 and in this study with the aim of peak demand shifting however s c and s d were found to enable peak demand shifting as well as satisfy eqi requirements in this study it was shown that reject water time based scheduling control has generally improved the effluent quality particularly the effluent ammonia concentration a guarentee of wastewater treatment performance and effluent quality is an essential pre condition for any of the strategies presented in this study most reject water scheduling control strategies enhance the nitrogen relevant parameters such as tn and snh in the effluent which could be explained as the reject water shifting balances the nitrogen load and makes better utilization of the nitrogen removal capacity and efficiency in the wrrf system this reflects the principle behind reject water control and peak demand shifting which represents a more holistic approach to wrrf operations based on existing case studies from usa aghajanzadeh et al 2015 lekov at al 2009 thompson et al 2010 and germany schäfer et al 2017 alternative dr strategies such as explioiting load shifting availability from the shutting down of equipment such as blowers lift pumps effluent pumps and centrifuge installation of variable frequency drive vfd and cogeneration of biogas could provide up to 60 of energy flexibility in the context of total plant demand however the high dependency of these strategies on sewer system storage capacity and risks of increased effluent turbidity due to shutting down processes and equipment creates uncertainty when implementing time critical demand response measures within wrrfs in addition some dr controls are situation specific for example the large open area of the secondary settling tank provides an additional oxygen source for aerobic bioreactions when the blower is switched off as part of a dr response in the donald m somers water pollution control plant california vijay et al 2015 a further example is that adequate sewer system storage offers load shifting flexibility for influent lift pumping in the water pollution control plant san francisco aghajanzadeh et al 2015 yet both of the dr controls mentioned for the secondary settling tank or sewer system require adequate infrastructure support which is not applicable for most exisiting urban wastewater water treament facilities therefore reject water scheduling control makes demand response more achievable and widely applicable with process water equipment commonly present in urban water treatment systems for future studies control strategies such as do control nhx or phosphorus p concentration as the control indicator could be incorporated in order to design dynamic tariff optimization and dr control for wrrfs 4 2 peak demand mitigation and energy cost optimization one of the initial objectives of the study was to identify the impact of reject water scheduling on power demand mitigation the results indicate that the shifting scenarios are effective in reducing the morning and evening peak demands based on the control strategies presented in this study 38 5 and 63 4 power demand reduction compared to average power demand in the morning and evening peak respectively could be archieved without sacrificing effluent quality however only s d reduces both peaks from the yearly average energy consumption profile the daily peak demand periods for bsm2 occur at approximately 11 30 and 20 30 unlike the peak times of an energy system ireland which occur here at approximately 09 30 and 18 00 the demand profile from wastewater treatment processes is delayed in comparison to the system power demand therefore reject water shifting strategies can exploit the difference between the electrical peak demand and that of the wrrfs themselves to take advantage of wrrf capacity at lower electricity tariff time periods this study also had the objective of analysing peak demand shifting in the context of an energy system such as in ireland practical implementation of the reject water load shifting strategy described here will be partly dependent on the electricity tariff structure for example the fixed price tariff applied here was based upon the mean value of day night and dynamic pricing tariffs whereas it is normally a result of a negotiated contract between the wrrf and the electricity supplier the electricity cost under the fixed price scheme did not show an overall advantage over the other pricing structures since it was based upon a conservative hypothesis that the fixed price to be as the mean value of the system marginal price smp in addition the dynamic pricing structure followed the smp of the irish electricity market although such a dynamic pricing structure is not as yet a concept applied in practice since real time pricing has not yet been implemented however it is plausible to assume that such a pricing structure or a variant thereof could become a reality in the future in the context of significant renewable energy generation and the rollout of advanced metering infrastructure ami although strategy s b achieves increased cumulative power demand percentiles below 50 kw 70 3 indicating that a lower power demand occurs more frequently this does not lead to reduced energy consumption or lower energy costs one of the reasons for this is that increased cumulative percentiles above 100 kw 4 6 cannot be neglected since there is a strong impact on the total energy consumption and energy cost especially with a dynamic pricing structure the increased energy cost reveals the necessity to develop more dynamic control approaches and better understanding and forecasting of future energy pricing 4 3 limitations and perspectives since wastewater treatment plants normally pay the industrial electricity price it is important to understand more about how the price is formed as well as energy market operations dereli et al 2020 as mentioned in the introduction energy electricity markets are transitioning into an environment of greater complexity in pricing with extra charging or billing options such as peak demand charges hypothetically wrrfs can implement demand response programs operating in restricted sympathy with a price based input recognising that the real time price may differ from the day ahead price particularly in a power system which contains a high share of variable renewables a real time reject water shifting strategy that takes into account a varying electricity price could improve the precision and accuracy on wrrf control in order to better balance effluent quality and energy cost furthermore whether the savings obtained from providing demand reponse activities as well as price differentials in dynamic tariffs can compensate for the necessary cost on infrastructure and enabling controls and communications becomes a priority concern o connell et al 2014 for wrrf operators wrrf operators could consider having other control strategies i e do and nhx controls to couple with reject water scheduling for a long term and plant wide energy saving and demand response performance in addition application of the shifting strategies and the real case scenario could be further developed to obtain the required capabilities more automatically the shifting strategies illustrated here could be refined based upon influent profile features such as weather holiday periods or day of the week similarly introducing remote upstream sensors for the influent flow characteristics or influent forecasting could be introduced to improve reject water shifting as part of real time monitoring or day ahead forecast control the reject water shifting strategy presented here adopted a systems approach considering the management of wastewater treatment energy effieciency operational cost and power system interactions assessment tools for demand response in wastewater treatment processes could be further developed including consideration of related carbon emissions social behaviour impact from the upper stream of sewer demand response water resourse management for the water food energy nexus etc the selection and optimization over reject water strategies can be further determined with the balance of multi objectives tradeoff upon stakeholder preferences regulation of water and wastewater treatment is a critical part of the energy system and is becoming a more stringent requirement consequently the energy demand for water and wastewater treatment is a critical portion of demand for wrrfs in order to implement a demand response program within wrrfs for example reject water scheduling strategies as in this paper must consider the regulation variance i e effluent limits and requirement geographically and spatially as well as the potential challenges and barriers from the energy transition in the power system it will also be meaningful to study the impact of the demand response from wrrfs on the power system kirchem et al 2020 5 conclusion the control of reject water in a waste water resource recovery facility a low volume but high nitrogen containing stream has been demonstrated to provide demand response potential while also improving effluent quality and potentially providing electricity cost savings in the context of a time of use price tariff overall reject water scheduling control strategies indicate the potential to reduce peak power demand lower long term electricity costs under different pricing structures maintaining effluent quality at an acceptable standard this study has illustrated several reject water shifting strategies and presented a potential methodology for wrrf operators to apply as a tool to mitigate peak demand and achieve electricity cost savings future studies on dynamic scheduling strategies could examine real time monitoring or day ahead price forecasting as an assessment tool for wrrf demand response while investigating the impact of wrrf peak demand reductions on the power system declaration of competing interest the authors
