24915,the global biogeochemical cycles gbcs are extremely important biosphere functions critical to the maintenance of conditions necessary for all life importantly perturbation of the gbcs has the potential to affect the structure and functioning of the earth system while biogeochemistry research to date has largely focused on natural processes human economic activities are increasingly recognised as integral components of the gbcs in this paper we develop a novel systems model the environmental social accounting matrix esam of coupled gbcs explicitly covering carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur with a particularly focus on the environment economy interface we illustrate diagrammatically the level at which the global economy through its transformation of useful resources i e raw materials into residuals i e wastes pollutants emission appropriates biogeochemical processes then through an application lens we discuss the esam s potential applications and extensions the esam represents one of only a few attempts to develop an integrated model of the earth system explicitly capturing the interaction in the element based gbcs between both natural and human processes keywords biogeochemical cycles material flow accounts anthropocene environment economy exchanges systems ecology 1 introduction the global cycling of carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p sulphur s hydrogen oxygen potassium chlorine iodine and many other elements are recognised as critical processes provided by the biosphere the global biogeochemical cycles gbcs are essential to maintaining and regulating the conditions for all life they continually supply scare elements needed by ecological systems for biotic metabolism their role in stabilising temperature humidity salinity acidity and other environmental conditions and their ability to convert toxic waste products from one form of life into nutrients for another ayres 1993 smil 2002 anthropocentrically they are also fundamental to the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services including food and raw material production and the provision of aesthetic recreational and spiritual values millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 systems ecology research on the earth system biogeochemistry has focused largely on the natural components of the cycles increasing recognition of system interdependencies within the gbc related environmental problems including global climate change widespread acidification of soils and waters and eutrophication of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems has highlighted the role played by human activities it is now recognised that humans are increasingly influencing and appropriating the gbcs catton 1982 vitousek et al 1986 1997 rojstaczer et al 2001 denman et al 2007 haberl et al 2007 venetoulis and talberth 2008 filippelli 2008 canfield et al 2010 van der voet et al 2000 thus many commentators prefer to use the term anthropo biogeochemical cycles system scientists have conceptualised the gbcs as a sequence of transformation processes and reservoirs that can be represented schematically as stocks linked by flows as stated by ayres 1993 p 203 the condition for stability in these cycles is easily stated the stocks in each compartment or reservoir must remain constant at least on average and for this condition to be met the inflows into each compartment must be balanced exactly on average by outflows if however the condition is not satisfied we must infer that the stock in some compartment s is accumulating at the expense of another compartment s while we may be assured that the gbcs contain balancing feedback structures that enable system regulation following perturbation the threat is that we may eventually reach a point where self regulating feedbacks are insufficient to maintain the system within a desirable state for humans constraining the scale of human activity relative to the regenerative capacity of the gbcs thus has normative weight it is a prerequisite to the achievement of distributive justice and hence strong sustainability in this paper we holistically trace the interactions between human and environment components of the gbcs for the 2004 year using elemental mass flows we present part of the environmental social accounting matrix esam a novel systems model which comprehensively captures the operation of the gbcs for c n p and s this paper focuses on a novel comprehensive accounting of the interface between the environment and economy recording the use of raw materials and production of residuals i e wastes pollutants emissions by human activities in this regard our work compliments but also significantly extends the industrial ecology work of singh and bakshi 2014 and fujimori and matsuoka 2007 importantly a full implementation of the esam would provide a novel comprehensive accounting of c n p and s elemental mass flows by all ecological and economic processes for all natural and human ecosystems that exist within the biosphere the structure of our paper follows section 2 introduces the esam through a systems diagram accompanying mathematical notation with key concept definitions and classifications section 3 derives the elemental mass flows associated with the environment economic interactions using a material flow analysis mfa approach we derive inter alia gbc flows for direct material inputs e g biomass extraction and production minerals and fossil fuel extraction and industrial n fixation waste generation livestock excrement solid waste coal ash p and wastewater waste treatment crop residuals livestock excrement solid wastes and wastewater and residual generation atmospheric emissions and disposal to land section 4 illustrates graphically using sankey diagrams the importance of human activity within the gbcs and providing some fascinating insights into global environmental economic interactions using an application orientated lens the key strengths and weaknesses of the esam are discussed in section 5 the paper ends with concluding comments please note a complete set of accounts for the c n p and s elemental mass flows encompassing all the environment economic interactions presented in this paper is available online in supplementary table 3 2 environmental social accounting matrix 2 1 the environment economy system fig 1 depicts the global environment economy system key features include 1 exogenous energy inputs e g solar energy crustal heat and tidal energy and waste heat output 2 physical flow of matter energy within and between the environment and economy and 3 flow of commodities within the economy system all processes involving materials are subject to the materials balance principle ayres and kneese 1969 furthermore if energy transformations were to be fully accounted for currently our work focuses on materials then energy would also be conserved i e as per the principles of energetics 2 1 1 system stocks and flows 2 1 1 1 physical economic stocks and flows matter energy enter the economy in the form of raw materials and then following transformation within the economy circulate in the form of goods and services and labour a small portion of this matter energy becomes tied up within reserves of capital e g buildings and in various stocks of products e g food a significant portion enters waste products some of which is recycled or re used eventually all matter energy crosses the economic system boundary as an output to the environment in the form of residuals and waste heat this industrial metabolism ayres 1989 ayres and simonis 1994 is analogous to processes within ecological systems but unlike the economic activity natural processes further close material loops by cycling resources and wastes interchangeably 2 1 1 2 physical environmental stocks and flows the environment is divided into four separate spheres the atmosphere oceans terrestrial biosphere and lithosphere each sphere is in turn comprised of major stocks for example vegetation and soils within the terrestrial biosphere the gbcs encapsulate all exchanges occurring between these stocks external energy inputs solar tidal crustal heat drive the biosphere processes in their entirety the gbcs are highly complex and self organised systems maintained at a disequilibrium with respect to thermodynamics schlesinger 1997 2 1 1 3 economic monetary flows although not focused on in this paper the within economy flows of money are generally in the opposite direction to flows of materials energy and information odum 1994 1996 1998 the demand for materials goods services or commodities is the primary driver of matter energy flows through the global economy pricing through markets is used as an information value meter to facilitate comparison and transaction see for example hausmann and hidalgo 2011 and hidalgo and hausmann 2009 producers firms industries etc are responsible for the production of commodities while final consumers largely households use commodities for satisfaction of human needs or wants government acts both as a producer and consumer of commodities on behalf of the people the extent to which the environment is made available for economic use is determined by ethics and values which guide rules and regulations governing human behaviour and acts of stewardship 2 2 static system framework in this paper we describe the global environment economy system as shown in fig 1 in accordance with the esam framework set out in fig 2 mass flow accounts are derived for c n p and s covering extraction of raw materials from the environment by the economy matrix r p with element r m j p describes the use of environmental commodity m by economic industry j where m 1 μ and j 1 σ and vector r o describes the use of ecological commodity m by households while matrix w p and vector w o describe the release of ecological commodity m by respectively industry j and households the remainder of the esam which encompasses flows within the environment and economy is included for completeness the esam permits mixed units with a tilde indicating those matrices and vectors that are specified in purely physical i e mass energy terms while the remaining matrices vectors and scalars may be measured in either physical or monetary terms within environment flows are thus recorded in physical terms while within economy flows may be either recorded in physical or monetary terms despite the importance of understanding and monitoring humanity s reliance and impact on environmental systems including by way of recording and monitoring physical flows there is an overwhelming dearth of this type of information presented in an integrated holistic manner consequently derivation of the esam has been an extremely onerous task involving collation of a myriad of disparate and ad hoc information sources and application of a variety of bottom up and top down estimation methods the esam mfa accounts are the most detailed and comprehensive information available on c n p and s flows for the global environment economic system in compiling the mass flow accounts reference has been made particularly to the concepts and definitions developed under mfa a physical accounting approach that adheres to the materials balance principle and is concerned particularly with recording mass flowing into a system the stock changes within that system and the resulting output flows to other systems mfa allows for application of internationally recognised classification systems that enable it to be directly linked to the united nations un 1993 system of national accounts this in turn enables mfa to be applied at various scales and for various types of systems e g firms aggregated sectors city region economies national economies and for the globe although many mfa studies measure total mass inputs outputs of a system a number have also concentrated on measuring specific materials or elements examples include maag et al 1997 for mercury graedel et al 2002 for copper antikainen et al 2004 for n and p through the finland forestry industry and cordell et al 2009 for p flows through the global food production and consumption system other studies have developed similar mass flow accounts for biogeochemical flows including the european science foundation s nitrogen in europe programme sutton et al 2011a and the c n and p supply and use tables by fujimori and matsuoka 2007 an important point to note is that the biogeochemical exchanges between the environment and economy are described by not only the economic sectors responsible for the exchange but also by the environmental commodity stock which inputs are sourced from or outputs are destined to 2 3 definitions and classifications the mfa classification system provides a convenient typology that ensures all mass flows to and from the global economic are accounted for and that system boundary issues are minimised to help determine the environment economy exchanges all material flows in the esam are coded to the 58 sectors industries plus households of global trade analysis project 1 1 refer to www gtap agecon purdue edu 7 0 gtap which ensures compatibility to the within economy accounts and adopts the internationally recognised un central product classification and international standard industrial classification systems see supplementary tables 1 and 2 for concordances gtap is a publicly available database and utilised by many economic practitioners for applied general equilibrium modelling and trade analysis specifically the materials flow analysis accounts for 6 different types of human processes i e waste production 2 2 as previously stated we have not focused on describing the within economy flows an exception however is the inclusion of separate accounts for waste production and waste treatment residual production waste treatment non processed flows waste recycling use and direct material inputs by 58 different sectors 57 economic industries plus households by 134 c n p and s environmental commodities stocks despite the sparse nature of this matrix 3 3 which is 348 rows 6 types x 58 sectors by 134 columns environmental commodities or 46 632 cells 4 596 non blank cells it is not possible to present as a table within this paper instead it appears in supplementary table 3 substances extracted from the environment are frequently separated into two major categories direct material inputs and non processed material flows adriaanse et al 1997 eurostat 2001 the eurostat 2001 p 27 mfa manual defines direct material inputs as all solid liquid and gaseous materials that enter the economy for further use in production or consumption processes these are further classified into five principal groups biomass extracted through agriculture forestry fishing etc materials for biomass production where primary production processes occur inside the economy minerals fossil fuels and unreactive n for use in industrial n fixation non processed material flows are further separated into two subcomponents comprising unused extraction on the input or extraction side and disposal of unused extraction on the output or disposal side eurostat 2001 unused extraction flows have been defined by eurostat 2001 p 21 as materials extracted or otherwise moved on purpose and by means of technology which are not fit or intended for use or materials that never enter the economic system and thus can be described as physical market externalities in a way non processed material flows can be viewed as akin to concurrent material input and residual flows but omit any processing of these materials within the economy examples include mining overburden soil excavated and moved during construction fish by catch and wood harvesting losses non processed material flows capture important biogeochemical processes arising directly out of human activities namely 1 organic matter combustion during human induced vegetation fires 2 biological n fixation within agricultural systems 3 n fixation within internal combustion engines and 4 emissions from rice agriculture inclusion of 1 and 4 ensures that atmospheric emissions attributed to anthropogenic processes are consistent with the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc methodological guide ipcc 2006 similarly n fixation covered by 2 and 3 is typically attributed to the economy gruber and galloway 2008 canfield et al 2010 eurostat 2001 define outputs to the environment as all materials released to air land or water so that human control is lost over the location and composition of the materials released the term residual is used to describe the commodities released to air and land with the latter including freshwater residuals discharged to land include a number of flows often referred to as dissipative uses for example fertilisers and materials spread on fields 3 derivation of material flow accounts this section is devoted to describing the various methods and datasets utilised in the compilation of the mfa accounts that record environment economy and vice versa exchanges 3 1 direct material inputs 3 1 1 biomass extraction the esam covers three major categories of biomass extraction grazed consumption of biomass by domestic animals wood and timber removals and global fish harvests omitted are a few smaller flows e g honey mushrooms berries and herbs starting with grazed consumption of biomass international agricultural databases such as those published by the food and agricultural organisation fao contain data only on market feed and fodder crops fed to livestock comprehensive estimates of biomass grazed by livestock or otherwise mowed for livestock feed are unavailable krausmann et al 2008a b calculate the grazing gap required to sustain the world s livestock in addition to market crops as 3 84 pg of dry matter for the year 2000 accounting for increases in global livestock numbers and if grazed biomass has the same stoichiometry as terrestrial vegetation 790c 7 6n 1 p 3 1s based on bohlin et al 1983 then this produces total flows of 2 00 pg c 22 4 tg n 6 5 tg p and 20 9 tg s these flows are apportioned among different livestock types and gtap sectors based on default feed intake ratios kg head day reported by the ipcc 1996 accounting for the proportion of each livestock type reared in confinement and thus not involved in grazing smil 1999 krausmann et al 2008a b also provide an estimate of the total wood harvest in 2000 as 1 94 pg dry matter their calculation is based on harvest volumes reported in the temperate and boreal forest resource assessment 2000 database united nations 2000 and fao statistics fao 2005 along with adjustments for unreported bark volumes in some parts of the world significant quantities of woody biomass are gathered from not only forests and groves but also bushes rubber plantations roadside and backyard trees to support household fuel demands smil 2008 a household wood extraction flow of 0 45 pg c is adopted in the esam derived from the difference between the fao wood fuel estimates and the total wood required to satisfy residential wood fuel demands fernades et al 2007 overall the total wood removal flows are calculated as 1 23 pg c 13 8 tg n 4 0 tg p and 12 9 tg s out of these flows 59 percent is allocated to the household sector and the remainder to the forestry industry fernades et al 2007 although human fish harvests have had significant impacts on marine ecosystems with for example at least a quarter of global commercial marine stocks estimated to be either overexploited or completely depleted fao 2005 the actual input of biomass to the economy associated with fish harvests is small when compared with other flows fish crustacean mollusc and so on capture in marine fishing areas is reported by the fao 2008 as 83 8 tg with an additional 16 7 tg produced through aquaculture production these values translate to a total of 11 2 tg c if c makes up around one ninth of the total wet weight of fish strathmann 1967 pauly and christensen 1995 note however that because harvested fish constitute a major feed input to aquaculture systems hasan and halwart 2009 simply adding the marine capture and aquaculture flows together will result in double counting of material inputs to the economy the esam thus includes a net fish harvest flow calculated by subtracting the estimated mass of fish used as inputs to marine aquaculture tacon and hasan 2007 from the total mass of fish produced from marine wild harvests plus aquaculture the derived c flow of 10 5 tg is then multiplied by the stoichiometry for marine consumers 103c 16 5n 1 p based on murray 1992 to calculate the associated flows of n p and s 3 1 2 biomass production in the esam crop production is a process residing within the economy the total element content of crops is calculated as 1 990 tg c 71 600 gg n 2 980 gg p and 11 430 gg s table 1 these values are calculated via a bottom up approach in brief this involved extracting estimates of total global production measured in t for some 200 different crop types from the fao food and agricultural commodities production database then multiplying the production values for each crop by dry matter content ratios and subsequently element to dry matter content ratios for each of c n p and s elements the relevant ratios are derived from a variety of values reported in the literature mishra and shukla 1986 ipcc 1996 smil 1999 gundersen et al 2000 vleeshouwers and verhagen 2002 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 unfortunately there is a paucity of information on the s content of crops to generate an approximation of the s needed for crop production the s p ratio for terrestrial vegetation is applied the fao data do not cover aboveground crop residuals such as straw stover and leaves to estimate the flow of crop residuals the fao production data for each crop are multiplied by a residual to crop ratio ipcc 1996 smil 1999 yevich and logan 2003 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 krausmann et al 2008a b once again the resulting estimates must be multiplied by dry matter content ratios followed by element to dry matter composition ratios to derive c n p and s content estimates although less apparent crop production generates significant quantities of belowground residuals primarily roots left during harvests this flow along with crop losses to animal pests is grouped into the non processed material flows category but is outlined here for convenience these residuals are estimated to be 608 7 tg c krausmann et al 2008a b it is assumed that belowground residuals exhibit the same element stoichiometry as terrestrial vegetation the belowground residual flow for each element is then disaggregated among gtap sectors according to each sector s contribution to crop production and aboveground residual production before crop harvesting a relatively significant quantity of plant biomass may be consumed or destroyed by agricultural pests although this matter is lost before it is can be applied in economic activities these material flows are a by product of agriculture and hence treated as a non processed material flow oerke 2006 provides estimates of the loss in yield of wheat rice maize potatoes soybeans and cotton crops for the period 2001 03 total losses from animal pests alone are estimated to range between 11 0 percent of actual yield for wheat to 24 1 percent for rice it is assumed that the amount of plant biomass consumed by animal pests is 15 percent of the total c biomass produced in crops and crop residuals 3 1 3 minerals extraction although humans extract a vast array of minerals from the lithosphere this paper is concerned only with those containing appreciable quantities of c n p and s table 2 in terms of c caco3 minerals including limestone marble chalk and dolomite are by far the most important with demands for use both in industrial processes e g fertiliser manufacture and in construction e g aggregates cement despite the economic importance of these minerals only limited data are available on worldwide demand while information does exist on bulk construction minerals in the un industrial commodity statistics and united states geological survey usgs databases problems of incomplete global coverage and the reporting of caco3 minerals in conjunction with other minerals exist additionally of the mass flows recorded in the literature behrens et al 2007 schandl and eisenmenger 2006 steinberger et al 2010 it is difficult to determine the likely caco3 content a pragmatic bottom up approach is therefore applied this involves identifying industrial c residuals that are likely to stem from the use of caco3 as a feedstock estimating the mass of caco3 required for these industrial processes and then summing over all the industrial processes no attempt is made to quantify the mass of limestone used directly as a construction material keeping with the mass balance principle thus limestone construction wastes must be excluded from the calculation of c waste and residual flows the emission database for global atmospheric research edgar reports emissions from cement 245 tg c and lime 53 tg c manufacture the database also reports an emission flow of 14 tg c associated with other mineral production although a proportion of the latter emissions will originate from fossil fuel feedstocks it is likely that soda ash production and use relying on caco3 as a feedstock is one source ipcc 1996 the us environmental protection authority usepa reports us emissions from soda ash production and use for the early 2000s as 1 tg c yr 1 and estimates that this is around one quarter of the global total usepa 2010 other principal industrial uses of caco3 involve limestone and dolomite use in metal manufacturing glass making and flue gas desulphurisation using emission ratios derived from the us greenhouse gas ghg inventory usepa 2010 global emissions from these sources are estimated at just over 10 tg c summing all these categories together produces a total global demand for caco3 in industrial processes of at least 314 tg c this demand is incorporated in the esam via an extraction flow from the carbonate minerals stock minerals containing po4 3 are also mined from the lithosphere primarily for use as fertilisers there is a variety of other minor industrial uses for p including in the production of food and beverages cleaning products and flame retardants for treatment of potable water and in processing of ceramics the usgs 2004 estimates po4 3 rock production at 19 8 tg p more than 90 percent of mined s is used in the production of sulphuric acid principally for fertiliser production brimblecombe 2005 smaller amounts of s are used in the manufacture of gunpowder insecticides fungicides medicines wood products and paper products this s is obtained directly from the lithosphere in the form of elemental s from sulphide pyrite minerals but also as a by product from metal ore and natural gas extraction and processing the usgs 2006 reports total global production of industrial s to be 32 100 gg this does not include s extracted from the lithosphere but unable to be captured for industrial use of importance are gaseous emissions primarily so2 from metal production estimated at 5 460 gg s adding these values together produces an estimated s extraction flow of at least 37 600 gg 3 1 4 fossil fuel extraction the rate at which humans extract c from the lithosphere in fossil fuels is almost equal in magnitude to c extraction in biomass the us energy information administration useia reports total world production of coal as 6 223 million short tons for 2004 this equates to some 3 160 tg c based on the quantities of c emissions released during combustion marland et al 2007 and accounting for the use of coal as a feedstock in other industrial processes a coal mass ratio of 49 20c 0 85n 0 20p 1s is used to estimate the other element flows associated with coal extraction white et al 1984 vorres 1989 smith et al 1994 mastalerz et al 2003 kabe et al 2004 higman and van der burgt 2008 it also accounts for the relative contribution of different types of coal anthracite bituminous and lignite within total production production of crude oil including condensate is reported by the useia as 72 5 million barrels per day which translates to a total extraction of around 3 62 pg the mass content of oil is estimated to be 85 5 percent c 0 3 percent n and 1 8 percent s hyne 1991 referring again to the useia datasets production of dry natural gas is estimated as 97 000 billion cubic feet the useia further reports 7 5 million barrels per day of petroleum produced from natural gas plant liquids if dry natural gas has an average c mass content of 76 percent and 83 percent for natural gas plant liquids ryder and burruss 2003 the total mass of c extracted in natural gas for petroleum and natural gas production is 2 010 tg 3 1 5 industrial n fixation industrial n fixation refers to a group of processes that enable dinitrogen to combine chemically with other elements to form reactive n compounds such as nh3 no3 or nitrites the haber bosch process first commercialised in 1913 is by far the most important industrial form of n fixation it involves heating n and hydrogen under very high temperature and pressure along with a chemical catalyst thus producing synthetic nh3 around four fifths of the reactive n formed from this process is used for fertiliser manufacture including as a feedstock for urea and for various nitrates so4 2 and po4 3 and the rest for various other industrial processes such as production of explosives dyes and fibres domene and ayres 2001 estimates of the total quantity of n fixed through the haber bosch process vary quite substantially in the literature for the 1990s the global rate has been reported at around 100 tg n gruber and galloway 2008 smil 2002 while a more recent source reports a rate of around 130 tg n for 2008 canfield et al 2010 a rate of 128 tg n is adopted in the esam 3 2 waste generation four primary categories of wastes are covered by the esam livestock excrement crop residuals solid wastes and wastewater the solid wastes category is further broken down into eight sub categories 1 paper and cardboard 2 textiles 3 vegetable and animal 4 rubber and leather 5 plastics 6 petroleum products and solvents 7 phosphogypsum and other industrial s wastes and 8 coal ash p 3 2 1 livestock excrement element flows in livestock excrement are calculated separately for 16 different livestock types table 6 overall by multiplying fao livestock population data by estimated manure production rates smil 1999 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 it is calculated that some 2 48 pg of excrement was produced cattle alone are responsible for 60 percent of this total with the next most important sources being buffaloes 8 percent and pigs 8 percent applying n and p content ratios smil 1999 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 the total flows associated with excrement production are 98 tg n and 4 570 gg p c flows are separately estimated as 617 tg based on data provided by prairie and duarte 2007 while s slows are approximated by the stoichiometry of zoomass 115 8c 14 5n 1 0p 0 2s based on elser et al 2000 and sterner and elser 2002 importantly only excrement produced by animals in confinement is added to the waste accounts the remaining quantities of excrement which are likely to be deposited onto fields are treated as a residual flow from the economy directly to the litter detritus stock 3 2 2 municipal solid waste solid waste generation rates and composition varies across the world unfortunately only a small number of countries have comprehensive waste data covering different types of wastes and treatment methods to estimate global solid waste production for sub categories 1 to 6 above reference is made to the region specific default parameters specified in the ipcc s guidelines for national ghg inventories ipcc 2006 calculations based on these default values are undertaken at the level of individual countries and then aggregated to provide a global total actual data from available national ghg inventories and other literature sources world bank 2005 phuntsho et al 2010 dhokhikah and trihadiningrum 2012 are substituted into the calculations as appropriate unfortunately the ipcc guidelines do not provide a method for estimating municipal solid waste production by rural populations within developing countries while these populations may practice dispersed types of waste disposal with high levels of recycling they are no doubt still responsible for significant wastes with no information available on the magnitude and composition of these wastes we only include estimates of waste originating from plant and animal materials i e biogenic wastes for each developing country the quantity of biogenic waste produced per capita in rural areas is simply set equivalent to the per capita rate of vegetable and animal waste production by the country s urban population the total waste is estimated at 265 tg c very little information is available on the likely element content by solid waste type ipcc guidelines however require reporting countries to track the degradable organic c doc and fossil organic c of waste and provide a set of default values for doc fossil c and total c content for wastes of different types applying these default values it is estimated that the c flow contained within municipal solid waste is around 440 tg table 3 paper and cardboard wastes contribute around 35 percent of this total the n and s flows associated with vegetable animal rubber and leather wastes are determined from the relevant c flows by applying stoichiometric ratios for these materials as taken from chandrappa and das 2012 the p content of vegetable and animal wastes however is approximated from the average c p content of food crops while the n s and p flows for wood waste are estimated from the stoichiometry of terrestrial vegetation finally a stoichiometry for textile wastes is estimated by taking the chemical composition of various textile yarns including nylon polyester plastic cotton wool silk and then calculating the likely contribution of these yarns to total textile production based on production data from the un industrial commodity statistics database 3 2 3 industrial solid waste industrial solid waste generation and composition varies significantly between countries depending on the types of industries industrial processes and technologies employed the ipcc guidelines do not contain a set of default production and composition parameters for use in calculating industrial solid waste accounts countries with no national data are encouraged to use data from like countries eurostat waste generation and treatment statistics are used as a proxy for the likely production rates tonnes per us million for waste types 1 6 by industry this comprehensive waste dataset records waste production by both type of waste and generating sector note that the methods used to estimate the c n p and s composition of these wastes are the same as those employed for municipal solid waste table 3 provides a summary of the estimated element flows based on an analysis of s materials flows within the us ober 2002 inorganic s wastes are mainly generated in the form of phosphogypsum synthetic gypsum produced during po4 3 fertiliser production and in petroleum refining sulphuric acid is the major feedstock for these industrial processes ober 2002 estimates consumption of sulphuric acid in us po4 3 fertiliser production at just over 7 tg s for 2000 this value is scaled to a global estimate for 2004 using world po4 3 fertiliser production statistics while also accounting for differences in fertiliser types and quantity of sulphuric acid required ober 2002 phosphogypsum waste production from fertiliser manufacturing is estimated to be 20 tg s the usgs 2006 estimates consumption of s within the us for petroleum refining as 4 tg this is scaled to a global estimate of 19 tg based on petroleum product statistics contained within the un industrial commodity statistics database a very small proportion is already accounted for in the wastewater estimates for petroleum manufacturing all remaining inorganic s emitted from petroleum manufacturing as a solid waste is deposited to landfills 3 2 4 coal ash p this is a special category of solid waste that does not fit neatly into either the municipal or industrial solid waste categories although the majority of p contained within coal is expected to be found in bottom ash following combustion szpunar 1992 some p is also likely to be emitted as fly ash that eventually settles onto the land or ocean a proportion of coal p is also likely to end up in economic products e g p absorbed into metals during steel manufacture as there is limited information on the likely size of these flows it is assumed in the esam that all s contained within coal ultimately ends up as solid waste released to landfills 3 2 5 municipal wastewater like solid waste the calculation of wastewater flows is undertaken at the level of individual countries and then aggregated to provide a global total the method stipulated in the ipcc guidelines for calculating wastewater generation originating from household water use is based on per capita emission rates bod5 person day 4 4 bod5 is the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed in five days by biological processes breaking down organic matter that vary between regions ipcc 2006 correction factors are used to account for bod from different industries co discharged with domestic wastewater e g restaurants butchers and supermarkets applying these rates as well as superior data from national inventories where available the total domestic wastewater generated over the study year is estimated as 61 1 tg c assuming an organic c to bod mass ratio of 0 53 san diego mcglone et al 2000 ratios of n bod and p bod are applied to estimate a loading of 22 200 gg n and 4 240 gg p the mass of s in wastewater is derived from the calculated s in sludge see section 3 3 below if the proportion of s removed in the sludge out of total wastewater s is the same as the proportion of p van drecht et al 2009 3 2 6 industrial wastewater a summary of the c n p and s contained within industrial wastewater is provided in table 4 the derivation of industrial wastewater element flows is based on a bottom up approach involving calculations for nine industry groups food manufacturing gtap industries 19 26 pulp and paper manufacturing 31 petroleum refining 32 leather 29 textiles 27 chemicals 33 wood products 30 ferrous metals 35 and other metals 36 for each industry group the total mass of organic c toc contained within wastewater is derived as t o c e r w w e c c c where e denotes the quantity of economic commodities produced by the relevant activity measured typically in either us or tonnes rwwec is the rate of wastewater production per unit of produced economic commodity and cc is the organic c composition of wastewater gc g cod 5 5 cod measures the total organic material available for chemical oxidation the values of rwwec for leather textiles chemicals wood products ferrous metals and other metals are expressed as g cod us of commodity and are derived from reported wastewater production values in national ghg inventories combined with sector output values contained within gtap for the food pulp and paper and petroleum manufacturing industries physical rwwec rates i e g cod t are instead applied doorn et al 1997 the relevant data on commodity production in mass terms are obtained from the un industrial commodity statistics and fao foresstat databases san diego mcglone et al 2000 provide factors to convert the cod within industrial wastewater to estimates of organic c n and p content estimates of the s content of wastewater are produced for each sector by multiplying the mass of n contained within the sector s wastewater by an assumed ratio of s to n for industries involved in the processing of animal products gtap industries 19 20 and 29 the ratio is based on the stoichiometry of humans sterner and elser 2002 while for industries 21 and 23 28 the ratios are derived from the calculated element contents of associated crops in the case of industry 22 a s n ratio of sewage sludge werther and ogada 1999 is applied and for industries 30 and 31 the stoichiometry of terrestrial vegetation to complete the calculation of industrial wastewater flows special consideration is given to the generation of inorganic waste s by industrial activities as already explained significant quantities of s are consumed in petroleum refining an average s cod mass ratio of 0 0092 for petroleum refinery wastewater altaş and büyükgüngör 2008 enables calculation of inorganic wastewater s for industry 32 ober 2002 also identifies copper ore processing as a significant producer of waste s originating from the use of sulphuric acid the us rate of sulphuric acid consumption by copper ore processing is reported as 452 000 t s usgs 2006 this is scaled to a global estimate of 5 57 tg s based on relative output of copper from world mines compared with us mines as reported by the usgs 2006 3 3 waste treatment this section describes the quantities of wastes that re enter the economy as reused or recycled materials and the treatment of remaining wastes for final disposal although the actual release of waste products into the environment following treatment fits within the residual generation component of the conceptual framework many of these flows are however outlined here for convenience 3 3 1 crop residuals three principal economic uses of crop residuals are identified animal feed biofuels and paper production starting with animal feed these mass flows are calculated as a f e p f c e r p f c r where afe is the mass of element e contained within crop residuals used as feed pfce is the mass of element e in pasture and forage crops and rpfcr is the ratio of crop residuals to pasture and forage crops within global animal feed the values for pfce are obtained directly from the crop production calculations described in section 3 1 while rpfcr is derived from wirsenius 2003 the resulting estimates of crop residuals used for animal feed are 416 tg c 5 430 gg n 894 gg p and 2 860 gg s the total mass of crop residual c consumed as household biofuel 503 tg is calculated from estimates of household biofuel emissions if around 90 percent of crop c is volatised as an emission yevich and logan 2003 the associated n p and s flows 6 570 gg 1 640 gg and 3 460 gg respectively are then derived from the c flow by applying the stoichiometry of crop residuals according to the work of yevich and logan 2003 only a few types of crop residuals are used in significant quantities as industrial fuel using yevich and logan s 2003 data and the crop production totals from above the estimates presented in table 5 are generated the fao s forestat database records total global production of fibre pulp from materials other than wood and recycled paper as 1 69 mt given the relatively small size of the element flows in question it is simply assumed that the necessary materials originate entirely from crop residuals and that approximately half the input materials are wasted during pulp production the input of crop residuals for paper production is calculated as 30 4 tg of dry matter translating to 17 8 tg c 232 gg n 38 3 gg p and 122 gg s based on the stoichiometry of fibrous crops the quantities of crop residuals burned within agricultural fields are described in section 3 4 all remaining crop residuals i e the difference between crop residuals production and crop residuals used for animal feed biofuels and paper production are calculated to be 891 tg c 9 810 tg n 1 050 gg p and 516 gg s these are treated as an input from the economy to the litter detritus stock 3 3 2 livestock excrement the likely fate of c n p and s contained within excrement produced by livestock varies across the world depending on farming practices grazing animals are assumed to deposit their wastes directly onto land these flows table 6 are calculated by multiplying the estimates of manure production by livestock type by the proportion of the livestock population not reared in confinement smil 1999 of the excrement n discharged directly to land 22 percent is treated as a flow to the atmospheric nh3 stock due to the almost immediate volatisation of this gas laubach et al 2013 the remaining elements contained within these flows are treated as a discharge from the economy to the litter detritus stock the n content of manures from confined animals is greatly reduced during collection storage and handling of the wastes the proportions of collected manure n volatised as nh3 are taken from smil 1999 and range from 28 to 36 percent depending on livestock type total emissions of nh3 are calculated as 14 760 gg n2o is also produced during manure storage and treatment via the combined processes of nitrification and denitrification the literature generally agrees that n2o production requires the presence of either nitrites or nitrates in an anaerobic environment additionally conditions preventing reduction of n2o to n2 such as a low ph or limited moisture must be present ipcc 2006 the ipcc tier 1 method for estimating n2o emissions entails allocating the total amount of n excretion from all livestock species to different types of manure management systems and then multiplying by an emission factor for each type of system this approach produces a global n2o emission rate of 447 gg total household consumption of manure as a fuel is estimated as 68 6 tg c 5 780 gg n and 516 gg p based on the biofuel emissions see section 3 4 while accounting for a proportion that escapes combustion the remaining mass contained within excrement produced by confined animals calculated as 252 tg c 21 200 gg n and 1 890 gg p must be released from agricultural systems back into the environment while most of these wastes will be employed as a form of fertiliser smil 1999 a proportion is also released as waste in either case the flows are treated as inputs to the litter detritus stock upon application to soils a further 15 percent of the n in excrement is volatised as nh3 smil 1999 3 3 3 solid wastes four broad types of treatment practices for solid wastes are covered recycling reuse incineration composting and release to landfills as with other waste related flows there is very little information at a global level to determine the quantities of wastes undergoing these different treatments the proportions by which total waste materials are distributed among waste treatment options are summarised in table 7 the c contained within incinerated and composted wastes is treated as direct atmospheric emissions of co2 and ch4 the edgar database records global ch4 emissions from waste incineration and other waste handling assumed to include composting as together less than 1 tg c even when adjusting for missing country data the estimated ch4 emissions are less than 1 tg c the remaining c within composted and incinerated wastes respectively calculated as 59 3 tg and 18 6 tg is assigned as a flow to the atmospheric co2 stock all n p and s within composted wastes are assigned simply as a flow to the respective element soil inorganic stocks as with c it is assumed that n p and s are all released into the environment during the year in which the wastes are generated although composting rates may be slower accounting for residual generation from incinerated wastes is more complex due to the production of n and s gas emissions emissions of n2 nox n2o and nh3 are estimated from emission factors e g t nh3 n per t of waste n which are in turn derived from national ghg inventories for residential biofuels and wood processing wastes see section 3 4 the resulting emissions are 231 gg n2 n 74 gg nox n 3 gg n2o n and 152 gg nh3 n approximately half the n contained within incinerated wastes remains following subtraction of gaseous emissions and is treated as a residual flow to the litter detritus stock similarly the p content of incinerated wastes is assigned as a flow to the litter detritus stock while for s the element content is assigned entirely to a gaseous emission of so2 the release of solid wastes into disposal sites is considered the point at which wastes leave the economy nevertheless we must also calculate gaseous emissions from landfills the ipcc 2006 methodology for estimating ch4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites is based on a first order decay function which assumes that the rate of doc loss from wastes is highest in the first few years of deposition and then gradually declines as the c is consumed this method requires historical waste disposal data to estimate present day emissions in this instance landfilled solid waste is back caste 55 years from the study year based on the rate of change in global real gross domestic product the estimated doc decomposed at solid waste disposal sites based on the ipcc methodology is 56 8 tg of the doc decomposed the default proportion released immediately as ch4 is 50 percent a proportion of the ch4 produced may however oxidise relatively quickly to co2 the default ipcc value for ch4 oxidation is zero although according to the guidelines values of up to 10 percent may apply in well managed solid waste disposal sites a value of 3 percent is applied producing a global emission for ch4 27 6 tg c and co2 29 3 tg c 3 3 4 wastewater wastewater treatment and discharge methods vary significantly between countries and between rural and urban locations applying ipcc guideline parameters for national ghg inventories ipcc 2006 it is estimated that around 54 percent of total domestic wastewater measured in c terms passes through sewers 22 percent is discharged to latrines 9 percent to septic tanks and the remainder is assumed untreated wastewater channelled by sewers to centralised treatment plants may undergo primary secondary and tertiary treatment with all stages resulting in the production of sewage sludge applying region specific rates for n and p removal in wastewater treatment van drecht et al 2009 and accounting for additional n removed through n2o and nh3 emissions it is estimated that around 1 140 gg n and 862 gg p is removed from domestic wastewater in sludge the c and s contained within sludge respectively 7 81 tg and 285 gg is also derived from the calculated n content based on reported ratios of n c and n s werther and ogada 1999 these sewage sludge residuals are allocated to the landfill solid waste stocks by element the remaining c n p and s contained within domestic wastewater is also discharged to the environment applying parameters specified by san diego mcglone et al 2000 regarding the apportionment of untreated effluent among organic and inorganic species 60 percent of the remaining n and 50 percent of the remaining p are assigned as flows to the terrestrial soil organic stocks and the balance to the soil inorganic stocks by element in the case of s the same shares as p are applied the ipcc guidelines specify a default maximum c emission capacity for domestic wastewater of 0 6 kg per kg of wastewater bod applying this value to the total estimated domestic wastewater production and then subtracting estimated ch4 emissions from wastewater handling gives a co2 emission flow of 32 8 tg the remaining 4 8 tg of wastewater c is assigned as a discharge to the soil organic c stock finally to allocate industrial wastewater c n p and s to receiving environmental stocks it is assumed that treatment processes for industrial wastewater in each country are approximately equivalent to that of domestic wastewater table 8 note however that the flow of inorganic wastewater s includes waste s produced during copper ore processing and petroleum refining 3 4 residual generation 3 4 1 atmospheric emissions tables 9 11 provide a summary of the different types of atmospheric emission flows included in the esam and the relevant literature data sources used in estimating each flow note that the adopted fossil fuel so2 emission flow excluding international shipping of 45 800 gg s is comprised of ten separate emission sub categories within the edgar database with the most important being public electricity and heat production 62 percent of the total emission and manufacturing industries and construction 23 percent the flow for public electricity and heat production is allocated entirely to industry 43 the manufacturing and construction flow is split on a pro rata basis among industries 18 42 and 46 using independently derived estimates of so2 emissions from combustion in these sectors these estimates are derived by first calculating the c content of coal crude oil and petroleum products combusted within each industry based on data recorded in gtap the quantities of c within fuels are then converted to quantities of s based on average c s ratios and finally multiplied by fuel specific scalars describing the proportion of fuel s oxidised during combustion ipcc 2006 the emission estimates noted in tables 9 11 for industrial biofuels wood residuals for each element are a sum of the estimated emissions from combustion of residuals generated during wood product and paper product manufacturing for the wood product manufacturing industry it is assumed that all wood residuals generated during production are combusted a global mass balance table for wood product manufacturing sector is constructed that based on the quantities of raw material inputs estimates the quantities of wood residuals generated as part of these calculations it is assumed 1 around 12 percent of raw timber is bark krausmann et al 2008a b 2 approximately 60 percent of the mass of harvested timber excluding fuel wood is used in manufacturing sawn wood sleepers and wood based panels with a residual generation rate of around one third forestat 3 and a further 9 percent of harvested timber is used in manufacturing other wood products foresstat with a residual generation rate of around 45 percent fujimori and matsuoka 2007 altogether wood residuals of nearly 150 tg c are estimated for the industry constructing a mass balance table for the global paper product manufacturing industry is similarly complex based on the reported production of pulpwood in foresstat it is estimated that around 15 percent of total forest timber removals are used for paper manufacturing adding to this inputs of recovered paper and crop residuals gives a total input of some 232 tg c to the industry of the c inputs to paper production foresstat reports 62 percent is accounted for in the mass of finished products and a further 9 percent is already included in the wastewater treatment accounts table 8 the remaining c is split among combusted black liquor 51 6 tg other combusted residuals 10 4 tg and solid wastes 5 5 tg côté et al 2002 usepa 2010 3 4 2 residuals disposed to land four principal mass flow categories are covered crop residuals synthetic fertilisers agricultural chemicals and livestock excrement table 12 the first and last categories are calculated in section 3 3 turning therefore to synthetic fertilisers tenkorang and lowenberg deboer 2008 estimate the total content of fertilisers as 90 700 gg n and 15 970 gg p unfortunately the quantity of s contained within global fertilisers is less well understood ober 2002 however estimates that around 210 gg s ended up in us n fertilisers during 2000 faostat reports that global n fertiliser production in 2004 was about 9 5 times the us production in 2000 the total fertiliser s flow is set as 1 990 gg fertiliser n and p is shared among three different farming types fertilised grasslands crops and wetland rice based on data recorded in bouwman et al 2002 and assumed n p ratios for fertiliser the s and p contained within synthetic fertilisers are treated as direct flows from the economy to the soil inorganic stocks by element in the case of n however the situation is more complex due to the volitisation of nh3 total nh3 losses are calculated as 12 900 gg n bouwman et al 2002 leaving a flow of 77 800 gg n to the soil inorganic n stock in terms of agricultural chemicals applied to land the usgs 2006 reports that around 2 030 gg s were used in the production of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals in the us it is assumed that local consumption of these chemicals equates to around 94 percent of production and that the us market is around 35 percent of the world market krs network 2006 if most of the s used for production ends up in final products the global flow from the economy to soil inorganic s stock can be estimated as 5 430 gg 3 5 non processed material flows the non processed material flows included in the esam are summarised in table 13 note that material flows associated with below ground crop residuals and crops lost to animal pests are described in section 3 1 additionally there is significant non production biomass flows associated with rice emissions and forestry activities rice emissions are set as 0 04 pg c as derived from wuebbles and hayhoe 2002 and olivier et al 2005 krausmann et al 2008a b estimate global felling losses in forests as 0 653 pg dry matter in 2000 based on a calculated difference in between forest felling and removal as with other vegetation flows included in the esam a c to dry matter content of 50 percent is applied the associated flows of n p and s are then determined from the stoichiometry of terrestrial vegetation like crop production forestry also leaves behind considerable quantities of non processed belowground biomass with the estimated global flows derived from krausmann et al 2008a b herridge et al 2008 provide estimates of biological n fixation for different agricultural systems including extensive uncultivated tropical savannahs used for grazing the estimated rate of n fixation within croplands is around 31 000 tg n for 2005 broken down by some 12 different crop types accounting for small changes in crop production between 2005 and 2004 faostat produces a revised global estimate for croplands of 29 730 gg n fixation flows of 18 100 gg n and 12 000 gg n are also adopted respectively for pasture and fodder legumes and extensive savannahs humans are further responsible for introducing a relatively significant quantity of reactive n to the biosphere because of n fixation in internal combustion engines where conditions of high temperature and pressure enable otherwise inert atmospheric n2 to react with oxygen because n is also contained within fossil fuels and released during combustion careful consideration is required to account appropriately for the total quantity of atmospheric n fixed during combustion the total fossil fuel combustion emissions of nox produced both directly from fuels and from n fixation is estimated as 21 tg n for 1990 galloway and cowling 2002 taking account of relatively significant increases in world primary energy demand between 1990 and 2004 oecd 2004 this is estimated to be 27 tg n the proportion of emissions derived from n fixation is then approximated by comparing the quantity of petroleum delivered to global transport activities iea 2009a 2009b and the likely n content of that fuel with the total quantity of n emissions estimated for transport i e nox n2o and nh3 is reported in the edgar database the resulting estimate is around 11 000 gg n or just over 35 percent of total nox emissions leaving 16 700 gg n released from the oxidation of n contained within fuels kruasmann et al 2008 calculate that nearly 2 500 tg of biomass dry matter were consumed in human induced fires during 2000 if this is approximately the same for the study year and applying a ratio of c emissions released per tg of biomass combusted from ito and penner 2004 total emissions from human induced fires are set as 1 215 9 tg c this flow is disaggregated into individual atmospheric c species based on the relative emissions reported by andreae and merlot 2001 for forest savannah burning i e ch4 emissions make up around 0 6 percent of the total c released during burning and that co2 co and vocs emissions respectively make up the remaining 91 3 percent 7 2 percent and 0 9 percent the emission flows are in turn disaggregated to environmental source stocks terrestrial vegetation litter detritus soil organic c using ratios from houghton 2005 who estimates that the total amount of c lost from land through land use change 77 percent is attributed to loss from vegetation 5 percent from litter and 18 percent from soils as forest and savannah fires are a major component of the land use change flow it is assumed that houghton s percentage shares are also reflective of the relative source contributions of c consumed in wildfires the calculations of n and s emissions from human induced vegetation fires are analogous to the calculations used for natural wildfires consideration is however given to the proportion of living vegetation that while consumed by human induced fires or wildfires is not combusted the ipcc 1996 applies a relatively low factor for non combustion during vegetation fires of around 10 percent while the rates of non combustion discussed by ito and penner 2004 are much higher a rate of 15 percent is applied generating a flow of 170 6 tg c from terrestrial vegetation to the litter detritus stock finally the flow of c resulting from ch4 recovery at landfills is derived by taking the global estimates by bogner 2003 for the period 1980 96 and extrapolating the data forward to the study year 4 results in this section we provide an element based summary of the esam environment economy accounts for each of c n p and s summary diagrams figs 3 6 are produced in a sankey format providing a fascinating description of the exchanges between the global environmental and economic systems to enable the esam information to be viewed within a single page for each element the 58 gtap sectors are aggregated to 12 sectors and the environmental commodities are aggregated into 29 stocks refer to supplementary tables 4 and 5 for concordances as aforementioned a full set of the esam environment economy accounts is provided in supplementary table 3 note that four types of material flows are identified in each diagram 1 processed material flows 2 non processed material flows 3 net wastes and 4 net stock changes and transfers in terms of processed material flows those depicted on the left hand side of each diagram correspond to direct material inputs while those on the right hand side are residuals the net waste type is included to account for net transfers of elements between sectors within wastes these flows are derived by calculating the difference between waste production and waste use recycling reuse and treatment for each sector a flow on the left hand side indicates that the relevant sector uses more of a waste than it produces while a flow on the right hand side indicates that a sector is a net provider of a waste to other sectors as the net waste flows are calculated for each type of waste it is possible for a sector to have a net waste flow depicted on both the left and right hand sides applying the mass balance principle for a given sector and element the difference between the sum of flows of categories 1 and 3 on the left hand side and flows 1 and 3 on the right hand side must correspond to the net transfer of materials to that sectors contained in economic commodities plus any relevant stock changes 4 4 1 carbon material flows the flows of c through the global economy are dominated by a pattern of uptake of high energy c commodities biomass fossil fuels from the environment by primary industries the net transfer of this c within economic commodities down production chains and the subsequent release of low energy c predominantly as co2 emissions by manufacturing services and final consumers fig 3 going slightly against this pattern the animals industry receives a very large input of high energy c in the form of grazed biomass estimated at nearly 2 000 tg with the net stock change and transfer flow for this industry only around 100 tg this occurs because of much of the biomass c required by the animals industry is returned to the environment by the industry itself via animal respiration and excretion furthermore while some c is retained in the animal products sold to other sectors these flows are partially offset by c contained within commodities purchased by the animals industry e g livestock feed and energy commodities similarly the crops industry takes significant quantities of low energy c from the environment and produces a substantial net stock change and transfer flow this is a consequence of the process of net primary production occurring within the industry itself relatively substantial non processed material flows are depicted for the crops industry this is a result of biomass produced by the industry but not used for economic purposes e g lost to pests belowground residuals a substantial non processed material flow is also depicted through the households sector this amounts to 1 140 tg c vegetation and 114 tg c of net soil lost via human induced vegetation fires 4 2 nitrogen material flows fig 4 shows the immense scale of n flows associated with industrial n fixation this is represented by a flow of 128 000 gg n2 n into the manufacturing industry balanced on the right hand side by an almost equivalent net stock change and transfer flow unlike the situation for c the crops industry does not have a substantial net stock change and transfer flowing towards the right hand side of the diagram the net stock change and transfer flow occurs on the left hand side for the industry this means that any n contained within crop products is more than compensated by the n contained in commodities consumed by the crop industry anthropogenic fixation of n2 to reactive n raises the energy state of that n with the energy gradually dissipated as the reactive n is converted through a variety of forms until it is eventually denitrified back to n2 in contrast to the c cycle where the dominant form of anthropogenic residual is the most stable co2 species relatively little n is re released from the economy directly as n2 it is only during fossil fuel combustion that appreciable quantities of the gas are produced estimated at around 19 600 gg n substantial quantities of reactive n are however released into the atmosphere through production of other n residuals particularly nox 18 300 gg n and nh4 31 900 gg it is an unfortunate paradox that reactive n comprises a residual for many activities while for agriculture it is demanded in vast quantities to support crop and pasture production although much of the reactive n released to the atmosphere occurs from dispersed fuel combustion 21 900 gg residuals burned in fields constitute a small source of reactive n 1 650 gg for which there is high potential for better utilisation improving the management of reactive n emitted from livestock farming is important fig 4 depicts a residual flow from the animals industry to the atmosphere of some 30 100 gg n associated with manure emissions coupled with a residual flow to soils of over 50 000 gg n if the coincidence of this reactive n in soils and n uptake by agricultural crops and pastures can be increased this would greatly improve the efficiency at which reactive n is utilised in the production of economic commodities sutton and billen 2011 interestingly before the commercialisation of industrial n fixation livestock manure was the only major form of n fertiliser to croplands jarvis et al 2011 today the transfer of n from animals to crops via manure is relatively small depicted by the net waste flow to the crops industry significant potential also exists to better utilise n in other forms of wastes the total n contained within global wastewater is estimated at some 45 600 gg around 14 percent of this n is retained in sludge 12 percent is released as emissions during wastewater handling and the rest is otherwise disposed to the environment often to waterways 4 3 phosphorus material flows like the n flows depicted above anthropogenic p flows are characterised by a very large flow through the manufacturing industry 19 800 gg associated predominantly with fertiliser production the significant size of the net sock change and transfer flow to the crops industry 11 500 gg also indicates that much of the p applied in fertilisers is lost from the economy almost immediately i e without assimilation into economic commodities another noticeable feature of fig 5 is the very large residual flow out of the electricity industry to the other environmental stock category 9 860 gg p this is explained by the substantial production of coal ash p during electricity generation presently the esam allocates coal ash p entirely as a residual flow to landfills however given the magnitude of coal ash p production it is important that the fate of this p at a global level is understood including rates of reuse or recycling unlike the case for n the only major commercial source of p in fertiliser manufacturing is from mined lithosphere reserves over recent years concerns associated with rising fertiliser prices depletion of reserves and the concentrations of reserves within a few nations have focused greater attention on finding opportunities for improving p recovery reuse and conservation van vuuren et al 2010 vaccari 2011 scholz and wellmer 2013 6 6 the estimated global reserves of po4 3 rock as published by the usgs 2010 2011 increased sharply from 16 pg in 2010 to 65 pg in 2011 largely due to increased estimates of moroccan reserves this has shifted the p debate away from a focus on scarcity toward a focus on pollution edixhoven et al 2013 vaccari 2011 for example describes the technologies that could be employed to better recover p from wastewater including treatment technologies and separation of p wastes at source through use of urine diversion or no mix toilets the total p wastewater flow included in the esam is some 4 740 gg i e 24 percent of the p mining flow like the situation with n there are significant opportunities to improve the reuse of p generated within animal excrement presently of the animal waste that is collected from concentrated animal feeding operations and utilised as a fertiliser much is applied in amounts beyond what can be assimilated by crops resulting in excessive runoff vaccari 2011 the total p contained in livestock p is estimated at some 4 570 gg with more than half produced from confined animals there is also potential to utilise fly ash as a soil amendment providing nutrients reducing acidity improving water retention in crop production schoeman and van deventer 2004 mittra et al 2005 basu et al 2009 due to radioactivity and heavy metal content however the current use of fly ash in agriculture is relatively limited basu et al 2009 4 4 sulphur material flows the largest raw material inputs of s to the economy originate from mined fossil fuels and minerals fig 6 estimated at 64 300 gg s 64 100 gg s and 37 600 gg s for coal petroleum and s minerals respectively although much of the fossil fuel s is combusted to atmospheric s in a pattern like anthropogenic c flows significant quantities are recovered from petroleum refining for use in industrial processes particularly fertiliser manufacture this helps explain the large net stock change and transfer flow depicted on the left hand side for the manufacturing industry gypsum produced as a by product from industrial activities is the ultimate destination for a huge proportion of the s passing through the economy this is estimated at 38 900 gg or 17 percent of all residual s flows like the situation with coal ash p identifying and quantifying any major re use or recycling flows for this residual would improve the s material flow accounts 5 discussion in developing the esam mfas for environment economy exchanges we have attempted to account for human interaction within the gbcs the esam is conceptually consistent with a view that sees the economy as existing at least in a physical sense within the wider biosphere it is also systematic with careful attention paid to the comprehensive inclusion of mass flows for each gbc the esam provides a static model from which a plethora of analytical applications are possible using some of these applications as exemplars we discuss potential extensions of the esam that would enhance its usefulness we specifically focus on those aspects which relate to environment economic exchanges 5 1 both mass and energy units the inclusion of energy flows within the esam framework would from a systems ecological and industrial ecology perspective provide a more conceptually complete description of the gbcs while significant data and time constraints have prevented this from being undertaken it is identified as worthwhile topic for future research 5 2 other global biogeochemical cycles other gbcs are also of great importance and worthy of inclusion within the esam water is an essential compound for life a key transporter of materials and is a common reactant and product of many biogeochemical processes similarly oxygen is often a critical element in redox oxidation and reduction chemical reactions and is thus arguably is inextricably interconnected throughout the gbcs other limiting elements influencing the rate of flow of important environmental processes e g the micronutrient iron required for ocean primary production martin and fitzwater 1988 and similarly plants require magnesium in their chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis importantly the interdependencies between the coupled cycles under perturbation is clearly a potential avenue for further research 5 3 development of a global physical input output table one potential extension to the esam framework and its empirical accounts is to utilise a physical numeraire for the within economy flows essentially this would result in the development of a full piot for each element considered which would facilitate the development of additional mfa indicators it is also noted that with such information it would be easier to investigate how changes in resource inputs to an economic system are connected to changes in residual outputs from that same system this does not imply however that a physical numeraire is necessarily better or should be used in replacement of say a financial numeraire in these regards it is particularly noted that the provision of service activities within an economy often do not involve an identifiable exchange of mass yet the financial exchanges associated with those activities are very important indirectly in determining the nature and rate of physical processes elsewhere within the system ideally an accounting framework for an economic system would include both physical and financial numeraire 5 4 sustainability indicators drawing on the theoretical frameworks of input output analysis and material flow analysis an extensive suite of sustainability indicators may be formulated the oecd 2008 has identified a range of input supply consumption balance describe growth in physical terms output emissions waste pollutants as an environmental burden and efficiency indicators to monitor the material basis productivity management and environmental impacts of material use essentially these indicators describe the level at which the global economy through its transformation of useful resources i e raw materials into residuals i e wastes pollutants emission appropriate the gbcs drawing on input output analysis and a full implementation of the esam smith et al 2014 have used the esam to create a novel suite of sustainability which communicate and monitor humanity s dependence on the gbcs insights are gained by comparing the rate of human appropriation of gbcs with that of the biosphere s regenerative capacity to calculate these indicators a new concept of ecotime is defined as the average gbc time available for matter held within different environmental stocks e g co2 plants fossil fuels to reach biogeochemical processes smith et al 2014 found that humans are placing significant pressure on the gbcs the global economic system is responsible for absorbing significant quantities of ecotime provided by the gbcs particularly in the c but also to a lesser extent in the n cycles an investigation of the terrestrial and oceanic gbcs highlights that more than 20 years of the current rate of regeneration provided by the c cycle is appropriated by the global economy within just one year in the case of the p and s cycles and possibly also the n cycle it would appear that undershoot of gbcs is an additional problem that is likely to deepen over time for the s cycle natural processes particularly soil erosion and river export are responsible for moving elements away from the terrestrial biosphere at a greater rate than the addition of those elements back to terrestrial systems via human processes the current high rate of natural removal of s from terrestrial systems reflects in part landscape changes that exacerbate erosion and the large quantities of biomass s resources that are transformed by the economy into dispersed wastes effectively flushed away by freshwater systems interestingly the level of undershoot of terrestrial s processes is only likely to increase from measures designed to reduce perturbation of the global c cycle this highlights the importance of systems thinking including analysis of interrelationships and trade offs in relation to managing human impacts on the gbcs 5 5 dynamic analysis of biogeochemical cycling an obvious extension of the esam accounts presented here is that that form the basis for a more dynamic analysis the esam records the gbc flows associated with the operation of the cycles including accounting for environment economy interactions with additional information on stock values and understanding of the dynamic coupling of the elemental cycles it is conceivable that the esam could be used to provide base information for a dynamic analysis of the gbcs such analyses are critical as a pedagogic tool that help select resilience building strategies by providing capacity to envisage futures and actions that might attain or avoid outcomes 6 conclusion a broad aim for this paper has been to progress sustainability through the development and application of an integrated systems modelling framework of the coupled gbcs for both the global economic and environment systems this is clearly a worthwhile goal given the essential role of gbcs play in maintaining and regulating the conditions necessary for life on earth as well as supporting the provision of the full range of other services provided by the biosphere to humanity increasing awareness of gbc related problems including global climate change soil acidification and freshwater eutrophication is now placing an increasing need to consider the gbcs in the context of sustainable development coupled environment economy systems are complex and adaptive systems that when subject to significant perturbation have the potential to transition to new stability domains that are not only less desirable but potentially catastrophic to human existence we have described the development of a comprehensive set of mfas for the gbcs of c n p and s these are essentially the mass flows crossing the environment economy interface and resulting from the human use of raw materials e g biomass extraction biomass production minerals extraction fossil fuel extraction industrial n fixation and production of residuals e g atmospheric emissions residuals disposed to land also included are mass flows associated with wastes production e g livestock excrement and crop residuals municipal solid waste industrial solid waste coal ash p municipal wastewater industrial wastewater and treatment e g landfill deposition combustion paper recycling in summarising these flows using sankey diagrams the significant role of the global economy in metabolising high energy commodities produced by the gbcs becomes apparent biomass and fossil fuels are demanded in huge quantities by the global economy and that matter once passed down economic supply chains is re released to the environment largely as dispersed and low energy residuals it is an unfortunate paradox that there exists substantial demand for n and p compounds for agriculture while at the same time there are significant production of those same compounds in unused wastes this highlights a clear need for technologies and practices that greatly improve waste recycling and the efficiency of natural resource utilisation our analysis enables us to not only understand the current state of these cycles but also to focus in on where we might address the discrepancies we find

24915,the global biogeochemical cycles gbcs are extremely important biosphere functions critical to the maintenance of conditions necessary for all life importantly perturbation of the gbcs has the potential to affect the structure and functioning of the earth system while biogeochemistry research to date has largely focused on natural processes human economic activities are increasingly recognised as integral components of the gbcs in this paper we develop a novel systems model the environmental social accounting matrix esam of coupled gbcs explicitly covering carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur with a particularly focus on the environment economy interface we illustrate diagrammatically the level at which the global economy through its transformation of useful resources i e raw materials into residuals i e wastes pollutants emission appropriates biogeochemical processes then through an application lens we discuss the esam s potential applications and extensions the esam represents one of only a few attempts to develop an integrated model of the earth system explicitly capturing the interaction in the element based gbcs between both natural and human processes keywords biogeochemical cycles material flow accounts anthropocene environment economy exchanges systems ecology 1 introduction the global cycling of carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p sulphur s hydrogen oxygen potassium chlorine iodine and many other elements are recognised as critical processes provided by the biosphere the global biogeochemical cycles gbcs are essential to maintaining and regulating the conditions for all life they continually supply scare elements needed by ecological systems for biotic metabolism their role in stabilising temperature humidity salinity acidity and other environmental conditions and their ability to convert toxic waste products from one form of life into nutrients for another ayres 1993 smil 2002 anthropocentrically they are also fundamental to the provisioning of a wide range of ecosystem services including food and raw material production and the provision of aesthetic recreational and spiritual values millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 systems ecology research on the earth system biogeochemistry has focused largely on the natural components of the cycles increasing recognition of system interdependencies within the gbc related environmental problems including global climate change widespread acidification of soils and waters and eutrophication of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems has highlighted the role played by human activities it is now recognised that humans are increasingly influencing and appropriating the gbcs catton 1982 vitousek et al 1986 1997 rojstaczer et al 2001 denman et al 2007 haberl et al 2007 venetoulis and talberth 2008 filippelli 2008 canfield et al 2010 van der voet et al 2000 thus many commentators prefer to use the term anthropo biogeochemical cycles system scientists have conceptualised the gbcs as a sequence of transformation processes and reservoirs that can be represented schematically as stocks linked by flows as stated by ayres 1993 p 203 the condition for stability in these cycles is easily stated the stocks in each compartment or reservoir must remain constant at least on average and for this condition to be met the inflows into each compartment must be balanced exactly on average by outflows if however the condition is not satisfied we must infer that the stock in some compartment s is accumulating at the expense of another compartment s while we may be assured that the gbcs contain balancing feedback structures that enable system regulation following perturbation the threat is that we may eventually reach a point where self regulating feedbacks are insufficient to maintain the system within a desirable state for humans constraining the scale of human activity relative to the regenerative capacity of the gbcs thus has normative weight it is a prerequisite to the achievement of distributive justice and hence strong sustainability in this paper we holistically trace the interactions between human and environment components of the gbcs for the 2004 year using elemental mass flows we present part of the environmental social accounting matrix esam a novel systems model which comprehensively captures the operation of the gbcs for c n p and s this paper focuses on a novel comprehensive accounting of the interface between the environment and economy recording the use of raw materials and production of residuals i e wastes pollutants emissions by human activities in this regard our work compliments but also significantly extends the industrial ecology work of singh and bakshi 2014 and fujimori and matsuoka 2007 importantly a full implementation of the esam would provide a novel comprehensive accounting of c n p and s elemental mass flows by all ecological and economic processes for all natural and human ecosystems that exist within the biosphere the structure of our paper follows section 2 introduces the esam through a systems diagram accompanying mathematical notation with key concept definitions and classifications section 3 derives the elemental mass flows associated with the environment economic interactions using a material flow analysis mfa approach we derive inter alia gbc flows for direct material inputs e g biomass extraction and production minerals and fossil fuel extraction and industrial n fixation waste generation livestock excrement solid waste coal ash p and wastewater waste treatment crop residuals livestock excrement solid wastes and wastewater and residual generation atmospheric emissions and disposal to land section 4 illustrates graphically using sankey diagrams the importance of human activity within the gbcs and providing some fascinating insights into global environmental economic interactions using an application orientated lens the key strengths and weaknesses of the esam are discussed in section 5 the paper ends with concluding comments please note a complete set of accounts for the c n p and s elemental mass flows encompassing all the environment economic interactions presented in this paper is available online in supplementary table 3 2 environmental social accounting matrix 2 1 the environment economy system fig 1 depicts the global environment economy system key features include 1 exogenous energy inputs e g solar energy crustal heat and tidal energy and waste heat output 2 physical flow of matter energy within and between the environment and economy and 3 flow of commodities within the economy system all processes involving materials are subject to the materials balance principle ayres and kneese 1969 furthermore if energy transformations were to be fully accounted for currently our work focuses on materials then energy would also be conserved i e as per the principles of energetics 2 1 1 system stocks and flows 2 1 1 1 physical economic stocks and flows matter energy enter the economy in the form of raw materials and then following transformation within the economy circulate in the form of goods and services and labour a small portion of this matter energy becomes tied up within reserves of capital e g buildings and in various stocks of products e g food a significant portion enters waste products some of which is recycled or re used eventually all matter energy crosses the economic system boundary as an output to the environment in the form of residuals and waste heat this industrial metabolism ayres 1989 ayres and simonis 1994 is analogous to processes within ecological systems but unlike the economic activity natural processes further close material loops by cycling resources and wastes interchangeably 2 1 1 2 physical environmental stocks and flows the environment is divided into four separate spheres the atmosphere oceans terrestrial biosphere and lithosphere each sphere is in turn comprised of major stocks for example vegetation and soils within the terrestrial biosphere the gbcs encapsulate all exchanges occurring between these stocks external energy inputs solar tidal crustal heat drive the biosphere processes in their entirety the gbcs are highly complex and self organised systems maintained at a disequilibrium with respect to thermodynamics schlesinger 1997 2 1 1 3 economic monetary flows although not focused on in this paper the within economy flows of money are generally in the opposite direction to flows of materials energy and information odum 1994 1996 1998 the demand for materials goods services or commodities is the primary driver of matter energy flows through the global economy pricing through markets is used as an information value meter to facilitate comparison and transaction see for example hausmann and hidalgo 2011 and hidalgo and hausmann 2009 producers firms industries etc are responsible for the production of commodities while final consumers largely households use commodities for satisfaction of human needs or wants government acts both as a producer and consumer of commodities on behalf of the people the extent to which the environment is made available for economic use is determined by ethics and values which guide rules and regulations governing human behaviour and acts of stewardship 2 2 static system framework in this paper we describe the global environment economy system as shown in fig 1 in accordance with the esam framework set out in fig 2 mass flow accounts are derived for c n p and s covering extraction of raw materials from the environment by the economy matrix r p with element r m j p describes the use of environmental commodity m by economic industry j where m 1 μ and j 1 σ and vector r o describes the use of ecological commodity m by households while matrix w p and vector w o describe the release of ecological commodity m by respectively industry j and households the remainder of the esam which encompasses flows within the environment and economy is included for completeness the esam permits mixed units with a tilde indicating those matrices and vectors that are specified in purely physical i e mass energy terms while the remaining matrices vectors and scalars may be measured in either physical or monetary terms within environment flows are thus recorded in physical terms while within economy flows may be either recorded in physical or monetary terms despite the importance of understanding and monitoring humanity s reliance and impact on environmental systems including by way of recording and monitoring physical flows there is an overwhelming dearth of this type of information presented in an integrated holistic manner consequently derivation of the esam has been an extremely onerous task involving collation of a myriad of disparate and ad hoc information sources and application of a variety of bottom up and top down estimation methods the esam mfa accounts are the most detailed and comprehensive information available on c n p and s flows for the global environment economic system in compiling the mass flow accounts reference has been made particularly to the concepts and definitions developed under mfa a physical accounting approach that adheres to the materials balance principle and is concerned particularly with recording mass flowing into a system the stock changes within that system and the resulting output flows to other systems mfa allows for application of internationally recognised classification systems that enable it to be directly linked to the united nations un 1993 system of national accounts this in turn enables mfa to be applied at various scales and for various types of systems e g firms aggregated sectors city region economies national economies and for the globe although many mfa studies measure total mass inputs outputs of a system a number have also concentrated on measuring specific materials or elements examples include maag et al 1997 for mercury graedel et al 2002 for copper antikainen et al 2004 for n and p through the finland forestry industry and cordell et al 2009 for p flows through the global food production and consumption system other studies have developed similar mass flow accounts for biogeochemical flows including the european science foundation s nitrogen in europe programme sutton et al 2011a and the c n and p supply and use tables by fujimori and matsuoka 2007 an important point to note is that the biogeochemical exchanges between the environment and economy are described by not only the economic sectors responsible for the exchange but also by the environmental commodity stock which inputs are sourced from or outputs are destined to 2 3 definitions and classifications the mfa classification system provides a convenient typology that ensures all mass flows to and from the global economic are accounted for and that system boundary issues are minimised to help determine the environment economy exchanges all material flows in the esam are coded to the 58 sectors industries plus households of global trade analysis project 1 1 refer to www gtap agecon purdue edu 7 0 gtap which ensures compatibility to the within economy accounts and adopts the internationally recognised un central product classification and international standard industrial classification systems see supplementary tables 1 and 2 for concordances gtap is a publicly available database and utilised by many economic practitioners for applied general equilibrium modelling and trade analysis specifically the materials flow analysis accounts for 6 different types of human processes i e waste production 2 2 as previously stated we have not focused on describing the within economy flows an exception however is the inclusion of separate accounts for waste production and waste treatment residual production waste treatment non processed flows waste recycling use and direct material inputs by 58 different sectors 57 economic industries plus households by 134 c n p and s environmental commodities stocks despite the sparse nature of this matrix 3 3 which is 348 rows 6 types x 58 sectors by 134 columns environmental commodities or 46 632 cells 4 596 non blank cells it is not possible to present as a table within this paper instead it appears in supplementary table 3 substances extracted from the environment are frequently separated into two major categories direct material inputs and non processed material flows adriaanse et al 1997 eurostat 2001 the eurostat 2001 p 27 mfa manual defines direct material inputs as all solid liquid and gaseous materials that enter the economy for further use in production or consumption processes these are further classified into five principal groups biomass extracted through agriculture forestry fishing etc materials for biomass production where primary production processes occur inside the economy minerals fossil fuels and unreactive n for use in industrial n fixation non processed material flows are further separated into two subcomponents comprising unused extraction on the input or extraction side and disposal of unused extraction on the output or disposal side eurostat 2001 unused extraction flows have been defined by eurostat 2001 p 21 as materials extracted or otherwise moved on purpose and by means of technology which are not fit or intended for use or materials that never enter the economic system and thus can be described as physical market externalities in a way non processed material flows can be viewed as akin to concurrent material input and residual flows but omit any processing of these materials within the economy examples include mining overburden soil excavated and moved during construction fish by catch and wood harvesting losses non processed material flows capture important biogeochemical processes arising directly out of human activities namely 1 organic matter combustion during human induced vegetation fires 2 biological n fixation within agricultural systems 3 n fixation within internal combustion engines and 4 emissions from rice agriculture inclusion of 1 and 4 ensures that atmospheric emissions attributed to anthropogenic processes are consistent with the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc methodological guide ipcc 2006 similarly n fixation covered by 2 and 3 is typically attributed to the economy gruber and galloway 2008 canfield et al 2010 eurostat 2001 define outputs to the environment as all materials released to air land or water so that human control is lost over the location and composition of the materials released the term residual is used to describe the commodities released to air and land with the latter including freshwater residuals discharged to land include a number of flows often referred to as dissipative uses for example fertilisers and materials spread on fields 3 derivation of material flow accounts this section is devoted to describing the various methods and datasets utilised in the compilation of the mfa accounts that record environment economy and vice versa exchanges 3 1 direct material inputs 3 1 1 biomass extraction the esam covers three major categories of biomass extraction grazed consumption of biomass by domestic animals wood and timber removals and global fish harvests omitted are a few smaller flows e g honey mushrooms berries and herbs starting with grazed consumption of biomass international agricultural databases such as those published by the food and agricultural organisation fao contain data only on market feed and fodder crops fed to livestock comprehensive estimates of biomass grazed by livestock or otherwise mowed for livestock feed are unavailable krausmann et al 2008a b calculate the grazing gap required to sustain the world s livestock in addition to market crops as 3 84 pg of dry matter for the year 2000 accounting for increases in global livestock numbers and if grazed biomass has the same stoichiometry as terrestrial vegetation 790c 7 6n 1 p 3 1s based on bohlin et al 1983 then this produces total flows of 2 00 pg c 22 4 tg n 6 5 tg p and 20 9 tg s these flows are apportioned among different livestock types and gtap sectors based on default feed intake ratios kg head day reported by the ipcc 1996 accounting for the proportion of each livestock type reared in confinement and thus not involved in grazing smil 1999 krausmann et al 2008a b also provide an estimate of the total wood harvest in 2000 as 1 94 pg dry matter their calculation is based on harvest volumes reported in the temperate and boreal forest resource assessment 2000 database united nations 2000 and fao statistics fao 2005 along with adjustments for unreported bark volumes in some parts of the world significant quantities of woody biomass are gathered from not only forests and groves but also bushes rubber plantations roadside and backyard trees to support household fuel demands smil 2008 a household wood extraction flow of 0 45 pg c is adopted in the esam derived from the difference between the fao wood fuel estimates and the total wood required to satisfy residential wood fuel demands fernades et al 2007 overall the total wood removal flows are calculated as 1 23 pg c 13 8 tg n 4 0 tg p and 12 9 tg s out of these flows 59 percent is allocated to the household sector and the remainder to the forestry industry fernades et al 2007 although human fish harvests have had significant impacts on marine ecosystems with for example at least a quarter of global commercial marine stocks estimated to be either overexploited or completely depleted fao 2005 the actual input of biomass to the economy associated with fish harvests is small when compared with other flows fish crustacean mollusc and so on capture in marine fishing areas is reported by the fao 2008 as 83 8 tg with an additional 16 7 tg produced through aquaculture production these values translate to a total of 11 2 tg c if c makes up around one ninth of the total wet weight of fish strathmann 1967 pauly and christensen 1995 note however that because harvested fish constitute a major feed input to aquaculture systems hasan and halwart 2009 simply adding the marine capture and aquaculture flows together will result in double counting of material inputs to the economy the esam thus includes a net fish harvest flow calculated by subtracting the estimated mass of fish used as inputs to marine aquaculture tacon and hasan 2007 from the total mass of fish produced from marine wild harvests plus aquaculture the derived c flow of 10 5 tg is then multiplied by the stoichiometry for marine consumers 103c 16 5n 1 p based on murray 1992 to calculate the associated flows of n p and s 3 1 2 biomass production in the esam crop production is a process residing within the economy the total element content of crops is calculated as 1 990 tg c 71 600 gg n 2 980 gg p and 11 430 gg s table 1 these values are calculated via a bottom up approach in brief this involved extracting estimates of total global production measured in t for some 200 different crop types from the fao food and agricultural commodities production database then multiplying the production values for each crop by dry matter content ratios and subsequently element to dry matter content ratios for each of c n p and s elements the relevant ratios are derived from a variety of values reported in the literature mishra and shukla 1986 ipcc 1996 smil 1999 gundersen et al 2000 vleeshouwers and verhagen 2002 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 unfortunately there is a paucity of information on the s content of crops to generate an approximation of the s needed for crop production the s p ratio for terrestrial vegetation is applied the fao data do not cover aboveground crop residuals such as straw stover and leaves to estimate the flow of crop residuals the fao production data for each crop are multiplied by a residual to crop ratio ipcc 1996 smil 1999 yevich and logan 2003 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 krausmann et al 2008a b once again the resulting estimates must be multiplied by dry matter content ratios followed by element to dry matter composition ratios to derive c n p and s content estimates although less apparent crop production generates significant quantities of belowground residuals primarily roots left during harvests this flow along with crop losses to animal pests is grouped into the non processed material flows category but is outlined here for convenience these residuals are estimated to be 608 7 tg c krausmann et al 2008a b it is assumed that belowground residuals exhibit the same element stoichiometry as terrestrial vegetation the belowground residual flow for each element is then disaggregated among gtap sectors according to each sector s contribution to crop production and aboveground residual production before crop harvesting a relatively significant quantity of plant biomass may be consumed or destroyed by agricultural pests although this matter is lost before it is can be applied in economic activities these material flows are a by product of agriculture and hence treated as a non processed material flow oerke 2006 provides estimates of the loss in yield of wheat rice maize potatoes soybeans and cotton crops for the period 2001 03 total losses from animal pests alone are estimated to range between 11 0 percent of actual yield for wheat to 24 1 percent for rice it is assumed that the amount of plant biomass consumed by animal pests is 15 percent of the total c biomass produced in crops and crop residuals 3 1 3 minerals extraction although humans extract a vast array of minerals from the lithosphere this paper is concerned only with those containing appreciable quantities of c n p and s table 2 in terms of c caco3 minerals including limestone marble chalk and dolomite are by far the most important with demands for use both in industrial processes e g fertiliser manufacture and in construction e g aggregates cement despite the economic importance of these minerals only limited data are available on worldwide demand while information does exist on bulk construction minerals in the un industrial commodity statistics and united states geological survey usgs databases problems of incomplete global coverage and the reporting of caco3 minerals in conjunction with other minerals exist additionally of the mass flows recorded in the literature behrens et al 2007 schandl and eisenmenger 2006 steinberger et al 2010 it is difficult to determine the likely caco3 content a pragmatic bottom up approach is therefore applied this involves identifying industrial c residuals that are likely to stem from the use of caco3 as a feedstock estimating the mass of caco3 required for these industrial processes and then summing over all the industrial processes no attempt is made to quantify the mass of limestone used directly as a construction material keeping with the mass balance principle thus limestone construction wastes must be excluded from the calculation of c waste and residual flows the emission database for global atmospheric research edgar reports emissions from cement 245 tg c and lime 53 tg c manufacture the database also reports an emission flow of 14 tg c associated with other mineral production although a proportion of the latter emissions will originate from fossil fuel feedstocks it is likely that soda ash production and use relying on caco3 as a feedstock is one source ipcc 1996 the us environmental protection authority usepa reports us emissions from soda ash production and use for the early 2000s as 1 tg c yr 1 and estimates that this is around one quarter of the global total usepa 2010 other principal industrial uses of caco3 involve limestone and dolomite use in metal manufacturing glass making and flue gas desulphurisation using emission ratios derived from the us greenhouse gas ghg inventory usepa 2010 global emissions from these sources are estimated at just over 10 tg c summing all these categories together produces a total global demand for caco3 in industrial processes of at least 314 tg c this demand is incorporated in the esam via an extraction flow from the carbonate minerals stock minerals containing po4 3 are also mined from the lithosphere primarily for use as fertilisers there is a variety of other minor industrial uses for p including in the production of food and beverages cleaning products and flame retardants for treatment of potable water and in processing of ceramics the usgs 2004 estimates po4 3 rock production at 19 8 tg p more than 90 percent of mined s is used in the production of sulphuric acid principally for fertiliser production brimblecombe 2005 smaller amounts of s are used in the manufacture of gunpowder insecticides fungicides medicines wood products and paper products this s is obtained directly from the lithosphere in the form of elemental s from sulphide pyrite minerals but also as a by product from metal ore and natural gas extraction and processing the usgs 2006 reports total global production of industrial s to be 32 100 gg this does not include s extracted from the lithosphere but unable to be captured for industrial use of importance are gaseous emissions primarily so2 from metal production estimated at 5 460 gg s adding these values together produces an estimated s extraction flow of at least 37 600 gg 3 1 4 fossil fuel extraction the rate at which humans extract c from the lithosphere in fossil fuels is almost equal in magnitude to c extraction in biomass the us energy information administration useia reports total world production of coal as 6 223 million short tons for 2004 this equates to some 3 160 tg c based on the quantities of c emissions released during combustion marland et al 2007 and accounting for the use of coal as a feedstock in other industrial processes a coal mass ratio of 49 20c 0 85n 0 20p 1s is used to estimate the other element flows associated with coal extraction white et al 1984 vorres 1989 smith et al 1994 mastalerz et al 2003 kabe et al 2004 higman and van der burgt 2008 it also accounts for the relative contribution of different types of coal anthracite bituminous and lignite within total production production of crude oil including condensate is reported by the useia as 72 5 million barrels per day which translates to a total extraction of around 3 62 pg the mass content of oil is estimated to be 85 5 percent c 0 3 percent n and 1 8 percent s hyne 1991 referring again to the useia datasets production of dry natural gas is estimated as 97 000 billion cubic feet the useia further reports 7 5 million barrels per day of petroleum produced from natural gas plant liquids if dry natural gas has an average c mass content of 76 percent and 83 percent for natural gas plant liquids ryder and burruss 2003 the total mass of c extracted in natural gas for petroleum and natural gas production is 2 010 tg 3 1 5 industrial n fixation industrial n fixation refers to a group of processes that enable dinitrogen to combine chemically with other elements to form reactive n compounds such as nh3 no3 or nitrites the haber bosch process first commercialised in 1913 is by far the most important industrial form of n fixation it involves heating n and hydrogen under very high temperature and pressure along with a chemical catalyst thus producing synthetic nh3 around four fifths of the reactive n formed from this process is used for fertiliser manufacture including as a feedstock for urea and for various nitrates so4 2 and po4 3 and the rest for various other industrial processes such as production of explosives dyes and fibres domene and ayres 2001 estimates of the total quantity of n fixed through the haber bosch process vary quite substantially in the literature for the 1990s the global rate has been reported at around 100 tg n gruber and galloway 2008 smil 2002 while a more recent source reports a rate of around 130 tg n for 2008 canfield et al 2010 a rate of 128 tg n is adopted in the esam 3 2 waste generation four primary categories of wastes are covered by the esam livestock excrement crop residuals solid wastes and wastewater the solid wastes category is further broken down into eight sub categories 1 paper and cardboard 2 textiles 3 vegetable and animal 4 rubber and leather 5 plastics 6 petroleum products and solvents 7 phosphogypsum and other industrial s wastes and 8 coal ash p 3 2 1 livestock excrement element flows in livestock excrement are calculated separately for 16 different livestock types table 6 overall by multiplying fao livestock population data by estimated manure production rates smil 1999 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 it is calculated that some 2 48 pg of excrement was produced cattle alone are responsible for 60 percent of this total with the next most important sources being buffaloes 8 percent and pigs 8 percent applying n and p content ratios smil 1999 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 the total flows associated with excrement production are 98 tg n and 4 570 gg p c flows are separately estimated as 617 tg based on data provided by prairie and duarte 2007 while s slows are approximated by the stoichiometry of zoomass 115 8c 14 5n 1 0p 0 2s based on elser et al 2000 and sterner and elser 2002 importantly only excrement produced by animals in confinement is added to the waste accounts the remaining quantities of excrement which are likely to be deposited onto fields are treated as a residual flow from the economy directly to the litter detritus stock 3 2 2 municipal solid waste solid waste generation rates and composition varies across the world unfortunately only a small number of countries have comprehensive waste data covering different types of wastes and treatment methods to estimate global solid waste production for sub categories 1 to 6 above reference is made to the region specific default parameters specified in the ipcc s guidelines for national ghg inventories ipcc 2006 calculations based on these default values are undertaken at the level of individual countries and then aggregated to provide a global total actual data from available national ghg inventories and other literature sources world bank 2005 phuntsho et al 2010 dhokhikah and trihadiningrum 2012 are substituted into the calculations as appropriate unfortunately the ipcc guidelines do not provide a method for estimating municipal solid waste production by rural populations within developing countries while these populations may practice dispersed types of waste disposal with high levels of recycling they are no doubt still responsible for significant wastes with no information available on the magnitude and composition of these wastes we only include estimates of waste originating from plant and animal materials i e biogenic wastes for each developing country the quantity of biogenic waste produced per capita in rural areas is simply set equivalent to the per capita rate of vegetable and animal waste production by the country s urban population the total waste is estimated at 265 tg c very little information is available on the likely element content by solid waste type ipcc guidelines however require reporting countries to track the degradable organic c doc and fossil organic c of waste and provide a set of default values for doc fossil c and total c content for wastes of different types applying these default values it is estimated that the c flow contained within municipal solid waste is around 440 tg table 3 paper and cardboard wastes contribute around 35 percent of this total the n and s flows associated with vegetable animal rubber and leather wastes are determined from the relevant c flows by applying stoichiometric ratios for these materials as taken from chandrappa and das 2012 the p content of vegetable and animal wastes however is approximated from the average c p content of food crops while the n s and p flows for wood waste are estimated from the stoichiometry of terrestrial vegetation finally a stoichiometry for textile wastes is estimated by taking the chemical composition of various textile yarns including nylon polyester plastic cotton wool silk and then calculating the likely contribution of these yarns to total textile production based on production data from the un industrial commodity statistics database 3 2 3 industrial solid waste industrial solid waste generation and composition varies significantly between countries depending on the types of industries industrial processes and technologies employed the ipcc guidelines do not contain a set of default production and composition parameters for use in calculating industrial solid waste accounts countries with no national data are encouraged to use data from like countries eurostat waste generation and treatment statistics are used as a proxy for the likely production rates tonnes per us million for waste types 1 6 by industry this comprehensive waste dataset records waste production by both type of waste and generating sector note that the methods used to estimate the c n p and s composition of these wastes are the same as those employed for municipal solid waste table 3 provides a summary of the estimated element flows based on an analysis of s materials flows within the us ober 2002 inorganic s wastes are mainly generated in the form of phosphogypsum synthetic gypsum produced during po4 3 fertiliser production and in petroleum refining sulphuric acid is the major feedstock for these industrial processes ober 2002 estimates consumption of sulphuric acid in us po4 3 fertiliser production at just over 7 tg s for 2000 this value is scaled to a global estimate for 2004 using world po4 3 fertiliser production statistics while also accounting for differences in fertiliser types and quantity of sulphuric acid required ober 2002 phosphogypsum waste production from fertiliser manufacturing is estimated to be 20 tg s the usgs 2006 estimates consumption of s within the us for petroleum refining as 4 tg this is scaled to a global estimate of 19 tg based on petroleum product statistics contained within the un industrial commodity statistics database a very small proportion is already accounted for in the wastewater estimates for petroleum manufacturing all remaining inorganic s emitted from petroleum manufacturing as a solid waste is deposited to landfills 3 2 4 coal ash p this is a special category of solid waste that does not fit neatly into either the municipal or industrial solid waste categories although the majority of p contained within coal is expected to be found in bottom ash following combustion szpunar 1992 some p is also likely to be emitted as fly ash that eventually settles onto the land or ocean a proportion of coal p is also likely to end up in economic products e g p absorbed into metals during steel manufacture as there is limited information on the likely size of these flows it is assumed in the esam that all s contained within coal ultimately ends up as solid waste released to landfills 3 2 5 municipal wastewater like solid waste the calculation of wastewater flows is undertaken at the level of individual countries and then aggregated to provide a global total the method stipulated in the ipcc guidelines for calculating wastewater generation originating from household water use is based on per capita emission rates bod5 person day 4 4 bod5 is the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed in five days by biological processes breaking down organic matter that vary between regions ipcc 2006 correction factors are used to account for bod from different industries co discharged with domestic wastewater e g restaurants butchers and supermarkets applying these rates as well as superior data from national inventories where available the total domestic wastewater generated over the study year is estimated as 61 1 tg c assuming an organic c to bod mass ratio of 0 53 san diego mcglone et al 2000 ratios of n bod and p bod are applied to estimate a loading of 22 200 gg n and 4 240 gg p the mass of s in wastewater is derived from the calculated s in sludge see section 3 3 below if the proportion of s removed in the sludge out of total wastewater s is the same as the proportion of p van drecht et al 2009 3 2 6 industrial wastewater a summary of the c n p and s contained within industrial wastewater is provided in table 4 the derivation of industrial wastewater element flows is based on a bottom up approach involving calculations for nine industry groups food manufacturing gtap industries 19 26 pulp and paper manufacturing 31 petroleum refining 32 leather 29 textiles 27 chemicals 33 wood products 30 ferrous metals 35 and other metals 36 for each industry group the total mass of organic c toc contained within wastewater is derived as t o c e r w w e c c c where e denotes the quantity of economic commodities produced by the relevant activity measured typically in either us or tonnes rwwec is the rate of wastewater production per unit of produced economic commodity and cc is the organic c composition of wastewater gc g cod 5 5 cod measures the total organic material available for chemical oxidation the values of rwwec for leather textiles chemicals wood products ferrous metals and other metals are expressed as g cod us of commodity and are derived from reported wastewater production values in national ghg inventories combined with sector output values contained within gtap for the food pulp and paper and petroleum manufacturing industries physical rwwec rates i e g cod t are instead applied doorn et al 1997 the relevant data on commodity production in mass terms are obtained from the un industrial commodity statistics and fao foresstat databases san diego mcglone et al 2000 provide factors to convert the cod within industrial wastewater to estimates of organic c n and p content estimates of the s content of wastewater are produced for each sector by multiplying the mass of n contained within the sector s wastewater by an assumed ratio of s to n for industries involved in the processing of animal products gtap industries 19 20 and 29 the ratio is based on the stoichiometry of humans sterner and elser 2002 while for industries 21 and 23 28 the ratios are derived from the calculated element contents of associated crops in the case of industry 22 a s n ratio of sewage sludge werther and ogada 1999 is applied and for industries 30 and 31 the stoichiometry of terrestrial vegetation to complete the calculation of industrial wastewater flows special consideration is given to the generation of inorganic waste s by industrial activities as already explained significant quantities of s are consumed in petroleum refining an average s cod mass ratio of 0 0092 for petroleum refinery wastewater altaş and büyükgüngör 2008 enables calculation of inorganic wastewater s for industry 32 ober 2002 also identifies copper ore processing as a significant producer of waste s originating from the use of sulphuric acid the us rate of sulphuric acid consumption by copper ore processing is reported as 452 000 t s usgs 2006 this is scaled to a global estimate of 5 57 tg s based on relative output of copper from world mines compared with us mines as reported by the usgs 2006 3 3 waste treatment this section describes the quantities of wastes that re enter the economy as reused or recycled materials and the treatment of remaining wastes for final disposal although the actual release of waste products into the environment following treatment fits within the residual generation component of the conceptual framework many of these flows are however outlined here for convenience 3 3 1 crop residuals three principal economic uses of crop residuals are identified animal feed biofuels and paper production starting with animal feed these mass flows are calculated as a f e p f c e r p f c r where afe is the mass of element e contained within crop residuals used as feed pfce is the mass of element e in pasture and forage crops and rpfcr is the ratio of crop residuals to pasture and forage crops within global animal feed the values for pfce are obtained directly from the crop production calculations described in section 3 1 while rpfcr is derived from wirsenius 2003 the resulting estimates of crop residuals used for animal feed are 416 tg c 5 430 gg n 894 gg p and 2 860 gg s the total mass of crop residual c consumed as household biofuel 503 tg is calculated from estimates of household biofuel emissions if around 90 percent of crop c is volatised as an emission yevich and logan 2003 the associated n p and s flows 6 570 gg 1 640 gg and 3 460 gg respectively are then derived from the c flow by applying the stoichiometry of crop residuals according to the work of yevich and logan 2003 only a few types of crop residuals are used in significant quantities as industrial fuel using yevich and logan s 2003 data and the crop production totals from above the estimates presented in table 5 are generated the fao s forestat database records total global production of fibre pulp from materials other than wood and recycled paper as 1 69 mt given the relatively small size of the element flows in question it is simply assumed that the necessary materials originate entirely from crop residuals and that approximately half the input materials are wasted during pulp production the input of crop residuals for paper production is calculated as 30 4 tg of dry matter translating to 17 8 tg c 232 gg n 38 3 gg p and 122 gg s based on the stoichiometry of fibrous crops the quantities of crop residuals burned within agricultural fields are described in section 3 4 all remaining crop residuals i e the difference between crop residuals production and crop residuals used for animal feed biofuels and paper production are calculated to be 891 tg c 9 810 tg n 1 050 gg p and 516 gg s these are treated as an input from the economy to the litter detritus stock 3 3 2 livestock excrement the likely fate of c n p and s contained within excrement produced by livestock varies across the world depending on farming practices grazing animals are assumed to deposit their wastes directly onto land these flows table 6 are calculated by multiplying the estimates of manure production by livestock type by the proportion of the livestock population not reared in confinement smil 1999 of the excrement n discharged directly to land 22 percent is treated as a flow to the atmospheric nh3 stock due to the almost immediate volatisation of this gas laubach et al 2013 the remaining elements contained within these flows are treated as a discharge from the economy to the litter detritus stock the n content of manures from confined animals is greatly reduced during collection storage and handling of the wastes the proportions of collected manure n volatised as nh3 are taken from smil 1999 and range from 28 to 36 percent depending on livestock type total emissions of nh3 are calculated as 14 760 gg n2o is also produced during manure storage and treatment via the combined processes of nitrification and denitrification the literature generally agrees that n2o production requires the presence of either nitrites or nitrates in an anaerobic environment additionally conditions preventing reduction of n2o to n2 such as a low ph or limited moisture must be present ipcc 2006 the ipcc tier 1 method for estimating n2o emissions entails allocating the total amount of n excretion from all livestock species to different types of manure management systems and then multiplying by an emission factor for each type of system this approach produces a global n2o emission rate of 447 gg total household consumption of manure as a fuel is estimated as 68 6 tg c 5 780 gg n and 516 gg p based on the biofuel emissions see section 3 4 while accounting for a proportion that escapes combustion the remaining mass contained within excrement produced by confined animals calculated as 252 tg c 21 200 gg n and 1 890 gg p must be released from agricultural systems back into the environment while most of these wastes will be employed as a form of fertiliser smil 1999 a proportion is also released as waste in either case the flows are treated as inputs to the litter detritus stock upon application to soils a further 15 percent of the n in excrement is volatised as nh3 smil 1999 3 3 3 solid wastes four broad types of treatment practices for solid wastes are covered recycling reuse incineration composting and release to landfills as with other waste related flows there is very little information at a global level to determine the quantities of wastes undergoing these different treatments the proportions by which total waste materials are distributed among waste treatment options are summarised in table 7 the c contained within incinerated and composted wastes is treated as direct atmospheric emissions of co2 and ch4 the edgar database records global ch4 emissions from waste incineration and other waste handling assumed to include composting as together less than 1 tg c even when adjusting for missing country data the estimated ch4 emissions are less than 1 tg c the remaining c within composted and incinerated wastes respectively calculated as 59 3 tg and 18 6 tg is assigned as a flow to the atmospheric co2 stock all n p and s within composted wastes are assigned simply as a flow to the respective element soil inorganic stocks as with c it is assumed that n p and s are all released into the environment during the year in which the wastes are generated although composting rates may be slower accounting for residual generation from incinerated wastes is more complex due to the production of n and s gas emissions emissions of n2 nox n2o and nh3 are estimated from emission factors e g t nh3 n per t of waste n which are in turn derived from national ghg inventories for residential biofuels and wood processing wastes see section 3 4 the resulting emissions are 231 gg n2 n 74 gg nox n 3 gg n2o n and 152 gg nh3 n approximately half the n contained within incinerated wastes remains following subtraction of gaseous emissions and is treated as a residual flow to the litter detritus stock similarly the p content of incinerated wastes is assigned as a flow to the litter detritus stock while for s the element content is assigned entirely to a gaseous emission of so2 the release of solid wastes into disposal sites is considered the point at which wastes leave the economy nevertheless we must also calculate gaseous emissions from landfills the ipcc 2006 methodology for estimating ch4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites is based on a first order decay function which assumes that the rate of doc loss from wastes is highest in the first few years of deposition and then gradually declines as the c is consumed this method requires historical waste disposal data to estimate present day emissions in this instance landfilled solid waste is back caste 55 years from the study year based on the rate of change in global real gross domestic product the estimated doc decomposed at solid waste disposal sites based on the ipcc methodology is 56 8 tg of the doc decomposed the default proportion released immediately as ch4 is 50 percent a proportion of the ch4 produced may however oxidise relatively quickly to co2 the default ipcc value for ch4 oxidation is zero although according to the guidelines values of up to 10 percent may apply in well managed solid waste disposal sites a value of 3 percent is applied producing a global emission for ch4 27 6 tg c and co2 29 3 tg c 3 3 4 wastewater wastewater treatment and discharge methods vary significantly between countries and between rural and urban locations applying ipcc guideline parameters for national ghg inventories ipcc 2006 it is estimated that around 54 percent of total domestic wastewater measured in c terms passes through sewers 22 percent is discharged to latrines 9 percent to septic tanks and the remainder is assumed untreated wastewater channelled by sewers to centralised treatment plants may undergo primary secondary and tertiary treatment with all stages resulting in the production of sewage sludge applying region specific rates for n and p removal in wastewater treatment van drecht et al 2009 and accounting for additional n removed through n2o and nh3 emissions it is estimated that around 1 140 gg n and 862 gg p is removed from domestic wastewater in sludge the c and s contained within sludge respectively 7 81 tg and 285 gg is also derived from the calculated n content based on reported ratios of n c and n s werther and ogada 1999 these sewage sludge residuals are allocated to the landfill solid waste stocks by element the remaining c n p and s contained within domestic wastewater is also discharged to the environment applying parameters specified by san diego mcglone et al 2000 regarding the apportionment of untreated effluent among organic and inorganic species 60 percent of the remaining n and 50 percent of the remaining p are assigned as flows to the terrestrial soil organic stocks and the balance to the soil inorganic stocks by element in the case of s the same shares as p are applied the ipcc guidelines specify a default maximum c emission capacity for domestic wastewater of 0 6 kg per kg of wastewater bod applying this value to the total estimated domestic wastewater production and then subtracting estimated ch4 emissions from wastewater handling gives a co2 emission flow of 32 8 tg the remaining 4 8 tg of wastewater c is assigned as a discharge to the soil organic c stock finally to allocate industrial wastewater c n p and s to receiving environmental stocks it is assumed that treatment processes for industrial wastewater in each country are approximately equivalent to that of domestic wastewater table 8 note however that the flow of inorganic wastewater s includes waste s produced during copper ore processing and petroleum refining 3 4 residual generation 3 4 1 atmospheric emissions tables 9 11 provide a summary of the different types of atmospheric emission flows included in the esam and the relevant literature data sources used in estimating each flow note that the adopted fossil fuel so2 emission flow excluding international shipping of 45 800 gg s is comprised of ten separate emission sub categories within the edgar database with the most important being public electricity and heat production 62 percent of the total emission and manufacturing industries and construction 23 percent the flow for public electricity and heat production is allocated entirely to industry 43 the manufacturing and construction flow is split on a pro rata basis among industries 18 42 and 46 using independently derived estimates of so2 emissions from combustion in these sectors these estimates are derived by first calculating the c content of coal crude oil and petroleum products combusted within each industry based on data recorded in gtap the quantities of c within fuels are then converted to quantities of s based on average c s ratios and finally multiplied by fuel specific scalars describing the proportion of fuel s oxidised during combustion ipcc 2006 the emission estimates noted in tables 9 11 for industrial biofuels wood residuals for each element are a sum of the estimated emissions from combustion of residuals generated during wood product and paper product manufacturing for the wood product manufacturing industry it is assumed that all wood residuals generated during production are combusted a global mass balance table for wood product manufacturing sector is constructed that based on the quantities of raw material inputs estimates the quantities of wood residuals generated as part of these calculations it is assumed 1 around 12 percent of raw timber is bark krausmann et al 2008a b 2 approximately 60 percent of the mass of harvested timber excluding fuel wood is used in manufacturing sawn wood sleepers and wood based panels with a residual generation rate of around one third forestat 3 and a further 9 percent of harvested timber is used in manufacturing other wood products foresstat with a residual generation rate of around 45 percent fujimori and matsuoka 2007 altogether wood residuals of nearly 150 tg c are estimated for the industry constructing a mass balance table for the global paper product manufacturing industry is similarly complex based on the reported production of pulpwood in foresstat it is estimated that around 15 percent of total forest timber removals are used for paper manufacturing adding to this inputs of recovered paper and crop residuals gives a total input of some 232 tg c to the industry of the c inputs to paper production foresstat reports 62 percent is accounted for in the mass of finished products and a further 9 percent is already included in the wastewater treatment accounts table 8 the remaining c is split among combusted black liquor 51 6 tg other combusted residuals 10 4 tg and solid wastes 5 5 tg côté et al 2002 usepa 2010 3 4 2 residuals disposed to land four principal mass flow categories are covered crop residuals synthetic fertilisers agricultural chemicals and livestock excrement table 12 the first and last categories are calculated in section 3 3 turning therefore to synthetic fertilisers tenkorang and lowenberg deboer 2008 estimate the total content of fertilisers as 90 700 gg n and 15 970 gg p unfortunately the quantity of s contained within global fertilisers is less well understood ober 2002 however estimates that around 210 gg s ended up in us n fertilisers during 2000 faostat reports that global n fertiliser production in 2004 was about 9 5 times the us production in 2000 the total fertiliser s flow is set as 1 990 gg fertiliser n and p is shared among three different farming types fertilised grasslands crops and wetland rice based on data recorded in bouwman et al 2002 and assumed n p ratios for fertiliser the s and p contained within synthetic fertilisers are treated as direct flows from the economy to the soil inorganic stocks by element in the case of n however the situation is more complex due to the volitisation of nh3 total nh3 losses are calculated as 12 900 gg n bouwman et al 2002 leaving a flow of 77 800 gg n to the soil inorganic n stock in terms of agricultural chemicals applied to land the usgs 2006 reports that around 2 030 gg s were used in the production of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals in the us it is assumed that local consumption of these chemicals equates to around 94 percent of production and that the us market is around 35 percent of the world market krs network 2006 if most of the s used for production ends up in final products the global flow from the economy to soil inorganic s stock can be estimated as 5 430 gg 3 5 non processed material flows the non processed material flows included in the esam are summarised in table 13 note that material flows associated with below ground crop residuals and crops lost to animal pests are described in section 3 1 additionally there is significant non production biomass flows associated with rice emissions and forestry activities rice emissions are set as 0 04 pg c as derived from wuebbles and hayhoe 2002 and olivier et al 2005 krausmann et al 2008a b estimate global felling losses in forests as 0 653 pg dry matter in 2000 based on a calculated difference in between forest felling and removal as with other vegetation flows included in the esam a c to dry matter content of 50 percent is applied the associated flows of n p and s are then determined from the stoichiometry of terrestrial vegetation like crop production forestry also leaves behind considerable quantities of non processed belowground biomass with the estimated global flows derived from krausmann et al 2008a b herridge et al 2008 provide estimates of biological n fixation for different agricultural systems including extensive uncultivated tropical savannahs used for grazing the estimated rate of n fixation within croplands is around 31 000 tg n for 2005 broken down by some 12 different crop types accounting for small changes in crop production between 2005 and 2004 faostat produces a revised global estimate for croplands of 29 730 gg n fixation flows of 18 100 gg n and 12 000 gg n are also adopted respectively for pasture and fodder legumes and extensive savannahs humans are further responsible for introducing a relatively significant quantity of reactive n to the biosphere because of n fixation in internal combustion engines where conditions of high temperature and pressure enable otherwise inert atmospheric n2 to react with oxygen because n is also contained within fossil fuels and released during combustion careful consideration is required to account appropriately for the total quantity of atmospheric n fixed during combustion the total fossil fuel combustion emissions of nox produced both directly from fuels and from n fixation is estimated as 21 tg n for 1990 galloway and cowling 2002 taking account of relatively significant increases in world primary energy demand between 1990 and 2004 oecd 2004 this is estimated to be 27 tg n the proportion of emissions derived from n fixation is then approximated by comparing the quantity of petroleum delivered to global transport activities iea 2009a 2009b and the likely n content of that fuel with the total quantity of n emissions estimated for transport i e nox n2o and nh3 is reported in the edgar database the resulting estimate is around 11 000 gg n or just over 35 percent of total nox emissions leaving 16 700 gg n released from the oxidation of n contained within fuels kruasmann et al 2008 calculate that nearly 2 500 tg of biomass dry matter were consumed in human induced fires during 2000 if this is approximately the same for the study year and applying a ratio of c emissions released per tg of biomass combusted from ito and penner 2004 total emissions from human induced fires are set as 1 215 9 tg c this flow is disaggregated into individual atmospheric c species based on the relative emissions reported by andreae and merlot 2001 for forest savannah burning i e ch4 emissions make up around 0 6 percent of the total c released during burning and that co2 co and vocs emissions respectively make up the remaining 91 3 percent 7 2 percent and 0 9 percent the emission flows are in turn disaggregated to environmental source stocks terrestrial vegetation litter detritus soil organic c using ratios from houghton 2005 who estimates that the total amount of c lost from land through land use change 77 percent is attributed to loss from vegetation 5 percent from litter and 18 percent from soils as forest and savannah fires are a major component of the land use change flow it is assumed that houghton s percentage shares are also reflective of the relative source contributions of c consumed in wildfires the calculations of n and s emissions from human induced vegetation fires are analogous to the calculations used for natural wildfires consideration is however given to the proportion of living vegetation that while consumed by human induced fires or wildfires is not combusted the ipcc 1996 applies a relatively low factor for non combustion during vegetation fires of around 10 percent while the rates of non combustion discussed by ito and penner 2004 are much higher a rate of 15 percent is applied generating a flow of 170 6 tg c from terrestrial vegetation to the litter detritus stock finally the flow of c resulting from ch4 recovery at landfills is derived by taking the global estimates by bogner 2003 for the period 1980 96 and extrapolating the data forward to the study year 4 results in this section we provide an element based summary of the esam environment economy accounts for each of c n p and s summary diagrams figs 3 6 are produced in a sankey format providing a fascinating description of the exchanges between the global environmental and economic systems to enable the esam information to be viewed within a single page for each element the 58 gtap sectors are aggregated to 12 sectors and the environmental commodities are aggregated into 29 stocks refer to supplementary tables 4 and 5 for concordances as aforementioned a full set of the esam environment economy accounts is provided in supplementary table 3 note that four types of material flows are identified in each diagram 1 processed material flows 2 non processed material flows 3 net wastes and 4 net stock changes and transfers in terms of processed material flows those depicted on the left hand side of each diagram correspond to direct material inputs while those on the right hand side are residuals the net waste type is included to account for net transfers of elements between sectors within wastes these flows are derived by calculating the difference between waste production and waste use recycling reuse and treatment for each sector a flow on the left hand side indicates that the relevant sector uses more of a waste than it produces while a flow on the right hand side indicates that a sector is a net provider of a waste to other sectors as the net waste flows are calculated for each type of waste it is possible for a sector to have a net waste flow depicted on both the left and right hand sides applying the mass balance principle for a given sector and element the difference between the sum of flows of categories 1 and 3 on the left hand side and flows 1 and 3 on the right hand side must correspond to the net transfer of materials to that sectors contained in economic commodities plus any relevant stock changes 4 4 1 carbon material flows the flows of c through the global economy are dominated by a pattern of uptake of high energy c commodities biomass fossil fuels from the environment by primary industries the net transfer of this c within economic commodities down production chains and the subsequent release of low energy c predominantly as co2 emissions by manufacturing services and final consumers fig 3 going slightly against this pattern the animals industry receives a very large input of high energy c in the form of grazed biomass estimated at nearly 2 000 tg with the net stock change and transfer flow for this industry only around 100 tg this occurs because of much of the biomass c required by the animals industry is returned to the environment by the industry itself via animal respiration and excretion furthermore while some c is retained in the animal products sold to other sectors these flows are partially offset by c contained within commodities purchased by the animals industry e g livestock feed and energy commodities similarly the crops industry takes significant quantities of low energy c from the environment and produces a substantial net stock change and transfer flow this is a consequence of the process of net primary production occurring within the industry itself relatively substantial non processed material flows are depicted for the crops industry this is a result of biomass produced by the industry but not used for economic purposes e g lost to pests belowground residuals a substantial non processed material flow is also depicted through the households sector this amounts to 1 140 tg c vegetation and 114 tg c of net soil lost via human induced vegetation fires 4 2 nitrogen material flows fig 4 shows the immense scale of n flows associated with industrial n fixation this is represented by a flow of 128 000 gg n2 n into the manufacturing industry balanced on the right hand side by an almost equivalent net stock change and transfer flow unlike the situation for c the crops industry does not have a substantial net stock change and transfer flowing towards the right hand side of the diagram the net stock change and transfer flow occurs on the left hand side for the industry this means that any n contained within crop products is more than compensated by the n contained in commodities consumed by the crop industry anthropogenic fixation of n2 to reactive n raises the energy state of that n with the energy gradually dissipated as the reactive n is converted through a variety of forms until it is eventually denitrified back to n2 in contrast to the c cycle where the dominant form of anthropogenic residual is the most stable co2 species relatively little n is re released from the economy directly as n2 it is only during fossil fuel combustion that appreciable quantities of the gas are produced estimated at around 19 600 gg n substantial quantities of reactive n are however released into the atmosphere through production of other n residuals particularly nox 18 300 gg n and nh4 31 900 gg it is an unfortunate paradox that reactive n comprises a residual for many activities while for agriculture it is demanded in vast quantities to support crop and pasture production although much of the reactive n released to the atmosphere occurs from dispersed fuel combustion 21 900 gg residuals burned in fields constitute a small source of reactive n 1 650 gg for which there is high potential for better utilisation improving the management of reactive n emitted from livestock farming is important fig 4 depicts a residual flow from the animals industry to the atmosphere of some 30 100 gg n associated with manure emissions coupled with a residual flow to soils of over 50 000 gg n if the coincidence of this reactive n in soils and n uptake by agricultural crops and pastures can be increased this would greatly improve the efficiency at which reactive n is utilised in the production of economic commodities sutton and billen 2011 interestingly before the commercialisation of industrial n fixation livestock manure was the only major form of n fertiliser to croplands jarvis et al 2011 today the transfer of n from animals to crops via manure is relatively small depicted by the net waste flow to the crops industry significant potential also exists to better utilise n in other forms of wastes the total n contained within global wastewater is estimated at some 45 600 gg around 14 percent of this n is retained in sludge 12 percent is released as emissions during wastewater handling and the rest is otherwise disposed to the environment often to waterways 4 3 phosphorus material flows like the n flows depicted above anthropogenic p flows are characterised by a very large flow through the manufacturing industry 19 800 gg associated predominantly with fertiliser production the significant size of the net sock change and transfer flow to the crops industry 11 500 gg also indicates that much of the p applied in fertilisers is lost from the economy almost immediately i e without assimilation into economic commodities another noticeable feature of fig 5 is the very large residual flow out of the electricity industry to the other environmental stock category 9 860 gg p this is explained by the substantial production of coal ash p during electricity generation presently the esam allocates coal ash p entirely as a residual flow to landfills however given the magnitude of coal ash p production it is important that the fate of this p at a global level is understood including rates of reuse or recycling unlike the case for n the only major commercial source of p in fertiliser manufacturing is from mined lithosphere reserves over recent years concerns associated with rising fertiliser prices depletion of reserves and the concentrations of reserves within a few nations have focused greater attention on finding opportunities for improving p recovery reuse and conservation van vuuren et al 2010 vaccari 2011 scholz and wellmer 2013 6 6 the estimated global reserves of po4 3 rock as published by the usgs 2010 2011 increased sharply from 16 pg in 2010 to 65 pg in 2011 largely due to increased estimates of moroccan reserves this has shifted the p debate away from a focus on scarcity toward a focus on pollution edixhoven et al 2013 vaccari 2011 for example describes the technologies that could be employed to better recover p from wastewater including treatment technologies and separation of p wastes at source through use of urine diversion or no mix toilets the total p wastewater flow included in the esam is some 4 740 gg i e 24 percent of the p mining flow like the situation with n there are significant opportunities to improve the reuse of p generated within animal excrement presently of the animal waste that is collected from concentrated animal feeding operations and utilised as a fertiliser much is applied in amounts beyond what can be assimilated by crops resulting in excessive runoff vaccari 2011 the total p contained in livestock p is estimated at some 4 570 gg with more than half produced from confined animals there is also potential to utilise fly ash as a soil amendment providing nutrients reducing acidity improving water retention in crop production schoeman and van deventer 2004 mittra et al 2005 basu et al 2009 due to radioactivity and heavy metal content however the current use of fly ash in agriculture is relatively limited basu et al 2009 4 4 sulphur material flows the largest raw material inputs of s to the economy originate from mined fossil fuels and minerals fig 6 estimated at 64 300 gg s 64 100 gg s and 37 600 gg s for coal petroleum and s minerals respectively although much of the fossil fuel s is combusted to atmospheric s in a pattern like anthropogenic c flows significant quantities are recovered from petroleum refining for use in industrial processes particularly fertiliser manufacture this helps explain the large net stock change and transfer flow depicted on the left hand side for the manufacturing industry gypsum produced as a by product from industrial activities is the ultimate destination for a huge proportion of the s passing through the economy this is estimated at 38 900 gg or 17 percent of all residual s flows like the situation with coal ash p identifying and quantifying any major re use or recycling flows for this residual would improve the s material flow accounts 5 discussion in developing the esam mfas for environment economy exchanges we have attempted to account for human interaction within the gbcs the esam is conceptually consistent with a view that sees the economy as existing at least in a physical sense within the wider biosphere it is also systematic with careful attention paid to the comprehensive inclusion of mass flows for each gbc the esam provides a static model from which a plethora of analytical applications are possible using some of these applications as exemplars we discuss potential extensions of the esam that would enhance its usefulness we specifically focus on those aspects which relate to environment economic exchanges 5 1 both mass and energy units the inclusion of energy flows within the esam framework would from a systems ecological and industrial ecology perspective provide a more conceptually complete description of the gbcs while significant data and time constraints have prevented this from being undertaken it is identified as worthwhile topic for future research 5 2 other global biogeochemical cycles other gbcs are also of great importance and worthy of inclusion within the esam water is an essential compound for life a key transporter of materials and is a common reactant and product of many biogeochemical processes similarly oxygen is often a critical element in redox oxidation and reduction chemical reactions and is thus arguably is inextricably interconnected throughout the gbcs other limiting elements influencing the rate of flow of important environmental processes e g the micronutrient iron required for ocean primary production martin and fitzwater 1988 and similarly plants require magnesium in their chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis importantly the interdependencies between the coupled cycles under perturbation is clearly a potential avenue for further research 5 3 development of a global physical input output table one potential extension to the esam framework and its empirical accounts is to utilise a physical numeraire for the within economy flows essentially this would result in the development of a full piot for each element considered which would facilitate the development of additional mfa indicators it is also noted that with such information it would be easier to investigate how changes in resource inputs to an economic system are connected to changes in residual outputs from that same system this does not imply however that a physical numeraire is necessarily better or should be used in replacement of say a financial numeraire in these regards it is particularly noted that the provision of service activities within an economy often do not involve an identifiable exchange of mass yet the financial exchanges associated with those activities are very important indirectly in determining the nature and rate of physical processes elsewhere within the system ideally an accounting framework for an economic system would include both physical and financial numeraire 5 4 sustainability indicators drawing on the theoretical frameworks of input output analysis and material flow analysis an extensive suite of sustainability indicators may be formulated the oecd 2008 has identified a range of input supply consumption balance describe growth in physical terms output emissions waste pollutants as an environmental burden and efficiency indicators to monitor the material basis productivity management and environmental impacts of material use essentially these indicators describe the level at which the global economy through its transformation of useful resources i e raw materials into residuals i e wastes pollutants emission appropriate the gbcs drawing on input output analysis and a full implementation of the esam smith et al 2014 have used the esam to create a novel suite of sustainability which communicate and monitor humanity s dependence on the gbcs insights are gained by comparing the rate of human appropriation of gbcs with that of the biosphere s regenerative capacity to calculate these indicators a new concept of ecotime is defined as the average gbc time available for matter held within different environmental stocks e g co2 plants fossil fuels to reach biogeochemical processes smith et al 2014 found that humans are placing significant pressure on the gbcs the global economic system is responsible for absorbing significant quantities of ecotime provided by the gbcs particularly in the c but also to a lesser extent in the n cycles an investigation of the terrestrial and oceanic gbcs highlights that more than 20 years of the current rate of regeneration provided by the c cycle is appropriated by the global economy within just one year in the case of the p and s cycles and possibly also the n cycle it would appear that undershoot of gbcs is an additional problem that is likely to deepen over time for the s cycle natural processes particularly soil erosion and river export are responsible for moving elements away from the terrestrial biosphere at a greater rate than the addition of those elements back to terrestrial systems via human processes the current high rate of natural removal of s from terrestrial systems reflects in part landscape changes that exacerbate erosion and the large quantities of biomass s resources that are transformed by the economy into dispersed wastes effectively flushed away by freshwater systems interestingly the level of undershoot of terrestrial s processes is only likely to increase from measures designed to reduce perturbation of the global c cycle this highlights the importance of systems thinking including analysis of interrelationships and trade offs in relation to managing human impacts on the gbcs 5 5 dynamic analysis of biogeochemical cycling an obvious extension of the esam accounts presented here is that that form the basis for a more dynamic analysis the esam records the gbc flows associated with the operation of the cycles including accounting for environment economy interactions with additional information on stock values and understanding of the dynamic coupling of the elemental cycles it is conceivable that the esam could be used to provide base information for a dynamic analysis of the gbcs such analyses are critical as a pedagogic tool that help select resilience building strategies by providing capacity to envisage futures and actions that might attain or avoid outcomes 6 conclusion a broad aim for this paper has been to progress sustainability through the development and application of an integrated systems modelling framework of the coupled gbcs for both the global economic and environment systems this is clearly a worthwhile goal given the essential role of gbcs play in maintaining and regulating the conditions necessary for life on earth as well as supporting the provision of the full range of other services provided by the biosphere to humanity increasing awareness of gbc related problems including global climate change soil acidification and freshwater eutrophication is now placing an increasing need to consider the gbcs in the context of sustainable development coupled environment economy systems are complex and adaptive systems that when subject to significant perturbation have the potential to transition to new stability domains that are not only less desirable but potentially catastrophic to human existence we have described the development of a comprehensive set of mfas for the gbcs of c n p and s these are essentially the mass flows crossing the environment economy interface and resulting from the human use of raw materials e g biomass extraction biomass production minerals extraction fossil fuel extraction industrial n fixation and production of residuals e g atmospheric emissions residuals disposed to land also included are mass flows associated with wastes production e g livestock excrement and crop residuals municipal solid waste industrial solid waste coal ash p municipal wastewater industrial wastewater and treatment e g landfill deposition combustion paper recycling in summarising these flows using sankey diagrams the significant role of the global economy in metabolising high energy commodities produced by the gbcs becomes apparent biomass and fossil fuels are demanded in huge quantities by the global economy and that matter once passed down economic supply chains is re released to the environment largely as dispersed and low energy residuals it is an unfortunate paradox that there exists substantial demand for n and p compounds for agriculture while at the same time there are significant production of those same compounds in unused wastes this highlights a clear need for technologies and practices that greatly improve waste recycling and the efficiency of natural resource utilisation our analysis enables us to not only understand the current state of these cycles but also to focus in on where we might address the discrepancies we find

24916,in this work we address the analysis of discrete time models of structured metapopulations subject to environmental stochasticity previous works on these models made use of the fact that migrations between the patches can be considered fast with respect to demography maturation survival reproduction in the population it was assumed that within each time step of the model there are many fast migration steps followed by one slow demographic event this assumption allowed one to apply approximate reduction techniques that eased the model analysis it is however a questionable issue in some cases since in particular individuals can die at any moment of the time step we propose new non equivalent models in which we re scale survival to consider its effect on the fast scale we propose a more general formulation of the approximate reduction techniques so that they also apply to the proposed new models we prove that the main asymptotic elements in this kind of stochastic models the stochastic growth rate sgr 1 1 stochastic growth rate sgr scaled logarithmic variance slv and the scaled logarithmic variance slv can be related between the original and the reduced systems so that the analysis of the latter allows us to ascertain the population fate in the first then we go on to considering some cases where we illustrate the reduction technique and show the differences between both modelling options in some cases using one option represents exponential growth whereas the other yields extinction 2010 msc 39a50 92d25 keywords metapopulation models environmental stochasticity time scales approximate aggregation 1 introduction mathematical models used in ecology trying to mimic natural systems complexity are often described by a large number of variables corresponding to various interacting organization levels the use of reduction and approximation techniques is a common approach in the analysis of the proposed models among these techniques we could include the so called aggregation of variables methods auger et al 2008 they are in consonance with the important issue of up scaling in the framework of ecological hierarchy theory lischke et al 2007 in this context we consider stochastic linear discrete systems as population dynamics models we distinguish time scales to deal with the complexity of these models our approach consists in assuming the existence of two different processes acting together at different time scales both processes are represented in matrix form each of them in its associated time scale we choose as time unit of the common discrete model the characteristic one of the slow process we suppose that the slow time unit is approximately k times larger than the fast one and further that in this large interval the fast process sequentially acts k times followed by the slow process acting once thus the combined effect of both processes can be described by the product of the slow process matrix times the k th power of the fast process matrix the treated models incorporate environmental stochasticity which refers to unpredictable temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions a number of different environmental conditions are considered and their variation is characterized by a sequence of random variables corresponding to the different time steps of the discrete system tuljapurkar 1990 tuljapurkar and caswell 1997 caswell 2001 each environment is characterized by its corresponding matrix of vital rates given certain hypotheses on the pattern of temporal variation and the vital rates in each environment the distribution of total population size is asymptotically lognormal with an expected value and a variance dependent on two parameters the first one is the stochastic growth rate λ s sgr which is the stochastic analogue of the dominant eigenvalue for deterministic systems we follow cohen s definition for the sgr cohen 1979 because it allows one to directly compare the stochastic rate of growth with its deterministic analogue although some authors tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 define the sgr as the logarithmic rate of growth i e logλ s the second one is the scaled logarithmic variance slv which characterizes the asymptotic deviation of the population size from its mean value the analytical derivation of the sgr and slv is not feasible in most situations so it is necessary to resort to computer simulations the reduction of two scale discrete systems for populations subject to environmental stochasticity was introduced in sanz and bravo de la parra 2000 where some results relating the moments of the solutions of original and the reduced systems were provided in sanz and bravo de la parra 2007 we studied how the sgr of the original system can be approximated by the reduced system sgr for a finite number of environments and a leslie type demography those results were extended in alonso and sanz 2009 to the case of an infinite number of different environmental conditions and the relationship between the slv of the original and the reduced systems was established in this work we focus on the analysis of discrete time models of structured metapopulations with environmental stochasticity and two time scales its purpose is extending to the stochastic case the study performed in nguyen huu et al 2011 for deterministic models in the aforementioned way of separating the slow and the fast process one includes in the former all mechanisms having to do with local demography maturation survival reproduction and in the fast one the migration between patches in nguyen huu et al 2011 it is argued that this way of separating the slow and the fast process might be unrealistic in some ecological situations indeed this approach can be seen as assuming that individuals perform at first a series of k migration events followed by a demographic event in the arrival patch the assumption sounds realistic for reproduction when discrete models describe populations with separated generations but not so much for processes like survival since deaths can happen in any moment of the slow time step to reflect this point in the model we propose to alternatively include survival in the fast process approximating its effect during the fast time unit and we refer to it as the re scaling of survival to the fast time scale the aim of this work is to adapt the method of re scaling to the proposed stochastic models and to compare the asymptotic behaviour of the models with and without re scaled survival in order to do so we use the aforementioned reduction techniques that need to be extended see appendix b so that they also apply to the new model with re scaled survival the re scaling procedure described here for survival in the context of structured metapopulations models might be generalized to a much larger setting nevertheless we consider that it is more accessible to present it in this particular yet still meaningful case the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 1 we present two different metapopulation models for a structured population subject to environmental stochasticity the migration among the different patches is assumed fast with respect to demography in the first of these models in the second one part of demography survival is re scaled to the fast scale with the help of the results in appendix b we propose in section 2 2 a reduction technique of both models to simplify their analysis and comparison the results of section 2 are applied in section 3 in section 3 1 we treat the case of an unstructured population in a multipatch environment where with the help of the reduction technique we obtain approximate closed expressions of the parameters defining the long term behaviour of the solutions in both models in section 3 2 some results for two classes model are established finally in section 3 3 with the help of a particular simple case the relationships between both modeling approaches are discussed following a discussion two appendices are included appendix a briefly introduces the basic form of matrix models with environmental stochasticity and the result on the distribution of population size when the environmental variation is a homogeneous markov chain appendix b includes the presentation of a general reducible linear discrete system with environmental stochasticity defined by means of sequences of matrices with limits suitable for reduction together with the construction of its reduced system and the relationship between their corresponding asymptotic elements 2 methods 2 1 two scale structured metapopulations models with environmental stochasticity in this section we present a stochastic discrete population model whose dynamics is driven by two processes slow and fast whose corresponding characteristic time scales are very different from each other the population is considered structured into q classes and inhabiting an environment divided into r patches we first assume that the fast process has to do with the movements of the individuals between patches whereas the slow process encompasses all the demographic issues births deaths and transitions between classes in a second step we will undertake the re scaling to the fast scale of the death process we represent the state of the population at time t by vector x t x 1 t x q t t ℝ qr where x i t x i 1 t x ir t ℝ r and x iα t denotes the population density of class i in patch α we choose as the projection interval of our model the one corresponding to the slow dynamics i e the time elapsed between times t and t 1 and we denote it by δ t we assume that the population can be subject to n different environmental conditions that we consider indexed by the set i 1 n the environmental variation is characterized by a sequence of random variables τ t t 0 a b defined on a certain probability space ω f p billingsley 2012 over the state space i for each realization ω ω of the process the population is subject to environmental conditions τ t 1 ω between times t and t 1 for each environment η i the slow process is defined by a nonnegative projection matrix d η d η ij 1 i j q ℝ qr qr divided into blocks d η ij diag d η ij α α 1 r ℝ r r where d η ij α represents the rate of individual s transition from class j to class i in patch α during the slow time interval in environment η i note that for each environment η matrix d η ij α 1 i j q ℝ q q represents demography in patch α this matrix does not appear as such in our formulation due to the chosen ordering of the state variables concerning the fast process let p η i α β represent the rate of migration from patch β to patch α for individuals of class i therefore p η i p η i α β 1 α β r ℝ r r is a column stochastic matrix that we assume primitive meaning the ability of individuals initially present in every patch to eventually reach any other patch finally the matrix representing the fast process for the whole population and each η is p η diag p η i i 1 q ℝ qr qr we now introduce the first way of modeling the fast slow system since the time step of the complete model is the one corresponding to the slow dynamics we need to approximate the effect of the fast process over this time interval in order to do so we assume that the fast process acts k times before the slow process does where k might take a large value let τ t 1 be the environmental process that selects the environment to which the population is subjected during interval δ t then the complete system reads as follows 1 x k t 1 d τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t where a k denotes the k power of matrix a model 1 can be interpreted as making individuals first perform a series of k dispersal events followed by the demographic process that occurs in the patch of arrival this assumption might be realistic in some aspects such as reproduction because discrete models are mainly used for species having offspring once every time unit however the situation is different in the case of mortality since individuals may die at any time therefore we propose next a new version of model 1 in which mortality acts at the fast time scale and we call this re scaling of survival to the fast time scale let s η j α 0 be the survival rate of class j in patch α and environment η first we factor every demographic coefficient in order to make s η j α appear explicitly i e we define d η ij α through d η ij α d η ij α s η j α defining d η ij diag d η ij α α 1 r and s η j diag s η j α α 1 r we have d η ij d η ij s η j similarly denoting d η d η ij 1 i j q and s η diag s η j j 1 q we have d η d η s η now we make power k appear explicitly in the survival rates by defining matrices s k η j diag s η j α 1 k α 1 r and s k η diag s k η j j 1 q that verify s k η j k s η j and s k η k s η finally we obtain the following expression for matrix d η d η d η s k η k this expression suggests the next complete model not equivalent to model 1 in which it is considered that mortality acts as the fast time scale 2 x k t 1 d τ t 1 s k τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t this model can be interpreted as follows individuals first perform a series of k dispersal events in which in each of them we consider mortality by taking into account the survival rate in the patch of arrival this is followed by the rest of the demographic process that occurs at the slow time scale 2 2 reduction of systems 1 and 2 following appendix b for system 1 we can take h k η d η p η k and now we must express its limit when k tends to infinity in the appropriate form so that hypotheses 1 and 2 are met the fact that matrix p η i is column stochastic and primitive implies that 1 is its dominant eigenvalue the row vector 1 1 1 ℝ r is an associated left eigenvector and there exists a unique positive right eigenvector v η i ℝ r such that 1 v η i 1 the perron frobenius theorem yields that lim k p η i k v η i 1 calling v η diag v η i i 1 q ℝ qr q and g diag 1 i 1 q ℝ q qr we have that lim k p η k v η g and so lim k d η p η k d η v η g thus matrix d η v η plays the role of matrix d η in 23 we can now write the reduced system 27 for the global variables y t gx t the total number of individuals in each class associated to system 1 in the following form 3 y t 1 g d τ t 1 v τ t 1 y t h ˆ τ t 1 y t let us now proceed to the reduction of system 2 for which we have still following appendix b h k η d η s k η p η k to show that hypotheses 1 and 2 also hold for system 2 we use theorem a 1 in nguyen huu et al 2011 to express in a suitable form the limit of matrix h k η when k tends to infinity for every i 1 q and η i let w η i log s η i 1 log s η i r ℝ r be a row vector and define the scalar γ η i exp w η i v η i then nguyen huu et al 2011 lim k s k η i p η i k γ η i v η i 1 calling v η diag γ η i v η i i 1 q it follows that lim k d η s k η p η k d η v η g and therefore the reduced system 27 associated to system 2 for the same global variables y t g x t is 4 y t 1 g d τ t 1 v τ t 1 y t h τ t 1 y t the interest of the proposed reduction method is that it is possible to obtain asymptotic results for systems 1 and 2 through the analysis of the reduced systems 3 and 4 we need to impose some conditions so that the systems involved have indeed good asymptotic properties theorem appendix 1 in a presents sufficient hypotheses so that the total population size of a matrix model with environmental stochasticity is asymptotically lognormal and describable in terms of a couple of constants the stochastic growth rate sgr and the scaled logarithmic variance slv in appendix b the reduction of matrix models with environmental stochasticity is presented in a general setting in particular it is proved that under suitable hypotheses for both the complete and the reduced systems the total population size is asymptotically lognormal moreover the sgr and the slv of the complete system can be approximated by those corresponding to the reduced system assume that the following two conditions are met the environmental variation τ t is a homogeneous irreducible and aperiodic markov chain i e its matrix of transition probabilities is primitive we denote its unique and positive stationary probability distribution by π π 1 π n the sets h ˆ 1 h ˆ n and h 1 h n are ergodic i e for each of them there exists a positive integer g such that any product of g matrices with repetitions allowed drawn from the set is a positive matrix it is easy to check that for each η i the incidence matrix of h η coincides with that of h ˆ η and therefore if one of the previous sets is ergodic so is the other now we apply proposition 2 and theorem 3 in appendix b and obtain that systems 3 and 4 and for k large enough also systems 1 and 2 verify that the total population size is asymptotically lognormal moreover denoting their corresponding sgr and slv by λ ˆ s λ s λ ˆ s k λ s k and σ ˆ 2 σ 2 σ k 2 σ k 2 respectively we have 5 lim k λ s k λ ˆ s lim k σ k σ ˆ lim k λ s k λ s lim k σ k σ thus the lognormal asymptotic distribution for the complete system 1 can be approximated through the constants λ ˆ s and σ ˆ associated to the reduced system 3 the same happens to system 2 using the constants λ s and σ associated to 4 therefore in order to establish a comparison between systems 1 and 2 we can compare the sgr and the slv of their corresponding simpler aggregated systems 3 results in this section we present some results comparing the two modelling options represented by systems 1 and 2 specifically we carry out this comparison through their respective sgrs and slvs in most ecological models the exact derivation of the sgr and the slv is not feasible this is due to the fact that there is not an explicit expression for the stationary distribution of the population structure therefore it is necessary to approximate those parameters by computer simulations or appropriate perturbation techniques tuljapurkar and caswell 1997 the results presented in section 2 2 justify using the simpler aggregated systems to carry out these simulations moreover there are particular cases in which our reduction procedure transforms a complex model into a reduced one for which we can obtain the sgr and the slv exactly we proceed to introduce two such cases 3 1 unstructured models we first consider the models of section 2 1 when q 1 i e there is no structure in the population we represent the state of the population at time t by vector x t x 1 t x r t ℝ r where x α t denotes the population density in patch α for each environment η i the slow process is defined by the nonnegative matrix d η diag d η α α 1 r where d η α that we assume positive represents the growth rate of the population in patch α during a slow time interval regarding the fast process we represent migrations between patches under environment η by a column stochastic primitive matrix p η ℝ r r we denote v η v η 1 v η r the unique positive right eigenvector of matrix p η associated to eigenvalue 1 whose entries sum up to 1 in this case model 1 reads 6 x k t 1 d τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t regarding model 2 let s η α 0 be the survival rate in patch α and environment η then we define d η α 0 through d η α s η α d η α and denote d η diag d η α α 1 r and s k η diag s η α 1 k α 1 r to obtain 7 x k t 1 d τ t 1 s k τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t in both cases the reduced system is a scalar system in which the only variable is the total population size for system 6 the reduced system is 8 y t 1 h ˆ τ t 1 y t with 9 h ˆ η α 1 r v η α d η α η i in the case of system 7 the reduced system becomes 10 y t 1 h τ t 1 y t where in this case 11 h η exp α 1 r v η α log s η α α 1 r v η α d η α η i since 8 and 10 are scalar we are able to find analytical expressions for their sgrs λ ˆ s and λ s and their slvs σ ˆ 2 and σ 2 we recall that we assume condition c1 and so the markov chain τ t has a stationary probability distribution π π 1 π 2 π n since the d η α and the d η α are positive and so are vectors v η then the h ˆ η and h η are also positive and as a consequence the sets h ˆ 1 h ˆ n and h 1 h n are ergodic so condition c2 holds thus for large enough k all four systems 6 7 8 and 10 meet the sufficient hypotheses for the existence of an asymptotic lognormal distribution for population size using 21 we can obtain explicitly the sgr and the slv that characterize the asymptotic distribution for systems 8 and 10 the reason being that in these cases the normalized population y t y t is trivial equal to 1 with probability one and so the stationary distribution of the chain τ t y t y t is simply that of τ t then it is immediate to obtain that log λ ˆ s η 1 n π η log h ˆ η η 1 n π η log α 1 r v η α d η α log λ s η 1 n π η log h η η 1 n π η α 1 r v η α log s η α log α 1 r v η α d η α regarding the slv for the sake of simplicity in the mathematical expressions we will only consider the iid case i e the case with no serial correlation in τ t the general expressions can be found in alonso and sanz 2009 in that case it is immediate to conclude that σ ˆ 2 η 1 n π η log h ˆ η 2 η 1 n π η log h ˆ η 2 σ 2 η 1 n π η log h η 2 η 1 n π η log h η 2 3 2 two stage models we consider a population structured into two stage specific classes non reproductive juveniles class 1 and reproductive adults class 2 the demography which governs the transition between the different classes is defined by the survival rates of juveniles and adults the maturation rates of juveniles and the fertility rates of adults we represent the state of the population at time t by vector x t x 1 t x 2 t t ℝ 2 r where x i t x i 1 t x ir t ℝ r and x iα t denotes the population density of class i in patch α let α 1 r j 1 2 and η i for each patch α and each environment η let s η j α be the fraction of individuals of class j alive at time n that survive to time n 1 also let m η α be the fraction of the surviving juveniles that mature and become adults finally supposing that reproduction happens at the end of each period of time t t 1 let f η α be the number of juveniles produced by an adult individual in patch α that has survived to time t 1 let us define matrices s η i diag s η i 1 s η i r m η diag m η 1 m η r f η diag f η 1 f η r then the projection matrix d η corresponding to demography for environment η consistent with the ordering of variables in x t is d η s η 1 i m η s η 2 f η s η 1 m η s η 2 ℝ 2 r 2 r regarding the fast process for each environment η and each class i we represent migrations between patches by a column stochastic primitive matrix p η i ℝ r r we denote v η i v η i 1 v η i r the unique positive right eigenvector of matrix p η i associated to eigenvalue 1 whose entries sum up to 1 the matrix representing migration for the whole population is p η diag p η 1 p η 2 therefore in this setting model 1 has the form 12 x k t 1 d τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 its corresponding reduced system is 13 y t 1 h ˆ τ t 1 y t where 14 h ˆ η α 1 r s η 1 α 1 m η α v η 1 α α 1 r s η 2 α ϕ η α v η 2 α α 1 r s η 1 α m η α v η 1 α α 1 r s η 2 α v η 2 α ℝ 2 2 η i we now turn our attention to model 2 i e the model in the case we re scale survival to the fast scale in this case following the proposed technique we define d η i m η f η m η i ℝ 2 r 2 r s k η i diag s η i 1 1 k s η i r 1 k ℝ r r s k η diag s k η 1 s k η 2 ℝ 2 r 2 r and the resulting system has the form 15 x k t 1 d τ t 1 s k τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t to obtain the corresponding reduced system we define γ η i exp α 1 r v η i α log s η i α and then in this setting system 4 takes the form 16 y t 1 h τ t 1 y t where 17 h η γ η 1 α 1 r 1 m η α v η 1 α γ η 2 α 1 r ϕ η α v η 2 α γ η 1 α 1 r m η α v η 1 α γ η 2 ℝ 2 2 η i the reduced systems 13 and 16 are not scalar and so in general they are not analytically tractable there are however several particular cases in which analytical calculations are possible here we focus on one of such cases let us suppose that the parameters that govern demography are independent of the environment and therefore in the notation we drop subindex η and that migration rates depend on the environment through a common multiplicative random variable i e different environments increase or decrease all migration rates by the same factor specifically for each i 1 2 and α β we have p η i α β ξ η i t i α β where ξ η i 0 1 and the t i αβ 0 verify that β α t i αβ 1 for β α we have p η i α α 1 ξ η i β α t i α β then it is easy to check that the eigenvector v η i of p η i associated to 1 is independent of η i e v η i v i v i 1 v i r t for all η i so we have that although systems 12 and 15 are stochastic the reduced systems 13 and 16 are deterministic more specifically we have h ˆ η h ˆ h η h where h ˆ and h are given by 14 and 17 by dropping subindex η therefore λ ˆ s and λ s are respectively the dominant eigenvalues of matrices h ˆ and h whereas σ ˆ 2 σ 2 0 3 3 comparison of the two modelling approaches in this section we use a very simple setting to illustrate the differences between models 1 and 2 due to the large number of parameters involved in the general case we restrict our attention to the case of section 3 1 of a population without structure and further we assume a deterministic setting and that the environment is constituted by two patches we present a first particular case that yields the same growth rates for both systems then a second situation in which the re scaled system always possesses a smaller growth rate and finally a third case where depending on parameter values the growth rate of any of the two systems can be larger than the other in the latter we show in particular that using one of the models can predict exponential growth whereas for the same parameter values the use of the other predicts extinction following the notation in section 3 1 let the demographic parameters of the model be d 1 d 1 s 1 and d 2 d 2 s 2 where d 1 and d 2 denote the fertility coefficients in each patch the fast process is then represented by matrix p 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 1 m 1 where m 1 0 1 represents the migration rate from patch 2 to patch 1 and m 2 0 1 the one from patch 1 to patch 2 p is a primitive stochastic matrix with associated stable probability distribution vector v v 1 v 2 m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 m 1 m 2 in this case model 1 reads 18 x k t 1 d 1 s 1 0 0 d 2 s 2 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 1 m 1 k x k t and model 2 19 x k t 1 d 1 0 0 d 2 s 1 1 k 1 m 2 s 1 1 k m 1 s 2 1 k m 2 s 2 1 k 1 m 1 k x k t their corresponding reduced systems are respectively y t 1 h ˆ y t v 1 d 1 s 1 v 2 d 2 s 2 y t and y t 1 h y t s 1 v 1 s 2 v 2 v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 y t thus we have to compare h ˆ v 1 d 1 s 1 v 2 d 2 s 2 and h s 1 v 1 s 2 v 2 v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 case 1 assuming equal survival rates s 1 s 2 we have h s v 1 s v 2 v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 s v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 h ˆ there is no difference between the asymptotic growth rates of systems 18 and 19 case 2 assuming equal fertility rates d 1 d 2 d and using the inequality relating the weighted arithmetic mean and the weighted geometric mean we obtain h s v 1 s v 2 v 1 d v 2 d s v 1 s v 2 d v 1 s 1 v 2 s 2 d h ˆ i e the asymptotic growth rate of the re scaled model 19 is always smaller than the one of system 18 we would like to stress that the first two cases can be straightforwardly extended to an environment with an arbitrary number of patches case 3 assuming a uniform distribution of individuals between patches v 1 v 2 1 2 we can find depending on parameters values the same results as in cases 1 and 2 and in addition the reverse inequality h ˆ h the expressions for h ˆ and h in this particular case are h ˆ 1 2 d 1 s 1 d 2 s 2 and h 1 2 s 1 s 2 d 1 d 2 considering d 1 and d 2 constant we can write the fraction of the survival rates in both patches c h ˆ h as a function of variable α s 2 s 1 0 in the following way c α 1 α d 1 d 1 d 2 α d 2 d 1 d 2 an elementary analysis yields that c is decreasing in 0 α min and increasing in α min with α min d 1 d 2 and c α min d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 2 1 on the other hand for d 1 d 2 equation c α 1 has two roots α 1 1 and α 2 d 1 d 2 2 one in 0 α min and the other in α min we can conclude from the above that if d 1 d 2 then h ˆ h for s 2 s 1 d 1 d 2 2 1 and h ˆ h for s 2 s 1 0 d 1 d 2 2 1 an analogous reverse result is obtained in the case d 1 d 2 an important additional question is whether h ˆ and h can be one larger than 1 and the other less than 1 since this would mean that one of the models predicts extinction whereas the other predicts exponential growth the answer is positive let us fabricate an example to illustrate this fact take for instance the previous case with d 1 d 2 and s 2 s 1 d 1 d 2 2 1 what implies h ˆ h now just change parameters d 1 and d 2 into 2 d 1 h ˆ h and 2 d 2 h ˆ h it is immediate to see that the corresponding growth rates that we call h ˆ and h verify the required condition h ˆ 2 h ˆ h h ˆ 1 2 h ˆ h h h the previous discussion corresponds to a deterministic setting if we introduce stochasticity the number of parameters is highly increased what renders the model difficult to analyze however one can check that the three aforementioned cases still hold 4 discussion we have dealt with the issue of distinguishing time scales in discrete systems to help in their analysis the setting is on the one hand simple because we deal with a linear structured metapopulation model and on the other hand complex due to the fact that the model considers environmental stochasticity and admits an arbitrary numbers of individual classes and spatial patches when there are two processes acting at different time scales that must be gathered in a single discrete model it is reasonable to choose the slow time unit to express it in this way the action of the fast process can be represented by letting it act a number of times approximately equal to the ratio between the two time scales it is not easy to establish a criterion to classify processes between those that occur at the slow time scale and those happening at the fast time scale indeed let us consider processes such as mortality predation and others which are often measured at the slow time scale if they act almost continuously then it can be argued that they should be better considered as occurring at the fast time scale we have analysed the particular case of survival in a linear stochastic structured metapopulation model first we have proposed a model in which survival is included in the slow process in a second step we have shown how to express its action on a much shorter interval of time by performing a sort of k th root of their action in a slow time unit using this we have proposed a second model to be compared with the first one in which survival has been re scaled to the fast time scale the comparison of the two models is done through their sgrs and slvs as they are the main parameters describing their asymptotic behaviour in general it is not possible to calculate them exactly and so the available course of action is to estimate them by means of computer simulations or other approximations the obtained reduction results simplify this task by performing it for the associated reduced models what is much less costly considering the particular case of unstructured populations their reduced models are scalar what allows one to obtain closed expressions for their sgrs and slvs that approximate the sgrs and the slvs of the original models in this setting of unstructured populations we carry out a comparison of the two models and we present cases where the re scaling of survival makes no difference in the dynamics other cases where considering survival at the fast scale reduces population growth rate and finally some cases where the population growth can be larger in any of the two models depending on parameters values 5 conclusion we have shown the relevance of using time scales when modelling through dynamical systems this is done in the framework of linear matrix models with environmental stochasticity a key point to build an accurate two time scale model is the choice of the time scale that it is associated to each of the processes involved for a given process data can be obtained on a certain time scale and at the same time they are better included in the model on a different time scale to deal with this issue we have considered the procedure of re scaling applied to the survival process survival data are translated from the slow to the fast time scale we have proposed some cases where including survival at either the slow or the fast time scale can mean the difference between exponential growth or extinction of the population this illustrates how important the appropriate choice of time scale can be directly linked to the time scales models are the methods to reduce them they are the tools to simplify their analysis in appendix b we have presented an extension of an already existing reduction technique for linear matrix models with environmental stochasticity this new result has lead to reducing the model with re scaled survival but it can be apply in more general situations the re scaling in the case proposed in this work is rather straightforward but this is not always the case and it would be very interesting to study the influence of time scale choice on other demographic processes nguyen huu et al 2011 proposed a more general approach to re scaling in a deterministic setting that can be extended to the stochastic case along the guidelines and the reduction results presented

presents the basic form of the matrix models that consider environmental stochasticity when the environmental process is a markov chain we assume that the population lives in an ambient in which there are different environmental states that for simplicity we suppose finite and label with η i 1 n a nonnegative matrix a η ℝ n n represents the vital rates of the population in environment η the environmental variation is characterized by a markov chain τ t t 0 1 2 defined on a certain probability space ω f p over the state space i for each realization ω ω of the process the population is subject to environmental conditions τ t 1 ω between times t and t 1 thus the model reads 20 z t 1 a τ t 1 z t where z t z 1 t z n t t represents the population vector at time t for each t 0 1 we assume that z 0 is a fixed nonzero nonnegative vector the following theorem gives important information on the distribution of the total population size z t 1 z 1 t z n t in the sequel the subscript in the norm will be omitted theorem 1 let us assume that markov chain τ t is homogeneous irreducible and aperiodic and further that the set a a η η 1 n of vital rate matrices is ergodic i e there exists a positive integer g such that any product of g matrices with repetitions allowed drawn from a is a positive matrix i e its components are all positive then we have 1 we can define the stochastic growth rate sgr λ s for system 20 through log λ s lim t log z t t with probability one moreover λ s is finite and is independent of the initial probabilities of the chain states and of the initial nonzero population vector z 0 0 and can be calculated through 21 log λ s e f log a τ t 1 z t z t where f denotes the stationary distribution for τ t z t z t whose existence is guaranteed cohen 1977 2 we can also define the scaled logarithmic variance slv as σ 2 lim t v log z t t where v denotes variance and where σ 2 which is finite is independent of the initial probabilities of the chain and of the initial nonzero population vector z 0 0 3 if σ 2 0 the population size is asymptotically lognormal in the sense that log z t t log λ s t 1 2 σ l n 0 1 where n 0 1 denotes a normal distribution of zero mean and unit variance and l denotes convergence in distribution proof the result is essentially lemma 4 in tuljapurkar and orzack 1980 except for a technical detail see theorem 2 3 in alonso and sanz 2009 for the proof appendix b reduction of matrix models with environmental stochasticity we present here a general class of matrix models with environmental stochasticity which can be reduced as well as the reduction technique we also include a result that relates the behavior of the original and the reduced model these models and results generalize those of alonso and sanz 2009 which are only valid for models of the kind 1 to more general models like 2 for the sake of simplicity in this work we deal with a finite number of environments but the general technique is valid even when there is an infinite denumerable or not number of environments let n n ℕ and i 1 n for each k large enough we consider a set of nonnegative matrices a k h k η η i with h k η ℝ n n and denote the population vector x k t x k 1 t x k n t ℝ n let τ t be the markov chain defined in appendix a that selects the environment in each time step then we define the so called complete model 22 x k t 1 h k τ t 1 x k t where we assume that x k 0 is a fixed nonzero vector x 0 0 in order to reduce system 22 we suppose that k is large enough and we impose some conditions which are specified in the following two hypotheses hypothesis 1 for all η i there exists a matrix h η such that lim k h k η h η hypothesis 2 there exist q ℕ q n such that for all η i we can decompose h η in the form 23 h η d η g where g ℝ q n independent of environment η and d η ℝ n q are nonnegative matrices in what follows we accept hypotheses 1 and 2 then we proceed to reduce system 22 in two steps first we define the so called auxiliary system which approximates 22 when k denoting its vector of variables at time t by x t this auxiliary system reads 24 x t 1 h τ t 1 x t d τ t 1 gx t the set of environmental matrices for the auxiliary system is a aux h η η i now we define global variables which will play the role of state variables of the reduced or aggregated system 25 y t gx t ℝ q multiplying both sides of 24 with g we obtain the aggregated system y t 1 gx t 1 gd τ t 1 gx t gd τ t 1 y t which is a stochastic system for the global variables y t that we use as an approximation of system 22 denoting 26 h ˆ η gd η η i we can write the aggregated system as 27 y t 1 h ˆ τ t 1 y t for which the set of environmental matrices is a ag h ˆ η η i note that through the previous procedure we have constructed an approximation of 22 for k large enough that allows us to reduce a system with n variables to a new system with q variables in most practical applications caswell 2001 rogers 2015 q will be much smaller than n in order to obtain asymptotic results of the original system 22 from the aggregated system 27 we proceed to relate the distribution of the total population size for both systems for the results to hold we need to impose the following hypothesis hypothesis 3 for all η i matrices d η are row allowable i e each row has at least a nonzero component and matrix g is column allowable i e each column has at least a nonzero component proposition 2 assume that the environmental process τ t is an irreducible and aperiodic homogeneous markov chain and that hypotheses 1 2 and 3 hold then if a ag is ergodic the set a aux is also ergodic and there exists k 0 ℕ such that a k is ergodic for all k k 0 therefore if a ag is ergodic the aggregated system meets the sufficient conditions of theorem 1 for the sgr and slv to exist and those sufficient conditions are also met by the auxiliary system and by the original system for k k 0 proof a straightforward generalization of the proofs of proposition 4 1 and corollary 4 2 in alonso and sanz 2009 therefore if a ag is an ergodic set we have under the hypotheses of proposition 2 that we can define the following characteristics for the aggregated system log λ ˆ s lim t e log y t t σ ˆ 2 lim t 1 t v log y t original system log λ s k lim t e log x k t t σ k 2 lim t 1 t v log x k t next theorem shows that when k is large we can approximate λ s k and σ k through λ ˆ s and σ ˆ respectively which are easier to compute theorem 3 let us assume the same hypotheses of proposition 2 and in addition that a ag is an ergodic set then we have lim k λ s k λ ˆ s lim k σ k σ ˆ and so the lognormal asymptotic distribution for the original system can be approximated through the parameters λ ˆ s and σ ˆ that correspond to the reduced system proof a quite technical generalization of the proof of theorem 4 3 in alonso and sanz 2009 that will appear published elsewhere 
24916,in this work we address the analysis of discrete time models of structured metapopulations subject to environmental stochasticity previous works on these models made use of the fact that migrations between the patches can be considered fast with respect to demography maturation survival reproduction in the population it was assumed that within each time step of the model there are many fast migration steps followed by one slow demographic event this assumption allowed one to apply approximate reduction techniques that eased the model analysis it is however a questionable issue in some cases since in particular individuals can die at any moment of the time step we propose new non equivalent models in which we re scale survival to consider its effect on the fast scale we propose a more general formulation of the approximate reduction techniques so that they also apply to the proposed new models we prove that the main asymptotic elements in this kind of stochastic models the stochastic growth rate sgr 1 1 stochastic growth rate sgr scaled logarithmic variance slv and the scaled logarithmic variance slv can be related between the original and the reduced systems so that the analysis of the latter allows us to ascertain the population fate in the first then we go on to considering some cases where we illustrate the reduction technique and show the differences between both modelling options in some cases using one option represents exponential growth whereas the other yields extinction 2010 msc 39a50 92d25 keywords metapopulation models environmental stochasticity time scales approximate aggregation 1 introduction mathematical models used in ecology trying to mimic natural systems complexity are often described by a large number of variables corresponding to various interacting organization levels the use of reduction and approximation techniques is a common approach in the analysis of the proposed models among these techniques we could include the so called aggregation of variables methods auger et al 2008 they are in consonance with the important issue of up scaling in the framework of ecological hierarchy theory lischke et al 2007 in this context we consider stochastic linear discrete systems as population dynamics models we distinguish time scales to deal with the complexity of these models our approach consists in assuming the existence of two different processes acting together at different time scales both processes are represented in matrix form each of them in its associated time scale we choose as time unit of the common discrete model the characteristic one of the slow process we suppose that the slow time unit is approximately k times larger than the fast one and further that in this large interval the fast process sequentially acts k times followed by the slow process acting once thus the combined effect of both processes can be described by the product of the slow process matrix times the k th power of the fast process matrix the treated models incorporate environmental stochasticity which refers to unpredictable temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions a number of different environmental conditions are considered and their variation is characterized by a sequence of random variables corresponding to the different time steps of the discrete system tuljapurkar 1990 tuljapurkar and caswell 1997 caswell 2001 each environment is characterized by its corresponding matrix of vital rates given certain hypotheses on the pattern of temporal variation and the vital rates in each environment the distribution of total population size is asymptotically lognormal with an expected value and a variance dependent on two parameters the first one is the stochastic growth rate λ s sgr which is the stochastic analogue of the dominant eigenvalue for deterministic systems we follow cohen s definition for the sgr cohen 1979 because it allows one to directly compare the stochastic rate of growth with its deterministic analogue although some authors tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 define the sgr as the logarithmic rate of growth i e logλ s the second one is the scaled logarithmic variance slv which characterizes the asymptotic deviation of the population size from its mean value the analytical derivation of the sgr and slv is not feasible in most situations so it is necessary to resort to computer simulations the reduction of two scale discrete systems for populations subject to environmental stochasticity was introduced in sanz and bravo de la parra 2000 where some results relating the moments of the solutions of original and the reduced systems were provided in sanz and bravo de la parra 2007 we studied how the sgr of the original system can be approximated by the reduced system sgr for a finite number of environments and a leslie type demography those results were extended in alonso and sanz 2009 to the case of an infinite number of different environmental conditions and the relationship between the slv of the original and the reduced systems was established in this work we focus on the analysis of discrete time models of structured metapopulations with environmental stochasticity and two time scales its purpose is extending to the stochastic case the study performed in nguyen huu et al 2011 for deterministic models in the aforementioned way of separating the slow and the fast process one includes in the former all mechanisms having to do with local demography maturation survival reproduction and in the fast one the migration between patches in nguyen huu et al 2011 it is argued that this way of separating the slow and the fast process might be unrealistic in some ecological situations indeed this approach can be seen as assuming that individuals perform at first a series of k migration events followed by a demographic event in the arrival patch the assumption sounds realistic for reproduction when discrete models describe populations with separated generations but not so much for processes like survival since deaths can happen in any moment of the slow time step to reflect this point in the model we propose to alternatively include survival in the fast process approximating its effect during the fast time unit and we refer to it as the re scaling of survival to the fast time scale the aim of this work is to adapt the method of re scaling to the proposed stochastic models and to compare the asymptotic behaviour of the models with and without re scaled survival in order to do so we use the aforementioned reduction techniques that need to be extended see appendix b so that they also apply to the new model with re scaled survival the re scaling procedure described here for survival in the context of structured metapopulations models might be generalized to a much larger setting nevertheless we consider that it is more accessible to present it in this particular yet still meaningful case the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 1 we present two different metapopulation models for a structured population subject to environmental stochasticity the migration among the different patches is assumed fast with respect to demography in the first of these models in the second one part of demography survival is re scaled to the fast scale with the help of the results in appendix b we propose in section 2 2 a reduction technique of both models to simplify their analysis and comparison the results of section 2 are applied in section 3 in section 3 1 we treat the case of an unstructured population in a multipatch environment where with the help of the reduction technique we obtain approximate closed expressions of the parameters defining the long term behaviour of the solutions in both models in section 3 2 some results for two classes model are established finally in section 3 3 with the help of a particular simple case the relationships between both modeling approaches are discussed following a discussion two appendices are included appendix a briefly introduces the basic form of matrix models with environmental stochasticity and the result on the distribution of population size when the environmental variation is a homogeneous markov chain appendix b includes the presentation of a general reducible linear discrete system with environmental stochasticity defined by means of sequences of matrices with limits suitable for reduction together with the construction of its reduced system and the relationship between their corresponding asymptotic elements 2 methods 2 1 two scale structured metapopulations models with environmental stochasticity in this section we present a stochastic discrete population model whose dynamics is driven by two processes slow and fast whose corresponding characteristic time scales are very different from each other the population is considered structured into q classes and inhabiting an environment divided into r patches we first assume that the fast process has to do with the movements of the individuals between patches whereas the slow process encompasses all the demographic issues births deaths and transitions between classes in a second step we will undertake the re scaling to the fast scale of the death process we represent the state of the population at time t by vector x t x 1 t x q t t ℝ qr where x i t x i 1 t x ir t ℝ r and x iα t denotes the population density of class i in patch α we choose as the projection interval of our model the one corresponding to the slow dynamics i e the time elapsed between times t and t 1 and we denote it by δ t we assume that the population can be subject to n different environmental conditions that we consider indexed by the set i 1 n the environmental variation is characterized by a sequence of random variables τ t t 0 a b defined on a certain probability space ω f p billingsley 2012 over the state space i for each realization ω ω of the process the population is subject to environmental conditions τ t 1 ω between times t and t 1 for each environment η i the slow process is defined by a nonnegative projection matrix d η d η ij 1 i j q ℝ qr qr divided into blocks d η ij diag d η ij α α 1 r ℝ r r where d η ij α represents the rate of individual s transition from class j to class i in patch α during the slow time interval in environment η i note that for each environment η matrix d η ij α 1 i j q ℝ q q represents demography in patch α this matrix does not appear as such in our formulation due to the chosen ordering of the state variables concerning the fast process let p η i α β represent the rate of migration from patch β to patch α for individuals of class i therefore p η i p η i α β 1 α β r ℝ r r is a column stochastic matrix that we assume primitive meaning the ability of individuals initially present in every patch to eventually reach any other patch finally the matrix representing the fast process for the whole population and each η is p η diag p η i i 1 q ℝ qr qr we now introduce the first way of modeling the fast slow system since the time step of the complete model is the one corresponding to the slow dynamics we need to approximate the effect of the fast process over this time interval in order to do so we assume that the fast process acts k times before the slow process does where k might take a large value let τ t 1 be the environmental process that selects the environment to which the population is subjected during interval δ t then the complete system reads as follows 1 x k t 1 d τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t where a k denotes the k power of matrix a model 1 can be interpreted as making individuals first perform a series of k dispersal events followed by the demographic process that occurs in the patch of arrival this assumption might be realistic in some aspects such as reproduction because discrete models are mainly used for species having offspring once every time unit however the situation is different in the case of mortality since individuals may die at any time therefore we propose next a new version of model 1 in which mortality acts at the fast time scale and we call this re scaling of survival to the fast time scale let s η j α 0 be the survival rate of class j in patch α and environment η first we factor every demographic coefficient in order to make s η j α appear explicitly i e we define d η ij α through d η ij α d η ij α s η j α defining d η ij diag d η ij α α 1 r and s η j diag s η j α α 1 r we have d η ij d η ij s η j similarly denoting d η d η ij 1 i j q and s η diag s η j j 1 q we have d η d η s η now we make power k appear explicitly in the survival rates by defining matrices s k η j diag s η j α 1 k α 1 r and s k η diag s k η j j 1 q that verify s k η j k s η j and s k η k s η finally we obtain the following expression for matrix d η d η d η s k η k this expression suggests the next complete model not equivalent to model 1 in which it is considered that mortality acts as the fast time scale 2 x k t 1 d τ t 1 s k τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t this model can be interpreted as follows individuals first perform a series of k dispersal events in which in each of them we consider mortality by taking into account the survival rate in the patch of arrival this is followed by the rest of the demographic process that occurs at the slow time scale 2 2 reduction of systems 1 and 2 following appendix b for system 1 we can take h k η d η p η k and now we must express its limit when k tends to infinity in the appropriate form so that hypotheses 1 and 2 are met the fact that matrix p η i is column stochastic and primitive implies that 1 is its dominant eigenvalue the row vector 1 1 1 ℝ r is an associated left eigenvector and there exists a unique positive right eigenvector v η i ℝ r such that 1 v η i 1 the perron frobenius theorem yields that lim k p η i k v η i 1 calling v η diag v η i i 1 q ℝ qr q and g diag 1 i 1 q ℝ q qr we have that lim k p η k v η g and so lim k d η p η k d η v η g thus matrix d η v η plays the role of matrix d η in 23 we can now write the reduced system 27 for the global variables y t gx t the total number of individuals in each class associated to system 1 in the following form 3 y t 1 g d τ t 1 v τ t 1 y t h ˆ τ t 1 y t let us now proceed to the reduction of system 2 for which we have still following appendix b h k η d η s k η p η k to show that hypotheses 1 and 2 also hold for system 2 we use theorem a 1 in nguyen huu et al 2011 to express in a suitable form the limit of matrix h k η when k tends to infinity for every i 1 q and η i let w η i log s η i 1 log s η i r ℝ r be a row vector and define the scalar γ η i exp w η i v η i then nguyen huu et al 2011 lim k s k η i p η i k γ η i v η i 1 calling v η diag γ η i v η i i 1 q it follows that lim k d η s k η p η k d η v η g and therefore the reduced system 27 associated to system 2 for the same global variables y t g x t is 4 y t 1 g d τ t 1 v τ t 1 y t h τ t 1 y t the interest of the proposed reduction method is that it is possible to obtain asymptotic results for systems 1 and 2 through the analysis of the reduced systems 3 and 4 we need to impose some conditions so that the systems involved have indeed good asymptotic properties theorem appendix 1 in a presents sufficient hypotheses so that the total population size of a matrix model with environmental stochasticity is asymptotically lognormal and describable in terms of a couple of constants the stochastic growth rate sgr and the scaled logarithmic variance slv in appendix b the reduction of matrix models with environmental stochasticity is presented in a general setting in particular it is proved that under suitable hypotheses for both the complete and the reduced systems the total population size is asymptotically lognormal moreover the sgr and the slv of the complete system can be approximated by those corresponding to the reduced system assume that the following two conditions are met the environmental variation τ t is a homogeneous irreducible and aperiodic markov chain i e its matrix of transition probabilities is primitive we denote its unique and positive stationary probability distribution by π π 1 π n the sets h ˆ 1 h ˆ n and h 1 h n are ergodic i e for each of them there exists a positive integer g such that any product of g matrices with repetitions allowed drawn from the set is a positive matrix it is easy to check that for each η i the incidence matrix of h η coincides with that of h ˆ η and therefore if one of the previous sets is ergodic so is the other now we apply proposition 2 and theorem 3 in appendix b and obtain that systems 3 and 4 and for k large enough also systems 1 and 2 verify that the total population size is asymptotically lognormal moreover denoting their corresponding sgr and slv by λ ˆ s λ s λ ˆ s k λ s k and σ ˆ 2 σ 2 σ k 2 σ k 2 respectively we have 5 lim k λ s k λ ˆ s lim k σ k σ ˆ lim k λ s k λ s lim k σ k σ thus the lognormal asymptotic distribution for the complete system 1 can be approximated through the constants λ ˆ s and σ ˆ associated to the reduced system 3 the same happens to system 2 using the constants λ s and σ associated to 4 therefore in order to establish a comparison between systems 1 and 2 we can compare the sgr and the slv of their corresponding simpler aggregated systems 3 results in this section we present some results comparing the two modelling options represented by systems 1 and 2 specifically we carry out this comparison through their respective sgrs and slvs in most ecological models the exact derivation of the sgr and the slv is not feasible this is due to the fact that there is not an explicit expression for the stationary distribution of the population structure therefore it is necessary to approximate those parameters by computer simulations or appropriate perturbation techniques tuljapurkar and caswell 1997 the results presented in section 2 2 justify using the simpler aggregated systems to carry out these simulations moreover there are particular cases in which our reduction procedure transforms a complex model into a reduced one for which we can obtain the sgr and the slv exactly we proceed to introduce two such cases 3 1 unstructured models we first consider the models of section 2 1 when q 1 i e there is no structure in the population we represent the state of the population at time t by vector x t x 1 t x r t ℝ r where x α t denotes the population density in patch α for each environment η i the slow process is defined by the nonnegative matrix d η diag d η α α 1 r where d η α that we assume positive represents the growth rate of the population in patch α during a slow time interval regarding the fast process we represent migrations between patches under environment η by a column stochastic primitive matrix p η ℝ r r we denote v η v η 1 v η r the unique positive right eigenvector of matrix p η associated to eigenvalue 1 whose entries sum up to 1 in this case model 1 reads 6 x k t 1 d τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t regarding model 2 let s η α 0 be the survival rate in patch α and environment η then we define d η α 0 through d η α s η α d η α and denote d η diag d η α α 1 r and s k η diag s η α 1 k α 1 r to obtain 7 x k t 1 d τ t 1 s k τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t in both cases the reduced system is a scalar system in which the only variable is the total population size for system 6 the reduced system is 8 y t 1 h ˆ τ t 1 y t with 9 h ˆ η α 1 r v η α d η α η i in the case of system 7 the reduced system becomes 10 y t 1 h τ t 1 y t where in this case 11 h η exp α 1 r v η α log s η α α 1 r v η α d η α η i since 8 and 10 are scalar we are able to find analytical expressions for their sgrs λ ˆ s and λ s and their slvs σ ˆ 2 and σ 2 we recall that we assume condition c1 and so the markov chain τ t has a stationary probability distribution π π 1 π 2 π n since the d η α and the d η α are positive and so are vectors v η then the h ˆ η and h η are also positive and as a consequence the sets h ˆ 1 h ˆ n and h 1 h n are ergodic so condition c2 holds thus for large enough k all four systems 6 7 8 and 10 meet the sufficient hypotheses for the existence of an asymptotic lognormal distribution for population size using 21 we can obtain explicitly the sgr and the slv that characterize the asymptotic distribution for systems 8 and 10 the reason being that in these cases the normalized population y t y t is trivial equal to 1 with probability one and so the stationary distribution of the chain τ t y t y t is simply that of τ t then it is immediate to obtain that log λ ˆ s η 1 n π η log h ˆ η η 1 n π η log α 1 r v η α d η α log λ s η 1 n π η log h η η 1 n π η α 1 r v η α log s η α log α 1 r v η α d η α regarding the slv for the sake of simplicity in the mathematical expressions we will only consider the iid case i e the case with no serial correlation in τ t the general expressions can be found in alonso and sanz 2009 in that case it is immediate to conclude that σ ˆ 2 η 1 n π η log h ˆ η 2 η 1 n π η log h ˆ η 2 σ 2 η 1 n π η log h η 2 η 1 n π η log h η 2 3 2 two stage models we consider a population structured into two stage specific classes non reproductive juveniles class 1 and reproductive adults class 2 the demography which governs the transition between the different classes is defined by the survival rates of juveniles and adults the maturation rates of juveniles and the fertility rates of adults we represent the state of the population at time t by vector x t x 1 t x 2 t t ℝ 2 r where x i t x i 1 t x ir t ℝ r and x iα t denotes the population density of class i in patch α let α 1 r j 1 2 and η i for each patch α and each environment η let s η j α be the fraction of individuals of class j alive at time n that survive to time n 1 also let m η α be the fraction of the surviving juveniles that mature and become adults finally supposing that reproduction happens at the end of each period of time t t 1 let f η α be the number of juveniles produced by an adult individual in patch α that has survived to time t 1 let us define matrices s η i diag s η i 1 s η i r m η diag m η 1 m η r f η diag f η 1 f η r then the projection matrix d η corresponding to demography for environment η consistent with the ordering of variables in x t is d η s η 1 i m η s η 2 f η s η 1 m η s η 2 ℝ 2 r 2 r regarding the fast process for each environment η and each class i we represent migrations between patches by a column stochastic primitive matrix p η i ℝ r r we denote v η i v η i 1 v η i r the unique positive right eigenvector of matrix p η i associated to eigenvalue 1 whose entries sum up to 1 the matrix representing migration for the whole population is p η diag p η 1 p η 2 therefore in this setting model 1 has the form 12 x k t 1 d τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 its corresponding reduced system is 13 y t 1 h ˆ τ t 1 y t where 14 h ˆ η α 1 r s η 1 α 1 m η α v η 1 α α 1 r s η 2 α ϕ η α v η 2 α α 1 r s η 1 α m η α v η 1 α α 1 r s η 2 α v η 2 α ℝ 2 2 η i we now turn our attention to model 2 i e the model in the case we re scale survival to the fast scale in this case following the proposed technique we define d η i m η f η m η i ℝ 2 r 2 r s k η i diag s η i 1 1 k s η i r 1 k ℝ r r s k η diag s k η 1 s k η 2 ℝ 2 r 2 r and the resulting system has the form 15 x k t 1 d τ t 1 s k τ t 1 p τ t 1 k x k t to obtain the corresponding reduced system we define γ η i exp α 1 r v η i α log s η i α and then in this setting system 4 takes the form 16 y t 1 h τ t 1 y t where 17 h η γ η 1 α 1 r 1 m η α v η 1 α γ η 2 α 1 r ϕ η α v η 2 α γ η 1 α 1 r m η α v η 1 α γ η 2 ℝ 2 2 η i the reduced systems 13 and 16 are not scalar and so in general they are not analytically tractable there are however several particular cases in which analytical calculations are possible here we focus on one of such cases let us suppose that the parameters that govern demography are independent of the environment and therefore in the notation we drop subindex η and that migration rates depend on the environment through a common multiplicative random variable i e different environments increase or decrease all migration rates by the same factor specifically for each i 1 2 and α β we have p η i α β ξ η i t i α β where ξ η i 0 1 and the t i αβ 0 verify that β α t i αβ 1 for β α we have p η i α α 1 ξ η i β α t i α β then it is easy to check that the eigenvector v η i of p η i associated to 1 is independent of η i e v η i v i v i 1 v i r t for all η i so we have that although systems 12 and 15 are stochastic the reduced systems 13 and 16 are deterministic more specifically we have h ˆ η h ˆ h η h where h ˆ and h are given by 14 and 17 by dropping subindex η therefore λ ˆ s and λ s are respectively the dominant eigenvalues of matrices h ˆ and h whereas σ ˆ 2 σ 2 0 3 3 comparison of the two modelling approaches in this section we use a very simple setting to illustrate the differences between models 1 and 2 due to the large number of parameters involved in the general case we restrict our attention to the case of section 3 1 of a population without structure and further we assume a deterministic setting and that the environment is constituted by two patches we present a first particular case that yields the same growth rates for both systems then a second situation in which the re scaled system always possesses a smaller growth rate and finally a third case where depending on parameter values the growth rate of any of the two systems can be larger than the other in the latter we show in particular that using one of the models can predict exponential growth whereas for the same parameter values the use of the other predicts extinction following the notation in section 3 1 let the demographic parameters of the model be d 1 d 1 s 1 and d 2 d 2 s 2 where d 1 and d 2 denote the fertility coefficients in each patch the fast process is then represented by matrix p 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 1 m 1 where m 1 0 1 represents the migration rate from patch 2 to patch 1 and m 2 0 1 the one from patch 1 to patch 2 p is a primitive stochastic matrix with associated stable probability distribution vector v v 1 v 2 m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 m 1 m 2 in this case model 1 reads 18 x k t 1 d 1 s 1 0 0 d 2 s 2 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 1 m 1 k x k t and model 2 19 x k t 1 d 1 0 0 d 2 s 1 1 k 1 m 2 s 1 1 k m 1 s 2 1 k m 2 s 2 1 k 1 m 1 k x k t their corresponding reduced systems are respectively y t 1 h ˆ y t v 1 d 1 s 1 v 2 d 2 s 2 y t and y t 1 h y t s 1 v 1 s 2 v 2 v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 y t thus we have to compare h ˆ v 1 d 1 s 1 v 2 d 2 s 2 and h s 1 v 1 s 2 v 2 v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 case 1 assuming equal survival rates s 1 s 2 we have h s v 1 s v 2 v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 s v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 h ˆ there is no difference between the asymptotic growth rates of systems 18 and 19 case 2 assuming equal fertility rates d 1 d 2 d and using the inequality relating the weighted arithmetic mean and the weighted geometric mean we obtain h s v 1 s v 2 v 1 d v 2 d s v 1 s v 2 d v 1 s 1 v 2 s 2 d h ˆ i e the asymptotic growth rate of the re scaled model 19 is always smaller than the one of system 18 we would like to stress that the first two cases can be straightforwardly extended to an environment with an arbitrary number of patches case 3 assuming a uniform distribution of individuals between patches v 1 v 2 1 2 we can find depending on parameters values the same results as in cases 1 and 2 and in addition the reverse inequality h ˆ h the expressions for h ˆ and h in this particular case are h ˆ 1 2 d 1 s 1 d 2 s 2 and h 1 2 s 1 s 2 d 1 d 2 considering d 1 and d 2 constant we can write the fraction of the survival rates in both patches c h ˆ h as a function of variable α s 2 s 1 0 in the following way c α 1 α d 1 d 1 d 2 α d 2 d 1 d 2 an elementary analysis yields that c is decreasing in 0 α min and increasing in α min with α min d 1 d 2 and c α min d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 2 1 on the other hand for d 1 d 2 equation c α 1 has two roots α 1 1 and α 2 d 1 d 2 2 one in 0 α min and the other in α min we can conclude from the above that if d 1 d 2 then h ˆ h for s 2 s 1 d 1 d 2 2 1 and h ˆ h for s 2 s 1 0 d 1 d 2 2 1 an analogous reverse result is obtained in the case d 1 d 2 an important additional question is whether h ˆ and h can be one larger than 1 and the other less than 1 since this would mean that one of the models predicts extinction whereas the other predicts exponential growth the answer is positive let us fabricate an example to illustrate this fact take for instance the previous case with d 1 d 2 and s 2 s 1 d 1 d 2 2 1 what implies h ˆ h now just change parameters d 1 and d 2 into 2 d 1 h ˆ h and 2 d 2 h ˆ h it is immediate to see that the corresponding growth rates that we call h ˆ and h verify the required condition h ˆ 2 h ˆ h h ˆ 1 2 h ˆ h h h the previous discussion corresponds to a deterministic setting if we introduce stochasticity the number of parameters is highly increased what renders the model difficult to analyze however one can check that the three aforementioned cases still hold 4 discussion we have dealt with the issue of distinguishing time scales in discrete systems to help in their analysis the setting is on the one hand simple because we deal with a linear structured metapopulation model and on the other hand complex due to the fact that the model considers environmental stochasticity and admits an arbitrary numbers of individual classes and spatial patches when there are two processes acting at different time scales that must be gathered in a single discrete model it is reasonable to choose the slow time unit to express it in this way the action of the fast process can be represented by letting it act a number of times approximately equal to the ratio between the two time scales it is not easy to establish a criterion to classify processes between those that occur at the slow time scale and those happening at the fast time scale indeed let us consider processes such as mortality predation and others which are often measured at the slow time scale if they act almost continuously then it can be argued that they should be better considered as occurring at the fast time scale we have analysed the particular case of survival in a linear stochastic structured metapopulation model first we have proposed a model in which survival is included in the slow process in a second step we have shown how to express its action on a much shorter interval of time by performing a sort of k th root of their action in a slow time unit using this we have proposed a second model to be compared with the first one in which survival has been re scaled to the fast time scale the comparison of the two models is done through their sgrs and slvs as they are the main parameters describing their asymptotic behaviour in general it is not possible to calculate them exactly and so the available course of action is to estimate them by means of computer simulations or other approximations the obtained reduction results simplify this task by performing it for the associated reduced models what is much less costly considering the particular case of unstructured populations their reduced models are scalar what allows one to obtain closed expressions for their sgrs and slvs that approximate the sgrs and the slvs of the original models in this setting of unstructured populations we carry out a comparison of the two models and we present cases where the re scaling of survival makes no difference in the dynamics other cases where considering survival at the fast scale reduces population growth rate and finally some cases where the population growth can be larger in any of the two models depending on parameters values 5 conclusion we have shown the relevance of using time scales when modelling through dynamical systems this is done in the framework of linear matrix models with environmental stochasticity a key point to build an accurate two time scale model is the choice of the time scale that it is associated to each of the processes involved for a given process data can be obtained on a certain time scale and at the same time they are better included in the model on a different time scale to deal with this issue we have considered the procedure of re scaling applied to the survival process survival data are translated from the slow to the fast time scale we have proposed some cases where including survival at either the slow or the fast time scale can mean the difference between exponential growth or extinction of the population this illustrates how important the appropriate choice of time scale can be directly linked to the time scales models are the methods to reduce them they are the tools to simplify their analysis in appendix b we have presented an extension of an already existing reduction technique for linear matrix models with environmental stochasticity this new result has lead to reducing the model with re scaled survival but it can be apply in more general situations the re scaling in the case proposed in this work is rather straightforward but this is not always the case and it would be very interesting to study the influence of time scale choice on other demographic processes nguyen huu et al 2011 proposed a more general approach to re scaling in a deterministic setting that can be extended to the stochastic case along the guidelines and the reduction results presented here acknowledgements authors are supported by ministerio de economía y competitividad spain project mtm2014 56022 c2 1 p appendix a matrix models with environmental stochasticity this section presents the basic form of the matrix models that consider environmental stochasticity when the environmental process is a markov chain we assume that the population lives in an ambient in which there are different environmental states that for simplicity we suppose finite and label with η i 1 n a nonnegative matrix a η ℝ n n represents the vital rates of the population in environment η the environmental variation is characterized by a markov chain τ t t 0 1 2 defined on a certain probability space ω f p over the state space i for each realization ω ω of the process the population is subject to environmental conditions τ t 1 ω between times t and t 1 thus the model reads 20 z t 1 a τ t 1 z t where z t z 1 t z n t t represents the population vector at time t for each t 0 1 we assume that z 0 is a fixed nonzero nonnegative vector the following theorem gives important information on the distribution of the total population size z t 1 z 1 t z n t in the sequel the subscript in the norm will be omitted theorem 1 let us assume that markov chain τ t is homogeneous irreducible and aperiodic and further that the set a a η η 1 n of vital rate matrices is ergodic i e there exists a positive integer g such that any product of g matrices with repetitions allowed drawn from a is a positive matrix i e its components are all positive then we have 1 we can define the stochastic growth rate sgr λ s for system 20 through log λ s lim t log z t t with probability one moreover λ s is finite and is independent of the initial probabilities of the chain states and of the initial nonzero population vector z 0 0 and can be calculated through 21 log λ s e f log a τ t 1 z t z t where f denotes the stationary distribution for τ t z t z t whose existence is guaranteed cohen 1977 2 we can also define the scaled logarithmic variance slv as σ 2 lim t v log z t t where v denotes variance and where σ 2 which is finite is independent of the initial probabilities of the chain and of the initial nonzero population vector z 0 0 3 if σ 2 0 the population size is asymptotically lognormal in the sense that log z t t log λ s t 1 2 σ l n 0 1 where n 0 1 denotes a normal distribution of zero mean and unit variance and l denotes convergence in distribution proof the result is essentially lemma 4 in tuljapurkar and orzack 1980 except for a technical detail see theorem 2 3 in alonso and sanz 2009 for the proof appendix b reduction of matrix models with environmental stochasticity we present here a general class of matrix models with environmental stochasticity which can be reduced as well as the reduction technique we also include a result that relates the behavior of the original and the reduced model these models and results generalize those of alonso and sanz 2009 which are only valid for models of the kind 1 to more general models like 2 for the sake of simplicity in this work we deal with a finite number of environments but the general technique is valid even when there is an infinite denumerable or not number of environments let n n ℕ and i 1 n for each k large enough we consider a set of nonnegative matrices a k h k η η i with h k η ℝ n n and denote the population vector x k t x k 1 t x k n t ℝ n let τ t be the markov chain defined in appendix a that selects the environment in each time step then we define the so called complete model 22 x k t 1 h k τ t 1 x k t where we assume that x k 0 is a fixed nonzero vector x 0 0 in order to reduce system 22 we suppose that k is large enough and we impose some conditions which are specified in the following two hypotheses hypothesis 1 for all η i there exists a matrix h η such that lim k h k η h η hypothesis 2 there exist q ℕ q n such that for all η i we can decompose h η in the form 23 h η d η g where g ℝ q n independent of environment η and d η ℝ n q are nonnegative matrices in what follows we accept hypotheses 1 and 2 then we proceed to reduce system 22 in two steps first we define the so called auxiliary system which approximates 22 when k denoting its vector of variables at time t by x t this auxiliary system reads 24 x t 1 h τ t 1 x t d τ t 1 gx t the set of environmental matrices for the auxiliary system is a aux h η η i now we define global variables which will play the role of state variables of the reduced or aggregated system 25 y t gx t ℝ q multiplying both sides of 24 with g we obtain the aggregated system y t 1 gx t 1 gd τ t 1 gx t gd τ t 1 y t which is a stochastic system for the global variables y t that we use as an approximation of system 22 denoting 26 h ˆ η gd η η i we can write the aggregated system as 27 y t 1 h ˆ τ t 1 y t for which the set of environmental matrices is a ag h ˆ η η i note that through the previous procedure we have constructed an approximation of 22 for k large enough that allows us to reduce a system with n variables to a new system with q variables in most practical applications caswell 2001 rogers 2015 q will be much smaller than n in order to obtain asymptotic results of the original system 22 from the aggregated system 27 we proceed to relate the distribution of the total population size for both systems for the results to hold we need to impose the following hypothesis hypothesis 3 for all η i matrices d η are row allowable i e each row has at least a nonzero component and matrix g is column allowable i e each column has at least a nonzero component proposition 2 assume that the environmental process τ t is an irreducible and aperiodic homogeneous markov chain and that hypotheses 1 2 and 3 hold then if a ag is ergodic the set a aux is also ergodic and there exists k 0 ℕ such that a k is ergodic for all k k 0 therefore if a ag is ergodic the aggregated system meets the sufficient conditions of theorem 1 for the sgr and slv to exist and those sufficient conditions are also met by the auxiliary system and by the original system for k k 0 proof a straightforward generalization of the proofs of proposition 4 1 and corollary 4 2 in alonso and sanz 2009 therefore if a ag is an ergodic set we have under the hypotheses of proposition 2 that we can define the following characteristics for the aggregated system log λ ˆ s lim t e log y t t σ ˆ 2 lim t 1 t v log y t original system log λ s k lim t e log x k t t σ k 2 lim t 1 t v log x k t next theorem shows that when k is large we can approximate λ s k and σ k through λ ˆ s and σ ˆ respectively which are easier to compute theorem 3 let us assume the same hypotheses of proposition 2 and in addition that a ag is an ergodic set then we have lim k λ s k λ ˆ s lim k σ k σ ˆ and so the lognormal asymptotic distribution for the original system can be approximated through the parameters λ ˆ s and σ ˆ that correspond to the reduced system proof a quite technical generalization of the proof of theorem 4 3 in alonso and sanz 2009 that will appear published elsewhere 
24917,this article aims to construct a land use simulation and decision support system landsds to comprehensively explore the interference and impact of natural environment individual choice and national macro policies on land use and cover change landsds takes full advantage of system dynamics sd model agent based model abm cellular automata ca model and geographic information system gis 1 on the one hand sd model controls land use area change on macro level on the other hand by passing the parameters values from sd model to ca model the iterations of ca model are controlled macroscopically and at the same time the transition rules in the ca model are affected microscopically by sd model 2 by simulating the complex selection behaviors of different agents abm enforces or participates in the cells transformation behaviors in ca model on the micro evolution scale 3 taking ca model as a breakthrough point the micro cell unit is used to realize the data exchange and communication between sd abm ca by integrating ca with sd and ca with abm and 4 using gis s powerful spatial computing and data processing capabilities the simulation results are further analyzed and processed to obtain more effective information landsds can solve the top down data analysis and graphic visualization problems caused by target data or policy mutations and can also handle the data and graphic visualization problems caused by the temporal and spatial changes of cell units the system solves the analysis methods and technical problems about the top down and bottom up seamless integration of the spatial and temporal models beijing urban expansion was taken as an example to demonstrate the availability of the system keywords land use simulation decision support system dynamics model agent based model cellular automata model 1 introduction due to the rapid population growth especially in developing countries urban expansion has become an increasingly serious problem he et al 2006 in cities the main factors driving land use change are derived from human activities a lot of evidence has shown that human behavior especially excessive cultivation and urbanization has caused many problems such as environmental problems food security and loss of biodiversity which have become more and more serious fang et al 2019 hu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 how to achieve the harmonious development between human activities and urban sustainability has become an important and severe problem therefore it is very necessary to construct a system for simulating land use change to provide constructive opinions and suggestions for the government and explore urban growth and sustainable development issues land use and cover change models are the main tools for studying land use problems and are also the key content for land use research which can help people better understand and explore the land system s dynamic characteristics and laws among the existing research results there are many macro and micro models used to explore land use change for example markov model arsanjani et al 2013 gong et al 2015 system dynamics sd model han et al 2009 and cellular automata ca model singh et al 2018 vaz and arsanjani 2015 these models have advantages in some respects and can solve some specific problems and there are also some coupled models that integrate some of these models clarke and gaydos 1998 liu et al 2015 munshi et al 2014 among these coupled models there mainly exist the following two problems 1 the unidirectionality of the feedback mechanism in the multi dimensional integrated model it is loose coupling between top down and bottom up models in fact it is always the coupled model based on function and application which realizes the one way communication from macro to micro these coupled models are unable to feedback the influence of micro evolution results on the macro change and do not form the real time and bidirectional communication between sub models to achieve real interaction and integration and 2 the lack of research on human environment mechanisms the interaction impact and constraints between human beings and their environment are the important factors that affect land use change in most single or coupled models there is lack of human agents influence which does not effectively consider the interaction between human and land he et al 2005 kazak 2018 yang et al 2012 based on the above problems we aim to construct a unified basic model that simulates land use change from macro to micro multi dimension and multi angle by screening out several dynamic models sd model combines system theory cybernetics and computer simulation and can build a causal feedback loop among various factors to explore the interrelationships and influences thereby gaining macroscopic meaning and guidance since sd model can easily introduce various macro driving factors it makes the scenarios simulation research simple which is very useful for testing policy recommendations sd model has been widely used to solve complicated social and natural problems castellazzi et al 2010 guo et al 2001 liu et al 2013 however the most obvious shortcoming of sd model is that there is no spatial representation ability and micro individual behavior cannot be considered based on this we introduced another dynamic model ca model ca model is a bottom up and microscopic model white et al 1997 ca model determines the next state of cell based on the current cell state the neighborhood the transition rule and so on many studies have shown that the ca model can achieve simulation studies on macro scale by the simple evolution of each cell on micro scale chen et al 2002 white and engelen 1993 its application in land use change and urban development is extensive and in depth which is also a hot spot for ca research clarke and gaydos 1998 lauf et al 2012 wu et al 2010 meanwhile ca model has spatial characters and can be integrated with geographic information system gis well gis can capture process and calculate spatial data well and have strong spatial storing managing and analyzing ability zhang and huang 2014 gis is widely used in the integration research with ca model clarke and gaydos 1998 yeh and li 2001 but the ca model cannot simulate the complex individual behavior nor is it mobile so we need to import abm to make the coupling model more perfect and comprehensive in recent years abm has attracted the attention of more and more scholars abm is often employed to study social phenomena epstein 1999 liu et al 2007 tian et al 2016 the abm model is another bottom up model and is also microscopic the biggest difference with ca model is the mobility of abm in abm the whole system produces pattern changes in the macro dimension according to the interaction between different microscopic individuals lambin et al 2003 abm can directly capture the interactive properties of nature and human systems as well as capture the complex system behaviors brought by these interactivity unlike ca model which focuses on transition rules abm is well suited for representing the evolutionary process between human activities and natural environment abm can map real world concepts and structures into the models white and engelen 2000 based on the previous temporal spatial dynamics method tsdm liu et al 2018 2017 and the geographic system basic model zheng 2012 this study presents a land use simulation and decision support system landsds which contains a sd model an abm a ca model and a gis by integrating the above four model the system can build a basic comprehensive model for land use simulation the model integrate the four sub models advantage and make up the weaknesses which can simulate land use change in multiple scales and multiple perspectives and provide help for the decision making section 2 mainly introduces the principle of landsds the interaction between sub models and how to build the three sub models section 3 is about the data use in the paper section 4 provides the precision verification of the system based on the study area and shows an in depth discussion about the system section 5 presents conclusions 2 methods 2 1 landsds this paper constructed a landsds which deeply integrates sd model abm ca model and gis in the landsds the sd model controls the distribution of each element on the macro amount according to its advantages in time dimension and macro dimension at the same time it is convenient to set various reasonable scenarios simulation by changing the values of some parameters in sd model abm influences the spatial distribution of various elements on the micro scale according to the simulation for the complex dynamic behaviors of different agents ca model uses its advantage in the spatial dimension to determine the micro pattern by defining the transition rules for the cell based on the above the system make full use of the spatial computing power of gis to make further analysis for the simulation results at the same time as shown in fig 1 before the system starts to run the initial conditions required in sd model abm and ca model are first set according to spatial data statistical data policy files and other ancillary data then the appropriate indicator parameters single or multiple are selected as the medium for interactive communication between sd model and ca model after the setting for initial conditions of the system the sd model is first run to obtain the values for the selected indicator parameters and then the results are fed back to the ca model thirdly according to different agents selection behaviors decided by various socio economic factors the influence of abm is introduced into ca model in ca model according to the factors such as the cell state and the influence of the neighborhood the cell state at next moment is calculated combined with the index parameters transmitted from sd model and the influence from abm when the iterations in ca model equals the number which is controlled by sd model the index parameters calculated on the spatial scale in ca model are transmitted to the sd model to fine tune the parameter values in sd equations and the simulation is pushed to the next moment the loop is stopped until the simulation reaches the set time and the simulation results are exported during the simulation process the users can track the changes of any elements and pause the simulation at any time the users also can export the simulation results of the spatial data and the tracked data for in depth analysis and study under gis or other statistical platforms at any time in landsds the data interaction and mutual influence between each sub models are realized with the smallest grid unit as the breakthrough the overall relationship can be expressed as modified from liu et al 2017 1 f t 1 f s d t 1 a b m t c a t where f t 1 represents the land use state at time t 1 s d t 1 is the effect of the sd model on the state transition at time t 1 a b m t denotes the effect of abm on the state transition at time t c a t r e p r e s e n t s t h e e f f e c t o f c a m o d e l o n t h e s t a t e t r a n s i t i o n a t t i m e t f is the transition function and indicates the proportional relationship 2 2 integration between sd and ca as shown in fig 2 the data bidirectional interaction mechanism between sd model and ca model is displayed in the traditional integration model between sd model and ca model the iterations of ca model are generally controlled by the macro parameters in sd model which is only the data flow and impact form sd model to ca model in the interaction mechanism of landsds constructed in this paper the data bidirectional communication and influence between sd model and ca model are realized by selecting appropriate indicators firstly the sd model is run to get the values of the selected indicator then the parameters are passed to ca model and the ca model is started to run in ca model the iterations are controlled and the transition rules are affected on micro scale according to the parameters which are passed from sd model when the evolution is push to the next time the indicators values obtained from ca model are fed back to sd model to adjust the parameters of dynamic equations bidirectional real time communication between the two sub models is achieved through data transfer between sd model and ca model through the bidirectional real time communication mechanism the trend of simulation results is corrected in time which is more in line with the reality that the government proposes some short term goals to achieve long term planning 2 3 integration between abm and ca the ca model which comprehensively considers the factors of natural environment and neighborhood influence can better simulate the land use change process but does not consider the dominant role for controlling land use change and in real life the dominant role such as the government usually play a decisive role in land use change based on this we coupled ca model with abm to introduce human land interactions into land use change simulations in this study taking urban expansion as an example agents are divided into two categories resident agents and government agents the resident agents select the suitable land for living by considering the surrounding environment such as transportation convenience environmental suitability and school convenience government agents determine the land use type for a particular plot through the macro planning at the same time according to the china s condition the choices of government agents are absolutely authoritative in the decision for the land use pattern for example if the government classifies a certain area as an ecological protection area the land parcels in the area will not be allowed to convert into other land use types in the integration of abm and ca model the selection behaviors of resident agents are determined according to the surrounding environment human factors and other factors the behaviors influence the transition rules in ca model to some extent to decide the land use type for a certain plot at the same time combined with the macro plan of the government agents in a period of time it is checked whether the land use type for a certain plot is allowed to determine the land use type finally fig 3 shows the integration mechanism between abm and ca model 2 4 the causal relationship in sd sd model explores the complex and non linear effects between various factors by construction a causal relationship to obtain useful information at macro level theobald and gross 1994 in the process of urban development the land use system is complex and variable and is interfered by many factors such as human therefore sd model is often used to explore complex urban expansion behaviors han et al 2009 shen et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in this study we construct a sd model to explore the impact of human activities on urban growth meanwhile to simplify the calculation we suppose that the land use change is affected only by human activities and ignore the natural choice in sd model there mainly contains three subsystems namely population subsystem economy subsystem and land use subsystem fig 4 the population increase has led to the demand increase for built up land at the same time further investment in the land has also promoted the expansion of urban built up land to a certain extent 2 5 transition rules in ca transition rules is the core of ca model the traditional ca transition rules can be expressed as 2 s t 1 f s t n t where st 1 is the cell state at time t 1 s t is the cell state at time t n t represents the state of the neighbor cell at time t and f refers to the transfer function for cell state from time t to time t 1 in this study the impact of sd model and abm is extended into the ca transition rules therefore the ca transition rules can be calculated as 3 s t 1 f s t n t d t 1 b t where d t 1 indicates the macro factors influence on cell state change at time t 1 and b t is the agent behaviors influence on cell state change at time t the more detailed formulas can be found in liu et al 2017 2 6 agents behaviors rules in abm in this paper the relationship of abm can be expressed as 4 u k f r e s i d e n t f a u t h o r i t y where u k represents the combined effect of the different agents on the land use change f r e s i d e n t indicates the effect of the resident agents on the land use change and f a u t h o r i t y indicates the effect of the government agents on the land use change in this study the role of government mainly reflects in macro planning which determines the land use pattern based on a series of factors given china s conditions the government planning has a high level mandatory role the choices of resident agents are often influenced by the surrounding living environment for example people often choose to live in the places where the public facilities are relatively complete and the environment is friendly after comprehensive consideration of various factors the choices of resident agents in this paper are mainly influenced by the following factors transportation convenience facility convenience education convenience hospital convenience and environmental friendliness the relationship can be expressed as 5 f r e s i d e n t β t r a f f i c x t r a f f i c β f a c i l i t y x f a c i l i t y β e d u c a t i o n x e d u c a t i o n β h o s p i t a l x h o s p i t a l

education convenience hospital convenience and environmental friendliness on land use change respectively and γ is the random interference value 3 study area and data beijing is china s political economic and cultural center and is adjacent to tianjin and hebei province beijing is one of the most densely populated and oldest cities in the world with a history of more than 3000 years li et al 2005 and it will host the winter olympic games in 2022 there are 16 districts under the jurisdiction of beijing which are divided into four functional zones namely capital functional core zone urban function development zone urban development new zone and ecological conservation development zone the total area of beijing is 16410 54 km2 by 2016 the resident population of beijing reached 21 73 million and the gross domestic product gdp reached 2566 91 billion yuan beijing municipal statistics bureau 2017 the huge population makes beijing so crowded the road system in beijing is like a network and there are six rings from the downtown area to the suburbs similar to other big cities in developing countries beijing faces many problems such as environmental pollution and population overload chen et al 2005 in this study we selected the land use data of beijing for 1995 2005 and 2015 to simulate the land use and cover change the land use data came from data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences liu et al 2005 through the visual interpretation of the landsat data the overall accuracy of interpretation is over 94 3 liu et al 2014 the data is mainly divided into six first class categories cropland woodland grassland water body built up land and unused land liu et al 2005 because there are few unused land in beijing and most of them are located in woodland we reclassified the land use types into four types cropland woodland and grassland built up land and water body according to the availability and accessibility of the data eight environmental elements were selected as shown in table 1 which were derived from the institute of remote sensing and digital earth chinese academy of sciences all of the spatial data was obtained based on the project supported by the ministry of land and resources of china 4 results 4 1 simulation results 4 1 1 the construction of transition rules for ca model in ca model the transition rules are the core content the current mining methods for the transition rules are various and the more commonly used are data mining li and gar on yeh 2004 ant colony optimization liu et al 2008 2007 yang et al 2012 logistic regression liu et al 2015 munshi et al 2014 and so on in this paper logistic regression method was used to obtain the influence probability of surrounding environment on the land use type change the formula can be expressed as 6 φ 1 1 e x p y 7 y β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n α where φ represents the influence probability of the surrounding environment on the land use type change β 1 β 2 and β n are the regression coefficients x 1 x 2 and x n represent the values of the driving factors e g the values of the distance to schools and α is the regression constant according to the availability and acquirable of the data the socio economic factors selected in this paper include distance to schools distance to markets distance to hospitals distance to restaurants distance to banks distance to hotels and distance to roads fig 5 in arcgis software the values of these environmental elements were obtained through 4952 valid random points prior to the logistic regression the values of these variables were normalized to exclude the effects of different scales the normalization formula can be expressed as tian et al 2011 8 s i s i m i n s i m a x s i m i n s i m a x s i m i n s i 1 m a x s i m i n s i where s i is the value of the driving factor after the normalization s i is the value of the driving factor m i n s i is the minimum for all values of the driving factor and m a x s i is the maximum for all values of the driving factor the normalized values were imported into the spss software for logistic regression analysis to obtain the regression coefficients for each influence factor 4 1 2 the construction of rules for abm for the government agents in order to reduce the degree of interference for the simulation results we only restricted the development of built up land by the macro planning data to a certain degree in the rules of resident agents we used the distance to roads to represent the transportation convenience the distance to markets to indicate the facility convenience the distance to schools to represent the education convenience the distance to hospitals to represent the hospital convenience and the distance to parks to indicate the environmental friendliness fig 5 the shorter distance the better convenience therefore the convenience value is inversely proportional to the distance value at the same time in order to prevent the denominator from appearing 0 and to ensure that the result was still limited to the range of 0 1 we exponentially processed the denominator the processed equation can be expressed as 9 x t r a f f i c μ t r a f f i c e x p d r o a d 10 x f a c i l i t y μ f a c i l i t y e x p d m a r k e t 11 x e d u c a t i o n μ e d u c a t i o n e x p d s c h o o l 12 x h o s p i t a l μ h o s p i t a l e x p d h o s p i t a l 13 x e n v i r o n m e n t μ e n v i r o n m e n t e x p d p a r k where d r o a d represents the distance to roads d m a r k e t represents the distance to markets d s c h o o l represents the distance to schools d h o s p i t a l represents the distance to hospitals d p a r k represents the distance to parks and μ t r a f f i c μ f a c i l i t y μ e d u c a t i o n μ h o s p

to 1 respectively 4 1 3 precision verification the test of the accuracy for the system is very necessary we usually compare the simulation result with the real data to obtain the simulation accuracy the visual comparison method is a simple method for evaluating the simulation result which can visually show the difference in spatial distribution between the simulation result and the real data the comparison between the actual land use maps and the simulation results for 2005 and 2015 in beijing is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the visual comparison that the simulation results generally show the land use distribution well although the simulation effect on some scattered land use is not very well the verification of the simulation results also needs to be calculated from the perspective of quantification this paper adopted the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to verify the accuracy of the system kappa coefficient is widely used in accuracy evaluation and is a standard measurement method congalton 1991 the calculation results showed that the total accuracies of land use for 2005 and 2015 were 86 56 and 90 40 and the kappa coefficients were 0 7659 and 0 8254 respectively meanwhile we introduced the fuzzy kappa coefficient to evaluate the system s simulation effect the fuzzy kappa coefficient takes into account the neighborhood effect of the grid and is more intelligent which can be used in combination with kappa coefficient to obtain better results dou et al 2007 visser and de nijs 2006 the fuzzy kappa coefficients of land use change for 2005 and 2015 were 0 852 and 0 887 respectively we also used areal simulated error to further verify the system s simulation results table 2 listed the area error for the four land use types in beijing the above four accuracy indicators indicate that the system has good simulation effect of course the simulation accuracies of land use change are affected by many aspects such as the quality of interpretation for remote sensing image which will have different degrees impact on simulation results from 1995 to 2015 the population of beijing increased from 12 51 million to 21 71 million and the gdp increased from 150 77 billion yuan to 2368 57 billion yuan beijing municipal statistics bureau 2017 on the one hand the increase of population has driven the rapid economic growth but on the other hand it has promoted the skyrocketing of urban built up land area it can be seen from fig 6 that the rapid expansion of the central urban area in beijing occupied a large amount of arable land and woodland and grassland which is very unfavorable for the sustainable development of beijing 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between landsds and traditional sd ca coupled model the performance of the landsds is compared with the traditional sd ca coupled model in the usual integration models the sd model is only used to control the iterations of the ca model in this paper we used the common coupled method for sd and ca model han et al 2009 he et al 2006 for simulation research as a comparative experimental group it can be seen in table 3 that the system which we built in this paper has better overall accuracies kappa coefficients and fuzzy kappa coefficients than the common sd ca coupled model the reason for the above results may be due to the data bidirectional exchange between sd model and ca model and the intervention of different agents selection behaviors decided by socio economic factors table 3 also shows that landsds can better simulate land use change under long time series which indicates that landsds can be used for future scenario simulation studies of course due to the availability of data different experimental environments and other reasons it is very difficult to completely simulate other researchers experiments for comparison therefore in this paper we used the same data to conduct the comparative experiments based on different model integration principles in the same experimental environment 5 2 the policy recommendations for beijing development due to the excessive concentration of resources such as educational resources and medical resources a large number of migrant workers enter beijing which has brought tremendous ecological and land supply pressure from 1995 to 2005 beijing s built up land increased by more than 1200 km2 while the cropland decreased by more than 1900 km2 table 4 the government should take more effective measures to promote beijing green and harmonious sustainable development 1 control population growth and ease urban expansion pressure in the future development plan beijing should refer to the development pattern of foreign satellite cities beijing need to transfer some resources and gradually evacuate population to reduce the expansion pace and improve ecological stability and 2 enhance linkages between regions and promote regional coordinated development with the rapid economic growth uneven development between cities will lead to very serious problems the coordinated development of beijing tianjin hebei and the construction of xiongan new district are aimed to ease some non capital function and promote regional harmonious development the government should strength beijing economic leading role for tianjin and hebei to gradually promote the overall development of the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration 6 conclusion this paper proposed a land use simulation and decision support system landsds which is actually an artificial intelligence temporal spatial simulation model landsds is a system that integrates macroscopic sd model and microscopic abm and ca model in cell unit landsds also integrates gis at the same time the system can solve data analysis and graphic visualization problems from top to down caused by target data or policy mutations and can also handle the data and graphic visualization problems from bottom to up caused by temporal spatial changes of cell units the system solves the temporal spatial analysis methods and technical problems about the top down and bottom up seamless integration which plague researchers long in this system the sd model controls the changes of various elements on a macro scale and decides the iterations of the entire simulation run at the same time abm is used to simulate the complex selection behaviors of different agents ca model simulates the distribution of micro cell state by changing the state of each cell on a micro scale gis is used for visual display and further in depth spatial analysis of the simulation results in the whole system each sub module communicates and transfers data through the micro individual cell unit and realizes the mutual influence and restriction between sub models beijing was used as a case to verify the effectiveness of the landsds the results showed that the integrated sd abm ca system could simulate the rapidly growing regions well by comparing with the real data the better overall simulation accuracies kappa coefficients and fuzzy kappa coefficients were obtained the system was also compared with the common coupled sd ca model and the compared results showed that landsds was superior to the traditional coupled model through the interaction between sd model and ca model and the introduction of agents complex behaviors the simulation results are more realistic the influencing factors of urban land use change are complex and changeable in this study in order to highlight the feasibility and operability of the integration method many simplifying work was carried out in the construction of the system such as the simplification of the natural economic and policy indicators in the future research these issues should be studied in depth to make the simulation results more realistic and efficient meanwhile based on china s basic national conditions we can see the effects of urban changes in a short period of time however for some developed or underdeveloped countries the temporal spatial changes are slow therefore collection a long series for data to calculate the relevant indicators should be considered to ensure the basic needs of the system for running declaration of competing interest we promise that there is no conflict of interest exiting in the submission of this manuscript and manuscript is approved by all

24917,this article aims to construct a land use simulation and decision support system landsds to comprehensively explore the interference and impact of natural environment individual choice and national macro policies on land use and cover change landsds takes full advantage of system dynamics sd model agent based model abm cellular automata ca model and geographic information system gis 1 on the one hand sd model controls land use area change on macro level on the other hand by passing the parameters values from sd model to ca model the iterations of ca model are controlled macroscopically and at the same time the transition rules in the ca model are affected microscopically by sd model 2 by simulating the complex selection behaviors of different agents abm enforces or participates in the cells transformation behaviors in ca model on the micro evolution scale 3 taking ca model as a breakthrough point the micro cell unit is used to realize the data exchange and communication between sd abm ca by integrating ca with sd and ca with abm and 4 using gis s powerful spatial computing and data processing capabilities the simulation results are further analyzed and processed to obtain more effective information landsds can solve the top down data analysis and graphic visualization problems caused by target data or policy mutations and can also handle the data and graphic visualization problems caused by the temporal and spatial changes of cell units the system solves the analysis methods and technical problems about the top down and bottom up seamless integration of the spatial and temporal models beijing urban expansion was taken as an example to demonstrate the availability of the system keywords land use simulation decision support system dynamics model agent based model cellular automata model 1 introduction due to the rapid population growth especially in developing countries urban expansion has become an increasingly serious problem he et al 2006 in cities the main factors driving land use change are derived from human activities a lot of evidence has shown that human behavior especially excessive cultivation and urbanization has caused many problems such as environmental problems food security and loss of biodiversity which have become more and more serious fang et al 2019 hu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 how to achieve the harmonious development between human activities and urban sustainability has become an important and severe problem therefore it is very necessary to construct a system for simulating land use change to provide constructive opinions and suggestions for the government and explore urban growth and sustainable development issues land use and cover change models are the main tools for studying land use problems and are also the key content for land use research which can help people better understand and explore the land system s dynamic characteristics and laws among the existing research results there are many macro and micro models used to explore land use change for example markov model arsanjani et al 2013 gong et al 2015 system dynamics sd model han et al 2009 and cellular automata ca model singh et al 2018 vaz and arsanjani 2015 these models have advantages in some respects and can solve some specific problems and there are also some coupled models that integrate some of these models clarke and gaydos 1998 liu et al 2015 munshi et al 2014 among these coupled models there mainly exist the following two problems 1 the unidirectionality of the feedback mechanism in the multi dimensional integrated model it is loose coupling between top down and bottom up models in fact it is always the coupled model based on function and application which realizes the one way communication from macro to micro these coupled models are unable to feedback the influence of micro evolution results on the macro change and do not form the real time and bidirectional communication between sub models to achieve real interaction and integration and 2 the lack of research on human environment mechanisms the interaction impact and constraints between human beings and their environment are the important factors that affect land use change in most single or coupled models there is lack of human agents influence which does not effectively consider the interaction between human and land he et al 2005 kazak 2018 yang et al 2012 based on the above problems we aim to construct a unified basic model that simulates land use change from macro to micro multi dimension and multi angle by screening out several dynamic models sd model combines system theory cybernetics and computer simulation and can build a causal feedback loop among various factors to explore the interrelationships and influences thereby gaining macroscopic meaning and guidance since sd model can easily introduce various macro driving factors it makes the scenarios simulation research simple which is very useful for testing policy recommendations sd model has been widely used to solve complicated social and natural problems castellazzi et al 2010 guo et al 2001 liu et al 2013 however the most obvious shortcoming of sd model is that there is no spatial representation ability and micro individual behavior cannot be considered based on this we introduced another dynamic model ca model ca model is a bottom up and microscopic model white et al 1997 ca model determines the next state of cell based on the current cell state the neighborhood the transition rule and so on many studies have shown that the ca model can achieve simulation studies on macro scale by the simple evolution of each cell on micro scale chen et al 2002 white and engelen 1993 its application in land use change and urban development is extensive and in depth which is also a hot spot for ca research clarke and gaydos 1998 lauf et al 2012 wu et al 2010 meanwhile ca model has spatial characters and can be integrated with geographic information system gis well gis can capture process and calculate spatial data well and have strong spatial storing managing and analyzing ability zhang and huang 2014 gis is widely used in the integration research with ca model clarke and gaydos 1998 yeh and li 2001 but the ca model cannot simulate the complex individual behavior nor is it mobile so we need to import abm to make the coupling model more perfect and comprehensive in recent years abm has attracted the attention of more and more scholars abm is often employed to study social phenomena epstein 1999 liu et al 2007 tian et al 2016 the abm model is another bottom up model and is also microscopic the biggest difference with ca model is the mobility of abm in abm the whole system produces pattern changes in the macro dimension according to the interaction between different microscopic individuals lambin et al 2003 abm can directly capture the interactive properties of nature and human systems as well as capture the complex system behaviors brought by these interactivity unlike ca model which focuses on transition rules abm is well suited for representing the evolutionary process between human activities and natural environment abm can map real world concepts and structures into the models white and engelen 2000 based on the previous temporal spatial dynamics method tsdm liu et al 2018 2017 and the geographic system basic model zheng 2012 this study presents a land use simulation and decision support system landsds which contains a sd model an abm a ca model and a gis by integrating the above four model the system can build a basic comprehensive model for land use simulation the model integrate the four sub models advantage and make up the weaknesses which can simulate land use change in multiple scales and multiple perspectives and provide help for the decision making section 2 mainly introduces the principle of landsds the interaction between sub models and how to build the three sub models section 3 is about the data use in the paper section 4 provides the precision verification of the system based on the study area and shows an in depth discussion about the system section 5 presents conclusions 2 methods 2 1 landsds this paper constructed a landsds which deeply integrates sd model abm ca model and gis in the landsds the sd model controls the distribution of each element on the macro amount according to its advantages in time dimension and macro dimension at the same time it is convenient to set various reasonable scenarios simulation by changing the values of some parameters in sd model abm influences the spatial distribution of various elements on the micro scale according to the simulation for the complex dynamic behaviors of different agents ca model uses its advantage in the spatial dimension to determine the micro pattern by defining the transition rules for the cell based on the above the system make full use of the spatial computing power of gis to make further analysis for the simulation results at the same time as shown in fig 1 before the system starts to run the initial conditions required in sd model abm and ca model are first set according to spatial data statistical data policy files and other ancillary data then the appropriate indicator parameters single or multiple are selected as the medium for interactive communication between sd model and ca model after the setting for initial conditions of the system the sd model is first run to obtain the values for the selected indicator parameters and then the results are fed back to the ca model thirdly according to different agents selection behaviors decided by various socio economic factors the influence of abm is introduced into ca model in ca model according to the factors such as the cell state and the influence of the neighborhood the cell state at next moment is calculated combined with the index parameters transmitted from sd model and the influence from abm when the iterations in ca model equals the number which is controlled by sd model the index parameters calculated on the spatial scale in ca model are transmitted to the sd model to fine tune the parameter values in sd equations and the simulation is pushed to the next moment the loop is stopped until the simulation reaches the set time and the simulation results are exported during the simulation process the users can track the changes of any elements and pause the simulation at any time the users also can export the simulation results of the spatial data and the tracked data for in depth analysis and study under gis or other statistical platforms at any time in landsds the data interaction and mutual influence between each sub models are realized with the smallest grid unit as the breakthrough the overall relationship can be expressed as modified from liu et al 2017 1 f t 1 f s d t 1 a b m t c a t where f t 1 represents the land use state at time t 1 s d t 1 is the effect of the sd model on the state transition at time t 1 a b m t denotes the effect of abm on the state transition at time t c a t r e p r e s e n t s t h e e f f e c t o f c a m o d e l o n t h e s t a t e t r a n s i t i o n a t t i m e t f is the transition function and indicates the proportional relationship 2 2 integration between sd and ca as shown in fig 2 the data bidirectional interaction mechanism between sd model and ca model is displayed in the traditional integration model between sd model and ca model the iterations of ca model are generally controlled by the macro parameters in sd model which is only the data flow and impact form sd model to ca model in the interaction mechanism of landsds constructed in this paper the data bidirectional communication and influence between sd model and ca model are realized by selecting appropriate indicators firstly the sd model is run to get the values of the selected indicator then the parameters are passed to ca model and the ca model is started to run in ca model the iterations are controlled and the transition rules are affected on micro scale according to the parameters which are passed from sd model when the evolution is push to the next time the indicators values obtained from ca model are fed back to sd model to adjust the parameters of dynamic equations bidirectional real time communication between the two sub models is achieved through data transfer between sd model and ca model through the bidirectional real time communication mechanism the trend of simulation results is corrected in time which is more in line with the reality that the government proposes some short term goals to achieve long term planning 2 3 integration between abm and ca the ca model which comprehensively considers the factors of natural environment and neighborhood influence can better simulate the land use change process but does not consider the dominant role for controlling land use change and in real life the dominant role such as the government usually play a decisive role in land use change based on this we coupled ca model with abm to introduce human land interactions into land use change simulations in this study taking urban expansion as an example agents are divided into two categories resident agents and government agents the resident agents select the suitable land for living by considering the surrounding environment such as transportation convenience environmental suitability and school convenience government agents determine the land use type for a particular plot through the macro planning at the same time according to the china s condition the choices of government agents are absolutely authoritative in the decision for the land use pattern for example if the government classifies a certain area as an ecological protection area the land parcels in the area will not be allowed to convert into other land use types in the integration of abm and ca model the selection behaviors of resident agents are determined according to the surrounding environment human factors and other factors the behaviors influence the transition rules in ca model to some extent to decide the land use type for a certain plot at the same time combined with the macro plan of the government agents in a period of time it is checked whether the land use type for a certain plot is allowed to determine the land use type finally fig 3 shows the integration mechanism between abm and ca model 2 4 the causal relationship in sd sd model explores the complex and non linear effects between various factors by construction a causal relationship to obtain useful information at macro level theobald and gross 1994 in the process of urban development the land use system is complex and variable and is interfered by many factors such as human therefore sd model is often used to explore complex urban expansion behaviors han et al 2009 shen et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in this study we construct a sd model to explore the impact of human activities on urban growth meanwhile to simplify the calculation we suppose that the land use change is affected only by human activities and ignore the natural choice in sd model there mainly contains three subsystems namely population subsystem economy subsystem and land use subsystem fig 4 the population increase has led to the demand increase for built up land at the same time further investment in the land has also promoted the expansion of urban built up land to a certain extent 2 5 transition rules in ca transition rules is the core of ca model the traditional ca transition rules can be expressed as 2 s t 1 f s t n t where st 1 is the cell state at time t 1 s t is the cell state at time t n t represents the state of the neighbor cell at time t and f refers to the transfer function for cell state from time t to time t 1 in this study the impact of sd model and abm is extended into the ca transition rules therefore the ca transition rules can be calculated as 3 s t 1 f s t n t d t 1 b t where d t 1 indicates the macro factors influence on cell state change at time t 1 and b t is the agent behaviors influence on cell state change at time t the more detailed formulas can be found in liu et al 2017 2 6 agents behaviors rules in abm in this paper the relationship of abm can be expressed as 4 u k f r e s i d e n t f a u t h o r i t y where u k represents the combined effect of the different agents on the land use change f r e s i d e n t indicates the effect of the resident agents on the land use change and f a u t h o r i t y indicates the effect of the government agents on the land use change in this study the role of government mainly reflects in macro planning which determines the land use pattern based on a series of factors given china s conditions the government planning has a high level mandatory role the choices of resident agents are often influenced by the surrounding living environment for example people often choose to live in the places where the public facilities are relatively complete and the environment is friendly after comprehensive consideration of various factors the choices of resident agents in this paper are mainly influenced by the following factors transportation convenience facility convenience education convenience hospital convenience and environmental friendliness the relationship can be expressed as 5 f r e s i d e n t β t r a f f i c x t r a f f i c β f a c i l i t y x f a c i l i t y β e d u c a t i o n x e d u c a t i o n β h o s p i t a l x h o s p i t a l

economic and cultural center and is adjacent to tianjin and hebei province beijing is one of the most densely populated and oldest cities in the world with a history of more than 3000 years li et al 2005 and it will host the winter olympic games in 2022 there are 16 districts under the jurisdiction of beijing which are divided into four functional zones namely capital functional core zone urban function development zone urban development new zone and ecological conservation development zone the total area of beijing is 16410 54 km2 by 2016 the resident population of beijing reached 21 73 million and the gross domestic product gdp reached 2566 91 billion yuan beijing municipal statistics bureau 2017 the huge population makes beijing so crowded the road system in beijing is like a network and there are six rings from the downtown area to the suburbs similar to other big cities in developing countries beijing faces many problems such as environmental pollution and population overload chen et al 2005 in this study we selected the land use data of beijing for 1995 2005 and 2015 to simulate the land use and cover change the land use data came from data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences liu et al 2005 through the visual interpretation of the landsat data the overall accuracy of interpretation is over 94 3 liu et al 2014 the data is mainly divided into six first class categories cropland woodland grassland water body built up land and unused land liu et al 2005 because there are few unused land in beijing and most of them are located in woodland we reclassified the land use types into four types cropland woodland and grassland built up land and water body according to the availability and accessibility of the data eight environmental elements were selected as shown in table 1 which were derived from the institute of remote sensing and digital earth chinese academy of sciences all of the spatial data was obtained based on the project supported by the ministry of land and resources of china 4 results 4 1 simulation results 4 1 1 the construction of transition rules for ca model in ca model the transition rules are the core content the current mining methods for the transition rules are various and the more commonly used are data mining li and gar on yeh 2004 ant colony optimization liu et al 2008 2007 yang et al 2012 logistic regression liu et al 2015 munshi et al 2014 and so on in this paper logistic regression method was used to obtain the influence probability of surrounding environment on the land use type change the formula can be expressed as 6 φ 1 1 e x p y 7 y β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n α where φ represents the influence probability of the surrounding environment on the land use type change β 1 β 2 and β n are the regression coefficients x 1 x 2 and x n represent the values of the driving factors e g the values of the distance to schools and α is the regression constant according to the availability and acquirable of the data the socio economic factors selected in this paper include distance to schools distance to markets distance to hospitals distance to restaurants distance to banks distance to hotels and distance to roads fig 5 in arcgis software the values of these environmental elements were obtained through 4952 valid random points prior to the logistic regression the values of these variables were normalized to exclude the effects of different scales the normalization formula can be expressed as tian et al 2011 8 s i s i m i n s i m a x s i m i n s i m a x s i m i n s i 1 m a x s i m i n s i where s i is the value of the driving factor after the normalization s i is the value of the driving factor m i n s i is the minimum for all values of the driving factor and m a x s i is the maximum for all values of the driving factor the normalized values were imported into the spss software for logistic regression analysis to obtain the regression coefficients for each influence factor 4 1 2 the construction of rules for abm for the government agents in order to reduce the degree of interference for the simulation results we only restricted the development of built up land by the macro planning data to a certain degree in the rules of resident agents we used the distance to roads to represent the transportation convenience the distance to markets to indicate the facility convenience the distance to schools to represent the education convenience the distance to hospitals to represent the hospital convenience and the distance to parks to indicate the environmental friendliness fig 5 the shorter distance the better convenience therefore the convenience value is inversely proportional to the distance value at the same time in order to prevent the denominator from appearing 0 and to ensure that the result was still limited to the range of 0 1 we exponentially processed the denominator the processed equation can be expressed as 9 x t r a f f

to 1 respectively 4 1 3 precision verification the test of the accuracy for the system is very necessary we usually compare the simulation result with the real data to obtain the simulation accuracy the visual comparison method is a simple method for evaluating the simulation result which can visually show the difference in spatial distribution between the simulation result and the real data the comparison between the actual land use maps and the simulation results for 2005 and 2015 in beijing is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the visual comparison that the simulation results generally show the land use distribution well although the simulation effect on some scattered land use is not very well the verification of the simulation results also needs to be calculated from the perspective of quantification this paper adopted the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to verify the accuracy of the system kappa coefficient is widely used in accuracy evaluation and is a standard measurement method congalton 1991 the calculation results showed that the total accuracies of land use for 2005 and 2015 were 86 56 and 90 40 and the kappa coefficients were 0 7659 and 0 8254 respectively meanwhile we introduced the fuzzy kappa coefficient to evaluate the system s simulation effect the fuzzy kappa coefficient takes into account the neighborhood effect of the grid and is more intelligent which can be used in combination with kappa coefficient to obtain better results dou et al 2007 visser and de nijs 2006 the fuzzy kappa coefficients of land use change for 2005 and 2015 were 0 852 and 0 887 respectively we also used areal simulated error to further verify the system s simulation results table 2 listed the area error for the four land use types in beijing the above four accuracy indicators indicate that the system has good simulation effect of course the simulation accuracies of land use change are affected by many aspects such as the quality of interpretation for remote sensing image which will have different degrees impact on simulation results from 1995 to 2015 the population of beijing increased from 12 51 million to 21 71 million and the gdp increased from 150 77 billion yuan to 2368 57 billion yuan beijing municipal statistics bureau 2017 on the one hand the increase of population has driven the rapid economic growth but on the other hand it has promoted the skyrocketing of urban built up land area it can be seen from fig 6 that the rapid expansion of the central urban area in beijing occupied a large amount of arable land and woodland and grassland which is very unfavorable for the sustainable development of beijing 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between landsds and traditional sd ca coupled model the performance of the landsds is compared with the traditional sd ca coupled model in the usual integration models the sd model is only used to control the iterations of the ca model in this paper we used the common coupled method for sd and ca model han et al 2009 he et al 2006 for simulation research as a comparative experimental group it can be seen in table 3 that the system which we built in this paper has better overall accuracies kappa coefficients and fuzzy kappa coefficients than the common sd ca coupled model the reason for the above results may be due to the data bidirectional exchange between sd model and ca model and the intervention of different agents selection behaviors decided by socio economic factors table 3 also shows that landsds can better simulate land use change under long time series which indicates that landsds can be used for future scenario simulation studies of course due to the availability of data different experimental environments and other reasons it is very difficult to completely simulate other researchers experiments for comparison therefore in this paper we used the same data to conduct the comparative experiments based on different model integration principles in the same experimental environment 5 2 the policy recommendations for beijing development due to the excessive concentration of resources such as educational resources and medical resources a large number of migrant workers enter beijing which has brought tremendous ecological and land supply pressure from 1995 to 2005 beijing s built up land increased by more than 1200 km2 while the cropland decreased by more than 1900 km2 table 4 the government should take more effective measures to promote beijing green and harmonious sustainable development 1 control population growth and ease urban expansion pressure in the future development plan beijing should refer to the development pattern of foreign satellite cities beijing need to transfer some resources and gradually evacuate population to reduce the expansion pace and improve ecological stability and 2 enhance linkages between regions and promote regional coordinated development with the rapid economic growth uneven development between cities will lead to very serious problems the coordinated development of beijing tianjin hebei and the construction of xiongan new district are aimed to ease some non capital function and promote regional harmonious development the government should strength beijing economic leading role for tianjin and hebei to gradually promote the overall development of the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration 6 conclusion this paper proposed a land use simulation and decision support system landsds which is actually an artificial intelligence temporal spatial simulation model landsds is a system that integrates macroscopic sd model and microscopic abm and ca model in cell unit landsds also integrates gis at the same time the system can solve data analysis and graphic visualization problems from top to down caused by target data or policy mutations and can also handle the data and graphic visualization problems from bottom to up caused by temporal spatial changes of cell units the system solves the temporal spatial analysis methods and technical problems about the top down and bottom up seamless integration which plague researchers long in this system the sd model controls the changes of various elements on a macro scale and decides the iterations of the entire simulation run at the same time abm is used to simulate the complex selection behaviors of different agents ca model simulates the distribution of micro cell state by changing the state of each cell on a micro scale gis is used for visual display and further in depth spatial analysis of the simulation results in the whole system each sub module communicates and transfers data through the micro individual cell unit and realizes the mutual influence and restriction between sub models beijing was used as a case to verify the effectiveness of the landsds the results showed that the integrated sd abm ca system could simulate the rapidly growing regions well by comparing with the real data the better overall simulation accuracies kappa coefficients and fuzzy kappa coefficients were obtained the system was also compared with the common coupled sd ca model and the compared results showed that landsds was superior to the traditional coupled model through the interaction between sd model and ca model and the introduction of agents complex behaviors the simulation results are more realistic the influencing factors of urban land use change are complex and changeable in this study in order to highlight the feasibility and operability of the integration method many simplifying work was carried out in the construction of the system such as the simplification of the natural economic and policy indicators in the future research these issues should be studied in depth to make the simulation results more realistic and efficient meanwhile based on china s basic national conditions we can see the effects of urban changes in a short period of time however for some developed or underdeveloped countries the temporal spatial changes are slow therefore collection a long series for data to calculate the relevant indicators should be considered to ensure the

24918,a new individual based plankton model is used to test the hypothesis that the timescale of photoacclimation of phytoplankton within the surface mixing layer of the ocean is slow relative to mixing in which case the chlorophyll to carbon chl c ratio of individual cells shows little adjustment in response to changes in light environment driven by vertical displacement rates of photoacclimation are shown to be a strongly non linear function of light intensity that depends on the balance of intrinsic chlorophyll synthesis at low irradiance versus increasing growth rate at high irradiance predicted photoacclimation was negligible for cells experiencing rates of turbulent mixing typical of the open ocean surface boundary layer 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 in which case chl c is set by mean light intensity the model was extended to incorporate a simple ecosystem of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus and using two layer slab physics used to study photoacclimation in a more realistic setting the seasonal cycle of plankton dynamics at ocean weather station india in the north atlantic 59 n 20 w results were remarkably similar when compared with an equivalent ecosystem model that used an eulerian representation of phytoplankton reinforcing our conclusion that mixing rates within the surface mixed layer of the ocean are typically too fast to permit photoacclimation by phytoplankton to ambient light keywords lagrangian model individual based model photoacclimation carbon to chlorophyll primary production marine ecosystem 1 introduction primary production by phytoplankton drives the ocean food web leading to export and sequestration of carbon in deep waters lutz et al 2007 much of this production occurs in the surface mixing layer the thickness of which can vary seasonally from only a few metres during summer stratified conditions to greater than 500 m over winter in some parts of the ocean however production can only occur within the euphotic zone which typically extends to an average of 50 m in the north atlantic ducklow 1999 turbulence with velocities typically 5 10 mm s 1 gives rise to rapid time scales of minutes to hours vertical movement of water in the surface mixing layer e g as shown by the trajectories of neutrally buoyant floats harcourt et al 2002 2010 d asaro et al 2014 it also means that phytoplankton cells experience vertical displacements and thereby a fluctuating light environment given the exponential attenuation of irradiance with depth gardner et al 1999 with potentially important consequences for primary production phytoplankton acclimate in response to changing light intensity leading to variation in chlorophyll to carbon chl c ratios chlorophyll synthesis is maximised under low irradiance in order to improve light harvesting and photosynthetic efficiency whereas there is no such need to produce high levels of light harvesting pigment when exposed to saturating levels of irradiance van de poll et al 2006 the extent to which cells become fully acclimated depends on the relative timescales of mixing and chlorophyll synthesis and it may be the case that phytoplankton do not undergo significant photoacclimation in the surface layer of the ocean given the high mixing rates previous studies both observational lewis et al 1984 anning et al 2000 and modelling falkowski and wirick 1981 franks and marra 1994 mcgillicuddy 1995 have differed in their conclusions on this matter which has important consequences for the calculation of depth integrated photosynthesis within the mixed layer of the ocean individual based lagrangian modelling approaches should be most appropriate for calculating primary production if photoacclimation is prevalent in which the phytoplankton assemblage is represented as the sum of individual cells each with its own unique position in the water column and associated life history including the photophysiological response ross et al 2011a standard eulerian models should otherwise suffice in which phytoplankton are treated as a single state variable with uniform chl c here we present a new lagrangian model and use it to calculate primary production in the surface mixing layer of the ocean focusing on the associated sensitivity to photoacclimation as seen in the predicted life histories of individual cells in a turbulent environment two model setups are examined the first incorporates an individual based representation of phytoplankton into an ecosystem model embedded within a 2 vertical layer slab physics in which the depth of the upper surface mixed layer as well as surface irradiance vary seasonally it is applied to a realistic ocean setting namely the seasonal cycle at ocean weather station india owsi in the northern north atlantic 59 n 20 w using turbulence forcing based on observed winds the second model version provides a theoretical analysis of the interaction between photoacclimation and rate of mixing by representing phytoplankton as the sole biological entity embedded within a mixing layer of fixed depth and exposed to constant irradiance using these two analyses our aim is to test the following hypothesis the timescale of photoacclimation of phytoplankton within the surface mixing layer of the ocean is slow relative to mixing such that individual cells undergo little adjustment of their chl c ratio in response to changes in light environment driven by vertical displacement if true this would mean that most if not all cells within the mixing layer would exhibit approximately uniform chl c ratios 2 model description we first introduce the eulerian model detailing all of the equations and the processes they represent the two lagrangian model setups i e the full ecosystem model and the simplified fixed slab model are then described in turn lists of model variables and parameters are provided in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 1 the eulerian model the eulerian model assumes that turbulence occurs within a single surface layer and that mixing is sufficient to ensure all components are fully mixed at all times concentrations of nutrients phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus npzd are therefore necessarily homogeneous throughout this surface mixing layer primary production is calculated numerically using an average value for chl c throughout the surface mixing layer but allowing changing light intensity with depth at 1 m resolution phytoplankton biomass is represented by two state variables that permit flexible stoichiometry in terms of nitrogen n and chlorophyll chl content p mmol n and chl g chl carbon biomass is calculated assuming a fixed redfield ratio parameter ζ of 12 6 mmol n g c 1 equivalent to 6 625 mol c mol n 1 photosynthesis v g c g chl 1 h 1 is described by a smith function 1 v z 0 h α i z v m a x v m a x 2 α 2 i z 2 0 5 where vmax is the maximum chlorophyll specific rate of photosynthesis g c g chl 1 h 1 α is the initial slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve g c g chl 1 h 1 w m 2 1 and i z is irradiance at depth z w m 2 a constant irradiance i0 is imposed at the ocean surface which is then attenuated with depth according to beer s law 2 i z i 0 e x p k p a r z the vertical attenuation coefficient kpar depends on chlorophyll concentration in a piecewise calculation in the water column 0 5 m 6 23 m and 23 m anderson 1993 anderson et al 2015 attenuation is calculated in 1 metre intervals based on the summed chlorophyll content in each interval the specific growth rate μp d 1 is then 3 μ p 24 θ v where θ is chlorophyll to carbon ratio g chl g c 1 equal to ζchl p ρchl g chl mmol n 1 is the scaling factor which specifies instantaneous chlorophyll synthesis relative to n and is an inverse function of irradiance such that phytoplankton acclimate at low light intensities by producing extra chlorophyll 4 ρ c h l z 0 h θ m a x ζ μ p 24 α i z θ where θ m a x is the maximum achievable chlorophyll to carbon ratio this equation is based on the dynamic photoacclimation model of geider et al 1997 which predicts the dependencies of chl c and growth rate on irradiance temperature and nutrient availability the equation for the rate of change of n biomass is 5 d p d t μ p p g m p 2 p m p 3 p k p p k m i x h p h t growth the first term depends on photosynthesis and nutrients the maximum rate of photosynthesis vmax is temperature dependent according to eppley 1972 6 μ p 24 θ v t n k n n 7 v m a x t v m a x 0 1 066 t where v max 0 is vmax at 0 c and kn is the half saturation constant for nutrient uptake there are three biological loss terms in eq 5 namely grazing and linear and non linear non grazing losses anderson et al 2015 the linear term represents a respiration rate of 0 02 d 1 parameter mp2 the non linear term represents density dependent processes such as viral lysis and takes a michaelis menten form governed by parameters mp3 maximum rate mmol n 1 d 1 and kp the half saturation constant mmol n m 3 this loss term is calculated as a function of the average phytoplankton concentration in the mixing layer p mmol n m 3 a holling type iii equation is used for grazing 8 g i m a x p 2 z k g 2 p 2 where imax is the maximum grazing rate d 1 and kg is the half saturation constant for grazing mmol n m 3 phytoplankton are lost from the surface layer to the layer below via a constant mixing rate kmix d 1 as well as detrainment as the mixing layer shoals term h in eq 5 the corresponding equation for the chlorophyll content of phytoplankton is 9 d c h l d t ρ c h l μ p p θ ζ g m p 2 p m p 3 p k

mortality rate mmol n 1 d 1 zooplankton are subject to mixing as well as detrainment and dilution due to changes in the depth of the mixing layer term h the equation for detritus is 11 d d d t m p 2 p

rate md d 1 as well as losses due to mixing and changes to the depth of the mixing layer detritus is also subject to a sinking rate of 10 m d 1 parameter vd finally the equation for dissolved inorganic nitrogen is 12 d n d t μ p p β 1 k z g m p 2 p h t m d d k m i x h n 0 n h t a corresponding lagrangian model was formulated based on the same equations designed to investigate two scenarios firstly a fixed slab phytoplankton only scenario for a detailed analysis of photoacclimation in the model in response to mixing rate and light intensity and secondly development of a full ecosystem model to provide a direct comparison between the eulerian and lagrangian formulations 2 2 fixed slab model phytoplankton are the only biological entity in this version of the model and are represented as super individuals scheffer et al 1995 within a vertical slab of water with a fixed depth h m the slab is subject to a constant mixing rate and constant irradiance at the surface it is computationally impossible to represent each individual phytoplankton cell in a real ocean water column hence the use of super individuals each of which represents a group of cells each super individual has its own unique vertical location in the water column which changes over time according to turbulent mixing and particle movement rules 13 v i α i i v m a x v m a x 2 α 2 i i 2 0 5 now ii becomes the irradiance experienced by a super individual at a given point in time w m 2 the specific growth rate of a super individual μp i d 1 is then 14 μ p i 24 θ i v i 15 ρ c h l i θ m a x ζ μ p i 24 α i i θ i the equations for rate of change of n and chl biomass in super individuals are now 16 d p i d t μ p i p i m p p i 2 17 d c h l i d t ρ c h l i μ p i p i θ i ζ m p p i 2 mortality is calculated as a simple quadratic function with parameter mp 0 3 mmol n 1 d 1 this simple mortality function does not explicitly represent processes such as grazing but acts as a control on phytoplankton population as our main focus is rates of phytoplankton growth and acclimation rather than the full ecosystem super individuals are transported passively in the water column by turbulent motion a simple random walk model is used based on the specification of turbulence via a diffusivity coefficient kv falkowski and wirick 1981 visser 1997 ross and sharples 2004 turbulent mixing is calculated using the non local k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 the eddy diffusivity kv is calculated from 18 k v w h s where s is the vertical shape function and the vertical velocity scale of turbulence w m s 1 is calculated from 19 w κ u where κ von kármán s constant 0 4 and u is the wind friction velocity approximated by u 0 001u large 1994 where u is surface wind speed m s 1 here we use a single value for s therefore assuming a constant turbulence throughout the mixing layer this simplification enables a more straightforward analysis of the model results the equation for the random walk is visser 1997 20 z n 1 z n r r 2 k v d t 0 5 here zn is current depth zn 1 is depth at the next time step and r represents a random process with mean of 0 and variance r we use a uniform distribution for r between 1 and 1 such that r 1 3 note that this equation is only strictly valid if kv is assumed to remain constant throughout the displacement from zn to zn 1 the distance moved each time step is therefore a function of surface wind speed and depth of the mixing layer the model has reflecting boundary conditions such that super individuals bounce off the surface and base of the water column the constant fixed depth in the fixed slab model means that unlike the mixing layer model with ecosystem below there is no detrainment or dilution of super individuals the model was run to steady state using a time step of 1 min it was initialised with 20 000 super individuals each with pi 0 015 mmol n chli 0 012 mg chl and chl c ratio of 0 01 g chl g c 1 model results were shown to be insensitive to the initial chl c ratio and so a mid range value was chosen 2 3 mixing layer model with ecosystem this version of the model has two layer slab physics anderson et al 2015 in which a seasonally varying upper mixing layer that incorporates an ecosystem made up of nitrate phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd is positioned above a deep layer that contains only nitrate in a fixed vertical profile fig 1 state variables are exchanged between the two layers via mixing across the base of the mixing layer entrainment and detrainment as the mixed layer deepens or shallows and by sinking of detritus z n and d are defined as standard eulerian state variables representing average concentrations in the surface layer i e with a single differential equation for each phytoplankton on the other hand are represented in lagrangian mode with state variables pi and chl i the average phytoplankton nitrogen biomass per metre pconc calculated by summing across all pi and divided by the depth of the surface layer is then used as the input for zooplankton detritus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen the equations for pi are 21 d p i d t μ p i p i g i m p 2 p i m p 3 p c o

surface layer to the layer below via a constant mixing rate kmix d 1 as well as detrainment as the mixing layer shoals the same reflecting boundaries were used as in the fixed slab model such that super individuals bounce off the surface and base of the water column the corresponding equation for the chlorophyll content of super individuals is 25 d c h l i d t ρ c h l i μ p i p i θ i ζ g i m p 2 p i m p 3 p c o n c p i k p p c o n c k m i x h p i h t in order to compensate for mortality and maintain a representative number of super individuals in the water column super individuals divide split in two when they reach a threshold size pdiv mmol n this use of splitting is solely a means of controlling the number of particles within the simulation and is not related to the biological process of cell division the equation for zooplankton is anderson et al 2015 26 d z d t i 1 n β k z g i h t m z z 2 k m i x h z h t the equation for detritus is 27 d d d t i 1 n m p 2 p i 1 β g i m p

n h t the slab physics and forcing were set up for a climatological scenario for ocean weather station india owsi in the northern north atlantic 59 n 20 w this is an ideal site for testing the model due to the strong seasonality in the depth of the surface mixing layer and characteristic spring bloom the annual cycle of mixing layer depth was taken from world ocean atlas antonov et al 2010 irradiance at the ocean surface was calculated using standard trigonometric equations brock 1981 anderson et al 2015 in conjunction with attenuation by clouds according to reed 1977 photosynthetically active radiation par as a fraction of the total was 0 43 anderson et al 2015 and as for the fixed slab model attenuation in the water column is a piece wise approximation anderson 1993 anderson et al 2015 irradiance varies throughout the day according to a sinusoidal function daily wind speeds were used to calculate turbulent mixing eq 19 based on a sinusoidal function fitted using non linear least squares to an annual cycle obtained by averaging data from 1997 to 2001 taken from the ecmwf era 40 atlas uppala et al 2005 finally nutrient was assumed to be present in the lower model layer as a linear gradient anderson et al 2015 29 n z a n h b n where n z is nutrient at depth z the regression coefficients an 0 0074 bn 10 85 were fitted for owsi from world ocean atlas data levitus et al 2010 model parameters were mostly taken from previous modelling studies including those focusing on the north atlantic fasham et al 1990 yool et al 2013 anderson et al 2015 the magnitude of acclimation to light in the model phytoplankton is controlled by the ratio θ m a x θ i and thus θ m a x the maximum achievable chl c ratio is an important parameter although assigning a value is not straightforward maximum ratios of chl c can range over an order of magnitude from 0 007 to over 0 07 g chl g c 1 geider et al 1997 previous models of photoacclimation have focused only on single species flynn et al 2001 for example used data for the marine diatom skeletonema costatum when comparing different models of photoacclimation in phytoplankton and estimated values of between 0 054 and 0 079 g chl g c 1 oceanic phytoplankton comprise a multitude of species and we therefore tuned this parameter for owsi resulting in a value of 0 02 g chl g c 1 this value is consistent with satellite derived values of chl c ratio in the open ocean behrenfeld et al 2005 that are considerably lower than those seen in laboratory studies the threshold for particle division pdiv was chosen so as to ensure that the number of super individuals in each simulation was greater than 2000 3 results 3 1 ocean weather station india the model was first run for owsi to examine photoacclimation in a realistic setting comparing results for lagrangian and eulerian representations of phytoplankton this analysis involved tuning the value of parameter θ m a x providing a value of 0 02 g chl g c 1 that is representative of open ocean phytoplankton and which is subsequently used in the theoretical analysis of the interplay between acclimation and the timescales of mixing section 3 2 the model was compared with chlorophyll data which are 8 day averages for a characteristic year 2006 anderson et al 2015 and with climatological nitrate data from world ocean atlas antonov et al 2010 the predicted seasonal cycles for these two variables using the lagrangian representation of phytoplankton and θ m a x 0 02 g chl g c 1 is shown in fig 2 simulation length was 3 years with the third year shown by which time a repeating annual cycle occurs the general agreement is good similar to other slab modelling studies of this site fasham 1995 anderson et al 2015 the timing of the spring chlorophyll bloom is about a month late as compared to the data which may be a consequence of the climatological mixing layer forcing whereas the data are for a particular year the underestimation of overwintering stock of phytoplankton at high latitudes is a common feature of slab models fasham 1995 anderson et al 2015 which may be due to the assumption of complete mixing within what is a deep mixing layer the predicted timing and magnitude of the seasonal nitrate drawdown are good which is encouraging given that the nitrate data themselves represent an average climatology the eulerian version of the model generates results that are nearly identical to those when phytoplankton are modelled in a lagrangian manner fig 3 predicted chl c varied between about 0 012 and 0 17 g chl g c 1 in both model versions higher in the winter months because of low irradiance but not showing any signs of a diel cycle the fact that the lagrangian and eulerian versions of the model generated predictions that match closely for phytoplankton nutrients and chl c ratio suggests that the timescales of mixing are too fast for photoacclimation to occur a phenomenon that is examined in more detail in the next section 3 2 fixed slab model the interaction between rates of mixing and photoacclimation was next investigated using the fixed slab model with phytoplankton as the sole state variable no explicit ecosystem or limitation by nutrients with parameters as for owsi notably θ m a x 0 02 g chl g c 1 six simulations were carried out each with 20 000 super individuals in a fixed slab of 100 m and with constant forcing in terms of irradiance at the ocean surface 200 w m 2 wind speed was varied for the different model runs between 0 and 100 m s 1 generating turbulent mixing kv of between 0 and 0 4 m2 s 1 the timescales tm associated with the turbulent mixing in the surface layer can be approximated using the layer depth h and the turbulent diffusivity kv taylor and ferrari 2011 and are given in the legend for fig 4 30 t m h 2 k v the simulations were run to steady state and snapshots taken that show chl c versus incident irradiance for 10 000 randomly chosen super individuals fig 4 a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate how the predicted spread of chl c values was affected by changes to θ m a x and vmax default values 10 the results not shown indicate that while changes to these parameters affect the fully acclimated chl c ratio for super individuals at each irradiance the spread of ratios shown over the whole population showed low sensitivity to changes in the parameterisation of θ m a x or vmax fully acclimated chl c θ a occurs when there is zero mixing such that super individuals have fixed depths distributed evenly throughout the 100 m slab fig 4a the red lines in fig 4 show θ a 31 θ a v p θ m a x v p 2 α 2 i 2 0 5 acclimated chl c thus decreases with increasing irradiance as expected photoacclimation was however incomplete when even a low rate of mixing is introduced 4 10 5 m2 s 1 fig 4b higher chl c ratios were seen in super individuals experiencing low irradiance but there is a large spread about the red line this spread of points in the plots diminishes as the rate of mixing is increased although not towards the fully acclimated state but rather towards uniformity whereby at the highest mixing rate of 4 10 1 m2 s 1 all the super individuals ended up with much the same chl c ratio close to 0 011 g chl g c 1 fig 4f super individuals were unable to photoacclimate to incident irradiance in the fluctuating light environment at high mixing rather they acclimated to the average irradiance in the euphotic zone surface to depth of 1 irradiance red spots in fig 4 although irradiance determines fully acclimated chl c as described above the rate of chlorophyll synthesis photoacclimation depends also on growth rate μp which is an increasing function of irradiance 32 μ c h l s p d c h l c h l d t ρ c h l μ p θ 24 θ m a x α i v m a x 2 ξ v m a x 2 α 2 i 2 where μ c h l s p is the specific rate of chlorophyll synthesis d 1 this relationship is shown in fig 5 with data points from fig 4a superimposed there is thus an optimum irradiance in this case 32 w m 2 at which the rate of chlorophyll synthesis i e photoacclimation is maximised with μ c h l s p declining on either side of the optimum photoacclimation is greatest when super individuals experience sustained exposure to irradiances that maximise μ c h l s p the key factor is the timescales involved i e to quantify what is meant by sustained in this regard working from the simulations shown in fig 4 we identified for each mixing rate the super individual that experienced the closest average irradiance to 32 w m 2 during the last 5 days and show its trajectory in terms of chl c depth and irradiance during this period fig 6 a zero mixing leads to fully acclimated chl c is 0 014 eq 19 the super individual occupying a depth of 6 6 m when mixing is low 4 10 4 m2 s 1 the super individuals in question maintain a depth of between 3 and 10 m throughout the 5 day period with an average depth of 7 0 m an increase of mixing to 4 10 3 m2 s 1 however means that irradiance is no longer sustained over several days and photoacclimation is minimal higher mixing rates lead to rapidly fluctuating vertical position and irradiance resulting in little or no photoacclimation similar results are seen when a lower average irradiance 10 w m 2 is selected fig 6b photoacclimation is seen for mixing rates 4 10 4 m2 s 1 with super individuals maintaining a depth of between 4 and 15 m and chl c tending towards 0 019 the acclimated value for 10 w m 2 in contrast chl c tended towards 0 011 at higher mixing rates corresponding to the average irradiance in the water column 50 9 w m 2 4 discussion rates of photoacclimation are a strongly non linear function of light intensity peaking at an optimum irradiance that maximises the balance between increasing chl c at low irradiance with increasing growth rate and associated synthesis of chlorophyll at high irradiance fig 5 a new lagrangian model was used to test the hypothesis that rates of photoacclimation in the surface mixed layer of the ocean due to changing irradiance as a consequence of vertical displacement are slow relative to mixing in which case little variation occurs in chl c between phytoplankton cells in the water column the hypothesis was supported by our model analyses the theoretical results of the fixed slab model indicate that significant photoacclimation only occurs when mixing rates are 4 10 4 m2 s 1 which corresponds to an approximate mixing timescale of nearly 30 days phytoplankton chl c ranged from 0 003 to 0 02 g chl g c 1 these slow mixing rates allowed phytoplankton cells to remain at the depth of optimum irradiance for a period of several days or more mixing rates in the ocean surface boundary layer are difficult to measure directly but observations e g d asaro 2014 show root mean square vertical velocities with typical values 0 005 0 035 m s 1 closely following the friction velocity u thereby supporting eq 19 together with vertical displacements of the order of the boundary layer thickness d asaro 2001 supporting eq 18 these studies imply diffusivities ranging from 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 in the surface boundary layer and that phytoplankton experience rapid vertical displacements on time scales of hours these magnitudes and timescales of displacement are evident immediately in the trajectories of lagrangian floats as shown in d asaro 2001 when mixing rates of this order were used in our model 4 10 2 m2 s 1 corresponding to an approximate mixing timescale of 7 h results showed that phytoplankton photoacclimate to average light intensity in the euphotic zone with chl c ratio showing a relatively narrow range between 0 008 and 0 017 g chl g c 1 moving beyond the theoretical analysis we also examined the performance of the lagrangian phytoplankton model as part of an npzd ecosystem model embedded within 2 layer slab physics run for station india in the northern north atlantic the rate of turbulent mixing in the surface mixing layer was determined from observed wind speeds varying between 0 01 and 0 29 m2 s 1 phytoplankton growth was driven by nutrients and seasonally varying irradiance at the ocean surface results were compared with an equivalent eulerian model in which phytoplankton were treated as a single homogeneous state variable with a single chl c ratio calculated from depth averaged light intensity predicted seasonal cycles of n p z and d were remarkably similar for the two model versions showing the characteristic bloom of phytoplankton and associated nitrate drawdown fig 2 chl c also exhibited strong seasonality with highest values in winter when incident irradiance is low and the mixed layer is deep predicted chl c was remarkably similar between the lagrangian and eulerian model versions being lower in the former but only marginally so chl c varied 0 0103 0 0165 and 0 0109 0 0166 g chl g c 1 in the lagrangian and eulerian versions of the model respectively fig 3 these marginal differences are not a result of individual photoacclimative properties but rather result from differences in the growth rates the mixing rates in the lagrangian model are not always fast enough to completely overcome the growth rates in the upper part of the mixing layer resulting in a slight gradient in the phytoplankton concentration enforcing the vertical phytoplankton profile predicted by the lagrangian model onto the eulerian model results in a perfect match between their respective predictions not shown however the aim of the study was not to just test when eulerian and lagrangian models diverge for all scenarios which would have required the addition of a diffusive term to the eulerian model but to test when they diverge in the special case of a well mixed surface layer in this case we find that divergence occurs at mixing rates characteristically much lower than those of the surface mixing the fact that the two model versions produce the same results at the high mixing rates that are characteristic of the surface mixing layer of the ocean 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 is sufficient for us to conclude that mixing in the natural environment is high enough to prevent variation in chl c from photoacclimation in response to ambient light these results re emphasise those of the theoretical analysis indicating that photoacclimation to ambient irradiance is of little consequence in the surface mixed layer of the ocean because rates of mixing are too fast furthermore they indicate that at least in terms of areas of the ocean where primary production occurs primarily in the surface mixed layer there may be limited benefit in using a lagrangian representation of phytoplankton in models rather than a standard eulerian approach of course photoacclimation does occur on longer timescales as mean light intensity changes e g seasonally or due to changing mixed layer depth our results are in agreement with field studies that have examined timescales of photoacclimation lewis et al 1984 took samples from the surface and near bottom in the bedford basin a coastal inlet of canada s atlantic coast and found no evidence of photoacclimation when mixing occurred on time scales less than 10 h anning et al 2000 subjected cultures of the marine diatom skeletoneme costatum to irradiance shifts over 15 days results showed that it took 3 5 days for the diatoms to fully acclimate to changes in irradiance with the chlorophyll content of the cells changing 2 5 fold our results likewise show that acclimation takes several days in order that significant changes in chl c occur and that such changes are negligible on timescales of less than a day fig 6 previous modelling studies have been equivocal about the interaction between rates of mixing and photoacclimation and the resulting consequences for primary production falkowski and wirick 1981 found that mean and variance of chl c ratios in phytoplankton along with photosynthetic rates showed little sensitivity to mixing rates ranging from 0 to 0 001 m2 s 1 when using a random walk lagrangian model within an idealised 20 m mixed layer on the other hand franks and marra 1994 using a similar idealised model with a 15 m mixed layer found that depth integrated photosynthesis increased with increasing mixing their model included photo inhibition which may have negatively impacted on cells near the surface especially at low mixing rates mcgillicuddy 1995 compared the performance of two photoacclimation models wolf and woods 1988 and lande and lewis 1989 at two mixing rates 0 01 m2 s 1 and 4 64 m2 s 1 and found little or no difference in predicted phytoplankton growth rate for the two model implementations under weak mixing whereas a significant reduction in mean growth rate occurred in the wolf and woods 1988 model under strong mixing the advantage and novelty of our approach is two fold first we used the fixed slab model to examine a wide range of mixing rates both representing those in the ocean mixed layer and slower rates using a contemporary model of photoacclimation geider et al 1997 and a maximum chl c parameter θ m a x appropriate for ocean phytoplankton obtained by tuning second we modelled a full seasonal cycle for a realistic ocean setting ocean weather station india using a complete npzd ecosystem model and seasonal forcing for wind and irradiance and compared the performance of lagrangian and eulerian formulations for this scenario an interesting application of lagrangian models has been to study whether measurements of primary production from bottles suspended in the water column in which algae experience more or less constant irradiance to which they acclimate are compromised given that cells in the surrounding water experience vertical mixing and thereby fluctuating irradiance barkmann and woods 1996 constructed and parameterised a 1d model for this purpose and found that the primary production calculated of freely moving phytoplankton at a given depth in the water column was 40 lower compared to cells that were confined to the same depth without being able to move similar results were found by ross et al 2011a b when undertaking a lagrangian modelling experiment in which calculated growth rates were compared for phytoplankton cells subject to mixing versus cells that were frozen for 24 h for two ocean settings shallow coastal regions surface mixed layer 6 m and the open ocean surface mixed layer 60 m our results suggest that photoacclimation leading to significant changes in chl c takes place over several days incubation experiments to measure primary production are usually carried out over 24 h mingelbier et al 1994 in which case errors related to photoacclimation may not be large our findings do not however mean that there is no place for lagrangian approaches to modelling phytoplankton and their role in marine ecosystems previous studies have shown that models formulating growth as a nonlinear function of an internal nutrient quota eg droop kinetics give differing predictions when represented in a lagrangian as opposed to eulerian formulation hellweger and kianirad 2007 baudry et al 2018 additionally much of the primary production in the ocean does not occur in the surface mixed layer but rather in stratified waters such as the deep chlorophyll maximum and elevated chlorophyll content may be expected as a consequence of the low irradiances at depth cullen 1982 individual differences in functional traits may be important when it comes to understanding phenomena such as the deep chlorophyll maximum and ephemeral features such as blooms caused by eddies in which case the spatial patterns and dynamics may not be fully captured using traditional eulerian techniques deangelis and yurek 2017 moreover lagrangian models can be integrated with geographical information systems gis data such as satellite observations of sea surface temperature in order to better understand the forces driving phytoplankton evolution and which determine ecological niche the results of our study nevertheless indicate that standard eulerian approaches should be more than sufficient for many contemporary marine ecosystem model applications 5 conclusions the results of our individual based lagrangian modelling study indicate that photoacclimation in phytoplankton is negligible for cells experiencing rates of turbulent mixing that are typical of the open ocean surface boundary layer 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 the individual based representation of phytoplankton was incorporated with an ecosystem model that also contains nutrient zooplankton and detritus and used to simulate the seasonal cycle of plankton dynamics at ocean weather station india in the north atlantic 59 n 20 w results were compared with a separate version of the model in which all state variables including phytoplankton were represented in eulerian mode the two simulations showed remarkable similarity again indicating that rates of mixing in the surface ocean are too fast to permit photoacclimation of phytoplankton to ambient light there may therefore be little or no benefit in using lagrangian models to calculate primary production rather than a standard eulerian approach at least for ocean sites where production is predominantly in the surface mixed layer declaration of competing interest none

24918,a new individual based plankton model is used to test the hypothesis that the timescale of photoacclimation of phytoplankton within the surface mixing layer of the ocean is slow relative to mixing in which case the chlorophyll to carbon chl c ratio of individual cells shows little adjustment in response to changes in light environment driven by vertical displacement rates of photoacclimation are shown to be a strongly non linear function of light intensity that depends on the balance of intrinsic chlorophyll synthesis at low irradiance versus increasing growth rate at high irradiance predicted photoacclimation was negligible for cells experiencing rates of turbulent mixing typical of the open ocean surface boundary layer 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 in which case chl c is set by mean light intensity the model was extended to incorporate a simple ecosystem of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus and using two layer slab physics used to study photoacclimation in a more realistic setting the seasonal cycle of plankton dynamics at ocean weather station india in the north atlantic 59 n 20 w results were remarkably similar when compared with an equivalent ecosystem model that used an eulerian representation of phytoplankton reinforcing our conclusion that mixing rates within the surface mixed layer of the ocean are typically too fast to permit photoacclimation by phytoplankton to ambient light keywords lagrangian model individual based model photoacclimation carbon to chlorophyll primary production marine ecosystem 1 introduction primary production by phytoplankton drives the ocean food web leading to export and sequestration of carbon in deep waters lutz et al 2007 much of this production occurs in the surface mixing layer the thickness of which can vary seasonally from only a few metres during summer stratified conditions to greater than 500 m over winter in some parts of the ocean however production can only occur within the euphotic zone which typically extends to an average of 50 m in the north atlantic ducklow 1999 turbulence with velocities typically 5 10 mm s 1 gives rise to rapid time scales of minutes to hours vertical movement of water in the surface mixing layer e g as shown by the trajectories of neutrally buoyant floats harcourt et al 2002 2010 d asaro et al 2014 it also means that phytoplankton cells experience vertical displacements and thereby a fluctuating light environment given the exponential attenuation of irradiance with depth gardner et al 1999 with potentially important consequences for primary production phytoplankton acclimate in response to changing light intensity leading to variation in chlorophyll to carbon chl c ratios chlorophyll synthesis is maximised under low irradiance in order to improve light harvesting and photosynthetic efficiency whereas there is no such need to produce high levels of light harvesting pigment when exposed to saturating levels of irradiance van de poll et al 2006 the extent to which cells become fully acclimated depends on the relative timescales of mixing and chlorophyll synthesis and it may be the case that phytoplankton do not undergo significant photoacclimation in the surface layer of the ocean given the high mixing rates previous studies both observational lewis et al 1984 anning et al 2000 and modelling falkowski and wirick 1981 franks and marra 1994 mcgillicuddy 1995 have differed in their conclusions on this matter which has important consequences for the calculation of depth integrated photosynthesis within the mixed layer of the ocean individual based lagrangian modelling approaches should be most appropriate for calculating primary production if photoacclimation is prevalent in which the phytoplankton assemblage is represented as the sum of individual cells each with its own unique position in the water column and associated life history including the photophysiological response ross et al 2011a standard eulerian models should otherwise suffice in which phytoplankton are treated as a single state variable with uniform chl c here we present a new lagrangian model and use it to calculate primary production in the surface mixing layer of the ocean focusing on the associated sensitivity to photoacclimation as seen in the predicted life histories of individual cells in a turbulent environment two model setups are examined the first incorporates an individual based representation of phytoplankton into an ecosystem model embedded within a 2 vertical layer slab physics in which the depth of the upper surface mixed layer as well as surface irradiance vary seasonally it is applied to a realistic ocean setting namely the seasonal cycle at ocean weather station india owsi in the northern north atlantic 59 n 20 w using turbulence forcing based on observed winds the second model version provides a theoretical analysis of the interaction between photoacclimation and rate of mixing by representing phytoplankton as the sole biological entity embedded within a mixing layer of fixed depth and exposed to constant irradiance using these two analyses our aim is to test the following hypothesis the timescale of photoacclimation of phytoplankton within the surface mixing layer of the ocean is slow relative to mixing such that individual cells undergo little adjustment of their chl c ratio in response to changes in light environment driven by vertical displacement if true this would mean that most if not all cells within the mixing layer would exhibit approximately uniform chl c ratios 2 model description we first introduce the eulerian model detailing all of the equations and the processes they represent the two lagrangian model setups i e the full ecosystem model and the simplified fixed slab model are then described in turn lists of model variables and parameters are provided in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 1 the eulerian model the eulerian model assumes that turbulence occurs within a single surface layer and that mixing is sufficient to ensure all components are fully mixed at all times concentrations of nutrients phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus npzd are therefore necessarily homogeneous throughout this surface mixing layer primary production is calculated numerically using an average value for chl c throughout the surface mixing layer but allowing changing light intensity with depth at 1 m resolution phytoplankton biomass is represented by two state variables that permit flexible stoichiometry in terms of nitrogen n and chlorophyll chl

firstly a fixed slab phytoplankton only scenario for a detailed analysis of photoacclimation in the model in response to mixing rate and light intensity and secondly development of a full ecosystem model to provide a direct comparison between the eulerian and lagrangian formulations 2 2 fixed slab model phytoplankton are the only biological entity in this version of the model and are represented as super individuals scheffer et al 1995 within a vertical slab of water with a fixed depth h m the slab is subject to a constant mixing rate and constant irradiance at the surface it is computationally impossible to represent each individual phytoplankton cell in a real ocean water column hence the use of super individuals each of which represents a group of cells each super individual has its own unique vertical location in the water column which changes over time according to turbulent mixing and particle movement rules 13 v i α i i v m a x v m a x 2 α 2 i i 2 0 5 now

calculated as a simple quadratic function with parameter mp 0 3 mmol n 1 d 1 this simple mortality function does not explicitly represent processes such as grazing but acts as a control on phytoplankton population as our main focus is rates of phytoplankton growth and acclimation rather than the full ecosystem super individuals are transported passively in the water column by turbulent motion a simple random walk model is used based on the specification of turbulence via a diffusivity coefficient kv falkowski and wirick 1981 visser 1997 ross and sharples 2004 turbulent mixing is calculated using the non local k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 the eddy diffusivity kv is calculated from 18 k v w h s where s is the vertical shape function and the vertical velocity scale of turbulence w m s 1 is calculated from 19 w κ u where κ von kármán s constant 0 4 and u is the wind friction velocity approximated by u 0 001u large 1994 where u is surface wind speed m s 1 here we use a single value for s therefore assuming a constant turbulence throughout the mixing layer this simplification enables a more straightforward analysis of the model results the equation for the random walk is visser 1997 20 z n 1 z n r r 2 k v d t 0 5 here zn is current depth zn 1 is depth at the next time step and r represents a random process with mean of 0 and variance r we use a uniform distribution for r between 1 and 1 such that r 1 3 note that this equation is only strictly valid if kv is assumed to remain constant throughout the displacement from zn to zn 1 the distance moved each time step is therefore a function of surface wind speed and depth of the mixing layer the model has reflecting boundary conditions such that super individuals bounce off the surface and base of the water column the constant fixed depth in the fixed slab model means that unlike the mixing layer model with ecosystem below there is no detrainment or dilution of super individuals the model was run to steady state using a time step of 1 min it was initialised with 20 000 super individuals each with pi 0 015 mmol n chli 0 012 mg chl and chl c ratio of 0 01 g chl g c 1 model results were shown to be insensitive to the initial chl c ratio and so a mid range value was chosen 2 3 mixing layer model with ecosystem this version of the model has two layer slab physics anderson et al 2015 in which a seasonally varying upper mixing layer that incorporates an ecosystem made up of nitrate phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd is positioned above a deep layer that contains only nitrate in a fixed vertical profile fig 1 state variables are exchanged between the two layers via mixing across the base of the mixing layer entrainment and detrainment as the mixed layer deepens or shallows and by sinking of detritus z n and d are defined as standard eulerian state variables representing average concentrations in the surface layer i e with a single differential equation for each phytoplankton on the other hand are represented in lagrangian mode with state variables pi and chl i the average phytoplankton nitrogen biomass per metre pconc calculated by summing across all pi and

due to the strong seasonality in the depth of the surface mixing layer and characteristic spring bloom the annual cycle of mixing layer depth was taken from world ocean atlas antonov et al 2010 irradiance at the ocean surface was calculated using standard trigonometric equations brock 1981 anderson et al 2015 in conjunction with attenuation by clouds according to reed 1977 photosynthetically

least squares to an annual cycle obtained by averaging data from 1997 to 2001 taken from the ecmwf era 40 atlas uppala et al 2005 finally nutrient was assumed to be present in the lower model layer as

2010 model parameters were mostly taken from previous modelling studies including those focusing on the north atlantic fasham et al 1990 yool et al 2013 anderson et al 2015 the magnitude of acclimation to light in the model phytoplankton is controlled by the ratio θ m a x θ i and thus θ m a x the maximum achievable chl c ratio is an important parameter although assigning a value is not straightforward maximum ratios of chl c can range over an order of magnitude from 0 007 to over 0 07 g chl g c 1 geider et al 1997 previous models of photoacclimation have focused only on single species flynn et al 2001 for example used data for the marine diatom skeletonema costatum when comparing different models of photoacclimation in phytoplankton and estimated values of between 0 054 and 0 079 g chl g c 1 oceanic phytoplankton comprise a multitude of species and we therefore tuned this parameter for owsi resulting in a value of 0 02 g chl g c 1 this value is consistent with satellite derived values of chl c ratio in the open ocean behrenfeld et al 2005 that are considerably lower than those seen in laboratory studies the threshold for particle division pdiv was chosen so as to ensure that the number of super individuals in each simulation was greater than 2000 3 results 3 1 ocean weather station india the model was first run for owsi to examine photoacclimation in a realistic setting comparing results for lagrangian and eulerian representations of phytoplankton this analysis involved tuning the value of parameter θ m a x providing a value of 0 02 g chl g c 1 that is representative of open ocean phytoplankton and which is subsequently used in the theoretical analysis of the interplay between acclimation and the timescales of mixing section 3 2 the model was compared with chlorophyll data which are 8 day averages for a characteristic year 2006 anderson et al 2015 and with climatological nitrate data from world ocean atlas antonov et al 2010 the predicted seasonal cycles for these two variables using the lagrangian representation of phytoplankton and θ m a x 0 02 g chl g c 1 is shown in fig 2 simulation length was 3 years with the third year shown by which time a repeating annual cycle occurs the general agreement is good similar to other slab modelling studies of this site fasham 1995 anderson et al 2015 the timing of the spring chlorophyll bloom is about a month late as compared to the data which may be a consequence of the climatological mixing layer forcing whereas the data are for a particular year the underestimation of overwintering stock of phytoplankton at high latitudes is a common feature of slab models fasham 1995 anderson et al 2015 which may be due to the assumption of complete mixing within what is a deep mixing layer the predicted timing and magnitude of the seasonal nitrate drawdown are good which is encouraging given that the nitrate data themselves represent an average climatology the eulerian version of the model generates results that are nearly identical to those when phytoplankton are modelled in a lagrangian manner fig 3 predicted chl c varied between about 0 012 and 0 17 g chl g c 1 in both model versions higher in the winter months because of low irradiance but not showing any signs of a diel cycle the fact that the lagrangian and eulerian versions of the model generated predictions that match closely for phytoplankton nutrients and chl c ratio suggests that the timescales of mixing are too fast for photoacclimation to occur a phenomenon that is examined in more detail in the next section 3 2 fixed slab model the interaction between rates of mixing and photoacclimation was next investigated using the fixed slab model with phytoplankton as the sole state variable no explicit ecosystem or limitation by nutrients with parameters as for owsi notably θ m a x 0 02 g chl g c 1 six simulations were carried out each with 20 000 super individuals in a fixed slab of 100 m and with constant forcing in terms of irradiance at the ocean surface 200 w m 2 wind speed was varied for the different model runs between 0 and 100 m s 1 generating turbulent mixing kv of between 0 and 0 4 m2 s 1 the timescales tm associated with the turbulent mixing in the surface layer can be approximated using the layer depth h and the turbulent diffusivity kv taylor and ferrari 2011 and are given in the legend for fig 4 30 t m h 2 k v the simulations were run to steady state and snapshots taken that show chl c versus incident irradiance for 10 000 randomly chosen super individuals fig 4 a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate how the predicted spread of chl c values was affected by changes to θ m a x and vmax default values 10 the results not shown indicate that while changes to these parameters affect the fully acclimated chl c ratio for super individuals at each irradiance the spread of ratios shown over the whole population showed low sensitivity to changes in the parameterisation of θ m a x or vmax fully acclimated chl c θ a occurs when there is zero mixing such that super individuals have fixed depths distributed evenly throughout the 100 m slab fig 4a the red lines in fig 4 show θ a 31 θ a v p θ m a x v p 2 α 2 i 2 0 5 acclimated chl c thus decreases with increasing irradiance as expected photoacclimation was however incomplete when even a low rate of mixing is introduced 4 10 5 m2 s 1 fig 4b higher chl c ratios were seen in super individuals experiencing low irradiance but there is a large spread about the red line this spread of points in the plots diminishes as the rate of mixing is increased although not towards the fully acclimated state but rather towards uniformity whereby at the highest mixing rate of 4 10 1 m2 s 1 all the super individuals ended up with much the same chl c ratio close to 0 011 g chl g c 1 fig 4f super individuals were unable to photoacclimate to incident irradiance in the fluctuating light environment at high mixing rather they acclimated to the average irradiance in the euphotic zone surface to depth of 1 irradiance red spots in fig 4 although irradiance determines fully acclimated chl c as described above the rate of chlorophyll synthesis photoacclimation depends also on growth rate μp which is an increasing function of irradiance 32 μ c h l s p d c h l c h l d t ρ c h l μ p θ 24 θ m a x α i v m a x 2 ξ v m a x 2 α 2 i 2 where μ c h l s p is the specific rate of chlorophyll synthesis d 1 this relationship is shown in fig 5 with data points from fig 4a superimposed there is thus an optimum irradiance in this case 32 w m 2 at which the rate of chlorophyll synthesis i e photoacclimation is maximised with μ c h l s p declining on either side of the optimum photoacclimation is greatest when super individuals experience sustained exposure to irradiances that maximise μ c h l s p the key factor is the timescales involved i e to quantify what is meant by sustained in this regard working from the simulations shown in fig 4 we identified for each mixing rate the super individual that experienced the closest average irradiance to 32 w m 2 during the last 5 days and show its trajectory in terms of chl c depth and irradiance during this period fig 6 a zero mixing leads to fully acclimated chl c is 0 014 eq 19 the super individual occupying a depth of 6 6 m when mixing is low 4 10 4 m2 s 1 the super individuals in question maintain a depth of between 3 and 10 m throughout the 5 day period with an average depth of 7 0 m an increase of mixing to 4 10 3 m2 s 1 however means that irradiance is no longer sustained over several days and photoacclimation is minimal higher mixing rates lead to rapidly fluctuating vertical position and irradiance resulting in little or no photoacclimation similar results are seen when a lower average irradiance 10 w m 2 is selected fig 6b photoacclimation is seen for mixing rates 4 10 4 m2 s 1 with super individuals maintaining a depth of between 4 and 15 m and chl c tending towards 0 019 the acclimated value for 10 w m 2 in contrast chl c tended towards 0 011 at higher mixing rates corresponding to the average irradiance in the water column 50 9 w m 2 4 discussion rates of photoacclimation are a strongly non linear function of light intensity peaking at an optimum irradiance that maximises the balance between increasing chl c at low irradiance with increasing growth rate and associated synthesis of chlorophyll at high irradiance fig 5 a new lagrangian model was used to test the hypothesis that rates of photoacclimation in the surface mixed layer of the ocean due to changing irradiance as a consequence of vertical displacement are slow relative to mixing in which case little variation occurs in chl c between phytoplankton cells in the water column the hypothesis was supported by our model analyses the theoretical results of the fixed slab model indicate that significant photoacclimation only occurs when mixing rates are 4 10 4 m2 s 1 which corresponds to an approximate mixing timescale of nearly 30 days phytoplankton chl c ranged from 0 003 to 0 02 g chl g c 1 these slow mixing rates allowed phytoplankton cells to remain at the depth of optimum irradiance for a period of several days or more mixing rates in the ocean surface boundary layer are difficult to measure directly but observations e g d asaro 2014 show root mean square vertical velocities with typical values 0 005 0 035 m s 1 closely following the friction velocity u thereby supporting eq 19 together with vertical displacements of the order of the boundary layer thickness d asaro 2001 supporting eq 18 these studies imply diffusivities ranging from 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 in the surface boundary layer and that phytoplankton experience rapid vertical displacements on time scales of hours these magnitudes and timescales of displacement are evident immediately in the trajectories of lagrangian floats as shown in d asaro 2001 when mixing rates of this order were used in our model 4 10 2 m2 s 1 corresponding to an approximate mixing timescale of 7 h results showed that phytoplankton photoacclimate to average light intensity in the euphotic zone with chl c ratio showing a relatively narrow range between 0 008 and 0 017 g chl g c 1 moving beyond the theoretical analysis we also examined the performance of the lagrangian phytoplankton model as part of an npzd ecosystem model embedded within 2 layer slab physics run for station india in the northern north atlantic the rate of turbulent mixing in the surface mixing layer was determined from observed wind speeds varying between 0 01 and 0 29 m2 s 1 phytoplankton growth was driven by nutrients and seasonally varying irradiance at the ocean surface results were compared with an equivalent eulerian model in which phytoplankton were treated as a single homogeneous state variable with a single chl c ratio calculated from depth averaged light intensity predicted seasonal cycles of n p z and d were remarkably similar for the two model versions showing the characteristic bloom of phytoplankton and associated nitrate drawdown fig 2 chl c also exhibited strong seasonality with highest values in winter when incident irradiance is low and the mixed layer is deep predicted chl c was remarkably similar between the lagrangian and eulerian model versions being lower in the former but only marginally so chl c varied 0 0103 0 0165 and 0 0109 0 0166 g chl g c 1 in the lagrangian and eulerian versions of the model respectively fig 3 these marginal differences are not a result of individual photoacclimative properties but rather result from differences in the growth rates the mixing rates in the lagrangian model are not always fast enough to completely overcome the growth rates in the upper part of the mixing layer resulting in a slight gradient in the phytoplankton concentration enforcing the vertical phytoplankton profile predicted by the lagrangian model onto the eulerian model results in a perfect match between their respective predictions not shown however the aim of the study was not to just test when eulerian and lagrangian models diverge for all scenarios which would have required the addition of a diffusive term to the eulerian model but to test when they diverge in the special case of a well mixed surface layer in this case we find that divergence occurs at mixing rates characteristically much lower than those of the surface mixing the fact that the two model versions produce the same results at the high mixing rates that are characteristic of the surface mixing layer of the ocean 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 is sufficient for us to conclude that mixing in the natural environment is high enough to prevent variation in chl c from photoacclimation in response to ambient light these results re emphasise those of the theoretical analysis indicating that photoacclimation to ambient irradiance is of little consequence in the surface mixed layer of the ocean because rates of mixing are too fast furthermore they indicate that at least in terms of areas of the ocean where primary production occurs primarily in the surface mixed layer there may be limited benefit in using a lagrangian representation of phytoplankton in models rather than a standard eulerian approach of course photoacclimation does occur on longer timescales as mean light intensity changes e g seasonally or due to changing mixed layer depth our results are in agreement with field studies that have examined timescales of photoacclimation lewis et al 1984 took samples from the surface and near bottom in the bedford basin a coastal inlet of canada s atlantic coast and found no evidence of photoacclimation when mixing occurred on time scales less than 10 h anning et al 2000 subjected cultures of the marine diatom skeletoneme costatum to irradiance shifts over 15 days results showed that it took 3 5 days for the diatoms to fully acclimate to changes in irradiance with the chlorophyll content of the cells changing 2 5 fold our results likewise show that acclimation takes several days in order that significant changes in chl c occur and that such changes are negligible on timescales of less than a day fig 6 previous modelling studies have been equivocal about the interaction between rates of mixing and photoacclimation and the resulting consequences for primary production falkowski and wirick 1981 found that mean and variance of chl c ratios in phytoplankton along with photosynthetic rates showed little sensitivity to mixing rates ranging from 0 to 0 001 m2 s 1 when using a random walk lagrangian model within an idealised 20 m mixed layer on the other hand franks and marra 1994 using a similar idealised model with a 15 m mixed layer found that depth integrated photosynthesis increased with increasing mixing their model included photo inhibition which may have negatively impacted on cells near the surface especially at low mixing rates mcgillicuddy 1995 compared the performance of two photoacclimation models wolf and woods 1988 and lande and lewis 1989 at two mixing rates 0 01 m2 s 1 and 4 64 m2 s 1 and found little or no difference in predicted phytoplankton growth rate for the two model implementations under weak mixing whereas a significant reduction in mean growth rate occurred in the wolf and woods 1988 model under strong mixing the advantage and novelty of our approach is two fold first we used the fixed slab model to examine a wide range of mixing rates both representing those in the ocean mixed layer and slower rates using a contemporary model of photoacclimation geider et al 1997 and a maximum chl c parameter θ m a x appropriate for ocean phytoplankton obtained by tuning second we modelled a full seasonal cycle for a realistic ocean setting ocean weather station india using a complete npzd ecosystem model and seasonal forcing for wind and irradiance and compared the performance of lagrangian and eulerian formulations for this scenario an interesting application of lagrangian models has been to study whether measurements of primary production from bottles suspended in the water column in which algae experience more or less constant irradiance to which they acclimate are compromised given that cells in the surrounding water experience vertical mixing and thereby fluctuating irradiance barkmann and woods 1996 constructed and parameterised a 1d model for this purpose and found that the primary production calculated of freely moving phytoplankton at a given depth in the water column was 40 lower compared to cells that were confined to the same depth without being able to move similar results were found by ross et al 2011a b when undertaking a lagrangian modelling experiment in which calculated growth rates were compared for phytoplankton cells subject to mixing versus cells that were frozen for 24 h for two ocean settings shallow coastal regions surface mixed layer 6 m and the open ocean surface mixed layer 60 m our results suggest that photoacclimation leading to significant changes in chl c takes place over several days incubation experiments to measure primary production are usually carried out over 24 h mingelbier et al 1994 in which case errors related to photoacclimation may not be large our findings do not however mean that there is no place for lagrangian approaches to modelling phytoplankton and their role in marine ecosystems previous studies have shown that models formulating growth as a nonlinear function of an internal nutrient quota eg droop kinetics give differing predictions when represented in a lagrangian as opposed to eulerian formulation hellweger and kianirad 2007 baudry et al 2018 additionally much of the primary production in the ocean does not occur in the surface mixed layer but rather in stratified waters such as the deep chlorophyll maximum and elevated chlorophyll content may be expected as a consequence of the low irradiances at depth cullen 1982 individual differences in functional traits may be important when it comes to understanding phenomena such as the deep chlorophyll maximum and ephemeral features such as blooms caused by eddies in which case the spatial patterns and dynamics may not be fully captured using traditional eulerian techniques deangelis and yurek 2017 moreover lagrangian models can be integrated with geographical information systems gis data such as satellite observations of sea surface temperature in order to better understand the forces driving phytoplankton evolution and which determine ecological niche the results of our study nevertheless indicate that standard eulerian approaches should be more than sufficient for many contemporary marine ecosystem model applications 5 conclusions the results of our individual based lagrangian modelling study indicate that photoacclimation in phytoplankton is negligible for cells experiencing rates of turbulent mixing that are typical of the open ocean surface boundary layer 10 3 to 10 1 m2 s 1 the individual based representation of phytoplankton was incorporated with an ecosystem model that also contains nutrient zooplankton and detritus and used to simulate the seasonal cycle of plankton dynamics at ocean weather station india in the north atlantic 59 n 20 w results were compared with a separate version of the model in which all state variables including phytoplankton were represented in eulerian mode the two simulations showed remarkable similarity again indicating that rates of mixing in the surface ocean are too fast to permit photoacclimation of phytoplankton to ambient light there may therefore be little or no benefit in using lagrangian models to calculate primary production rather than a standard eulerian approach at least for ocean sites where production is predominantly in the surface mixed layer declaration of competing interest none

24919,variance in life history outcomes among individuals is a requirement for natural selection and a determinant of the ecological dynamics of populations heterogeneity among individuals will cause such variance but so will the inherently stochastic nature of their demography the relative contributions of these variance components stochasticity and heterogeneity to life history outcomes are presented here in a general demographic calculation a general formulation of sensitivity analysis is provided for the relationship between the variance components and the demographic rates within the life cycle we illustrate these novel methods with two examples the variance in longevity within and between frailty groups in a laboratory population of fruit flies and the variance in lifetime reproductive output within and between initial environment states in a perennial herb in a stochastic fire environment in fruit flies an increase in mortality would increase the variance due to stochasticity and reduce that due to heterogeneity in the plant example increasing mortality reduces and increasing fertility increases both variance components sensitivity analyses such as these can provide a powerful tool in identifying patterns among life history stages and heterogeneity groups and their contributions to variance in life history outcomes keywords variance decomposition sensitivity analysis individual stochasticity heterogeneity lifetime reproductive output longevity life history 1 introduction the life histories of all species are characterized by variability no two individuals live the same life leading to variability in such demographic outcomes as longevity growth and developmental trajectories and lifetime reproductive output such variance among individuals ultimately determines both the ecological dynamics and the evolutionary potential of species lifetime reproductive output is often positively skewed with many individuals producing few offspring and a long tail of rare individuals producing many offspring clutton brock 1988 newton 1989 similarly longevity varies among individuals with deaths often peaking at very early life history stages and again at later stages where senescence occurs caughley 1966 inter individual variation in demographic outcomes arises from two sources one is heterogeneity among individuals the other is chance differences among homogeneous individuals we define individuals to be homogeneous if they are at every stage of life subject to identical demographic rates mortality reproduction growth development movement etc for example if a set of individuals all experience the same mortality schedule their trajectories from birth to death differ only when one individual is luckier than the other the inter individual variability in lifetime outcomes that arises from such chance processes is called individual stochasticity caswell 2009 1 1 it is important to be clear how our terminology relates to other terms independently introduced to describe the same phenomena caswell and collaborators refer to the stochastic differences in outcomes from the same vital rates as individual stochasticity e g caswell 2009 2011 caswell and vindenes 2018 caswell and zarulli 2018 as distinct from heterogeneity tuljapurkar and steiner and collaborators have called the stochastic component dynamic heterogeneity and distinguished it from fixed heterogeneity e g tuljapurkar et al 2009 steiner et al 2010 steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 as will become clear later we want to be able to distinguish fixed and dynamic versions of heterogeneity which is difficult to do using tuljapurkar and steiner s terminology however their dynamic heterogeneity corresponds exactly to our individual stochasticity more recently snyder and ellner have introduced the much more familiar term luck for what we call individual stochasticity on the other hand if the set of individuals contains groups that at any stage of life experience different rates these differences will contribute to inter individual variability within each group inter individual variability is due to stochasticity because within each group all individuals experience the same rates whereas the difference among groups results from heterogeneity in traits or environments linked to the different rates experienced by the different groups heterogeneity is a broad term encompassing all manners of differences in vital rates among individuals one might think that heterogeneity is a new concern but that is far from the case demography is and always has been a science of heterogeneity the recognition that individuals of different ages are heterogeneous in mortality and fertility motivated the development of life tables longevity statistics stable population theory and the rest of age classified demography e g lotka 1939 leslie 1945 the recognition that size developmental stage or physiological condition might be more important motivated stage classified demography e g lefkovitch 1965 metz and diekmann 1986 caswell 1989 within age or stage classified demography we know how to calculate the variance due to individual stochasticity in longevity caswell 2009 and lifetime reproductive output van daalen and caswell 2017 these analyses in the form of matrix population models provide a basis for analyzing the effect of additional sources of heterogeneity by incorporating them into the demographic state space start by defining a set of individuals that is of interest inter individual variability within this set in some demographic outcome will depend on heterogeneity and stochasticity to make the discussion more concrete suppose that the set consists of individuals within one age class say age at birth suppose that the individuals in the set are heterogeneous in a property called frailty which influences the mortality rates experienced at any age suppose further that the outcome of interest is longevity we divide the set of individuals into groups based on their frailty at birth the lives of the individuals within each group unfold under the influence of stochasticity each group has its own typical outcome the variable defining such heterogeneity may remain fixed at its initial value e g genotype or some kinds of frailty or may change dynamically through the life cycle e g resources physiological condition health see table 1 if dynamic its changes contribute to the stochastic component of the variation matrix population models have been used to quantify the contributions of individual stochasticity and heterogeneity to the variance in demographic outcomes e g hartemink and caswell 2018 caswell et al 2018 some studies have found that stochasticity alone can account for most or at least a substantial fraction of the observed variance in lifetime reproductive output of e g nematodes and polychaetes caswell 2011 seabirds tuljapurkar et al 2009 steiner et al 2010 steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 birds and mammals van daalen 2015 and humans van daalen and caswell 2019 in such cases heterogeneity can be invoked only with additional evidence one of the best forms of evidence is statistical identification and estimation of the heterogeneity either as a latent or an observed variable e g cam et al 2016 authier et al 2017 given such an estimate a quantitative assessment of the contribution of heterogeneity is achieved by incorporating the heterogeneity into the i state space of the demographic model resulting in a multistate or age stage classified model these models are constructed using vec permutation matrix methods caswell 2014 caswell and salguero gómez 2013 caswell et al 2018 individuals are classified according to a two dimensional state space one dimension describes the progression through the life history e g age size developmental stage and the other dimension describes the movement among heterogeneity groups the groups may represent observable properties e g health resources environmental conditions or unobserved latent variables e g frailty methods for estimation of latent variables from individual data is a rapidly growing field of its own recently reviewed in gimenez et al 2018 and hamel et al 2018 see also works on mixture models such as mclachlan and peel 2004 erişoğlu et al 2012 the multistate model that results from expanding the state space is itself a markov chain from which variance in a variety of demographic outcomes can be calculated we will focus on longevity and lifetime reproductive output because the model contains groups within which all individuals experience identical rates but which differ from each other it is possible to partition the variance into variance within groups attributable to individual stochasticity and variance among the groups resulting from heterogeneity as of this writing in most cases only a small fraction of the variance can be attributed to heterogeneity hartemink et al 2017 found that unobserved frailty in the gamma gompertz makeham mortality model contributed less than 10 of the variance in longevity in several human populations an analysis of laboratory insect populations found that latent heterogeneity in mortality parameters contributed a median of 35 of the variance in longevity hartemink and caswell 2018 jenouvrier et al 2018 found that unobserved heterogeneity in the southern fulmar contributed 5 9 of the variance in longevity 3 7 of the variance in age at first reproduction and 22 of the variance in lifetime reproductive output snyder and ellner 2018 partitioned the variance in a population of kittiwakes and a population of plants where the heterogeneity was again unobserved 2 2 observability is of course partly a function of the data and how they are collected and could change if some new measurement was developed unobserved heterogeneity poses statistical challenges to estimation but there is no fundamental difference between the analysis of observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity in these studies heterogeneity could generally explain a small fraction of the longevity and age at first reproduction and a slightly larger fraction of lifetime reproductive output heterogeneity can also arise from external factors that are directly observable but possibly neglected one such set of factors in human populations are lumped under the term socioeconomic status status as measured by income education or other metrics is known to affect life expectancy however several analyses have found that only a small fraction a few percent of the variance in longevity is due to socioeconomic heterogeneity seaman et al 2019 caswell 2019a vaupel et al 2011 in plants and animals external factors often correspond to environmental conditions a set of individuals at the same age or stage may be heterogeneous in location microclimate resource availability or disturbance history that heterogeneity will contribute to variance in the demographic outcome environmental conditions may be dynamic such as fire or resource availability or fixed such as microclimate variation in sessile organisms we provide examples of both fixed and dynamic heterogeneity in sections 4 and 5 by incorporating the heterogeneity be it fixed or dynamic into the individual state space we turn the variance and its components into demographic quantities as such they depend on the life history characteristics including the definitions of the state space the lifespan of the species whether the heterogeneity affects survival reproduction or development or some combination of these and the way the individuals are mixed among the heterogeneity groups as with any other demographic quantity sensitivity analysis is a powerful and essential tool for analyzing this dependence and quantifying how changes in the life history will change variance components in this study we present a general sensitivity analysis of the components of variance in an arbitrary demographic outcome we will begin by defining a notation for the variance component calculations and then develop sensitivity formulae we illustrate the sensitivity analysis with two examples an age frailty classified model for a species of fruit fly and a stochastic stage environment model for a perennial herb with a fire dependent life history in the case of the fruit fly increasing mortality increases the variance due to stochasticity and reduces the variance due to heterogeneity the effects are strongest at early ages in the case of the plant increasing mortality reduces both variance components increasing fertility increases both components the effects are strongest at large size classes the diversity of these responses demonstrates that sensitivity analysis can reveal connections between variance components and the parameters that define the life cycle they also suggest the value of further theoretical and comparative analyses a note on notation our analysis requires careful mathematical notation to be clear so we specify our general notation here matrices are denoted by upper case boldface letters e g p and vectors by lower case boldface letters e g ρ vectors are column vectors by default x t is the transpose of x the vector 1 n is a n 1 vector of ones i n is the identity matrix of order n and e i is the i th unit vector with a 1 in the i th entry and zeros elsewhere the diagonal matrix with the vector x on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere is denoted d x the symbol denotes the hadamard or element by element product and denotes the kronecker product the vec operator vec x stacks the columns of an m n matrix x into an mn 1 column vector the vec permutation matrix k m n satisfies vec x t k m n vec x in cases where it will help understanding we indicate the dimension of displayed matrix expressions the expectation and variance are denoted by e and v 2 variance decomposition in demographic models to develop our results we must bring together several different components and methods we first define the variance components then the sensitivity of the variance components in general and then the demographic model from which they can be calculated finally we will show how to make the sensitivity calculations specific by applying them to two examples 2 1 stages groups and outcomes the population is classified into stages x 1 s age or size classes developmental stages etc and a set of heterogeneity groups γ 1 g genotype frailty environmental condition etc the definition of stages and groups is investigator specific for example from the perspective of a stage classified model age is a form of heterogeneity from the perspective of an age classified model the same is true of developmental stage caswell et al 2018 we are interested in a demographic outcome which we denote by ξ the properties of the random variable ξ depend on the action of the vital rates over the life cycle including transitions among stages within the heterogeneity groups and transitions among heterogeneity groups to the extent that such transitions are possible 2 2 conditional means and variances we define the conditional means and variances of ξ conditional on group membership as 1 m i e ξ γ i 2 v i v ξ γ i for i 1 g these conditional values are collected in mean and variance vectors 3 m m 1 m g v v 1 v g the calculation of m and v depends on the life cycle and on the choice of variable ξ the distribution of individuals among groups is given by a probability distribution vector π of dimension g 1 we refer to this as the mixing distribution sensu frühwirth schnatter 2006 the mixing distribution determines how individuals are distributed among the heterogeneity groups and thus is one of the determinants of the variance in demographic outcomes the mixing distribution is specified at the point in the life cycle from which the demographic outcome is calculated e g at birth or some other chosen stage the mixing distribution must be specified by the investigator this is a feature not a bug it might be obtained from a model e g the group distribution in the stable population estimated from data hartemink and caswell 2018 jenouvrier et al 2018 measured from observed covariates seaman et al 2019 or assumed e g a uniform distribution as a pseudo experiment 2 3 variance components variance components are calculated from the conditional means and variances the mean of ξ is the mean calculated over the distribution π of γ of the conditional means 4 e ξ e π e ξ γ 5 π t m the variance of ξ contains two terms 6 v ξ e π v ξ γ v π e ξ γ 7 v w ξ within v b ξ between where v w is the within group variance and v b is the between group variance e g rényi 1970 frühwirth schnatter 2006 the within group variance is the mean of the conditional variances with weights specified by π the between group variance is the weighted variance of the conditional group means these variance components capture the effects of heterogeneity and stochasticity if the groups had identical rates there would be no heterogeneity and v b would be zero if the outcome within each group was totally determined by group membership there would be no stochasticity and v w would be zero in our notation the within group and between group variances are computed as 8 v w ξ π t v 9 v b ξ π t m m π t m 2 the fraction of the total variance contributed by heterogeneity 10 k v b v b v w is known as the intraclass correlation coefficient in quantitative genetics falconer 1960 and its square root is known as the correlation ratio in probability theory rényi 1970 if ξ is independent of γ then k 0 if k 1 then ξ is a deterministic function of γ rényi 1970 and individual stochasticity makes no contribution to the variance in ξ 2 4 sensitivity of the variance components to find the sensitivity of v b v w and k to changes in demographic parameters we differentiate eqs 8 and 9 with respect to m and v our methods are an application of matrix calculus see caswell 2019b for a summary of ecological applications and magnus and neudecker 1985 1988 for detailed mathematics as always in these applications we begin by writing the differentials of the variance components in terms of the differentials of the model components the chain rule then permits us to write the derivative of the variance component with respect to a vector θ of parameters that affect the vital rates in this paper we focus on parametric effects on m and v we will treat the mixing distribution π as fixed so derivatives with respect to π do not appear within group variance differentiating 8 gives 11 d v w v w v d v 12 π t d v let θ be a vector of parameters of interest the chain rule gives 13 d v w d θ t π t d v d θ t between group variance the differential of the between group variance from 9 is 14 d v b v b m t d m 15 2 π t d m 2 π t m π t d m once again dependence on a parameter vector θ yields 16 d v b d θ t 2 π t d m 2 π t m π t d m d θ t intra class correlation using eqs 13 and 16 it is also possible to differentiate k as given in 10 with respect to a vector of parameters giving 17 d k d θ t 1 k v b v w d v b d θ t k v b v w d v w d θ t the expressions 13 16 and 17 are the droids we are looking for they require the derivatives of the conditional means and variances with respect to the model parameters these derivatives in turn depend on the model the choice of an outcome ξ and the mixing distribution to find them we begin by constructing the model 3 incorporating heterogeneity vec permutation models for stages and groups in order to calculate both within and between group variances we incorporate both demographic i states and heterogeneity groups into the demographic model in this section we present a general age stage framework that does so we use it to develop expressions for the conditional means and variances of the outcome ξ from which the variance components v b v w and k can be computed the model provides expressions that can be differentiated with respect to parameters specific to the life history stages and heterogeneity groups the multistate model is constructed using the vec permutation framework which can incorporate both fixed and dynamic heterogeneity a complete description of the method for constructing age stage models is given in caswell et al 2018 so we do not repeat the details here when heterogeneity is dynamic i e when individuals can change from one group to another during their lives it is essential to incorporate the heterogeneity into the state space when heterogeneity is fixed the vec permutation approach is equivalent to treating each group independently but it has the advantage of permitting exploration of non fixed groups 3 1 model construction the population composition can be thought of as given by a matrix 18 n n 11 n 1 s n g 1 n g s in which rows correspond to heterogeneity groups and columns to stages the population vector n is obtained by applying the vec operator to n which results in 19 where groups are organized within stages the population projection matrix is 20 a u f where the survival and transition matrix u and the fertility matrix f each inherit the group within stage block structure of 19 we use the tilde to identify vectors or matrices with this block structure these matrices are constructed from demographic rates specific to both stages and groups and capture both kinds of transitions the s s matrix u i describes transitions among stages for group i the g g matrix d j describes transitions among groups for individuals in stage j if heterogeneity is fixed d j is an identity matrix the s s matrix f i gives stage specific fertility for individuals in group i and the g g matrix h j allocates offspring newly produced by stage j into their appropriate groups these matrices are incorporated into gs gs block diagonal matrices u d f and ℍ for example 21 u i 1 g l i u i q i where l i and q i are block construction matrices caswell and van daalen 2016 given as 22 l i 0 i 1 s s i s s 0 g i s s q i 0 s s i 1 i s s 0 s s g i i 1 g finally the block structured projection matrices are given by 23 u d k u k t 24 f ℍ k f k t the vec permutation matrix k permutes the rows and columns in such a way that the orientation defined by 19 is preserved 3 2 moments of demographic outcomes we consider a demographic outcome that can be calculated from and thus inherits the structure of the multistate markov chain we denote this vector outcome by ξ its entries give the outcome for all gs combinations of stage and group the model will provide the moments of ξ which in turn provide the mean and variance vectors 25 the vectors m and v of the conditional means and variances within the set of interest are obtained from m and v specify a stage j in which our cohort of interest will be initialized this is often the first stage or stage at birth but it could be any stage then the conditional mean and variance vectors in eq 3 are given by 26 m e j t i g m 27 v e j t i g v where e j is the j th unit vector of length s it extracts the j th life history stage and i g keeps all the heterogeneity groups the demographic outcome ξ is a function of some set of parameters collected in a vector θ so far we have not specified the outcome ξ or how it is calculated we do so now for two cases longevity and lifetime reproduction variance in longevity longevity is the outcome of the mortality hazards faced by an individual as it moves through life history stages and among heterogeneity groups the mean and variance of longevity are calculated from the multistate fundamental matrix 28 n i u 1 from which we obtain the vectors of the first and second moments of longevity η as 29 η 1 t 1 g s t n 30 η 2 t η 1 t 2 n i g s these moment vectors inherit the stage within group structure of u from these the mean and variance vectors in 25 are 31 m η 1 32 v η 2 η 1 η 1 variance in lifetime reproductive output lifetime reproductive output depends on mortality and fertility for all stages and all heterogeneity groups the life cycle transitions are described by the markov chain transition matrix 33 the final state in the last row of p is the absorbing state of death the vector d 1 g s can be written as a matrix when there are multiple absorbing states i e m α g s where α represents the number of absorbing states reproduction is described as a reward that individuals accumulate as they survive and move among the stages of their life cycle caswell 2011 van daalen and caswell 2015 2017 2019 the statistics of reproduction are given by matrices containing the moments of rewards associated with all possible transitions in p we will be concerned with the first and second moments r 1 and r 2 see van daalen and caswell 2017 for a general discussion of how these moments might be obtained lifetime reproductive output is the accumulated reproductive reward over the lifetime of an individual its first and second moments are 34 ρ 1 n t z p r 1 t 1 g s 1 35 ρ 2 n t z p r 2 t 1 g s 1 2 u r ˆ 1 t ρ 1 where z is a matrix that cleaves off the absorbing state z t glues it back on and r ˆ k is the submatrix of r k without the absorbing state van daalen and caswell 2017 3 3 two forms of notation collide in this quantity van daalen and caswell 2017 use ρ k to denote the vector of k th moments of lifetime reproductive output with the tilde indicating that absorbing state s have been excluded because it is known a priori that the dead do not reproduce in this paper however the tilde denotes a multistate quantity with stage within group structure to avoid confusion we have here adopted the latter convention for ρ as well the vectors ρ 1 and ρ 2 of dimension g s 1 inherit the block structure of u and give the remaining lifetime reproductive output of individuals in every group within every stage in terms of these moments the vectors containing the multistate means and variances of lifetime reproductive output in 25 are 36 m ρ 1 37 v ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 3 3 sensitivity analysis in order to obtain the sensitivity of the variance components it is useful to consider the paths of dependency between the parameters and the outcome fig 1 a shows the links between the mortality schedule of heterogeneity group i and the components of variance in longevity fig 1b shows the links between the fertility and mortality schedules of group i and the components of variance in lifetime reproductive output in the paths in fig 1a and b vital rates are first translated into the multistate framework u and f respectively then transformed into the matrices used in the computations u and n for longevity calculations and u r 1 and r 2 for lro calculations 3 3 1 longevity the

mean and variance vectors m and v are the vectors given by 31 and 32 eqs 38 and 39 give the sensitivity of the variance components to the stage specific mortality schedule within a specified group the effect of perturbations in multiple groups is obtained by adding these group specific sensitivities some of the derivatives in eqs 38 and 39 are determined by the construction of the matrices and generally applicable to any model these are given in table 2 others are specific to the life cycle and parameterization under investigation these are presented in section 4 3 3 2 lifetime reproductive

determined only by the construction of the model and are generally applicable these are given in table 3 those derivatives in 40 43 that are specific to the life cycle and the model are given in the case study of section 5 4 case study heterogeneous frailty and variance in longevity to illustrate sensitivity analysis we analyze the components of the variance in longevity for an age classified population with latent heterogeneity groups that affect mortality we will call this latent variable frailty although it is not exactly frailty sensu vaupel and yashin 1985 and vaupel et al 1979 who used the term to describe a multiplicative hazard effect the analysis is based on data from an experimental population of the fruit fly anastrepha obliqua as described in vaupel et al 1998 that study reported daily mortality for 134 807 adult female flies in a search for latent unobserved heterogeneity hartemink and caswell 2018 fit a mixture of weibull survival functions to these data using the em algorithm aic methods identified a model with six heterogeneity groups each with a different set of weibull parameters and thus a different age schedule of mortality fig 2 shows the distributions of age at death for the six frailty groups and for the mixture of the six groups all analyses were performed in matlab code is available in the supplementary material the mean and variance of longevity were calculated using eqs 28 32 and are shown in fig 3 the first three frailty groups have higher mean longevity and especially groups 1 and 3 have high variance in longevity as well the mixing distribution of newly eclosed adult flies among frailty groups is was estimated as 44 π 0 06 0 20 0 20 0 16 0 24 0 14 t hartemink and caswell 2018 the variance components calculated from eqs 5 10 are e π η 18 9 v w 37 3 v b 109 4 v 146 6 k 0 746 that is 75 of the variance in longevity arises from heterogeneity in frailty between individuals with 25 of the variance due to individual stochasticity this is a large contribution of heterogeneity relative to other species hartemink and caswell 2018 which makes it an interesting example on which to perform sensitivity analysis the derivatives in eqs 38 and 39 that are specific to this case i e specific to an age classified life cycle longevity as the dependent variable mortality as the independent variable are as follows differentiating 29 with respect to n gives 45 d m d vec t n i g s 1 g s t differentiating 32 with respect to n gives 46 d v d vec t n 2 n t i g s 1 g s t i g s 1 g s t 2 i g s η 1 t 2 d η 1 i g s 1 g s t because the model is age classified u i is given by 47 u i y 1 s σ i t where y is a matrix with ones on the subdiagonal and zeros elsewhere and the survival vector σ i is 48 σ i e μ i differentiating 47 gives 49 d vec u i d μ i t d vec y i s 1 s d σ i the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 4 the left column shows the sensitivity of v w fig 4a v b fig 4c and k fig 4e to changes in age specific mortality within each group holding mortality in other groups constant these are the conditional derivatives in eqs 38 and 39 mortality in group 3 has a strong positive effect on v w and a strong negative effect on v b the effect on k is negative overall the effects of group specific mortality on k are qualitatively similar to the effects on v b both variance components are most sensitive to changes in mortality at early ages and practically insensitive to changes after age 20 with the exception of group 3 which happens to have the longest life expectancy 35 days compared to 19 days for a mixed cohort the sensitivities to changes in mortality that affect all frailty groups are shown in fig 4b d and f all else being equal an environment with higher overall mortality levels should show a lower fraction of variance in longevity due to heterogeneity but the details will depend on how heterogeneity affects the vital rates and the mixing of individuals among heterogeneity groups the response of v w to mortality at early ages is positive fig 4a the response becomes negative at late ages the boundary between early and late ages differs among groups the response of v b to changes in mortality is negative when the changes affect long lived frailty groups and positive when short lived frailty groups are affected fig 4c the pattern of group specific positive or negative responses of k to changing mortality is similar fig 4e 5 case study environmental stochasticity and variance in lifetime reproductive output the previous example considered the contribution of fixed heterogeneity to variance in longevity in an age classified population in this case study we consider the contribution of a dynamic form of heterogeneity to the variance in lifetime reproductive output lro in a stage classified plant population the heterogeneity in this case reflects the environment into which the individual is born subsequent environmental conditions fire in this case and their stochastic dynamics are incorporated into the individual states dynamic heterogeneity can have diverse effects on variance fixed heterogeneity leads to intra cohort selection removing the more frail individuals and reducing the eventual variance see caswell 2014 for an example dynamic movement among heterogeneity groups can counteract this loss of diversity however those dynamics also mix individuals among groups the lower the rate of mixing the longer individuals will experience the rates of the environment at the starting stage the higher the rate of mixing between groups in the limit independent and identically distributed transitions the less persistent will be the effects of environment at birth thus dynamic heterogeneity may either increase or reduce the component of variance due to heterogeneity lomatium bradshawii is an endangered perennial herb native to grasslands in oregon and washington l bradshawii is adapted to an environment with frequent fires reproductive output increases in years where fires take place caswell and kaye 2001 caswell 2011 caswell and kaye 2001 presented stage classified matrix models for l bradshawii in a stochastically varying fire environment the stages include a yearling class two classes of vegetative plants and three classes of reproductive plants differentiated by size here we use the fertility and survival data for one of the populations rose prairie to calculate the statistics and variance components of lifetime reproductive output for this species analyses were performed in matlab code is available in the supplementary material four environmental states were recognized a fire year one year since last fire two years since last fire and three or more years since the last fire the dynamics of the fire environment follow a markov chain with transition matrix 50 d r r r r 1 r 0 0 0 0 1 r 0 0 0 0 1 r 1 r where r is the fire frequency each of the four fire states has its own set of survival and fertility matrices the survival and transition matrix u is constructed as in eq 23 where d contains six copies of the environmental transition matrix d on the diagonal the transitions among life history stages u i differ among fire environments we calculate mean and variance in lifetime reproductive output according to eqs 33 37 the moments of lifetime reproductive output in eqs 34 and 35 depend on u and on the reward matrices r 1 and r 2 the reward matrices are constructed from environment specific fertility schedules define a vector f i containing the mean stage specific fertilities in environment i the multistate vector of fertilities is 51 where l i is the block construction matrix appearing in 22 as in 23 the vec permutation matrix k permutes the rows and columns so that the structure of f in 51 matches that of u we assume that rewards are obtained when individuals occupy a given state regardless of their next transition and that no rewards can be collected by individuals who are dead these assumptions give the mean reward matrix 52 where 53 z i 0 we obtain the matrix r 2 of second moments of rewards by assuming that individual reproduction follows a poisson distribution so that 54 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 1 see caswell 2011 and van daalen and caswell 2017 for discussion of other ways that r 2 could be obtained the statistics of lro depend on the fire frequency r fig 5 both mean and variance in lro increase with increasing fire frequency despite the strong effect of the fire environment on all the vital rates the intraclass correlation k is small for this model environmental heterogeneity contributes less than 0 5 of the variance in lro if we continue the analysis at r 0 49 a scenario roughly corresponding to the maximum contribution of heterogeneity the stochastic within environment component of the variance dominates e π ρ 1 5 v w 45 2 v b 0 2 v 45 4 k 0 004 for sensitivity analysis we keep the fire frequency set to r 0 49 the stable distribution of environments is given by the right eigenvector of the environmental matrix d in eq 50 this provides the mixing distribution as 55 π 0 49 0 25 0 13 0 13 t other possibilities for mixing distributions have been suggested by hernandez suarez et al 2012 the sensitivities of lifetime reproductive output to changes in mortality and fertility within each group i e each environment are calculated using eqs 40 43 following the dependencies shown in fig 1b we first investigate the sensitivity of the variance components to fertility most of the derivatives are once again independent of the life cycle structure and the dependent and independent variables of interest these are collected in table 3 differentiating 36 with respect to f gives 56 d m d f t n t 1 g s 1 z k 1 d vec p d vec r 1 d f t differentiating 37 with respect to f gives 57 d v d f t n t 1 g s 1 z k 1 d vec p d vec r 2 d f t 2 ρ 1 t i k 2 d vec u z z d vec r 1 d f t 2 u r ˆ 1 t d m d f t 2 d ρ 1 d m d f t where k 1 and k 2 are vec permutation matrices magnus and neudecker 1979 58 k 1 k g s 1 g s 1 59 k 2 k g s g s the steps required to obtain 56 and 57 are presented in van daalen and caswell 2017 and in the supplementary material the sensitivities of v w v b and k to fertility are shown in fig 6 the sensitivities of the within group variance v w to fertility fig 6a and b increase with stage up to stage 5 this pattern holds whether fertility is changed within one environment fig 6a or in all environments fig 6b the between group variance v b is most sensitive to fertility in stage 1 fig 6c with an increase in fertility in a fire year raising v b whereas in the non fire years it lowers v b in later stages fertility has only small positive or negative effects on the between group variance depending on the environment when fertility is increased in all environments v b increases fig 6d the net effect of increasing fertility in stage 1 is zero because it increases lro equally in every environment as there is no chance of dying differentially before entering stage 1 therefore the difference among groups does not change the intraclass correlation k is most sensitive to fertility in stage 1 whether the response is positive or negative depends on the stage environment combination fig 6e as is always the case sensitivity analysis happily reports the results of changes that are hypothetical in this case some changes in fertility are impossible as for example stage 1 is a pre reproductive stage and increasing fertility at that stage is an interesting thought experiment rather than a potential biological reality at the final three stages where reproduction takes place the effect of changing fertility is far greater for v w than v b but the fraction of variance due to heterogeneity does not change greatly lifetime reproductive output depends on mortality as well as fertility the sensitivities of the variance components to mortality are given in eqs 41 and 43 most of the pieces of these derivatives are given in tables 2 and 3 unlike 47 for insects u i for the plants is a function of growth and survival as in 60 u i g i σ i 61 σ i i 1 s σ i t 62 σ

and caswell 2017 and in the supplementary material the sensitivities of v w v b and k to mortality are shown in fig 7 increasing mortality in any environment reduces the within group variance v w fig 7a the effects on v b and k depend on the stage environment combination but the effects are small figs 7c and e increasing mortality in a fire year decreases v b as does increasing mortality in stages 4 and 5 when mortality increases in all environments both v w fig 7b and v b fig 7d are reduced the effects on k are small and mostly negative fig 7f 6 discussion variance components are central to the discussion of the relative contribution of heterogeneity and stochasticity to life history outcomes heterogeneity differences among individuals that lead to differences in the vital rates they experience is expressed as variance between groups individual stochasticity differences in outcome among individuals experiencing the same rates appears as variance within groups the important question is how much each of these sources contributes to the variance the results in sections 2 4 and 3 provide a flexible method for decomposing variance applicable across life history outcomes types of heterogeneity life cycles sets of vital rates and mixing distributions this flexibility is a consequence of formulating the life cycle as a multistate matrix model caswell et al 2018 the within group and between group components of variance depend on the life cycle as in other parts of demography sensitivity analysis is useful to explore this dependence caswell 2019b we present a method for the sensitivity analysis of the variance components to life history parameters and illustrate the approach with two examples variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty in a fruit fly and variance in lifetime reproductive output due to environmental conditions in an herbaceous plant in a stochastic fire environment the fraction of variance explained by heterogeneity differs between these two examples in the fruit fly 75 of the variance in longevity is due to heterogeneity in initial frailty in l bradshawii only 0 4 of the variance in lro is due to heterogeneity in initial environmental conditions both examples are extreme compared to previous studies but in different directions about 5 10 of the variance in longevity is due to frailty in humans hartemink et al 2017 about 5 is due to socio economic heterogeneity in humans seaman et al 2019 a median of 35 is due to frailty in laboratory insect populations hartemink and caswell 2018 and about 6 due to unobserved heterogeneity in the southern fulmar jenouvrier et al 2018 studies of lifetime reproductive output have reported contributions of 22 due to unobserved heterogeneity in southern fulmars jenouvrier et al 2018 and 39 due to quality in kittiwakes snyder and ellner 2018 snyder and ellner 2018 show that for some analytical models incorporating stochasticity and heterogeneity stochasticity determines a substantial fraction of the variation even as they vary the values for survival and fertility in addition they show that increasing variability in survival and fertility generally increased the contribution of stochasticity the sensitivity results for the two examples analyzed here partly agree with their result with the added benefit of disentangling at which ages or stages and which heterogeneity groups within and between group variances are most sensitive to fertility and mortality in the fruit fly example the sensitivity of v w to mortality is positive up to some critical age the sensitivity of v b is negative at these ages intuitively leading to a decrease in k with increasing mortality however if mortality at early ages increased only for the most frail groups of fruit flies the result would be an increase in k in the case of lro in l bradshawii the sensitivity of both variance components to fertility is positive and to mortality is negative although k is a simple function of v b and v w the sensitivity of k is not necessarily a simple result of the sensitivities for the variance components the lomatium example illustrates this although sensitivity of k in this case is always small the sensitivity patterns the direction and magnitude of the sensitivities of the variance components and k differ between the two examples the fact that in the fruit fly increasing mortality changes the within group and between group components of variance in opposite directions suggests some kind of trade off but this is not observed in the example for lomatium whether this difference is a result of the structure of the models the type of heterogeneity the choice in mixing distribution or the demographic outcome under investigation is a question that can only be answered by additional analyses more studies of variance components of different species across the tree of life would be indispensable in the search for broad patterns the mixing distribution π is a key ingredient in variance decomposition because it defines the initial distribution of individuals among heterogeneity groups we have treated it as a fixed parameter a useful extension would be to include the sensitivity of demographic outcomes to π in the analysis we expect that its relative influence would vary with the type of heterogeneity the term heterogeneity applies to a wide range of types of differences among individuals in this paper we included an example in which an unobserved internal fixed set of differences frailty in the broad sense affected the mortality schedule see table 1 we also analyzed an example in which the heterogeneity is an observed external and dynamic set of differences due to the fire environment the differences between the vital rates in the fire environments are substantial yet the between group variance component is very small this reflects the dynamic rather than fixed nature of the fire environment individuals starting life in one environment experience the other environments decreasing the contribution of the differences in initial environment over the lifetime whether this is a general result for dynamic heterogeneity is a question that can only be answered with additional studies additional examples of dynamic heterogeneity and environmental differences but also different kinds of fixed heterogeneity and dynamic sequential heterogeneity groups will be valuable to elucidate how heterogeneity contributes to the variance in life history outcomes many studies include the effects of certain covariates on vital rate estimates these covariates if incorporated into a demographic model might provide the heterogeneity information required for variance analysis life history outcomes are often highly variable among individuals especially for fitness components such as lifetime reproductive output it is important to account for variance due to individual stochasticity on which selection cannot act steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 van daalen and caswell 2019 indeed individual stochasticity might slow selection by obscuring variance due to genetic heterogeneity steiner and tuljapurkar 2012

24919,variance in life history outcomes among individuals is a requirement for natural selection and a determinant of the ecological dynamics of populations heterogeneity among individuals will cause such variance but so will the inherently stochastic nature of their demography the relative contributions of these variance components stochasticity and heterogeneity to life history outcomes are presented here in a general demographic calculation a general formulation of sensitivity analysis is provided for the relationship between the variance components and the demographic rates within the life cycle we illustrate these novel methods with two examples the variance in longevity within and between frailty groups in a laboratory population of fruit flies and the variance in lifetime reproductive output within and between initial environment states in a perennial herb in a stochastic fire environment in fruit flies an increase in mortality would increase the variance due to stochasticity and reduce that due to heterogeneity in the plant example increasing mortality reduces and increasing fertility increases both variance components sensitivity analyses such as these can provide a powerful tool in identifying patterns among life history stages and heterogeneity groups and their contributions to variance in life history outcomes keywords variance decomposition sensitivity analysis individual stochasticity heterogeneity lifetime reproductive output longevity life history 1 introduction the life histories of all species are characterized by variability no two individuals live the same life leading to variability in such demographic outcomes as longevity growth and developmental trajectories and lifetime reproductive output such variance among individuals ultimately determines both the ecological dynamics and the evolutionary potential of species lifetime reproductive output is often positively skewed with many individuals producing few offspring and a long tail of rare individuals producing many offspring clutton brock 1988 newton 1989 similarly longevity varies among individuals with deaths often peaking at very early life history stages and again at later stages where senescence occurs caughley 1966 inter individual variation in demographic outcomes arises from two sources one is heterogeneity among individuals the other is chance differences among homogeneous individuals we define individuals to be homogeneous if they are at every stage of life subject to identical demographic rates mortality reproduction growth development movement etc for example if a set of individuals all experience the same mortality schedule their trajectories from birth to death differ only when one individual is luckier than the other the inter individual variability in lifetime outcomes that arises from such chance processes is called individual stochasticity caswell 2009 1 1 it is important to be clear how our terminology relates to other terms independently introduced to describe the same phenomena caswell and collaborators refer to the stochastic differences in outcomes from the same vital rates as individual stochasticity e g caswell 2009 2011 caswell and vindenes 2018 caswell and zarulli 2018 as distinct from heterogeneity tuljapurkar and steiner and collaborators have called the stochastic component dynamic heterogeneity and distinguished it from fixed heterogeneity e g tuljapurkar et al 2009 steiner et al 2010 steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 as will become clear later we want to be able to distinguish fixed and dynamic versions of heterogeneity which is difficult to do using tuljapurkar and steiner s terminology however their dynamic heterogeneity corresponds exactly to our individual stochasticity more recently snyder and ellner have introduced the much more familiar term luck for what we call individual stochasticity on the other hand if the set of individuals contains groups that at any stage of life experience different rates these differences will contribute to inter individual variability within each group inter individual variability is due to stochasticity because within each group all individuals experience the same rates whereas the difference among groups results from heterogeneity in traits or environments linked to the different rates experienced by the different groups heterogeneity is a broad term encompassing all manners of differences in vital rates among individuals one might think that heterogeneity is a new concern but that is far from the case demography is and always has been a science of heterogeneity the recognition that individuals of different ages are heterogeneous in mortality and fertility motivated the development of life tables longevity statistics stable population theory and the rest of age classified demography e g lotka 1939 leslie 1945 the recognition that size developmental stage or physiological condition might be more important motivated stage classified demography e g lefkovitch 1965 metz and diekmann 1986 caswell 1989 within age or stage classified demography we know how to calculate the variance due to individual stochasticity in longevity caswell 2009 and lifetime reproductive output van daalen and caswell 2017 these analyses in the form of matrix population models provide a basis for analyzing the effect of additional sources of heterogeneity by incorporating them into the demographic state space start by defining a set of individuals that is of interest inter individual variability within this set in some demographic outcome will depend on heterogeneity and stochasticity to make the discussion more concrete suppose that the set consists of individuals within one age class say age at birth suppose that the individuals in the set are heterogeneous in a property called frailty which influences the mortality rates experienced at any age suppose further that the outcome of interest is longevity we divide the set of individuals into groups based on their frailty at birth the lives of the individuals within each group unfold under the influence of stochasticity each group has its own typical outcome the variable defining such heterogeneity may remain fixed at its initial value e g genotype or some kinds of frailty or may change dynamically through the life cycle e g resources physiological condition health see table 1 if dynamic its changes contribute to the stochastic component of the variation matrix population models have been used to quantify the contributions of individual stochasticity and heterogeneity to the variance in demographic outcomes e g hartemink and caswell 2018 caswell et al 2018 some studies have found that stochasticity alone can account for most or at least a substantial fraction of the observed variance in lifetime reproductive output of e g nematodes and polychaetes caswell 2011 seabirds tuljapurkar et al 2009 steiner et al 2010 steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 birds and mammals van daalen 2015 and humans van daalen and caswell 2019 in such cases heterogeneity can be invoked only with additional evidence one of the best forms of evidence is statistical identification and estimation of the heterogeneity either as a latent or an observed variable e g cam et al 2016 authier et al 2017 given such an estimate a quantitative assessment of the contribution of heterogeneity is achieved by incorporating the heterogeneity into the i state space of the demographic model resulting in a multistate or age stage classified model these models are constructed using vec permutation matrix methods caswell 2014 caswell and salguero gómez 2013 caswell et al 2018 individuals are classified according to a two dimensional state space one dimension describes the progression through the life history e g age size developmental stage and the other dimension describes the movement among heterogeneity groups the groups may represent observable properties e g health resources environmental conditions or unobserved latent variables e g frailty methods for estimation of latent variables from individual data is a rapidly growing field of its own recently reviewed in gimenez et al 2018 and hamel et al 2018 see also works on mixture models such as mclachlan and peel 2004 erişoğlu et al 2012 the multistate model that results from expanding the state space is itself a markov chain from which variance in a variety of demographic outcomes can be calculated we will focus on longevity and lifetime reproductive output because the model contains groups within which all individuals experience identical rates but which differ from each other it is possible to partition the variance into variance within groups attributable to individual stochasticity and variance among the groups resulting from heterogeneity as of this writing in most cases only a small fraction of the variance can be attributed to heterogeneity hartemink et al 2017 found that unobserved frailty in the gamma gompertz makeham mortality model contributed less than 10 of the variance in longevity in several human populations an analysis of laboratory insect populations found that latent heterogeneity in mortality parameters contributed a median of 35 of the variance in longevity hartemink and caswell 2018 jenouvrier et al 2018 found that unobserved heterogeneity in the southern fulmar contributed 5 9 of the variance in longevity 3 7 of the variance in age at first reproduction and 22 of the variance in lifetime reproductive output snyder and ellner 2018 partitioned the variance in a population of kittiwakes and a population of plants where the heterogeneity was again unobserved 2 2 observability is of course partly a function of the data and how they are collected and could change if some new measurement was developed unobserved heterogeneity poses statistical challenges to estimation but there is no fundamental difference between the analysis of observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity in these studies heterogeneity could generally explain a small fraction of the longevity and age at first reproduction and a slightly larger fraction of lifetime reproductive output heterogeneity can also arise from external factors that are directly observable but possibly neglected one such set of factors in human populations are lumped under the term socioeconomic status status as measured by income education or other metrics is known to affect life expectancy however several analyses have found that only a small fraction a few percent of the variance in longevity is due to socioeconomic heterogeneity seaman et al 2019 caswell 2019a vaupel et al 2011 in plants and animals external factors often correspond to environmental conditions a set of individuals at the same age or stage may be heterogeneous in location microclimate resource availability or disturbance history that heterogeneity will contribute to variance in the demographic outcome environmental conditions may be dynamic such as fire or resource availability or fixed such as microclimate variation in sessile organisms we provide examples of both fixed and dynamic heterogeneity in sections 4 and 5 by incorporating the heterogeneity be it fixed or dynamic into the individual state space we turn the variance and its components into demographic quantities as such they depend on the life history characteristics including the definitions of the state space the lifespan of the species whether the heterogeneity affects survival reproduction or development or some combination of these and the way the individuals are mixed among the heterogeneity groups as with any other demographic quantity sensitivity analysis is a powerful and essential tool for analyzing this dependence and quantifying how changes in the life history will change variance components in this study we present a general sensitivity analysis of the components of variance in an arbitrary demographic outcome we will begin by defining a notation for the variance component calculations and then develop sensitivity formulae we illustrate the sensitivity analysis with two examples an age frailty classified model for a species of fruit fly and a stochastic stage environment model for a perennial herb with a fire dependent life history in the case of the fruit fly increasing mortality increases the variance due to stochasticity and reduces the variance due to heterogeneity the effects are strongest at early ages in the case of the plant increasing mortality reduces both variance components increasing fertility increases both components the effects are strongest at large size classes the diversity of these responses demonstrates that sensitivity analysis can reveal connections between variance components and the parameters that define the life cycle they also suggest the value of further theoretical and comparative analyses a note on notation our analysis requires careful mathematical notation to be clear so we specify our general notation here matrices are denoted by upper case boldface letters e g p and vectors by lower case boldface letters e g ρ vectors are column vectors by default x t is the transpose of x the vector 1 n is a n 1 vector of ones i n is the identity matrix of order n and e i is the i th unit vector with a 1 in the i th entry and zeros elsewhere the diagonal matrix with the vector x on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere is denoted d x the symbol denotes the hadamard or element by element product and denotes the kronecker product the vec operator vec x stacks the columns of an m n matrix x into an mn 1 column vector the vec permutation matrix k m n satisfies vec x t k m n vec x in cases where it will help understanding we indicate the dimension of displayed matrix expressions the expectation and variance are denoted by e and v 2 variance decomposition in demographic models to develop our results we must bring together several different components and methods we first define the variance components then the sensitivity of the variance components in general and then the demographic model from which they can be calculated finally we will show how to make the sensitivity calculations specific by applying them to two examples 2 1 stages groups and outcomes the population is classified into stages x 1 s age or size classes developmental stages etc and a set of heterogeneity groups γ 1 g genotype frailty environmental condition etc the definition of stages and groups is investigator specific for example from the perspective of a stage classified model age is a form of heterogeneity from the perspective of an age classified model the same is true of developmental stage caswell et al 2018 we are interested in a demographic outcome which we denote by ξ the properties of the random variable ξ depend on the action of the vital rates over the life cycle including transitions among stages within the heterogeneity groups and transitions among heterogeneity groups to the extent that such transitions are possible 2 2 conditional means and variances we define the conditional means and variances of ξ conditional on group membership as 1 m i e ξ γ i 2 v i v ξ γ i for i 1 g these conditional values are collected in mean and variance vectors 3 m m 1 m g v v 1 v g the calculation of m and v depends on the life cycle and on the choice of variable ξ the distribution of individuals among groups is given by a probability distribution vector π of dimension g 1 we refer to this as the mixing distribution sensu frühwirth schnatter 2006 the mixing distribution determines how individuals are distributed among the heterogeneity groups and thus is one of the determinants of the variance in demographic outcomes the mixing distribution is specified at the point in the life cycle from which the demographic outcome is calculated e g at birth or some other chosen stage the mixing distribution must be specified by the investigator this is a feature not a bug it might be obtained from a model e g the group distribution in the stable population estimated from data hartemink and caswell 2018 jenouvrier et al 2018 measured from observed covariates seaman et al 2019 or assumed e g a uniform distribution as a pseudo experiment 2 3 variance components variance components are calculated from the conditional means and variances the mean of ξ is the mean calculated over the distribution π of γ of the conditional means 4 e ξ e π e ξ γ 5 π t m the variance of ξ contains two terms 6 v ξ e π v ξ γ v π e ξ γ 7 v w ξ within v b ξ between where v w is the within group variance and v b is the between group variance e g rényi 1970 frühwirth schnatter 2006 the within group variance is the mean of the conditional variances with weights specified by π the between group variance is the weighted variance of the conditional group means these variance components capture the effects of heterogeneity and stochasticity if the groups had identical rates there would be no heterogeneity and v b would be zero if the outcome within each group was totally determined by group membership there would be no stochasticity and v w would be zero in our notation the within group and between group variances are computed as 8 v w ξ π t v 9 v b ξ π t m m π t m 2 the fraction of the total variance contributed by heterogeneity 10 k v b v b v w is known as the intraclass correlation coefficient in quantitative genetics falconer 1960 and its square root is known as the correlation ratio in probability theory rényi 1970 if ξ is independent of γ then k 0 if k 1 then ξ is a deterministic function of γ rényi 1970 and individual stochasticity makes no contribution to the variance in ξ 2 4 sensitivity of the variance components to find the sensitivity of v b v w and k to changes in demographic parameters we differentiate eqs 8 and 9 with respect to m and v our methods are an application of matrix calculus see caswell 2019b for a summary of ecological applications and magnus and neudecker 1985 1988 for detailed mathematics as always in these applications we begin by writing the differentials of the variance components in terms of the differentials of the model components the chain rule then permits us to write the derivative of the variance component with respect to a vector θ of parameters that affect the vital rates in this paper we focus on parametric effects on m and v we will treat the mixing distribution π as fixed so derivatives with respect to π do not appear within group variance differentiating 8 gives 11 d v w v w v d v 12 π t d v let θ be a vector of parameters of interest the chain rule gives 13 d v w d θ t π t d v d θ t between group variance the differential of the between group variance from 9 is 14 d v b v b m t d m 15 2 π t d m 2 π t m π t d m once again dependence on a parameter vector θ yields 16 d v b d θ t 2 π t d m 2 π t m π t d m d θ t intra class correlation using eqs 13 and 16 it is also possible to differentiate k as given in 10 with respect to a vector of parameters giving 17 d k d θ t 1 k v b v w d v b d θ t k v b v w d v w d θ t the expressions 13 16 and 17 are the droids we are looking for they require the derivatives of the conditional means and variances with respect to the model parameters these derivatives in turn depend on the model the choice of an outcome ξ and the mixing distribution to find them we begin by constructing the model 3 incorporating heterogeneity vec permutation models for stages and groups in order to calculate both within and between group variances we incorporate both demographic i states and heterogeneity groups into the demographic model in this section we present a general age stage framework that does so we use it to develop expressions for the conditional means and variances of the outcome ξ from which the variance components v b v w and k can be computed the model provides expressions that can be differentiated with respect to parameters specific to the life history stages and heterogeneity groups the multistate model is constructed using the vec permutation framework which can incorporate both fixed and dynamic heterogeneity a complete description of the method for constructing age stage models is given in caswell et al 2018 so we do not repeat the details here when heterogeneity is dynamic i e when individuals can change from one group to another during their lives it is essential to incorporate the heterogeneity into the state space when heterogeneity is fixed the vec permutation approach is equivalent to treating each group independently but it has the advantage of permitting exploration of non fixed groups 3 1 model construction the population composition can be thought of as given by a matrix 18 n n 11 n 1 s n g 1 n g s in which rows correspond to heterogeneity groups and columns to stages the population vector n is obtained by applying the vec operator to n which results in 19 where groups are organized within stages the population projection matrix is 20 a u f where the survival and transition matrix u and the fertility matrix f each inherit the group within stage block structure of 19 we use the tilde to identify vectors or matrices with this block structure these matrices are constructed from demographic rates specific to both stages and groups and capture both kinds of transitions the s s matrix u i describes transitions among stages for group i the g g matrix d j describes transitions among groups for individuals in stage j if heterogeneity is fixed d j is an identity matrix the s s matrix f i gives stage specific fertility for individuals in group i and the g g matrix h j allocates offspring newly produced by stage j into their appropriate groups these matrices are incorporated into gs gs block diagonal matrices u d f and ℍ for example 21 u i 1 g l i u i q i where l i and q i are block construction matrices caswell and van daalen 2016 given as 22 l i 0 i 1 s s i s s 0 g i s s q i 0 s s i 1 i s s 0 s s g i i 1 g finally the block structured projection matrices are given by 23 u d k u k t 24 f ℍ k f k t the vec permutation matrix k permutes the rows and columns in such a way that the orientation defined by 19 is preserved 3 2 moments of demographic outcomes we consider a demographic outcome that can be calculated from and thus inherits the structure of the multistate markov chain we denote this vector outcome by ξ its entries give the outcome for all gs combinations of stage and group the model will provide the moments of ξ which in turn provide the mean and variance vectors 25 the vectors m and v of the conditional means and variances within the set of interest are obtained from m and v specify a stage j in which our cohort of interest will be initialized this is often the first stage or stage at birth but it could be any stage then the conditional mean and variance vectors in eq 3 are given by 26 m e j t i g m 27 v e j t i g v where e j is the j th unit vector of length s it extracts the j th life history stage and i g keeps all the heterogeneity groups the demographic outcome ξ is a function of some set of parameters collected in a vector θ so far we have not specified the outcome ξ or how it is calculated we do so now for two cases longevity and lifetime reproduction variance in longevity longevity is the outcome of the mortality hazards faced by an individual as it moves through life history stages and among heterogeneity groups the mean and variance of longevity are calculated from the multistate fundamental matrix 28 n i u 1 from which we obtain the vectors of the first and second moments of longevity η as 29 η 1 t 1 g s t n 30 η 2 t η 1 t 2 n i g s these moment vectors inherit the stage within group structure of u from these the mean and variance vectors in 25 are 31 m η 1 32 v η 2 η 1 η 1 variance in lifetime reproductive output lifetime reproductive output depends on mortality and fertility for all stages and all heterogeneity groups the life cycle transitions are described by the markov chain transition matrix 33 the final state in the last row of p is the absorbing state of death the vector d 1 g s can be written as a matrix when there are multiple absorbing states i e m α g s where α represents the number of absorbing states reproduction is described as a reward that individuals accumulate as they survive and move among the stages of their life cycle caswell 2011 van daalen and caswell 2015 2017 2019 the statistics of reproduction are given by matrices containing the moments of rewards associated with all possible transitions in p we will be concerned with the first and second moments r 1 and r 2 see van daalen and caswell 2017 for a general discussion of how these moments might be obtained lifetime reproductive output is the accumulated reproductive reward over the lifetime of an individual its first and second moments are 34 ρ 1 n t z p r 1 t 1 g s 1 35 ρ 2 n t z p r 2 t 1 g s 1 2 u r ˆ 1 t ρ 1 where z is a matrix that cleaves off the absorbing state z t glues it back on and r ˆ k is the submatrix of r k without the absorbing state van daalen and caswell 2017 3 3 two forms of notation collide in this quantity van daalen and caswell 2017 use ρ k to denote the vector of k th moments of lifetime reproductive output with the tilde indicating that absorbing state s have been excluded because it is known a priori that the dead do not reproduce in this paper however the tilde denotes a multistate quantity with stage within group structure to avoid confusion we have here adopted the latter convention for ρ as well the vectors ρ 1 and ρ 2 of dimension g s 1 inherit the block structure of u and give the remaining lifetime reproductive output of individuals in every group within every stage in terms of these moments the vectors containing the multistate means and variances of lifetime reproductive output in 25 are 36 m ρ 1 37 v ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 3 3 sensitivity analysis in order to obtain the sensitivity of the variance components it is useful to consider the paths of dependency between the parameters and the outcome fig 1 a shows the links between the mortality schedule of heterogeneity group i and the components of variance in longevity fig 1b shows the links between the fertility and mortality schedules of group i and the components of variance in lifetime reproductive output in the paths in fig 1a and b vital rates are first translated into the multistate framework u and f respectively then transformed into the matrices used in the computations u and n for longevity calculations and u r 1 and r 2 for lro calculations 3 3 1 longevity the sensitivity equations for the components of variance in longevity corresponding to the dependencies in fig 1a are 38 d v b d μ t group i d v b d m t d m d m t d m d vec t n d vec n d vec t u d vec u d vec t u d vec u d vec t u i d vec u i d μ i t 39 d v w d μ t group i d v w d v t d v d v t d v d vec t n d vec n d vec t u d u d vec t u d vec u d vec t u i d vec u i d μ i t in these expressions the mean and variance vectors m and v are the vectors given by 31 and 32 eqs 38 and 39 give the sensitivity of the variance components to the stage specific mortality schedule within a specified group the effect of perturbations in multiple groups is obtained by adding these group specific sensitivities some of the derivatives in eqs 38 and 39 are determined by the construction of the matrices and generally applicable to any model these are given in table 2 others are specific to the life cycle and parameterization under investigation these are presented in section 4 3 3 2 lifetime reproductive output lifetime reproductive output depends on both fertility and mortality following the dependencies illustrated in fig 1b we have the sensitivities of the between group variance v b to fertility and to mortality 40 d v b d f t group i d v b d m t d m d m t d m d vec t r 1 d vec r 1 d f t d f d f i t 41 d v b d μ t group i d v b d m t d m d m t d m d vec t u d vec u d vec t u d vec u d vec t u

vec u i d μ i t some of the derivatives of v w with respect to mortality are the same as in the case of longevity and given in table 2 some of the derivatives with respect to fertility are also determined only by the construction of the model and are generally applicable these are given in table 3 those derivatives in 40 43 that are specific to the life cycle and the model are given in the case study of section 5 4 case study heterogeneous frailty and variance in longevity to illustrate sensitivity analysis we analyze the components of the variance in longevity for an age classified population with latent heterogeneity groups that affect mortality we will call this latent variable frailty although it is not exactly frailty sensu vaupel and yashin 1985 and vaupel et al 1979 who used the term to describe a multiplicative hazard effect the analysis is based on data from an experimental population of the fruit fly anastrepha obliqua as described in vaupel et al 1998 that study reported daily mortality for 134 807 adult female flies in a search for latent unobserved heterogeneity hartemink and caswell 2018 fit a mixture of weibull survival functions to these data using the em algorithm aic methods identified a model with six heterogeneity groups each with a different set of weibull parameters and thus a different age schedule of mortality fig 2 shows the distributions of age at death for the six frailty groups and for the mixture of the six groups all analyses were performed in matlab code is available in the supplementary material the mean and variance of longevity were calculated using eqs 28 32 and are shown in fig 3 the first three frailty groups have higher mean longevity and especially groups 1 and 3 have high variance in longevity as well the mixing distribution of newly eclosed adult flies among frailty groups is was estimated as 44 π 0 06 0 20 0 20 0 16 0 24 0 14 t hartemink and caswell 2018 the variance components calculated from eqs 5 10 are e π η 18 9 v w 37 3 v b 109 4 v 146 6 k 0 746 that is 75 of the variance in longevity arises from heterogeneity in frailty between individuals with 25 of the variance due to individual stochasticity this is a large contribution of heterogeneity relative to other species hartemink and caswell 2018 which makes it an interesting example on which to perform sensitivity analysis the derivatives in eqs 38 and 39 that are specific to this case i e specific to an age classified life cycle longevity as the dependent variable mortality as the independent variable are as follows differentiating 29 with respect to n gives 45 d m d vec t n i g s 1 g s t differentiating 32 with respect to n gives 46 d v d vec t n 2 n t i g s 1 g s t i g s 1 g s t 2 i g s η 1 t 2 d η 1 i g s 1 g s t because the model is age classified u i is given by 47 u i y 1 s σ i t where y is a matrix with ones on the subdiagonal and zeros elsewhere and the survival vector σ i is 48 σ i e μ i differentiating 47 gives 49 d vec u i d μ i t d vec y i s 1 s d σ i the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 4 the left column shows the sensitivity of v w fig 4a v b fig 4c and k fig 4e to changes in age specific mortality within each group holding mortality in other groups constant these are the conditional derivatives in eqs 38 and 39 mortality in group 3 has a strong positive effect on v w and a strong negative effect on v b the effect on k is negative overall the effects of group specific mortality on k are qualitatively similar to the effects on v b both variance components are most sensitive to changes in mortality at early ages and practically insensitive to changes after age 20 with the exception of group 3 which happens to have the longest life expectancy 35 days compared to 19 days for a mixed cohort the sensitivities to changes in mortality that affect all frailty groups are shown in fig 4b d and f all else being equal an environment with higher overall mortality levels should show a lower fraction of variance in longevity due to heterogeneity but the details will depend on how heterogeneity affects the vital rates and the mixing of individuals among heterogeneity groups the response of v w to mortality at early ages is positive fig 4a the response becomes negative at late ages the boundary between early and late ages differs among groups the response of v b to changes in mortality is negative when the changes affect long lived frailty groups and positive when short lived frailty groups are affected fig 4c the pattern of group specific positive or negative responses of k to changing mortality is similar fig 4e 5 case study environmental stochasticity and variance in lifetime reproductive output the previous example considered the contribution of fixed heterogeneity to variance in longevity in an age classified population in this case study we consider the contribution of a dynamic form of heterogeneity to the variance in lifetime reproductive output lro in a stage classified plant population the heterogeneity in this case reflects the environment into which the individual is born subsequent environmental conditions fire in this case and their stochastic dynamics are incorporated into the individual states dynamic heterogeneity can have diverse effects on variance fixed heterogeneity leads to intra cohort selection removing the more frail individuals and reducing the eventual variance see caswell 2014 for an example dynamic movement among heterogeneity groups can counteract this loss of diversity however those dynamics also mix individuals among groups the lower the rate of mixing the longer individuals will experience the rates of the environment at the starting stage the higher the rate of mixing between groups in the limit independent and identically distributed transitions the less persistent will be the effects of environment at birth thus dynamic heterogeneity may either increase or reduce the component of variance due to heterogeneity lomatium bradshawii is an endangered perennial herb native to grasslands in oregon and washington l bradshawii is adapted to an environment with frequent fires reproductive output increases in years where fires take place caswell and kaye 2001 caswell 2011 caswell and kaye 2001 presented stage classified matrix models for l bradshawii in a stochastically varying fire environment the stages include a yearling class two classes of vegetative plants and three classes of reproductive plants differentiated by size here we use the fertility and survival data for one of the populations rose prairie to calculate the statistics and variance components of lifetime reproductive output for this species analyses were performed in matlab code is available in the supplementary material four environmental states were recognized a fire year one year since last fire two years since last fire and three or more years since the last fire the dynamics of the fire environment follow a markov chain with transition matrix 50 d r r r r 1 r 0 0 0 0 1 r 0 0 0 0 1 r 1 r where r is the fire frequency each of the four fire states has its own set of survival and fertility matrices the survival and transition matrix u is constructed as in eq 23 where d contains six copies of the environmental transition matrix d on the diagonal the transitions among life history stages u i differ among fire environments we calculate mean and variance in lifetime reproductive output according to eqs 33 37 the moments of lifetime reproductive output in eqs 34 and 35 depend on u and on the reward matrices r 1 and r 2 the reward matrices are constructed from environment specific fertility schedules define a vector f i containing the mean stage specific fertilities in environment i the multistate vector of fertilities is 51 where l i is the block construction matrix appearing in 22 as in 23 the vec permutation matrix k permutes the rows and columns so that the structure of f in 51 matches that of u we assume that rewards are obtained when individuals occupy a given state regardless of their next transition and that no rewards can be collected by individuals who are dead these assumptions give the mean reward matrix 52 where 53 z i 0 we obtain the matrix r 2 of second moments of rewards by assuming that individual reproduction follows a poisson distribution so that 54 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 1 see caswell 2011 and van daalen and caswell 2017 for discussion of other ways that r 2 could be obtained the statistics of lro depend on the fire frequency r fig 5 both mean and variance in lro increase with increasing fire frequency despite the strong effect of the fire environment on all the vital rates the intraclass correlation k is small for this model environmental heterogeneity contributes less than 0 5 of the variance in lro if we continue the analysis at r 0 49 a scenario roughly corresponding to the maximum contribution of heterogeneity the stochastic within environment component of the variance dominates e π ρ 1 5 v w 45 2 v b 0 2 v 45 4 k 0 004 for sensitivity analysis we keep the fire frequency set to r 0 49 the stable distribution of environments is given by the right eigenvector of the environmental matrix d in eq 50 this provides the mixing distribution as 55 π 0 49 0 25 0 13 0 13 t other possibilities for mixing distributions have been suggested by hernandez suarez et al 2012 the sensitivities of lifetime reproductive output to changes in mortality and fertility within each group i e each environment are calculated using eqs 40 43 following the dependencies shown in fig 1b we first investigate the sensitivity of the variance components to fertility most of the derivatives are once again independent of the life cycle structure and the dependent and independent variables of interest these are collected in table 3 differentiating 36 with respect to f gives 56 d m d f t n t 1 g s 1 z k 1 d vec p d vec r 1 d f t differentiating 37 with respect to f gives 57 d v d f t n t 1 g s 1 z k 1 d vec p d vec r 2 d f t 2 ρ 1 t i k 2 d vec u z z d vec r 1 d f t 2 u r ˆ 1 t d m d f t 2 d ρ 1 d m d f t where k 1 and k 2 are vec permutation matrices magnus and neudecker 1979 58 k 1 k g s 1 g s 1 59 k 2 k g s g s the steps required to obtain 56 and 57 are presented in van daalen and caswell 2017 and in the supplementary material the sensitivities of v w v b and k to fertility are shown in fig 6 the sensitivities of the within group variance v w to fertility fig 6a and b increase with stage up to stage 5 this pattern holds whether fertility is changed within one environment fig 6a or in all environments fig 6b the between group variance v b is most sensitive to fertility in stage 1 fig 6c with an increase in fertility in a fire year raising v b whereas in the non fire years it lowers v b in later stages fertility has only small positive or negative effects on the between group variance depending on the environment when fertility is increased in all environments v b increases fig 6d the net effect of increasing fertility in stage 1 is zero because it increases lro equally in every environment as there is no chance of dying differentially before entering stage 1 therefore the difference among groups does not change the intraclass correlation k is most sensitive to fertility in stage 1 whether the response is positive or negative depends on the stage environment combination fig 6e as is always the case sensitivity analysis happily reports the results of changes that are hypothetical in this case some changes in fertility are impossible as for example stage 1 is a pre reproductive stage and increasing fertility at that stage is an interesting thought experiment rather than a potential biological reality at the final three stages where reproduction takes place the effect of changing fertility is far greater for v w than v b but the fraction of variance due to heterogeneity does not change greatly lifetime reproductive output depends on mortality as well as fertility the sensitivities of the variance components to mortality are given in eqs

and caswell 2017 and in the supplementary material the sensitivities of v w v b and k to mortality are shown in fig 7 increasing mortality in any environment reduces the within group variance v w fig 7a the effects on v b and k depend on the stage environment combination but the effects are small figs 7c and e increasing mortality in a fire year decreases v b as does increasing mortality in stages 4 and 5 when mortality increases in all environments both v w fig 7b and v b fig 7d are reduced the effects on k are small and mostly negative fig 7f 6 discussion variance components are central to the discussion of the relative contribution of heterogeneity and stochasticity to life history outcomes heterogeneity differences among individuals that lead to differences in the vital rates they experience is expressed as variance between groups individual stochasticity differences in outcome among individuals experiencing the same rates appears as variance within groups the important question is how much each of these sources contributes to the variance the results in sections 2 4 and 3 provide a flexible method for decomposing variance applicable across life history outcomes types of heterogeneity life cycles sets of vital rates and mixing distributions this flexibility is a consequence of formulating the life cycle as a multistate matrix model caswell et al 2018 the within group and between group components of variance depend on the life cycle as in other parts of demography sensitivity analysis is useful to explore this dependence caswell 2019b we present a method for the sensitivity analysis of the variance components to life history parameters and illustrate the approach with two examples variance in longevity due to heterogeneous frailty in a fruit fly and variance in lifetime reproductive output due to environmental conditions in an herbaceous plant in a stochastic fire environment the fraction of variance explained by heterogeneity differs between these two examples in the fruit fly 75 of the variance in longevity is due to heterogeneity in initial frailty in l bradshawii only 0 4 of the variance in lro is due to heterogeneity in initial environmental conditions both examples are extreme compared to previous studies but in different directions about 5 10 of the variance in longevity is due to frailty in humans hartemink et al 2017 about 5 is due to socio economic heterogeneity in humans seaman et al 2019 a median of 35 is due to frailty in laboratory insect populations hartemink and caswell 2018 and about 6 due to unobserved heterogeneity in the southern fulmar jenouvrier et al 2018 studies of lifetime reproductive output have reported contributions of 22 due to unobserved heterogeneity in southern fulmars jenouvrier et al 2018 and 39 due to quality in kittiwakes snyder and ellner 2018 snyder and ellner 2018 show that for some analytical models incorporating stochasticity and heterogeneity stochasticity determines a substantial fraction of the variation even as they vary the values for survival and fertility in addition they show that increasing variability in survival and fertility generally increased the contribution of stochasticity the sensitivity results for the two examples analyzed here partly agree with their result with the added benefit of disentangling at which ages or stages and which heterogeneity groups within and between group variances are most sensitive to fertility and mortality in the fruit fly example the sensitivity of v w to mortality is positive up to some critical age the sensitivity of v b is negative at these ages intuitively leading to a decrease in k with increasing mortality however if mortality at early ages increased only for the most frail groups of fruit flies the result would be an increase in k in the case of lro in l bradshawii the sensitivity of both variance components to fertility is positive and to mortality is negative although k is a simple function of v b and v w the sensitivity of k is not necessarily a simple result of the sensitivities for the variance components the lomatium example illustrates this although sensitivity of k in this case is always small the sensitivity patterns the direction and magnitude of the sensitivities of the variance components and k differ between the two examples the fact that in the fruit fly increasing mortality changes the within group and between group components of variance in opposite directions suggests some kind of trade off but this is not observed in the example for lomatium whether this difference is a result of the structure of the models the type of heterogeneity the choice in mixing distribution or the demographic outcome under investigation is a question that can only be answered by additional analyses more studies of variance components of different species across the tree of life would be indispensable in the search for broad patterns the mixing distribution π is a key ingredient in variance decomposition because it defines the initial distribution of individuals among heterogeneity groups we have treated it as a fixed parameter a useful extension would be to include the sensitivity of demographic outcomes to π in the analysis we expect that its relative influence would vary with the type of heterogeneity the term heterogeneity applies to a wide range of types of differences among individuals in this paper we included an example in which an unobserved internal fixed set of differences frailty in the broad sense affected the mortality schedule see table 1 we also analyzed an example in which the heterogeneity is an observed external and dynamic set of differences due to the fire environment the differences between the vital rates in the fire environments are substantial yet the between group variance component is very small this reflects the dynamic rather than fixed nature of the fire environment individuals starting life in one environment experience the other environments decreasing the contribution of the differences in initial environment over the lifetime whether this is a general result for dynamic heterogeneity is a question that can only be answered with additional studies additional examples of dynamic heterogeneity and environmental differences but also different kinds of fixed heterogeneity and dynamic sequential heterogeneity groups will be valuable to elucidate how heterogeneity contributes to the variance in life history outcomes many studies include the effects of certain covariates on vital rate estimates these covariates if incorporated into a demographic model might provide the heterogeneity information required for variance analysis life history outcomes are often highly variable among individuals especially for fitness components such as lifetime reproductive output it is important to account for variance due to individual stochasticity on which selection cannot act steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 van daalen and caswell 2019 indeed individual stochasticity might slow selection by obscuring variance due to genetic heterogeneity steiner and tuljapurkar 2012 sensitivity analysis of the variance components to the vital rates is a necessary tool to identify the contributions of heterogeneity and stochasticity to life history outcomes acknowledgments this
