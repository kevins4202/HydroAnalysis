spivey et al 2004 some of the eoss are accurate over the specified domain of application and are able to predict phase equilibria in aquatic systems however all of the eoss have some constraints they are valid over a limited range of pressure and salt concentrations or suffer from intolerable deficiencies for instance the eos proposed by duan et al 1992a which has been frequently used for geochemichal applications is more efficient for predicting p v t properties of methane under high pressures duan et al 2011 furthermore the complex eoss usually depend on various parameters and do not

the derived conclusions numerical simulations of coupled problems in the subsurface such as multi phase flow and reactive transport of methane in porous media are computationally costly in particular where a large scale domain is considered the calculation of eos usually contributes a significant portion of the overall computational cost because compositions of liquid and gas phases must be estimated at each iteration therefore due to the high computational time an efficient application of complex eoss in numerical simulation of coupled processes is laborious grunwald et al 2020 machine learning ml has been successfully applied for a wide range of problems in the field of geoscience and engineering ranaee et al 2021 2018 including gas solubility predictions baghban et al 2015 menad

reliability the proposed model is evaluated by using the leverage statistical method 2 materials and methods 2 1 data preparation a ml algorithm learns from so called training data during the development process and thus the quality of the predictive model is directly correlated with the quality of the training dataset hutter et al 2019 a literature review was conducted to build a dataset from published experimental data methane solubility in pure water and brine has been reported over a broad range of pressure temperature and nacl concentrations clever and young 1987 but only a few measurements have been conducted for aqueous solutions with other salts such as cacl2 kcl and mgcl2 byrne and stoessell 1982 kiepe et al 2003 furthermore the experimental data in some cases contains inconsistencies or errors barta and bradley 1985 drummond 1981 for instance methane solubilities in pure water reported by michels et al 1936 are inconsistent with most of the datasets following duan et al 1992a the compiled data were reviewed to omit any inconsistencies methane solubility data have been expressed in many different units such as mole fraction bunsen coefficient and henry s law constant amirijafari and campbell 1972 cramer 1984 kiepe et al 2003 lannung et al 1960 the complied solubility data were mostly reported in mole fraction the mole fraction of the gas component in the liquid phase and thus the remaining data were converted to mole fraction using appropriate conversion factors where feasible to avoid conversion the solubility data were taken from clever and young 1987 the compiled data are presented in table 1 where 1 denotes that the partial pressure of methane is 1 atm the input dataset included pressure temperature and concentrations of dissociated ions of the salts nacl kcl mgcl2 cacl2 k2so4 mgso4 and na2so4 in aqueous solutions while the corresponding magnitude of methane solubility was considered as the target output the input dataset contains 1478 data points the spans of input parameter values are summarized in table 2 the distribution of each parameter in the dataset is shown in fig 1 it can be observed that the distribution of pressure is more continuous than temperature and salt concentrations using k fold cross validation the dataset was randomly divided into k groups of roughly equal size then k 1 groups of the dataset were used to train models and the remaining group was used to validate the models therefore each data sample has the opportunity to train and validate models stone 1974 in this study 5 fold cross validation k 5 was used before training data were normalized and all variables were linearly scaled to the interval 1 1 2 2 machine learning algorithms in this section each employed machine learning algorithm is briefly described a detailed explanation of mathematical backgrounds and computational procedures can be found in the cited literature matlab 2020b software was used to develop and train ml models 2 2 1 regression tree regression trees rt are well established techniques that have been used for building prediction models from a large dataset loh 2011 the advantages of rt over classical parametric regression methods are i great flexibility to model higher order non linearity ii powerful variable subset selection iii insensitivity to outliers in the covariate space and iv easy implementation on different types of data structures leblanc 2006 in addition rts are able to fit almost every kind of traditional statistical models such as least squares and logistic loh 2014 despite the advantages regression trees are also known for their instability breiman 1996 loh 2011 regression trees are hierarchical models consisting of a root branches and leaves with the root of the tree at the top representing the input dataset and leaves at the bottom representing the output cichsz 2015 saha et al 2015 the building procedure involves splitting the root node into two child nodes based on the value of an independent variable which maximizes the homogeneity of child nodes this binary process continues by applying the same splitting rule recursively until the stopping criteria are met ikonomovska et al 2011 saha et al 2015 the splitting rules are in the internal nodes and the predictions are in the leaf nodes ikonomovska et al 2011 to estimate the target value at a leaf node the tree uses the average value of the training data associated with that leaf node loh 2011 saha et al 2015 2 2 2 boosted regression tree boosted regression tree brt is an ensemble of two powerful algorithms boosting and regression trees elith et al 2008 this algorithm incorporates important advantages of tree algorithms handling predictor variables of various types and accommodating missing values based on surrogate splitting boosting combines multiple trees in a sequential process to improve the predictive performance that could be obtained from a single tree the idea is to put emphasis on observations that are modeled poorly i e observations with high deviation from the mean in existing trees until the lowest predictive deviance is reached buhlmann and hothorn 2007 saha et al 2015 the poor productive performance of regression trees has been overcome by the boosting algorithm elith et al 2008 brt uses a forward stage wise procedure meaning that existing trees remain unchanged at each iteration a new tree is trained using the original features and is added to the current sequence of trees the residuals of each observation are then updated to represent the contribution of the newly added tree once the process is completed the final predictions are determined by the weighted sum between each tree s predictions de ath 2007 döpke et al 2017 saha et al 2015 friedman 2001 introduced gradient boosting to minimize the specified loss function this optimization technique applies the method of steepest descent to forward stage wise estimation later friedman 2002 modified the gradient boosting procedure with random subsampling of the training data to enhance the prediction performance and lower the risk of overfitting as well as computation time de ath 2007 2 2 3 support vector machine the support vector machine svm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier developed according to the structural risk minimization and statistical learning svms utilize a supervised learning process to generate input output mapping functions from the input data evgeniou and pontil 2001 raghavendra 2014 svms transform the input data into a high dimensional feature space using nonlinear kernel functions and fit a linear function with the least reasonable complexity to the feature space this feature allows the algorithm to predict well since their emergence in the late 1990s vapnik 1998 svms have been applied to a broad range of engineering problems and have the well known ability for modeling highly nonlinear and complex systems with desired degree of accuracy evgeniou and pontil 2001 to reduce the likelihood of overfitting suykens et al 2002 and suykens and vandewalle 2000 implemented significant modifications to the standard svm to overcome the drawbacks related to computational efficiency the least squares support vector machine lssvm benefits from solving a linear system of equations and therefore is more practical for high dimensional learning tasks the lssvm uses easier to use calculation approaches and quicker solution searches while drawing parallel with the standard svm the lssvm has excellent generalization capability even where using small input data in a multi dimensional domain suykens et al 2002 suykens and vandewalle 2000 further advantages of this method are simple modeling procedure and ability to predict the nonlinear input output relationship 2 2 4 gaussian process regression gaussian process regression gpr is a class of non parametric kernel based probabilistic models and has been widely employed for predictive modeling gpr generalizes multivariate normal distributions in the infinite dimensional space and thus is defined in the distribution over functional values rasmussen 2004 williams and rasmussen 1995 gpr is able to seamlessly integrate various machine learning tasks such as hyper parameter estimation and model training thereby the regression process is simplified and results are less affected by subjectivity rasmussen 2004 sun et al 2014 the advantages of gpr models are i the suitability for relatively small datasets ii the capability of fitting a highly non linear function and iii the ability to provide uncertainty measurements over the predictions seeger 2004 the gpr s predictive performance relies strongly on the appropriate selection of the covariance function or kernel which describes the structure of the target function the gpr has the advantage of being flexible in choosing the kernel which can be selected based on assumptions such as smoothness and existing patterns in the data schulz et al 2018 seeger 2004 williams and rasmussen 2006 in gpr the commonly used kernels are squared exponential kernel rational quadratic kernel and matérn kernels the squared exponential is the most widely used kernel within the kernel machines field williams and rasmussen 2006 and is employed in the implementation of gpr algorithm 2 3 model optimization to fit a balanced model user defined parameters i e hyper parameters need to be optimized for instance the maximum number of splits for the brt model or the box constraint of the lssvm require tuning hyper parameter values can strongly affect the model performance and thus selecting incorrect values may lead to erroneous and even deceptive outcomes hutter et al 2019 yet finding optimal hyper parameter values directly is usually an expensive and challenging task it is necessary to employ a suitable optimization scheme to minimize the model error the widely used techniques for hyper parameters tuning in machine learning problems are grid search gs random search rs and bayesian optimization bo hutter et al 2019 yang and shami 2020 grid search is one of the standard methods that attempt to find the optimum values by searching exhaustively through a specified subset of the hyper parameter space of the targeted algorithm random search randomly selects the combinations of hyper parameter values instead of the exhaustive enumeration of all combinations bergstra et al 2011 bergstra and bengio 2012 bayesian optimization is a powerful and flexible approach that uses the bayesian theorem in bo an acquisition function must be chosen which is used for constructing a utility function from the model posterior to direct sampling to areas where improvement over the current optimum can be expected bergstra et al 2011 hutter et al 2019 three acquisition functions including expected improvements probability of improvement and lower confidence bound were tested for the bayesian optimization 2 4 equations of state equations of state eoss are widely used for modeling the phase equilibria of fluids in the past decades rapid advancements have been made in developing correlations and thermodynamic paradigms for the accurate estimation of methane solubility in aquatic systems however all the developed models have limited applicability domains and fail to accurately reproduce the desired experimental values duan and mao 2006 for instance the duan et al 1992a model is more efficient in predicting p v t properties of methane for pressures larger than 100 mpa but faces difficulties for low pressure systems duan et al 2011 the duan and mao 2006 model can be written as follows 1 ln m ch 4 ln y ch 4 φ ch 4 p μ ch 4 l 0 rt 2 λ ch 4 na m na m k 2 m ca 2 2 m mg 2 ζ ch 4 na cl m na m k 2 m ca 2 2 m mg 2 m cl 2 m so 4 2 4 λ ch 4 so 4 2 m so 4 2 where m ch4 is the methane solubility in the liquid phase y ch4 and φ ch4 are the mole fraction and the fugacity coefficient of ch4 in the gas phase t k is temperature p bar is pressure and r bar cm3 mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant μ ch4 l 0 is the chemical potential of ch4 in the liuid phase λ ch4 na and ζ ch4 na cl are interaction parameters and m mol kg 1 is the salt concentration λ ch4 so42 is 0 0332 the spivey et al 2004 model can be described as 2 c m ch 4 h 2 o exp a t ln p p ν 2 b t ln p p ν c t 3 c m ch 4 brine c m ch 4 h 2 o exp 2 λ ch 4 na t p c m nacl ζ ch 4 nacl t p c m nacl 2 where c m ch4 h2o and c m ch4 brine are the methane solubility in pure water and brine respectively t k is temperature p mpa is pressure and p ν mpa is the vapour pressure of pure water a t b t and c t are temperature dependent functions λ ch4 na t p and ζ ch4 nacl t p are coefficients and c m nacl mol kg 1 is the salt concentration 2 5 evaluation indices the performance of the developed models is evaluated based on comparison between the predicted and experimental values ranaee et al 2016 taherdangkoo et al 2020b we used evaluation indices i e the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error mse and mean absolute deviation mad the value of r2 is a fraction between 0 and 1 and has no units when r2 equals 1 the data should lie precisely on a line with no scatter this demonstrates a perfectly fitted model the mse and mad are measured on the same scale and the values should approach zero to fit a model these indices are calculated by the following equations 4 r 2 1 y e y p 2 y e y e 2 5 mse y e y p 2 n 6 mad y e y p n which y e and y p represent the experimental and predicted values respectively y e represents the average of experimental values and n equals the number of values 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of hyper parameters to optimize the hyper parameters of rt brt gpr and lssvm models grid search random search and bayesian optimization algorithms were executed three acquisition functions i e expected improvements probability of improvement and lower confidence bound were employed for the implementation of the bo algorithm the goal of optimization in general is to find an iteration that minimizes the loss function i e the minimum squared error each iteration corresponds to a set of hyper parameter values for the sake of comparison the iteration number for running bo and rs algorithms was fixed to 30 this value was chosen as no improvements after 30 iterations were observed the number of grid divisions for gs algorithm was set to 15 four ml model are coupled with gs rs and bo optimization algorithms among all possible combinations the optimal models are rt bo brt bo lssvm bo and gpr gs the expected improvement is selected as the acquisition function for the implementation of the rt bo and lssvm bo models while the lower confidence bound is the acquisition function used for the brt bo model since this study focuses on evaluating the performance of ml models for methane solubility prediction only outcomes of the optimal models are presented table 3 summarizes the optimum hyper parameter values of ml models 3 2 prediction of methane solubility the rt bo brt bo lssvm bo and gpr gs models were employed for the prediction of methane solubility in aqueous solutions the input variables were pressure temperature and concentrations of nacl kcl mgcl2 cacl2 k2so4 mgso4 and na2so4 while the solubility of methane in terms of mole fraction was considered as output the performance of ml models was evaluated based on r2 mse and mad criteria once the optimum hyper parameters are determined the randomly selected testing data were employed to evaluate the performance of ml models we used 5 fold cross validation to split the input dataset into two subsets training data and testing data the regression plots of the predicted methane solubility values from rt bo brt bo lssvm bo and gpr gs versus experimental values are depicted in fig 2 for four ml models the predicted and experimental values lie close to the 45 degree reference line in black illustrating their high prediction ability the statistical indices are summarized in table 4 r2 values higher than 0 9 usually indicate a strong correlation between predicted and experimental data deepened analyses of the statistical indices confirms the high predictive performances of four ml models r2 values equal or higher than 0 95 and mse and mad values close to zero among the others the lssvm model has the lowest predictive quality with having r2 and mse values equal to 0 95 and 4 28 10 7 respectively the deviation of the lssvm predicted results from the reference line further indicates the difference between predicted values and experimental ones based on table 4 and fig 2 the brt bo model outperforms the other ml models with the highest value of r2 and lowest values of mse and mad the r2 value equals 0 99 and mse and mad values are 1 19 10 7 and 1 92 10 4 respectively the quality of the brt bo predictions is further illustrated in fig 3 with experimental data points and predicted values covering each other indicating a prediction with minimum error the outputs of the brt bo model show perfect agreement with the experimental values it can be underlined that the developed ml models for predicting methane solubility in aquatic systems follow the accuracy ranking shown below brt bo gpr gs rt bo lssvm bo 3 3 comparing the brt bo model with equations of state the predictive ability of the brt bo model is compared with equations of state the detailed comparison analysis is summarized in table 5 for a better visual comparison mse and r2 bar plots are depicted in fig 4 the brt bo model results in the highest r2 value and the lowest mse and mad values the spivey model has a higher performance compared to the duan model however the spivey model is only valid for the aqueous nacl solutions and 1226 data points were used for testing its performace the statistical indices presented in table 5 and the graphical comparison shown in fig 4 indicate that the brt bo outperforms the spivey and duan models in predicting solubility of methane in aquatic systems over the range of pressure temperature and salt concentrations reported in this study 3 4 applicability domain of the brt bo model the precision of the input data strongly effect the prediction capability of ml models the leverage statistical approach was used to evaluate the accuracy of the compiled dataset and identify the application realm of the brt bo model a detailed description and computational procedure of the leverage approach can be found in mohammadi et al 2012 and shafiei et al 2014 the williams plot is displayed in fig 5 for the results using the brt bo model the standardized residual is plotted versus the hat value the reliable zone is bounded by the standardized residual sr indexes in red and the critical leverage limit h shown in green it is clear that the majority of the solubility data fall in the range of 3 sr 3 and 0 h 0 0039 expressing the high reliability and statistical validity of the brt bo model the figure shows that 65 data points are outliers from the applicability domain of the brt bo model corresponding to 4 4 of the input dataset the analysis shows that the outliers are from the dataset reported by blount and price 1982 the results indicate that the brt bo model could efficiently identify the existing patterns in the input data to predict the unseen values accurately one of the key advantages of the developed brt bo is its ability to cover a broad range of pressure temperature and salt concentrations for which the model trained other models suggested in the literature such as those employed here encounter limitations with respect to ranges of pressure and type of species it can be claimed that the performance of the proposed model is higher than that of the other correlations the brt bo is accurate and relatively easy to use comparing to complicated eoss making it a suitable tool for further application in higher level modeling 4 conclusions numerical modeling of methane migration between a deep hydrocarbon reservoir and shallow groundwater is complex because it involves complicated hydrogeological conditions and multiphase flow and transport processes an accurate methane solubility prediction framework is required for numerical modeling of methane and aqueous phase flow this research employs machine learning models for predicting methane solubility in pure water and mixed aquatic systems containing na k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 the compiled dataset includes experimental data covering a widespread range of pressure temperature and salt concentrations we implemented evaluated and compared four ml algorithms i e boosted regression tree regression tree support vector machine and gaussian process regression for optimizing hyper parameters of the ml models grid search random search and bayesian optimization algorithms were employed the predicted solubility data were compared with spivey et al 2004 and duan and mao 2006 equations of state the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 all four ml models provide satisfactory performance for the prediction of methane solubility in mixed aqueous systems 2 the brt bo model is identified the most accurate model for the task of methane solubility prediction r2 and mse values equal to 0 99 and 1 19 10 7 respectively 3 the brt bo model outperforms the examined eoss having higher prediction accuracy this demonstrates the potential of the brt bo model to be used as an alternative option to the more standard and typically employed eoss for predicting methane solubility 4 the application of leverage method confirmed the accuracy and statistical validation of the brt bo model and 4 4 of the data were outliers 5 having a high predictive accuracy the brt bo model can serve as a reliable tool for calculating the solubility of methane in marine and deep subsurface environments it has high potential to be applied in higher level modeling such as numerical modeling of methane migration from a leaky gas well towards shallow groundwater acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the editor charles werth and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and detailed comments that contributed to improve this work

regression methods are i great flexibility to model higher order non linearity ii powerful variable subset selection iii insensitivity to outliers in the covariate space and iv easy implementation on different types of data structures leblanc 2006 in addition rts are able to fit almost every kind of traditional statistical models such as least squares and logistic loh 2014 despite the advantages regression trees are also known for their instability breiman 1996 loh 2011 regression trees are hierarchical models consisting of a root branches and leaves with the root of the tree at the top representing the input dataset and leaves at the bottom representing the output cichsz 2015 saha et al 2015 the building procedure involves splitting the root node into two child nodes based on the value of an independent variable which maximizes the homogeneity of child nodes this binary process continues by applying the same splitting rule recursively until the stopping criteria are met ikonomovska et al 2011 saha et al 2015 the splitting rules are in the internal nodes and the predictions are in the leaf nodes ikonomovska et al 2011 to estimate the target value at a leaf node the tree uses the average value of the training data associated with that leaf node loh 2011 saha et al 2015 2 2 2 boosted regression tree boosted regression tree brt is an ensemble of two powerful algorithms boosting and regression trees elith et al 2008 this algorithm incorporates important advantages of tree algorithms handling predictor variables of various types and accommodating missing values based on surrogate splitting boosting combines multiple trees in a sequential process to improve the predictive performance that could be obtained from a single tree the idea is to put emphasis on observations that are modeled poorly i e observations with high deviation from the mean in existing trees until the lowest predictive deviance is reached buhlmann and hothorn 2007 saha et al 2015 the poor productive performance of regression trees has been overcome by the boosting algorithm elith et al 2008 brt uses a forward stage wise procedure meaning that existing trees remain unchanged at each iteration a new tree is trained using the original features and is added to the current sequence of trees the residuals of each observation are then updated to represent the contribution of the newly added tree once the process is completed the final predictions are determined by the weighted sum between each tree s predictions de ath 2007 döpke et al 2017 saha et al 2015 friedman 2001 introduced gradient boosting to minimize the specified loss function this optimization technique applies the method of steepest descent to forward stage wise estimation later friedman 2002 modified the gradient boosting procedure with random subsampling of the training data to enhance the prediction performance and lower the risk of overfitting as well as computation time de ath 2007 2 2 3 support vector machine the support vector machine svm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier developed according to the structural risk minimization and statistical learning svms utilize a supervised learning process to generate input output mapping functions from the input data evgeniou and pontil 2001 raghavendra 2014 svms transform the input data into a high dimensional feature space using nonlinear kernel functions and fit a linear function with the least reasonable complexity to the feature space this feature allows the algorithm to predict well since their emergence in the late 1990s vapnik 1998 svms have been applied to a broad range of engineering problems and have the well known ability for modeling highly nonlinear and complex systems with desired degree of accuracy evgeniou and pontil 2001 to reduce the likelihood of overfitting suykens et al 2002 and suykens and vandewalle 2000 implemented significant modifications to the standard svm to overcome the drawbacks related to computational efficiency the least squares support vector machine lssvm benefits from solving a linear system of equations and therefore is more practical for high dimensional learning tasks the lssvm uses easier to use calculation approaches and quicker solution searches while drawing parallel with the standard svm the lssvm has excellent generalization capability even where using small input data in a multi dimensional domain suykens et al 2002 suykens and vandewalle 2000 further advantages of this method are simple modeling procedure and ability to predict the nonlinear input output relationship 2 2 4 gaussian process regression gaussian process regression gpr is a class of non parametric kernel based probabilistic models and has been widely employed for predictive modeling gpr generalizes multivariate normal distributions in the infinite dimensional space and thus is defined in the distribution over functional values rasmussen 2004 williams and rasmussen 1995 gpr is able to seamlessly integrate various machine learning tasks such as hyper parameter estimation and model training thereby the regression process is simplified and results are less affected by subjectivity rasmussen 2004 sun et al 2014 the advantages of gpr models are i the suitability for relatively small datasets ii the capability of fitting a highly non linear function and iii the ability to provide uncertainty measurements over the predictions seeger 2004 the gpr s predictive performance relies strongly on the appropriate selection of the covariance function or kernel which describes the structure of the target function the gpr has the advantage of being flexible in choosing the kernel which can be selected based on assumptions such as smoothness and existing patterns in the data schulz et al 2018 seeger 2004 williams and rasmussen 2006 in gpr the commonly used kernels are squared exponential kernel rational quadratic kernel and matérn kernels the squared exponential is the most widely used kernel within the kernel machines field williams and rasmussen 2006 and is employed in the implementation of gpr algorithm 2 3 model optimization to fit a balanced model user defined parameters i e hyper parameters need to be optimized for instance the maximum number of splits for the brt model or the box constraint of the lssvm require tuning hyper parameter values can strongly affect the model performance and thus selecting incorrect values may lead to erroneous and even deceptive outcomes hutter et al 2019 yet finding optimal hyper parameter values directly is usually an expensive and challenging task it is necessary to employ a suitable optimization scheme to minimize the model error the widely used techniques for hyper parameters tuning in machine learning problems are grid search gs random search rs and bayesian optimization bo hutter et al 2019 yang and shami 2020 grid search is one of the standard methods that attempt to find the optimum values by searching exhaustively through a specified subset of the hyper parameter space of the targeted algorithm random search randomly selects the combinations of hyper parameter values instead of the exhaustive enumeration of all combinations bergstra et al 2011 bergstra and bengio 2012 bayesian optimization is a powerful and flexible approach that uses the bayesian theorem in bo an acquisition function must be chosen which is used for constructing a utility function from the model posterior to direct sampling to areas where improvement over the current optimum can be expected bergstra et al 2011 hutter et al 2019 three acquisition functions including expected improvements probability of improvement and lower confidence bound were tested for the bayesian optimization 2 4 equations of state equations of state eoss are widely used for modeling the phase equilibria of fluids in the past decades rapid advancements have been made in developing correlations and thermodynamic paradigms for the accurate estimation of methane solubility in aquatic systems however all the developed models have limited applicability domains and fail to accurately reproduce the desired experimental values duan and mao 2006 for instance the duan et al 1992a model is more efficient in predicting p v t properties of methane for pressures larger than 100 mpa but faces difficulties for low pressure systems duan et al 2011 the duan and mao 2006 model can be written as follows 1 ln m ch 4 ln y ch 4 φ ch 4 p μ ch 4 l 0 rt 2 λ ch 4 na m na m k 2 m ca 2 2 m mg 2 ζ ch 4 na cl m na m k 2 m ca 2 2 m mg 2 m cl 2 m so 4 2 4 λ ch 4 so 4 2 m so 4 2 where m ch4 is the methane solubility in the liquid phase y ch4 and φ ch4 are the mole fraction and the fugacity coefficient of ch4 in the gas phase t k is temperature p bar is pressure and r bar cm3 mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant μ ch4 l 0 is the chemical potential of ch4 in the liuid phase λ ch4 na and ζ ch4 na cl are interaction parameters and m mol kg 1 is the salt concentration λ ch4 so42 is 0 0332 the spivey et al 2004 model can be described as 2 c m ch 4 h 2 o exp a t ln p p ν 2 b t ln p p ν c t 3 c m ch 4 brine c m ch 4 h 2 o exp 2 λ ch 4 na t p c m nacl ζ ch 4 nacl t p c m nacl 2 where c m ch4 h2o and c m ch4 brine are the methane solubility in pure water and brine respectively t k is temperature p mpa is pressure and p ν mpa is the vapour pressure of pure water a t b t and c t are temperature dependent functions λ ch4 na t p and ζ ch4 nacl t p are coefficients and c m nacl mol kg 1 is the salt concentration 2 5 evaluation indices the performance of the developed models is evaluated based on comparison between the predicted and experimental values ranaee et al 2016 taherdangkoo et al 2020b we used evaluation indices i e the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error mse and mean absolute deviation mad the value of r2 is a fraction between 0 and 1 and has no units when r2 equals 1 the data should lie precisely on a line with no scatter this demonstrates a perfectly fitted model the mse and mad are measured on the same scale and the values should approach zero to fit a model these indices are calculated by the following equations 4 r 2 1 y e y p 2 y e y e 2 5 mse y e y p 2 n 6 mad y e y p n which y e and y p represent the experimental and predicted values respectively y e represents the average of experimental values and n equals the number of values 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of hyper parameters to optimize the hyper parameters of rt brt gpr and lssvm models grid search random search and bayesian optimization algorithms were executed three acquisition functions i e expected improvements probability of improvement and lower confidence bound were employed for the implementation of the bo algorithm the goal of optimization in general is to find an iteration that minimizes the loss function i e the minimum squared error each iteration corresponds to a set of hyper parameter values for the sake of comparison the iteration number for running bo and rs algorithms was fixed to 30 this value was chosen as no improvements after 30 iterations were observed the number of grid divisions for gs algorithm was set to 15 four ml model are coupled with gs rs and bo optimization algorithms among all possible combinations the optimal models are rt bo brt bo lssvm bo and gpr gs the expected improvement is selected as the acquisition function for the implementation of the rt bo and lssvm bo models while the lower confidence bound is the acquisition function used for the brt bo model since this study focuses on evaluating the performance of ml models for methane solubility prediction only outcomes of the optimal models are presented table 3 summarizes the optimum hyper parameter values of ml models 3 2 prediction of methane solubility the rt bo brt bo lssvm bo and gpr gs models were employed for the prediction of methane solubility in aqueous solutions the input variables were pressure temperature and concentrations of nacl kcl mgcl2 cacl2 k2so4 mgso4 and na2so4 while the solubility of methane in terms of mole fraction was considered as output the performance of ml models was evaluated based on r2 mse and mad criteria once the optimum hyper parameters are determined the randomly selected testing data were employed to evaluate the performance of ml models we used 5 fold cross validation to split the input dataset into two subsets training data and testing data the regression plots of the predicted methane solubility values from rt bo brt bo lssvm bo and gpr gs versus experimental values are depicted in fig 2 for four ml models the predicted and experimental values lie close to the 45 degree reference line in black illustrating their high prediction ability the statistical indices are summarized in table 4 r2 values higher than 0 9 usually indicate a strong correlation between predicted and experimental data deepened analyses of the statistical indices confirms the high predictive performances of four ml models r2 values equal or higher than 0 95 and mse and mad values close to zero among the others the lssvm model has the lowest predictive quality with having r2 and mse values equal to 0 95 and 4 28 10 7 respectively the deviation of the lssvm predicted results from the reference line further indicates the difference between predicted values and experimental ones based on table 4 and fig 2 the brt bo model outperforms the other ml models with the highest value of r2 and lowest values of mse and mad the r2 value equals 0 99 and mse and mad values are 1 19 10 7 and 1 92 10 4 respectively the quality of the brt bo predictions is further illustrated in fig 3 with experimental data points and predicted values covering each other indicating a prediction with minimum error the outputs of the brt bo model show perfect agreement with the experimental values it can be underlined that the developed ml models for predicting methane solubility in aquatic systems follow the accuracy ranking shown below brt bo gpr gs rt bo lssvm bo 3 3 comparing the brt bo model with equations of state the predictive ability of the brt bo model is compared with equations of state the detailed comparison analysis is summarized in table 5 for a better visual comparison mse and r2 bar plots are depicted in fig 4 the brt bo model results in the highest r2 value and the lowest mse and mad values the spivey model has a higher performance compared to the duan model however the spivey model is only valid for the aqueous nacl solutions and 1226 data points were used for testing its performace the statistical indices presented in table 5 and the graphical comparison shown in fig 4 indicate that the brt bo outperforms the spivey and duan models in predicting solubility of methane in aquatic systems over the range of pressure temperature and salt concentrations reported in this study 3 4 applicability domain of the brt bo model the precision of the input data strongly effect the prediction capability of ml models the leverage statistical approach was used to evaluate the accuracy of the compiled dataset and identify the application realm of the brt bo model a detailed description and computational procedure of the leverage approach can be found in mohammadi et al 2012 and shafiei et al 2014 the williams plot is displayed in fig 5 for the results using the brt bo model the standardized residual is plotted versus the hat value the reliable zone is bounded by the standardized residual sr indexes in red and the critical leverage limit h shown in green it is clear that the majority of the solubility data fall in the range of 3 sr 3 and 0 h 0 0039 expressing the high reliability and statistical validity of the brt bo model the figure shows that 65 data points are outliers from the applicability domain of the brt bo model corresponding to 4 4 of the input dataset the analysis shows that the outliers are from the dataset reported by blount and price 1982 the results indicate that the brt bo model could efficiently identify the existing patterns in the input data to predict the unseen values accurately one of the key advantages of the developed brt bo is its ability to cover a broad range of pressure temperature and salt concentrations for which the model trained other models suggested in the literature such as those employed here encounter limitations with respect to ranges of pressure and type of species it can be claimed that the performance of the proposed model is higher than that of the other correlations the brt bo is accurate and relatively easy to use comparing to complicated eoss making it a suitable tool for further application in higher level modeling 4 conclusions numerical modeling of methane migration between a deep hydrocarbon reservoir and shallow groundwater is complex because it involves complicated hydrogeological conditions and multiphase flow and transport processes an accurate methane solubility prediction framework is required for numerical modeling of methane and aqueous phase flow this research employs machine learning models for predicting methane solubility in pure water and mixed aquatic systems containing na k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 the compiled dataset includes experimental data covering a widespread range of pressure temperature and salt concentrations we implemented evaluated and compared four ml algorithms i e boosted regression tree regression tree support vector machine and gaussian process regression for optimizing hyper parameters of the ml models grid search random search and bayesian optimization algorithms were employed the predicted solubility data were compared with spivey et al 2004 and duan and mao 2006 equations of state the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 all four ml models provide satisfactory performance for the prediction of methane solubility in mixed aqueous systems 2 the brt bo model is identified the most accurate model for the task of methane solubility prediction r2 and mse values equal to 0 99 and 1 19 10 7 respectively 3 the brt bo model outperforms the examined eoss having higher prediction accuracy this demonstrates the potential of the brt bo model to be used as an alternative option to the more standard and typically employed eoss for predicting methane solubility 4 the application of leverage method confirmed the accuracy and statistical validation of the brt bo model and 4 4 of the data were outliers 5 having a high predictive accuracy the brt bo model can serve as a reliable tool for calculating the solubility of methane in marine and deep subsurface environments it has high potential to be applied in higher level modeling such as numerical modeling of methane migration from a leaky gas well towards shallow groundwater acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the editor charles werth and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and detailed comments that contributed to improve this work 
1386,the processes impacting solute transport through unsaturated porous media have been receiving renewed attention due to their relevance to the transport of emerging contaminants a set of well monitored and highly controlled experiments in sand columns were conducted to determine the effect of partial saturation on conservative solute breakthrough in porous media the results suggest traditional transport parameter estimation methods inadequately account for the pore scale processes of mass transfer to the immobile zones and the effects of partial saturation on advective transport even for conservative tracers accurate estimation of these basic transport parameters is critical to evaluate the multi phase partitioning of nonconservative solutes as any errors in these parameters would bias the estimates of multi phase partitioning parameters herein we introduced the mass transfer index mti a semi empirical approach for quantifying the impact of non fickian elements of pore scale unsaturated solute transport i e immobile water tortuous flow paths and non uniform solute distribution which become increasingly important as the wetting fluid saturation decreases importantly this mti was determined independently of chemically driven phase partitioning and is supported by experimental data based on this conceptualization the 1 d equilibrium advection dispersion equation was modified to incorporate the mti as a lumped parameter which quantifies resistance to mti 1 or promotion of mti 1 of advective solute flux analytical solutions to the modified advection dispersion reaction equation for pulse and step inputs were developed conservative tracer experiments were conducted in variably saturated sand columns to validate both the mti conceptualization and the inversion method used to estimate the mti these experiments involved the use of x ray absorption spectroscopy integrated with sensor based measurements of soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity for tracer breakthrough the mathematical model developed herein adapts traditional macroscopic models of solute transport to account for the non fickian pore scale transport behaviors observed in unsaturated porous media with significant advective flux keywords unsaturated vadose zone non fickian fate and transport multi phase flow modelling 1 introduction vadose zone processes have received more attention due to emerging contaminants that likely exhibit multi phase retention processes in unsaturated soils brusseau 2020 2018 brusseau et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 houtz et al 2013 li et al 2018 lyu et al 2018 specifically poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass are widespread contaminants of concern in the environment in both saturated and unsaturated groundwater systems hatton et al 2018 houtz et al 2013 sepulvado et al 2011 sun et al 2016 these fluorinated surfactants can be sorbed at the air water interface present in vadose zone soils lyu et al 2018 saturated and unsaturated column experiments of pfass have used the traditional method of moments analysis of solute breakthrough to estimate the retardation of the contaminants brusseau et al 2019 brusseau and rao 1989 j valocchi 1990 leij et al 1991 leij and dane 1992 lyu et al 2018 van glubt et al 2021 wang et al 1998 yu et al 1999 while the method of moments is a simple and robust technique to estimate the retardation coefficient its use in unsaturated column studies ignores some key aspects of multi phase flow and transport in porous media namely the method of moments and standard parameter estimation methods do not explicitly account for the effect of non fickian transport that occur at the pore scale i e advective flow path tortuosity solute mass transfer into and out of immobile zones and non uniform solute distributions which become increasingly important as saturation decreases hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 persson et al 2005 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 explicitly accounting for these processes is important as there is increased interest in using the method of moments for quantifying multi phase retardation processes van glubt et al 2021 while the standard method of moments does not explicitly quantify the impact of non fickian phenomena it does implicitly account for non fickian processes because it uses the effective porosity technique for the calculation of pore volumes payne et al 2008 this means that while the traditional method of moments technique can provide accurate estimations of chemical sorption parameters it brushes over some elements of transport which become increasingly important as saturation decreases specifically the method of moments and effective porosity concepts do not consider increasingly non fickian nature of solute transport as saturation decreases the role of immobile water in soil pores and advective flow path tortuosity in the fate and transport of highly soluble compounds in the saturated and unsaturated subsurface has been conceptually and experimentally demonstrated bond and wierenga 1990 brusseau and rao 1989 clennell 1997 de smedt and wierenga 1984 hasan et al 2020 maraqa et al 1997 padilla et al 1999 van genuchten and wierenga 1977 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 successful models of unsaturated zone water flow and solute transport which consider mass transfer between immobile water and increasing diffusive flux tortuosity with decreasing saturation have been reported for applications in soil physics and subsurface contamination millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 penman 1940 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 of particular interest a recent study used x ray synchrotron microscopy to investigate pore scale processes and revealed the key role non fickian transport plays in advective transport under unsaturated conditions hasan et al 2020 these results confirmed observations from pore scale models developed by the same researchers hasan et al 2019 while this study is a recent effort which provides high resolution measurements of the impact of immobile water on solute transport in variably saturated media there are several past efforts which demonstrate the phenomena of non fickian transport in a similar fashion bromly and hinz 2004 cortis and berkowitz 2004 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 nützmann et al 2002 persson et al 2005 toride et al 2003 wierenga and van genuchten 1989 zoia et al 2010 some key observations of non fickian transport include asymmetrical breakthrough curves btcs increasing dispersion with decreasing saturation tailing in the btc plume arrival times which are not predicted using the darcy flux water content relationship and flow path channelization bond and wierenga 1990 bromly and hinz 2004 cortis and berkowitz 2004 de smedt and wierenga 1984 haga et al 1999 hagare et al 2008 kapetas et al 2014 nützmann et al 2002 padilla et al 1999 persson et al 2005 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 toride et al 2003 van genuchten and wierenga 1977 wierenga and van genuchten 1989 zoia et al 2010 these experimental observations of btcs are supported by various types of pore scale modelling and macroscopic modelling efforts berkowitz et al 2006 brusseau and rao 1989 gao et al 2010 hansen and berkowitz 2020 hasan et al 2019 mašín et al 2006 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 zoia et al 2010 currently there are some macroscopic models which have adapted the traditional advection dispersion equation ade to better model non fickian transport in unsaturated media specifically these models include the mobile immobile model mim van genuchten and wierenga 1976 the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt haggerty and gorelick 1995 the fractional advection dispersion equation model f ade benson et al 2000 the stochastic convection model sposito et al 1986 and continuous time random walk ctrw models berkowitz et al 2006 while these models have successfully demonstrated the ability to capture processes characteristic of non fickian transport i e btc tailing and btc asymmetry there are two drawbacks to all of these models first all of these models are much more complex than the standard ade model requiring extensive training and skill to implement second none of these models explicitly account for advective flow path tortuosity or how it changes with saturation we believe both concerns can potentially be addressed using a simplified conceptual model reinforced by empirical observations of solute transport there are three elements of non fickian transport in porous media immobile pore water and non wetting phase pocket formation the first element of non fickian transport berkowitz et al 2006 cortis and berkowitz 2004 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 haga et al 1999 hasan et al 2020 kapetas et al 2014 nützmann et al 2002 persson et al 2005 wierenga and van genuchten 1989 was demonstrated to be a primary driver of both variable advective tortuosity the second element and non uniform solute distribution the third element these immobile zones and dispersed pockets of non wetting phase fluids generate non uniform solute distributions because of different transport rates in diffusion dominated immobile zones vs advection dominated mobile zones hasan et al 2020 jimenez martinez et al 2017 karadimitriou et al 2017 advective flow path tortuosity becomes increasingly important as a greater percentage of the pore volume becomes immobile or blocked by non wetting phase fluid immobile water can create dead end pore spaces which solutes must navigate around clennell 1997 coats and smith 1964 de gennes 1983 immobile zones can generally be characterized as either macroscopic immobile water or pore scale immobile water macroscopic immobile water are pockets of water trapped in narrow pore throats which are isolated from the flow regime brusseau and rao 1989 hasan et al 2020 ruan and illangasekare 1999 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 weber et al 1991 pore scale immobile water is defined as hygroscopically retained water on the surface of soil grains and in pore throats ruan and illangasekare 1999 weber et al 1991 macroscopic pore scale immobile water is similar to a non wetting phase fluid because the advecting solute must navigate around these pockets in the mean direction of flow in the porous medium the macroscopic definition of immobile water is consistent with the conceptualization of mualem 1976 who described flow in unsaturated porous media as being similar to a series of interconnected pipes wherein the saturation of the medium was equivalent to the number of pipes filled with water mualem 1976 importantly this conceptualization postulates that flow fields in the media become highly non uniform at low saturations as most water and the solutes it carries is directed into channels of flow that are separated from one another this flow channelization concept has been supported by evidence from experimental studies and modelling birkholzer and tsang 1997 kapetas et al 2014 padilla et al 1999 however at low saturations in sandy porous media mobile water likely flows as a thin sheet on top of hygroscopically retained immobile water and soil grains lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 these two types of immobile water are not conceptually exclusionary the thin sheet conceptualization notes that at higher end saturations hydraulic conductivity is primarily determined by capillary forces that are well described by the mualem model lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 laboratory studies showed that the mualem 1976 model tends to overpredict hydraulic conductivity at low saturations for sandy soils lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 experimental evidence and modelling at lower saturations particularly in sands or media with rounded grains suggests flow in the pore space occurs as sheet flow along the surface of the grains and hygroscopically retained water lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 at low saturations the ratio of the mobile water to hygroscopically retained water on the surface of the grains rapidly decreases lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 supporting this conceptualization ruan and illangasekare 1999 experimentally validated a sheet flow based model for prediction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated sandy soils the second element of non fickian transport tortuosity is generated by the presence of immobile water and or pockets of non wetting phase fluid tortuosity has two common definitions first tortuosity can be defined as the ratio of the magnitude of pore scale fluid velocity to the component of the pore scale fluid velocity in the direction of macroscopic flow aminpour et al 2018 chou et al 2012 clennell 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013 ma and selim 1994 matyka and koza 2011 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 penman 1940 second tortuosity can be defined as the ratio of the mean free path length of the fluid particles to the length of the porous medium measured along the longitudinal axis of flow clennell 1997 cooper et al 2016 delgado 2006 ezzatabadipour and zahedi 2021 ghanbarian et al 2013 matyka et al 2008 matyka and koza 2011 with respect to solute mass transport in unsaturated porous media tortuosity has typically only been considered with respect to diffusive tortuosity millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 penman 1940 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 overall decreasing water saturation has two net effects first the volume fraction of immobile water and non wetting phase fluid increase causing non ideality i e increased dispersion elution tailing in the btc and changing the measured effective porosity second the size of the representative elementary volume rev for the porous media where macroscopic parameters e g permeability and saturation are defined increases as the distribution of active flow regions become less uniform hassanizadeh and gray 1979 joekar niasar et al 2012 padilla et al 1999 a conceptual diagram of the effect of decreasing water saturation immobile water size of rev tortuosity and the transport of an example contaminant perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos is presented in fig 1 while there are some experimental techniques which can directly measure the non fickian elements of unsaturated transport i e dye tracers x ray syncrotron microscopy gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 hagare et al 2008 hasan et al 2020 kapetas et al 2014 persson et al 2005 they require equipment that is not widely available are difficult to conduct and often require complex models for data analysis therefore a simplified macroscopic model to quantify these processes is of practical interest this study postulates there is a direct correlation between wetting fluid saturation and the impact of non fickian transport on btcs in variably saturated porous media in this study we developed the conceptual and mathematical foundations of a practical semi empirical modelling approach which explicitly quantifies the effects of non fickian solute transport using macroscopic observations of a conservative tracer the explicit quantification of these non fickian transport properties is lumped into a single term hereby referred to as the mass transfer index mti the mti is a macroscopic parameter related to the intrinsic properties of the porous medium hydrodynamic characteristics of the wetting and non wetting phases and the degree of wetting phase saturation evidence from steady state conservative tracer experiments are presented to support the existence of the mti the mti is theorized to primarily quantify the effects of advective flux tortuosity and instantaneous mobile immobile solute exchange under equilibrium conditions the mti can be generally considered as a resistance to mti 1 or acceleration of mti 1 advective flux which increases with decreasing water content a secondary dataset padilla et al 1999 where solute exchange was rate limited was analyzed to demonstrate how the mti method can quantify advective flux tortuosity directly when used with the mim and is presented as supplementary information si padilla et al tortuosity analysis experiments were designed to observe the effect of wetting fluid saturation and fluid flow rate on the mti an automated and motorized x ray absorbance spectroscopy system provided accurate measurements of water saturation continuously along the columns this enabled the accurate measurement and confirmation of uniform steady state unsaturated flow conditions in all the experiments presented a modified analytical solution of the 1 d ade was programmed into a public domain python 3 6 software package to perform inverse parameter estimation for the mti other important macroscopic transport parameters i e coefficient of dispersion were estimated along with the mti results from the inverse parameter estimation were compared to results from a modified version of stanmod cxtfit simunek and toride 2013 an inverse parameter estimation software program the results were analyzed against existing theory to support the introduction of the mti into the standard advection dispersion equation for subsurface transport 2 theory development 2 1 conceptual and mathematical underpinnings of the semi empirical model a direct correlation between porous media saturation and diffusive flux tortuosity has been well established chou et al 2012 ghanbarian et al 2013 millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 1997 penman 1940 the mti and diffusive flux tortuosity are conceptually similar in that both can be summarized as a macroscopic quantification of the resistance to solute transport within the pores the diffusive tortuosity is a measure of the resistance to diffusive flux while the mti is a measure of resistance to advective flux induced by non fickian transport both the mti and diffusive tortuosity impact the transport of solutes in field and laboratory settings and co occur with chemical retardation and transformation phenomena for reactive solutes brusseau and rao 1989 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 conceptual and computational models which consider both advective flux tortuosity and immobile regions for saturated porous media have been developed aminpour et al 2018 ezzatabadipour and zahedi 2021 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 however to our knowledge these models have not been experimentally validated therefore before we can effectively quantify chemical retardation effects in unsaturated porous media we must first quantify the impact of non fickian transport mechanisms using conservative solutes a conceptual diagram of pore scale sorption phenomena which co occur with non fickian transport processes demonstrated in fig 1 was adapted from tran et al 2017 and is presented in fig 2 tran et al 2017 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 the impacts of non fickian solute transport are primarily a function of physical properties of the porous media i e porosity grain size grain shape the wetting fluid saturation the wetting and non wetting fluid properties i e viscosity and fluid flow characteristics i e peclet number hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 assuming that solute concentrations are low such that fluid properties are not significantly affected these physical transport considerations are solute independent therefore a parameter which quantifies these impacts is introduced and defined as the mti under low flow rates in homogeneous media i e immobile zone mass transfer can be considered singular instantaneous and reversible in nature the mti can be treated as a lumped parameter this is mathematically similar to the way that retardation factors captures the multiple mechanisms of partitioning of mass from solute to other phases brusseau 2018 brusseau and rao 1989 we must note that unlike the retardation factor the mti can and likely will be less than 1 under some transport conditions e g solute plumes can be delayed or emerge early on a relative concentration vs dimensionless time btc plot based on these considerations a version of the 1 d equilibrium transport equation obtained from runkel 1996 can be empirically modified by introducing the mti as a multiplier to the rate of change of mass storage term in the equilibrium ade runkel 1996 1 t r i c i t u c i x d 2 c i x 2 where t is the mti r i is the retardation factor of the i th species of the chemical c i is the aqueous concentration of the i th chemical t is time x is the 1 d longitudinal distance from the source u is the longitudinal velocity linear pore velocity of water d is the macroscopic coefficient of dispersion the exact analytical solution and parameter definitions are presented in the supplementary information si modified runkel equations the dispersive diffusive coefficient in eq 1 modified with the mti is given by 2 d α l u d o τ t where α l is the longitudinal dispersivity of the porous medium d o is the bi molecular free phase coefficient of diffusion and τ is the diffusive tortuosity of the mean free path it is important to note that many past modelling efforts define diffusive tortuosity τ inversely to the definition of advective tortuosity τ a presented here i e τ l l mfp for the diffusive flux τ a l mfp l for the advective flux clennell 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013 ma and selim 1994 maraqa et al 1997 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 the definition of advective tortuosity we have chosen is still commonplace in literature and was chosen to satisfy the limiting conditions of the conceptual modelling approach presented in the discussion it is also important to note that chemical retardation of non conservative solutes can still be incorporated within the mti framework for a conservative tracer the retardation factor r i is equal to one eq 3 presents a typical calculation for the retardation factor for a non conservative solute in unsaturated conditions 3 r i 1 k d ρ b θ w k ai a ai θ w where r i is the retardation factor of the i th species k d is the solid phase partitioning coefficient ρ b is the solid phase bulk density θ w is the total water content or wetting phase volume fraction k ai is the air water interfacial partitioning coefficient and a ai is the air water interfacial area finally traditional solute dispersion transport parameters must be considered for successful application of this approach the advective parameter in eq 1 is described by eq 4 4 u v linear q θ w where u is the macroscopic longitudinal velocity that is the same as v linear the average linear pore velocity and q is the darcy flux the approach we proposed here was developed and tested using a conserative non reactive solute sodium chloride nacl which was the solute employed for all column studies described herein batch sorption tests were conducted for the silica sand to ensure sorption was negligible si batch sorption tests lumping the effects of advective tortuosity and the mobile immobile ratio into a single parameter allows for the measurement of the effect on the macroscopic btc as a function of the effective saturation as the mti is introduced as a semi emperical parameter a physically based functional realtionship to the effective saturation was not yet known hence we investigated the fitting of power law relationships which are consistent with other semi empirical relationships of transport parameters in unsaturated porous media and with limiting conditions as effective saturation approaches zero millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 padilla et al 1999 penman 1940 this study theorizes that the darcy equation can quantify the impact of non fickian transport using a single lumped parameter term while the exact form of this term depends on the wetting and non wetting fluid as well as the porous media characteristics hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 a direct correllation should exist between pore scale flow properties the physical parameters which determine solute transport and macroscopic observations of wetting phase fraction in the porous media in other words the exact form of the mass transfer relationship is determined by the capillary pressure p c and peclet number of the wetting phase pe w at the pore scale these pore scale properties determine changes in the mobile immobile water ratio θ m θ i m and the advective tortuosity τ a which impact solute transport but we hypothesize these pore scale physics impacting solute transport are well correllated with the effective saturation s e described in eq 5 for a specific combination of wetting and non wetting fluid in a homogeneous porous media 5 s e θ w θ r θ s θ r s s r 1 s r where θ w is the water content θ r is the residual water content θ s is the saturated water content or porosity s is the saturation and s r is the residual saturation 2 2 experimental materials and methods 2 2 1 measurement equipment and column construction three rectangular cross section soil columns 110 cm length x 7 cm width x 5 cm thick interior dimensions were constructed out of 1 24 cm thick polycarbonate a length greater than 1 m was chosen to help promote uniform steady state flow under unsaturated conditions long column setup the rectangular design of the columns was chosen to facilitate high accuracy measurements from the x ray absorbance spectroscopy system described below a rectangular funnel was 3 d printed from poly lactic acid pla filament and placed in the base of the column to prevent dead volume and direct flow out of the base of the column a total length of 102 cm in the column was packed with medium grained sand for the study a 3 d printed pla dispersion plate and a 3 cm gravel pack were placed on top of the column to produce uniform water distribution across the flow section pla was chosen for its ease of access and insolubility in most common solvents i e methanol and isopropyl alcohol sato et al 2013 columns were packed with air dried high purity 99 sio2 silica sands from the unimin corporation the sands were medium sized 0 35 mm effective diameter rounded grains with a high degree of uniformity cu 1 43 the porosity of the sand was initially determined gravimetrically and volumetrically in 15 cm liquid chromatography columns the columns were purged with co2 for 90 min prior to filling with water from the top and bottom of the column to ensure the removal of any insoluble air pockets in the system ulrich et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 the fully saturated columns were then scanned with the x ray system to measure the water content conservative tracer transport experiments for saturated and unsaturated conditions were conducted using a standard methodology reported in literature brusseau et al 2015 lyu et al 2018 peng and brusseau 2005 this method achieves uniform water content and steady state flow by connecting peristaltic pumps to the top and bottom of the columns and slowly adjusting the outflow rate as needed to decrease or increase water content the real time water content temperature and electrical conductivity of the wetting fluid were measured at three points along the length of each column 18 cm 51 cm 83 cm using high accuracy soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity sensors once water content measurements from the sensors stabilized high spatial resolution measurements of water content along the length of the column were determined using princeton gamma technology intrinsic germanium detector and pantak unipolar series 2 hf 100 x ray generator using x ray absorption spectroscopy x ray scans were conducted throughout the course of every conservative tracer experiment to ensure water content distribution was uniform longitudinally across the column all experiments were conducted at ambient temperatures 15 22 c 2 2 2 tracer test experimental methods two high precision masterflex l s multichannel pumps were attached to the top and bottom of the columns respectively platinum cured l s 17 masterflex tubing was used to ensure minimal retention of salt tracer on tubing conservative solute transport tests were performed at three ranges of partial saturations 90 100 saturation 65 85 saturation and 40 60 saturation to construct the t s e curves because two multi channel pump heads were used to control inlet and outlet flow in all three columns variations in column construction and sand packing caused some variation in saturation 5 from one another in each set of tests the tracer tests were performed with 0 05 0 5 and 5 0 g l of nacl respectively to evaluate whether the mti is independent of the tracer concentrations i e if the mti is purely a physical property of the soil water system the conductivity sensors recorded values at 5 min intervals along the length of the column to create the tracer btcs in addition the conductivity was also measured at different depths along the column to determine if the mti was scale dependent experiments were conducted in triplicate at three saturation ranges three solute concentrations and in three columns for mid range darcy flow rates a total of 27 experiments the three conductivity sensors per column at 18 cm 51 cm and 83 cm downstream resulted in a total of 81 btcs for the mid range flow rate experiments two low flow rate experiments were conducted in the same three columns at 100 and 85 saturation to observe the mti at low flow rate conditions low flow experiments were conducted in triplicate columns and produced an additional 18 btcs finally two high flow rate experiments were conducted in the same three columns to test the limiting condition of high flow rates the sensors in the columns have a maximum logging rate of 1 log every 5 min because the flow rates were so fast the sensors could not adequately capture the elution front of the salt tracer the conductivity of the tracer in the high flow rate experiments were monitored at the outlet using an orion conductivity probe and a small volume flow through cell these were conducted in triplicate and produced 6 btcs table 1 details the experimental conditions included in this study 2 2 3 data analysis methods analysis of the tracer btcs was done using the traditional method of moments as well as a customized python program hereby referred to as the mti estimator program which implemented the analytical solution of the 1 d formulation of the ade incorporating the mti i e eq 1 the program uses a trust region foundational curve fitting scheme available in the scipy stats library for inverse parameter estimation a beta version of this software is available on github in a windows compatible exe format stults 2020 validation of the mti estimator program was done using the stanmod cxtfit code simunek and toride 2013 analysis of x ray spectroscopic data was done using fundamental principles of x ray attenuation described in past work for this system ferré et al 2005 another custom program written in python was used to parse and process the x ray data files the data from the x ray system was collected and controlled using a custom labview program ferré et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray absorption and soil moisture sensor data high spatial density x ray scans were combined with high temporal density water content measurements from in situ sensors to ensure the saturation remained relatively constant along the length of each column this was a critical control as the mti depends on the degree of saturation the x ray system accuracy was 1 0 for liquid water according to cuvet calibration tests the precision of the x ray system varied with temperature and signal strength but was typically 2 for ambient conditions with good signal to noise ratio ferré et al 2005 the soil moisture sensors had a volumetric water content accuracy of 2 when used in field soils with low saturation extracts meter 2019 results of the x ray scan data and soil moisture data showed neither the total water content nor the distribution of water along the length of three columns and varied significantly over the course of the experiments fig 3 illustrates the uniformity in saturation across the length of all three columns and three different experimental conditions the consistency of the water saturation in the columns enabled the use a steady state assumption in modelling low flow rates were used in the majority of experiments to ensure there was little change in the macroscopic peclet number between the experiments this ensured any observed changes in the mti were only the result of varying saturations used in each experiment 3 2 validation using stanmod cxtfit the mti estimation code was tested against a thoroughly validated inverse parameter estimation code stanmod cxtfit simunek and toride 2013 to evaluate its performance the cxtfit code estimated the mti by using the x ray attenuation measured water content rather than the effective water content to calculate the linear pore velocity from darcy flow rate cxtfit inversion of btc data was then used to solve for the values of r i and d retardation factor and the macroscopic coefficient of dispersion sodium chloride behaves as a conservative tracer in the sandy porous media used in this study resulting in a retardation factor of 1 no sorption because the retardation factor for the conservative tracer is presumed equal to 1 the r i value drops out of the left hand side lhs of eq 1 leaving the t value as the lone lhs coefficient the methodology was demonstrated in fig 4 and the supporting information supporting info the goodness of fit information from cxtfit was compared to the goodness of fit information from the mti estimator to ensure proper error tolerance the estimated r i and d values produced by cxtfit were compared to the estimated t and d produced by the mti estimator program all of the estimated parameter values were within one standard deviation of error and in most cases were nearly identical to 3 significant figures indicating the mti estimator performed as expected fig 4 is a presentation of fitted tracer data using cxtfit and the custom mti estimator software 3 3 btc results the validity of the experimental data gathered for each data point was determined using goodness of fit metrics automatically generated by the mti estimator for this study results from the curve fitting system were considered valid when the r squared value was greater than 0 9 and the percent mass error from the simulated curve and the data was 20 of the 105 btcs and individual mti values 99 94 3 adhered to the validity criteria outlined above most of the invalidated data points were due to low concentration experiments 0 05 g l being near the limit of quantitation for the conductivity sensors a highly uniform medium grained sand was chosen to help facilitate a variety of flow rates and to ensure rapid solute exchange from mobile to immobile zones the rapid exchange of solute between mobile and immobile zones was evident in the btcs from the experiments which were very symmetrical under both saturated and unsaturated conditions because of the symmetry present in the btcs it was determined the standard ade could be properly adapted for this proof of concept study representative btcs for all three columns under saturated and unsaturated conditions for mid and low flow rates are presented with both linear and logarithmic axes in fig 5 4 mti results and analysis using the mti conceptual framework we then inferred the form of the t s e relationship using information from a limiting condition and then validated the form of the equation using experimental evidence 4 1 limiting condition low water content at the residual water content i e the effective saturation of zero the advective flux is negligible within the rev i e v linear 0 walser et al 1999 eq 6 uses a simple substitution from eqs 1 and 2 to present the t value as it relates to the advective flux 6 r i c i t u t c i x u t α l d o i τ 2 c i x 2 where τ 0 66 θ w θ s 8 3 as defined by moldrup et al 1997 moldrup et al 1997 from this form it is clear that t must approach infinity as s e approaches zero to eliminate advective mass flux u from the equation a mathematical representation of this limiting condition is presented in eq 7 7 lim s e 0 t s e note that even as s e approaches zero and t approaches infinity eq 6 still allows for diffusive mass transfer within the rev albeit severely limited by diffusive tortuosity 4 2 t se relationship for mid range flow data previously inverse power law type relationships which satisfy the limiting condition in eq 7 have been observed between important mass transfer parameters i e macroscopically defined coefficient of dispersion and decreasing water contents lim et al 1998 maraqa et al 1997 padilla et al 1999 therefore an inverse power law and inverse natural logarithm type relationships were fit to the effective saturation and the mti data the t s e relationships for the bulk sand in all three replicate columns for the mid flow rate tests experiments 1 1 3 3 from table 1 are presented in fig 6 typical goodness of fit measures such as the r squared are not suitable for non linear problems spiess and neumeyer 2010 a combination of pearson rank correlation values calculated using the scipy stats library and the total percent residuals were evaluated to represent the non parametric and parametric goodness of fits respectively sheskin 2007 while both the power law and natural logarithm fits performed well the power law fit had a lower average percent error and a higher pearson rank correlation coefficient this suggests the power law type relationship is the more representative of t as function of effective saturation the equation for the inverse power law type relationship is presented in eq 8 8 t s e b s e n where n is the polynomial fitting parameter of the t s e relationship where n 0 for the inverse power law relationships and b is the full saturation intercept fitting parameter or the fully saturated effective porosity of the t s e relationship the parameter t is considered a function of effective saturation which is different for each combination of porous media regarding wetting and non wetting fluid while the type of porous media and the wetting fluids are the primary drivers of non fickian transport in this conceptual model there are several significant factors which can increase non fickian transport under unsaturated conditions these factors include pore scale differences due to packing of the column channelization from air pocket trapping or physical disturbances and changes to the water content distribution caused by the rate of drainage of the porous medium birkholzer and tsang 1997 hasan et al 2020 kapetas et al 2014 mahadevan et al 2012 padilla et al 1999 ideally all columns would have identical drainage rates when reducing saturation and identical flow rates when performing steady state tracer tests unfortunately this experimental setup required all three column effluent lines be attached to a single multi channel pump head because of minor differences in the column construction and tubing configuration each column had slightly different drainage rates and flow rates si compiled mti data for these reasons we chose to analyze the t s e relationship for each column separately to ensure the trend in eq 8 was applicable under all conditions results of the individual column analyses are presented in fig 7 and table 2 results of the power law fitting for each column produced very good correlation measures with the theoretical fit for all three columns and the bulk data average percent errors ranged from 7 9 14 0 and pearson correlation coefficients were greater than or very close to 0 8 indicating relatively small prediction errors and excellent correlation furthermore fitted parameters for each column and the bulk fit had relatively small standard errors the predicted values for n and b were within the standard errors of one another for all three columns indicating similar results across all three columns these similar values high correlations and low percent errors supports the theory that the mti can be accurately estimated based solely on the degree of saturation in the porous medium additionally the effect of rapid drainage on the t s e relationship can be observed in the differences in the goodness of fit between the three columns rapid drainage has been demonstrated to enhance the effects of channelization in porous media through dislodging of small particles and through infiltration of air pockets into tight pore spaces after water is dislodged mahadevan et al 2012 these observations are supported by pore scale models which demonstrate how pressure changes of an infiltrating wetting front can influence non fickian transport in unsaturated porous media hasan et al 2019 because the mti theory considers water saturation to be uniform within the rev channelization from rapid drainage presumably results in deviations from the eq 8 prediction column b had relatively fast drainage rate compared to columns a c and exhibited the most deviation from the eq 8 prediction column a had the slowest and most controlled drainage while column c had a slightly faster drainage rate with less control column a had the best correlation with eq 8 while measurements from column c had more deviation this provides evidence to suggest that deviations from the mti can occur when channelization or other factors cause heterogeneity of water flow in the rev despite these deviations the mti correlations were still quite accurate in all three columns another source of non uniform water flow are pockets of mass transfer limited immobile water developing in an otherwise uniform and highly mobile system the sand in this study was intentionally chosen because of its high uniformity and relatively large grain sizes which indicate a lack of significant mass transfer limitations in this type of sand advective tortuosity and mobile immobile zone solute exchange have the same effect on the btc and are therefore inseparable theoretically in a sand where mobile immobile zone solute exchange is rate limited the mim can be used to calculate the mobile volume fraction and rate constant therefore while the mti concept is not directly applicable when rate limited transfer is present using the mim in combination with the mti concept should enable direct calculation of advective flux tortuosity furthermore this advective flux tortuosity should obey a similar power law relationship like that of the mti a secondary dataset padilla et al 1999 which used a similar chemically inert sand with mass transfer limitations was analyzed to test this hypothesis the results of this analysis are presented in the supplementary information si padilla et al tortuosity analysis the results of this analysis demonstrate that while the mti quantification is not necessarily applicable for all soil types concepts from the mti can be incorporated into more robust models of solute transport to enhance their accuracy furthermore advective tortuosity obeys the same inverse power law type relationship established for the mti si padilla et al tortuosity analysis 4 3 analysis of t se relationship accounting for concentration or length scale variability this study was designed to enable btcs and their associated t values to be measured at three points downstream in the column and experiments were conducted with three nacl concentrations see table 1 this was done to test the impact of solute concentration or length scale on the calculated t value the conceptual development of the mti indicates that the predicted values of t should not vary with longitudinal distance of the measurement point nor solute concentration any correlated variability with solute concentration or measurement distance would suggest a conceptual flaw in the underlying theory or an experimental design flaw i e the presence of significant interactions between the solute and the media unsteady state to determine whether there was any discernable correlation with longitudinal observation point or solute concentrations the linear regression presented in eq 8 was performed on each subset of categorical length and concentration data the results of this analysis are presented in fig 8 results of this analysis show minimal variability in the t s e relationships when data were categorized by longitudinal distance of the measurement point some minor variability in the t s e relationship was observed in the regressions when categorized by solute concentration however the predicted parameter values were well within the 95 c i estimation of one another si convolutional function data the same observations are noted for the length scale correlations results from the categorical regressions of mid flow rate data suggest the underlying theory of the mti is correct 4 4 flow rate impacts on the t se relationship and comparison to diffusive tortuosity during preliminary data analysis of the mid range flow rate mti data a weak but non negligible correlation was observed between the linear pore velocity and the predicted value of t this observation is in keeping with conceptual theory supported by pore scale models and experimental evidence hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 hasan et al 2020 observed the macroscopic peclet number for the system influenced the ratio of mobile to immobile water content at the pore scale increasing the ratio of total immobile water to the total mobile water would logically increase the impact of non fickian transport in a porous media therefore we hypothesized that we would observe a correlation between flow rate and the t s e relationship the low and high flow rate experiments outlined in table 1 conducted to test this hypothesis were performed at full saturation and the 65 85 range of effective saturation under high and low flow rate conditions in all three columns the low flow experiments had specific darcy fluxes and linear pore velocities approximately 3 5 times lower than that of the original experiments while the high flow experiments were conducted at specific discharges and linear pore velocities around 100 fold higher than the original mid flow rate experiments as shown in table 1 the mti was estimated using the same methodology described for the original mid flow rate experiments and linear regression was performed on these data using eq 7 to find the best fit as both the diffusive tortuosity and the mti can be interpreted as a resistance to advective and diffusive solute fluxes we believed it was pertinent to compare the t s e relationships measured in these experiments with predicted diffusive tortuosity vs saturation relationship for the same medium there are two important notes regarding the mti and diffusive tortuosity first the mti was developed as the inverse of the diffusive tortuosity to satisfy a limiting condition in eq 7 second the diffusive tortuosity is a function of the total saturation not the effective saturation the t s e data are presented alongside the inverse of the moldrup et al 1997 equation for liquid phase diffusive tortuosity in fig 9 results from these experiments show that while the t s e relationship is somewhat sensitive to changes in flow rate in the mid to low flow rate range rapid flow rates can induce highly non fickian transport in porous media this is consistent with other experimental studies which demonstrate that increasing flow rate and grain size can cause deviations from flow rates predicted by the darcy s law i q relationship van lopik et al 2017 these results also demonstrate a direct correlation between increasing flow rate and increasing t values in the t s e relationship this evidence is congruent with current evidence from experimental studies and pore scale modelling hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 the low flow rate experiments produced t values that were similar but slightly lower on average to the t values from the mid flow rate experiments there was also a noticeable decrease in the predicted t values at the extrapolated lower end of the t s e curve furthermore there is a noticeable flattening towards 1 of the predicted t s e relationship for the low flow rate experiments this correlation indicates the mti correction becomes less important as diffusive flux starts to dominate over advective flux in keeping with the general theory of the mti further investigation at very low flow rates i e macroscopic peclet number in the 0 01 1 0 range would be required to confirm this observation the final major finding of this study is the notable difference between the inverse diffusive tortuosity saturation τ 1 s and the t s e relationship diffusive tortuosity impedes the diffusive solute flux in unsaturated porous media much more dramatically than the resistance to advective flux from increasingly non fickian transport at lower saturations furthermore many realistic soils will likely have t s e relationships with t values much less than one over most of the effective saturation range 0 1 this is because advective transport in field soils occurs in a small fraction of the total wetting phase volume payne et al 2008 this concept is typically referred to as the effective porosity or the mobile porosity of the medium payne et al 2008 while there is likely to be increased mobile and immobile zone solute exchange in these soils resulting in increased non fickian transport it has been demonstrated that the effective porosity of real soils often results in solute breakthrough 5 10 times earlier than predicted from the darcy flux water content relationship horton et al 1988 this 5 10 times earlier breakthrough corresponds to an mti of 0 1 0 2 at full saturation further investigation of the t s e relationship of real soils for typical saturations and flow rates is needed results from experimental analysis of real soils will indicate whether linear pore velocity is typically overestimated t 1 or underestimated t 1 from the standard darcy relationship 5 conclusions 5 1 comparison to previous studies and modelling efforts the mti model attempts to take the well studied effective porosity technique and method of moments used in saturated flow and scale them to work under variably saturated conditions using this simple experimentally supported semi empirical correlation researchers can now better account for non fickian transport in unsaturated porous media without the use of complex numerical models furthermore the introduction of a term which can account for advective flux tortuosity in the mobile phase represents a significant step forward in our understanding of flow and transport in unsaturated porous media however the mti method alone cannot capture some processes i e rate limited mobile immobile zone solute exchange which impact observations of solute transport the mti should be considered a technique which can supplement more complex models indeed this proof of concept study was designed to demonstrate how the mti could be successfully incorporated into more complex models such as the mim mrmt stochastic convection f ade or ctrw models as a supplement to this study we have demonstrated how the mti concept can be used in combination with the mim to directly quantify the correlation between effective saturation and advective flux tortuosity si padilla et al tortuosity analysis while a high purity silica sand was selected because of its inert sorptive properties uniform sand media is not necessarily the most conducive to the mti theory flow in sandy media can transition from the traditional mualem pipe flow at higher saturations to sheet flow at lower saturations the sheet flow transition causes a discontinuity in the physical mechanisms of transport at lower s e 0 30 effective saturations the mti is likely more useful for agricultural or less uniform soils where pipe flow is persistent across the entire range of effective saturation 5 2 implications for future work considering unsaturated advective transport of solutes future work on the transport of reactive solutes in unsaturated porous media can benefit from use of the mti method which allows for the correction for the non fickian component of the pore scale transport when estimating mass flux at the macroscopic scale most unsaturated transport models such as hydrus or feflow use the relationship between darcy flux based on relative permeability and water content to predict the linear pore velocity of solutes dhi wasy dhi wasy gmbh 2005 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 this relationship between the darcy flux and water content demonstrated in eq 4 has been widely used because past efforts regarding advective transport in the vadose zone were primarily optimized and utilized for the prediction of darcy flux rather than solute transport while darcy flux and linear pore velocity are correlated it is established that the standard darcy flux water content relationship is often unreliable for predicting solute movement in saturated soils horton et al 1988 the effective porosity based on the fraction of the porosity that contributes to mobile flow is shown to provide accurate estimations of solute advective transport in saturated media horton et al 1988 payne et al 2008 the theoretical underpinnings of the effective porosity technique and evidence from recent studies hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 demonstrate that using the darcy flux water content approximation of linear pore velocity will produce inaccurate results of simulated solute transport in saturated and unsaturated conditions the same non fickian processes which result in the difference between measured and effective porosity are primarily controlled by immobile water which becomes increasingly important as saturation decreases the mti method takes the underlying idea of the effective porosity method and scales it to a correlation with effective saturation which can account for pore scale non fickian transport in a macroscopic model while existing macroscopic models can accurately simulate many important features of solute transport in unsaturated porous media dhi wasy dhi wasy gmbh 2005 guo et al 2020 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the correct prediction of linear pore velocity is essential for simulating the transport of widespread emerging contaminants that are reactive e g pfass in the vadose zone hatton et al 2018 5 3 suggestions for correcting models and improving future studies the mti method was designed to be easily integrated into existing models of unsaturated solute transport a t s e relationship can easily be determined for a porous medium with wetting and non wetting fluids of interest using a simple btc experiment with a conservative solute once the t s e relationship is determined the predicted t value simply divides the linear pore velocity calculated using the standard darcy flux water content relationship a custom written mti estimation program was compiled for windows and made readily available to users who wish to calculate the mti using conservative btc data stults 2020 because the mti was formulated similarly to the retardation factor term it can also be calculated using a method of moments technique this is done by creating a relative concentration dimensionless time btc using a conservative tracer as demonstrated in fig 5 and then calculating the actual dimensionless breakthrough time compared to the predicted breakthrough time dimensionless time equal to 1 by calculating the mti for a variably saturated porous medium before estimating the retardation factor researchers can better assess the impact of non fickian transport in their studies a standard correction should also be made to the traditional mim mrmt ctrw f ade and stochastic convection model to include and advective tortuosity term for advective solutes 6 summary a conceptual model was developed to macroscopically quantify pore scale non fickian transport processes which are dependent on wetting fluid saturation porous media characteristics wetting and non wetting phase interactions and wetting fluid hydrodynamics under equilibrium conditions these non fickian processes could be macroscopically quantified using a single lumped parameter term t referred to as the mass transfer index mti a strong correlation was observed between the mti and the effective saturation a semi empirical relationship between the mti and effective saturation was inferred from a limiting condition and results from past studies of transport in unsaturated soils this relationship referred to as the t s e relationship was calculated and validated through careful experimental observations the development of the mti method significantly advances the understanding and ability to predict solute transport in unsaturated soils credit

1386,the processes impacting solute transport through unsaturated porous media have been receiving renewed attention due to their relevance to the transport of emerging contaminants a set of well monitored and highly controlled experiments in sand columns were conducted to determine the effect of partial saturation on conservative solute breakthrough in porous media the results suggest traditional transport parameter estimation methods inadequately account for the pore scale processes of mass transfer to the immobile zones and the effects of partial saturation on advective transport even for conservative tracers accurate estimation of these basic transport parameters is critical to evaluate the multi phase partitioning of nonconservative solutes as any errors in these parameters would bias the estimates of multi phase partitioning parameters herein we introduced the mass transfer index mti a semi empirical approach for quantifying the impact of non fickian elements of pore scale unsaturated solute transport i e immobile water tortuous flow paths and non uniform solute distribution which become increasingly important as the wetting fluid saturation decreases importantly this mti was determined independently of chemically driven phase partitioning and is supported by experimental data based on this conceptualization the 1 d equilibrium advection dispersion equation was modified to incorporate the mti as a lumped parameter which quantifies resistance to mti 1 or promotion of mti 1 of advective solute flux analytical solutions to the modified advection dispersion reaction equation for pulse and step inputs were developed conservative tracer experiments were conducted in variably saturated sand columns to validate both the mti conceptualization and the inversion method used to estimate the mti these experiments involved the use of x ray absorption spectroscopy integrated with sensor based measurements of soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity for tracer breakthrough the mathematical model developed herein adapts traditional macroscopic models of solute transport to account for the non fickian pore scale transport behaviors observed in unsaturated porous media with significant advective flux keywords unsaturated vadose zone non fickian fate and transport multi phase flow modelling 1 introduction vadose zone processes have received more attention due to emerging contaminants that likely exhibit multi phase retention processes in unsaturated soils brusseau 2020 2018 brusseau et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 houtz et al 2013 li et al 2018 lyu et al 2018 specifically poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass are widespread contaminants of concern in the environment in both saturated and unsaturated groundwater systems hatton et al 2018 houtz et al 2013 sepulvado et al 2011 sun et al 2016 these fluorinated surfactants can be sorbed at the air water interface present in vadose zone soils lyu et al 2018 saturated and unsaturated column experiments of pfass have used the traditional method of moments analysis of solute breakthrough to estimate the retardation of the contaminants brusseau et al 2019 brusseau and rao 1989 j valocchi 1990 leij et al 1991 leij and dane 1992 lyu et al 2018 van glubt et al 2021 wang et al 1998 yu et al 1999 while the method of moments is a simple and robust technique to estimate the retardation coefficient its use in unsaturated column studies ignores some key aspects of multi phase flow and transport in porous media namely the method of moments and standard parameter estimation methods do not explicitly account for the effect of non fickian transport that occur at the pore scale i e advective flow path tortuosity solute mass transfer into and out of immobile zones and non uniform solute distributions which become increasingly important as saturation decreases hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 persson et al 2005 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 explicitly accounting for these processes is important as there is increased interest in using the method of moments for quantifying multi phase retardation processes van glubt et al 2021 while the standard method of moments does not explicitly quantify the impact of non fickian phenomena it does implicitly account for non fickian processes because it uses the effective porosity technique for the calculation of pore volumes payne et al 2008 this means that while the traditional method of moments technique can provide accurate estimations of chemical sorption parameters it brushes over some elements of transport which become increasingly important as saturation decreases specifically the method of moments and effective porosity concepts do not consider increasingly non fickian nature of solute transport as saturation decreases the role of immobile water in soil pores and advective flow path tortuosity in the fate and transport of highly soluble compounds in the saturated and unsaturated subsurface has been conceptually and experimentally demonstrated bond and wierenga 1990 brusseau and rao 1989 clennell 1997 de smedt and wierenga 1984 hasan et al 2020 maraqa et al 1997 padilla et al 1999 van genuchten and wierenga 1977 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 successful models of unsaturated zone water flow and solute transport which consider mass transfer between immobile water and increasing diffusive flux tortuosity with decreasing saturation have been reported for applications in soil physics and subsurface contamination millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 penman 1940 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 of particular interest a recent study used x ray synchrotron microscopy to investigate pore scale processes and revealed the key role non fickian transport plays in advective transport under unsaturated conditions hasan et al 2020 these results confirmed observations from pore scale models developed by the same researchers hasan et al 2019 while this study is a recent effort which provides high resolution measurements of the impact of immobile water on solute transport in variably saturated media there are several past efforts which demonstrate the phenomena of non fickian transport in a similar fashion bromly and hinz 2004 cortis and berkowitz 2004 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 nützmann et al 2002 persson et al 2005 toride et al 2003 wierenga and van genuchten 1989 zoia et al 2010 some key observations of non fickian transport include asymmetrical breakthrough curves btcs increasing dispersion with decreasing saturation tailing in the btc plume arrival times which are not predicted using the darcy flux water content relationship and flow path channelization bond and wierenga 1990 bromly and hinz 2004 cortis and berkowitz 2004 de smedt and wierenga 1984 haga et al 1999 hagare et al 2008 kapetas et al 2014 nützmann et al 2002 padilla et al 1999 persson et al 2005 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 toride et al 2003 van genuchten and wierenga 1977 wierenga and van genuchten 1989 zoia et al 2010 these experimental observations of btcs are supported by various types of pore scale modelling and macroscopic modelling efforts berkowitz et al 2006 brusseau and rao 1989 gao et al 2010 hansen and berkowitz 2020 hasan et al 2019 mašín et al 2006 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 zoia et al 2010 currently there are some macroscopic models which have adapted the traditional advection dispersion equation ade to better model non fickian transport in unsaturated media specifically these models include the mobile immobile model mim van genuchten and wierenga 1976 the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt haggerty and gorelick 1995 the fractional advection dispersion equation model f ade benson et al 2000 the stochastic convection model sposito et al 1986 and continuous time random walk ctrw models berkowitz et al 2006 while these models have successfully demonstrated the ability to capture processes characteristic of non fickian transport i e btc tailing and btc asymmetry there are two drawbacks to all of these models first all of these models are much more complex than the standard ade model requiring extensive training and skill to implement second none of these models explicitly account for advective flow path tortuosity or how it changes with saturation we believe both concerns can potentially be addressed using a simplified conceptual model reinforced by empirical observations of solute transport there are three elements of non fickian transport in porous media immobile pore water and non wetting phase pocket formation the first element of non fickian transport berkowitz et al 2006 cortis and berkowitz 2004 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 haga et al 1999 hasan et al 2020 kapetas et al 2014 nützmann et al 2002 persson et al 2005 wierenga and van genuchten 1989 was demonstrated to be a primary driver of both variable advective tortuosity the second element and non uniform solute distribution the third element these immobile zones and dispersed pockets of non wetting phase fluids generate non uniform solute distributions because of different transport rates in diffusion dominated immobile zones vs advection dominated mobile zones hasan et al 2020 jimenez martinez et al 2017 karadimitriou et al 2017 advective flow path tortuosity becomes increasingly important as a greater percentage of the pore volume becomes immobile or blocked by non wetting phase fluid immobile water can create dead end pore spaces which solutes must navigate around clennell 1997 coats and smith 1964 de gennes 1983 immobile zones can generally be characterized as either macroscopic immobile water or pore scale immobile water macroscopic immobile water are pockets of water trapped in narrow pore throats which are isolated from the flow regime brusseau and rao 1989 hasan et al 2020 ruan and illangasekare 1999 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 weber et al 1991 pore scale immobile water is defined as hygroscopically retained water on the surface of soil grains and in pore throats ruan and illangasekare 1999 weber et al 1991 macroscopic pore scale immobile water is similar to a non wetting phase fluid because the advecting solute must navigate around these pockets in the mean direction of flow in the porous medium the macroscopic definition of immobile water is consistent with the conceptualization of mualem 1976 who described flow in unsaturated porous media as being similar to a series of interconnected pipes wherein the saturation of the medium was equivalent to the number of pipes filled with water mualem 1976 importantly this conceptualization postulates that flow fields in the media become highly non uniform at low saturations as most water and the solutes it carries is directed into channels of flow that are separated from one another this flow channelization concept has been supported by evidence from experimental studies and modelling birkholzer and tsang 1997 kapetas et al 2014 padilla et al 1999 however at low saturations in sandy porous media mobile water likely flows as a thin sheet on top of hygroscopically retained immobile water and soil grains lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 these two types of immobile water are not conceptually exclusionary the thin sheet conceptualization notes that at higher end saturations hydraulic conductivity is primarily determined by capillary forces that are well described by the mualem model lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 laboratory studies showed that the mualem 1976 model tends to overpredict hydraulic conductivity at low saturations for sandy soils lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 experimental evidence and modelling at lower saturations particularly in sands or media with rounded grains suggests flow in the pore space occurs as sheet flow along the surface of the grains and hygroscopically retained water lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 at low saturations the ratio of the mobile water to hygroscopically retained water on the surface of the grains rapidly decreases lebeau and konrad 2010 ruan and illangasekare 1999 supporting this conceptualization ruan and illangasekare 1999 experimentally validated a sheet flow based model for prediction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated sandy soils the second element of non fickian transport tortuosity is generated by the presence of immobile water and or pockets of non wetting phase fluid tortuosity has two common definitions first tortuosity can be defined as the ratio of the magnitude of pore scale fluid velocity to the component of the pore scale fluid velocity in the direction of macroscopic flow aminpour et al 2018 chou et al 2012 clennell 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013 ma and selim 1994 matyka and koza 2011 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 penman 1940 second tortuosity can be defined as the ratio of the mean free path length of the fluid particles to the length of the porous medium measured along the longitudinal axis of flow clennell 1997 cooper et al 2016 delgado 2006 ezzatabadipour and zahedi 2021 ghanbarian et al 2013 matyka et al 2008 matyka and koza 2011 with respect to solute mass transport in unsaturated porous media tortuosity has typically only been considered with respect to diffusive tortuosity millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 penman 1940 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 overall decreasing water saturation has two net effects first the volume fraction of immobile water and non wetting phase fluid increase causing non ideality i e increased dispersion elution tailing in the btc and changing the measured effective porosity second the size of the representative elementary volume rev for the porous media where macroscopic parameters e g permeability and saturation are defined increases as the distribution of active flow regions become less uniform hassanizadeh and gray 1979 joekar niasar et al 2012 padilla et al 1999 a conceptual diagram of the effect of decreasing water saturation immobile water size of rev tortuosity and the transport of an example contaminant perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos is presented in fig 1 while there are some experimental techniques which can directly measure the non fickian elements of unsaturated transport i e dye tracers x ray syncrotron microscopy gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 hagare et al 2008 hasan et al 2020 kapetas et al 2014 persson et al 2005 they require equipment that is not widely available are difficult to conduct and often require complex models for data analysis therefore a simplified macroscopic model to quantify these processes is of practical interest this study postulates there is a direct correlation between wetting fluid saturation and the impact of non fickian transport on btcs in variably saturated porous media in this study we developed the conceptual and mathematical foundations of a practical semi empirical modelling approach which explicitly quantifies the effects of non fickian solute transport using macroscopic observations of a conservative tracer the explicit quantification of these non fickian transport properties is lumped into a single term hereby referred to as the mass transfer index mti the mti is a macroscopic parameter related to the intrinsic properties of the porous medium hydrodynamic characteristics of the wetting and non wetting phases and the degree of wetting phase saturation evidence from steady state conservative tracer experiments are presented to support the existence of the mti the mti is theorized to primarily quantify the effects of advective flux tortuosity and instantaneous mobile immobile solute exchange under equilibrium conditions the mti can be generally considered as a resistance to mti 1 or acceleration of mti 1 advective flux which increases with decreasing water content a secondary dataset padilla et al 1999 where solute exchange was rate limited was analyzed to demonstrate how the mti method can quantify advective flux tortuosity directly when used with the mim and is presented as supplementary information si padilla et al tortuosity analysis experiments were designed to observe the effect of wetting fluid saturation and fluid flow rate on the mti an automated and motorized x ray absorbance spectroscopy system provided accurate measurements of water saturation continuously along the columns this enabled the accurate measurement and confirmation of uniform steady state unsaturated flow conditions in all the experiments presented a modified analytical solution of the 1 d ade was programmed into a public domain python 3 6 software package to perform inverse parameter estimation for the mti other important macroscopic transport parameters i e coefficient of dispersion were estimated along with the mti results from the inverse parameter estimation were compared to results from a modified version of stanmod cxtfit simunek and toride 2013 an inverse parameter estimation software program the results were analyzed against existing theory to support the introduction of the mti into the standard advection dispersion equation for subsurface transport 2 theory development 2 1 conceptual and mathematical underpinnings of the semi empirical model a direct correlation between porous media saturation and diffusive flux tortuosity has been well established chou et al 2012 ghanbarian et al 2013 millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 1997 penman 1940 the mti and diffusive flux tortuosity are conceptually similar in that both can be summarized as a macroscopic quantification of the resistance to solute transport within the pores the diffusive tortuosity is a measure of the resistance to diffusive flux while the mti is a measure of resistance to advective flux induced by non fickian transport both the mti and diffusive tortuosity impact the transport of solutes in field and laboratory settings and co occur with chemical retardation and transformation phenomena for reactive solutes brusseau and rao 1989 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 conceptual and computational models which consider both advective flux tortuosity and immobile regions for saturated porous media have been developed aminpour et al 2018 ezzatabadipour and zahedi 2021 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 however to our knowledge these models have not been experimentally validated therefore before we can effectively quantify chemical retardation effects in unsaturated porous media we must first quantify the impact of non fickian transport mechanisms using conservative solutes a conceptual diagram of pore scale sorption phenomena which co occur with non fickian transport processes demonstrated in fig 1 was adapted from tran et al 2017 and is presented in fig 2 tran et al 2017 weber et al 1991 weber and smith 1987 the impacts of non fickian solute transport are primarily a function of physical properties of the porous media i e porosity grain size grain shape the wetting fluid saturation the wetting and non wetting fluid properties i e viscosity and fluid flow characteristics i e peclet number hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 assuming that solute concentrations are low such that fluid properties are not significantly affected these physical transport considerations are solute independent therefore a parameter which quantifies these impacts is introduced and defined as the mti under low flow rates in homogeneous media i e immobile zone mass transfer can be considered singular instantaneous and reversible in nature the mti can be treated as a lumped parameter this is mathematically similar to the way that retardation factors captures the multiple mechanisms of partitioning of mass from solute to other phases brusseau 2018 brusseau and rao 1989 we must note that unlike the retardation factor the mti can and likely will be less than 1 under some transport conditions e g solute plumes can be delayed or emerge early on a relative concentration vs dimensionless time btc plot based on these considerations a version of the 1 d equilibrium transport equation obtained from runkel 1996 can be empirically modified by introducing the mti as a multiplier to the rate of change of mass storage term in the equilibrium ade runkel 1996 1 t r i c i t u c i x d 2 c i x 2 where t is the mti r i is the retardation factor of the i th species of the chemical c i is the aqueous concentration of the i th chemical t is time x is the 1 d longitudinal distance from the source u is the longitudinal velocity linear pore velocity of water d is the macroscopic coefficient of dispersion the exact analytical solution and parameter definitions are presented in the supplementary information si modified runkel equations the dispersive diffusive coefficient in eq 1 modified with the mti is given by 2 d α l u d o τ t where α l is the longitudinal dispersivity of the porous medium d o is the bi molecular free phase coefficient of diffusion and τ is the diffusive tortuosity of the mean free path it is important to note that many past modelling efforts define diffusive tortuosity τ inversely to the definition of advective tortuosity τ a presented here i e τ l l mfp for the diffusive flux τ a l mfp l for the advective flux clennell 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013 ma and selim 1994 maraqa et al 1997 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 the definition of advective tortuosity we have chosen is still commonplace in literature and was chosen to satisfy the limiting conditions of the conceptual modelling approach presented in the discussion it is also important to note that chemical retardation of non conservative solutes can still be incorporated within the mti framework for a conservative tracer the retardation factor r i is equal to one eq 3 presents a typical calculation for the retardation factor for a non conservative solute in unsaturated conditions 3 r i 1 k d ρ b θ w k ai a ai θ w where r i is the retardation factor of the i th species k d is the solid phase partitioning coefficient ρ b is the solid phase bulk density θ w is the total water content or wetting phase volume fraction k ai is the air water interfacial partitioning coefficient and a ai is the air water interfacial area finally traditional solute dispersion transport parameters must be considered for successful application of this approach the advective parameter in eq 1 is described by eq 4 4 u v linear q θ w where u is the macroscopic longitudinal velocity that is the same as v linear the average linear pore velocity and q is the darcy flux the approach we proposed here was developed and tested using a conserative non reactive solute sodium chloride nacl which was the solute employed for all column studies described herein batch sorption tests were conducted for the silica sand to ensure sorption was negligible si batch sorption tests lumping the effects of advective tortuosity and the mobile immobile ratio into a single parameter allows for the measurement of the effect on the macroscopic btc as a function of the effective saturation as the mti is introduced as a semi emperical parameter a physically based functional realtionship to the effective saturation was not yet known hence we investigated the fitting of power law relationships which are consistent with other semi empirical relationships of transport parameters in unsaturated porous media and with limiting conditions as effective saturation approaches zero millington and quirk 1961 moldrup et al 1999 moldrup et al 1997 padilla et al 1999 penman 1940 this study theorizes that the darcy equation can quantify the impact of non fickian transport using a single lumped parameter term while the exact form of this term depends on the wetting and non wetting fluid as well as the porous media characteristics hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 a direct correllation should exist between pore scale flow properties the physical parameters which determine solute transport and macroscopic observations of wetting phase fraction in the porous media in other words the exact form of the mass transfer relationship is determined by the capillary pressure p c and peclet number of the wetting phase pe w at the pore scale these pore scale properties determine changes in the mobile immobile water ratio θ m θ i m and the advective tortuosity τ a which impact solute transport but we hypothesize these pore scale physics impacting solute transport are well correllated with the effective saturation s e described in eq 5 for a specific combination of wetting and non wetting fluid in a homogeneous porous media 5 s e θ w θ r θ s θ r s s r 1 s r where θ w is the water content θ r is the residual water content θ s is the saturated water content or porosity s is the saturation and s r is the residual saturation 2 2 experimental materials and methods 2 2 1 measurement equipment and column construction three rectangular cross section soil columns 110 cm length x 7 cm width x 5 cm thick interior dimensions were constructed out of 1 24 cm thick polycarbonate a length greater than 1 m was chosen to help promote uniform steady state flow under unsaturated conditions long column setup the rectangular design of the columns was chosen to facilitate high accuracy measurements from the x ray absorbance spectroscopy system described below a rectangular funnel was 3 d printed from poly lactic acid pla filament and placed in the base of the column to prevent dead volume and direct flow out of the base of the column a total length of 102 cm in the column was packed with medium grained sand for the study a 3 d printed pla dispersion plate and a 3 cm gravel pack were placed on top of the column to produce uniform water distribution across the flow section pla was chosen for its ease of access and insolubility in most common solvents i e methanol and isopropyl alcohol sato et al 2013 columns were packed with air dried high purity 99 sio2 silica sands from the unimin corporation the sands were medium sized 0 35 mm effective diameter rounded grains with a high degree of uniformity cu 1 43 the porosity of the sand was initially determined gravimetrically and volumetrically in 15 cm liquid chromatography columns the columns were purged with co2 for 90 min prior to filling with water from the top and bottom of the column to ensure the removal of any insoluble air pockets in the system ulrich et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 the fully saturated columns were then scanned with the x ray system to measure the water content conservative tracer transport experiments for saturated and unsaturated conditions were conducted using a standard methodology reported in literature brusseau et al 2015 lyu et al 2018 peng and brusseau 2005 this method achieves uniform water content and steady state flow by connecting peristaltic pumps to the top and bottom of the columns and slowly adjusting the outflow rate as needed to decrease or increase water content the real time water content temperature and electrical conductivity of the wetting fluid were measured at three points along the length of each column 18 cm 51 cm 83 cm using high accuracy soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity sensors once water content measurements from the sensors stabilized high spatial resolution measurements of water content along the length of the column were determined using princeton gamma technology intrinsic germanium detector and pantak unipolar series 2 hf 100 x ray generator using x ray absorption spectroscopy x ray scans were conducted throughout the course of every conservative tracer experiment to ensure water content distribution was uniform longitudinally across the column all experiments were conducted at ambient temperatures 15 22 c 2 2 2 tracer test experimental methods two high precision masterflex l s multichannel pumps were attached to the top and bottom of the columns respectively platinum cured l s 17 masterflex tubing was used to ensure minimal retention of salt tracer on tubing conservative solute transport tests were performed at three ranges of partial saturations 90 100 saturation 65 85 saturation and 40 60 saturation to construct the t s e curves because two multi channel pump heads were used to control inlet and outlet flow in all three columns variations in column construction and sand packing caused some variation in saturation 5 from one another in each set of tests the tracer tests were performed with 0 05 0 5 and 5 0 g l of nacl respectively to evaluate whether the mti is independent of the tracer concentrations i e if the mti is purely a physical property of the soil water system the conductivity sensors recorded values at 5 min intervals along the length of the column to create the tracer btcs in addition the conductivity was also measured at different depths along the column to determine if the mti was scale dependent experiments were conducted in triplicate at three saturation ranges three solute concentrations and in three columns for mid range darcy flow rates a total of 27 experiments the three conductivity sensors per column at 18 cm 51 cm and 83 cm downstream resulted in a total of 81 btcs for the mid range flow rate experiments two low flow rate experiments were conducted in the same three columns at 100 and 85 saturation to observe the mti at low flow rate conditions low flow experiments were conducted in triplicate columns and produced an additional 18 btcs finally two high flow rate experiments were conducted in the same three columns to test the limiting condition of high flow rates the sensors in the columns have a maximum logging rate of 1 log every 5 min because the flow rates were so fast the sensors could not adequately capture the elution front of the salt tracer the conductivity of the tracer in the high flow rate experiments were monitored at the outlet using an orion conductivity probe and a small volume flow through cell these were conducted in triplicate and produced 6 btcs table 1 details the experimental conditions included in this study 2 2 3 data analysis methods analysis of the tracer btcs was done using the traditional method of moments as well as a customized python program hereby referred to as the mti estimator program which implemented the analytical solution of the 1 d formulation of the ade incorporating the mti i e eq 1 the program uses a trust region foundational curve fitting scheme available in the scipy stats library for inverse parameter estimation a beta version of this software is available on github in a windows compatible exe format stults 2020 validation of the mti estimator program was done using the stanmod cxtfit code simunek and toride 2013 analysis of x ray spectroscopic data was done using fundamental principles of x ray attenuation described in past work for this system ferré et al 2005 another custom program written in python was used to parse and process the x ray data files the data from the x ray system was collected and controlled using a custom labview program ferré et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray absorption and soil moisture sensor data high spatial density x ray scans were combined with high temporal density water content measurements from in situ sensors to ensure the saturation remained relatively constant along the length of each column this was a critical control as the mti depends on the degree of saturation the x ray system accuracy was 1 0 for liquid water according to cuvet calibration tests the precision of the x ray system varied with temperature and signal strength but was typically 2 for ambient conditions with good signal to noise ratio ferré et al 2005 the soil moisture sensors had a volumetric water content accuracy of 2 when used in field soils with low saturation extracts meter 2019 results of the x ray scan data and soil moisture data showed neither the total water content nor the distribution of water along the length of three columns and varied significantly over the course of the experiments fig 3 illustrates the uniformity in saturation across the length of all three columns and three different experimental conditions the consistency of the water saturation in the columns enabled the use a steady state assumption in modelling low flow rates were used in the majority of experiments to ensure there was little change in the macroscopic peclet number between the experiments this ensured any observed changes in the mti were only the result of varying saturations used in each experiment 3 2 validation using stanmod cxtfit the mti estimation code was tested against a thoroughly validated inverse parameter estimation code stanmod cxtfit simunek and toride 2013 to evaluate its performance the cxtfit code estimated the mti by using the x ray attenuation measured water content rather than the effective water content to calculate the linear pore velocity from darcy flow rate cxtfit inversion of btc data was then used to solve for the values of r i and d retardation factor and the macroscopic coefficient of dispersion sodium chloride behaves as a conservative tracer in the sandy porous media used in this study resulting in a retardation factor of 1 no sorption because the retardation factor for the conservative tracer is presumed equal to 1 the r i value drops out of the left hand side lhs of eq 1 leaving the t value as the lone lhs coefficient the methodology was demonstrated in fig 4 and the supporting information supporting info the goodness of fit information from cxtfit was compared to the goodness of fit information from the mti estimator to ensure proper error tolerance the estimated r i and d values produced by cxtfit were compared to the estimated t and d produced by the mti estimator program all of the estimated parameter values were within one standard deviation of error and in most cases were nearly identical to 3 significant figures indicating the mti estimator performed as expected fig 4 is a presentation of fitted tracer data using cxtfit and the custom mti estimator software 3 3 btc results the validity of the experimental data gathered for each data point was determined using goodness of fit metrics automatically generated by the mti estimator for this study results from the curve fitting system were considered valid when the r squared value was greater than 0 9 and the percent mass error from the simulated curve and the data was 20 of the 105 btcs and individual mti values 99 94 3 adhered to the validity criteria outlined above most of the invalidated data points were due to low concentration experiments 0 05 g l being near the limit of quantitation for the conductivity sensors a highly uniform medium grained sand was chosen to help facilitate a variety of flow rates and to ensure rapid solute exchange from mobile to immobile zones the rapid exchange of solute between mobile and immobile zones was evident in the btcs from the experiments which were very symmetrical under both saturated and unsaturated conditions because of the symmetry present in the btcs it was determined the standard ade could be properly adapted for this proof of concept study representative btcs for all three columns under saturated and unsaturated conditions for mid and low flow rates are presented with both linear and logarithmic axes in fig 5 4 mti results and analysis using the mti conceptual framework we then inferred the form of the t s e relationship using information from a limiting condition and then validated the form of the equation using experimental evidence 4 1 limiting condition low water content

is clear that t must approach infinity as s e approaches zero to eliminate advective mass flux u from the equation a mathematical representation of this limiting condition is presented in eq 7 7 lim s e 0 t s e note that even as s e approaches zero and t approaches infinity eq 6 still allows for diffusive mass transfer within the rev albeit severely limited by diffusive tortuosity 4 2 t se relationship for mid range flow data previously inverse power law type relationships which satisfy the limiting condition in eq 7 have been observed between important mass transfer parameters i e macroscopically defined coefficient of dispersion and decreasing water contents lim et al 1998 maraqa et al 1997 padilla et al 1999 therefore an inverse power law and inverse natural logarithm type relationships were fit to the effective saturation and the mti data the t s e relationships for the bulk sand in all three replicate columns for the mid flow rate tests experiments 1 1 3 3 from table 1 are presented in fig 6 typical goodness of fit measures such as the r squared are not suitable for non linear problems spiess and neumeyer 2010 a combination of pearson rank correlation values calculated using the scipy stats library and the total percent residuals were evaluated to represent the non parametric and parametric goodness of fits respectively sheskin 2007 while both the power law and natural logarithm fits performed well the power law fit had a lower average percent error and a higher pearson rank correlation coefficient this suggests the power law type relationship is the more representative of t as function of effective saturation the equation for the inverse power law type relationship is presented in eq 8 8 t s e b s e n where n is the polynomial fitting parameter of the t s e relationship where n 0 for the inverse power law relationships and b is the full saturation intercept fitting parameter or the fully saturated effective porosity of the t s e relationship the parameter t is considered a function of effective saturation which is different for each combination of porous media regarding wetting and non wetting fluid while the type of porous media and the wetting fluids are the primary drivers of non fickian transport in this conceptual model there are several significant factors which can increase non fickian transport under unsaturated conditions these factors include pore scale differences due to packing of the column channelization from air pocket trapping or physical disturbances and changes to the water content distribution caused by the rate of drainage of the porous medium birkholzer and tsang 1997 hasan et al 2020 kapetas et al 2014 mahadevan et al 2012 padilla et al 1999 ideally all columns would have identical drainage rates when reducing saturation and identical flow rates when performing steady state tracer tests unfortunately this experimental setup required all three column effluent lines be attached to a single multi channel pump head because of minor differences in the column construction and tubing configuration each column had slightly different drainage rates and flow rates si compiled mti data for these reasons we chose to analyze the t s e relationship for each column separately to ensure the trend in eq 8 was applicable under all conditions results of the individual column analyses are presented in fig 7 and table 2 results of the power law fitting for each column produced very good correlation measures with the theoretical fit for all three columns and the bulk data average percent errors ranged from 7 9 14 0 and pearson correlation coefficients were greater than or very close to 0 8 indicating relatively small prediction errors and excellent correlation furthermore fitted parameters for each column and the bulk fit had relatively small standard errors the predicted values for n and b were within the standard errors of one another for all three columns indicating similar results across all three columns these similar values high correlations and low percent errors supports the theory that the mti can be accurately estimated based solely on the degree of saturation in the porous medium additionally the effect of rapid drainage on the t s e relationship can be observed in the differences in the goodness of fit between the three columns rapid drainage has been demonstrated to enhance the effects of channelization in porous media through dislodging of small particles and through infiltration of air pockets into tight pore spaces after water is dislodged mahadevan et al 2012 these observations are supported by pore scale models which demonstrate how pressure changes of an infiltrating wetting front can influence non fickian transport in unsaturated porous media hasan et al 2019 because the mti theory considers water saturation to be uniform within the rev channelization from rapid drainage presumably results in deviations from the eq 8 prediction column b had relatively fast drainage rate compared to columns a c and exhibited the most deviation from the eq 8 prediction column a had the slowest and most controlled drainage while column c had a slightly faster drainage rate with less control column a had the best correlation with eq 8 while measurements from column c had more deviation this provides evidence to suggest that deviations from the mti can occur when channelization or other factors cause heterogeneity of water flow in the rev despite these deviations the mti correlations were still quite accurate in all three columns another source of non uniform water flow are pockets of mass transfer limited immobile water developing in an otherwise uniform and highly mobile system the sand in this study was intentionally chosen because of its high uniformity and relatively large grain sizes which indicate a lack of significant mass transfer limitations in this type of sand advective tortuosity and mobile immobile zone solute exchange have the same effect on the btc and are therefore inseparable theoretically in a sand where mobile immobile zone solute exchange is rate limited the mim can be used to calculate the mobile volume fraction and rate constant therefore while the mti concept is not directly applicable when rate limited transfer is present using the mim in combination with the mti concept should enable direct calculation of advective flux tortuosity furthermore this advective flux tortuosity should obey a similar power law relationship like that of the mti a secondary dataset padilla et al 1999 which used a similar chemically inert sand with mass transfer limitations was analyzed to test this hypothesis the results of this analysis are presented in the supplementary information si padilla et al tortuosity analysis the results of this analysis demonstrate that while the mti quantification is not necessarily applicable for all soil types concepts from the mti can be incorporated into more robust models of solute transport to enhance their accuracy furthermore advective tortuosity obeys the same inverse power law type relationship established for the mti si padilla et al tortuosity analysis 4 3 analysis of t se relationship accounting for concentration or length scale variability this study was designed to enable btcs and their associated t values to be measured at three points downstream in the column and experiments were conducted with three nacl concentrations see table 1 this was done to test the impact of solute concentration or length scale on the calculated t value the conceptual development of the mti indicates that the predicted values of t should not vary with longitudinal distance of the measurement point nor solute concentration any correlated variability with solute concentration or measurement distance would suggest a conceptual flaw in the underlying theory or an experimental design flaw i e the presence of significant interactions between the solute and the media unsteady state to determine whether there was any discernable correlation with longitudinal observation point or solute concentrations the linear regression presented in eq 8 was performed on each subset of categorical length and concentration data the results of this analysis are presented in fig 8 results of this analysis show minimal variability in the t s e relationships when data were categorized by longitudinal distance of the measurement point some minor variability in the t s e relationship was observed in the regressions when categorized by solute concentration however the predicted parameter values were well within the 95 c i estimation of one another si convolutional function data the same observations are noted for the length scale correlations results from the categorical regressions of mid flow rate data suggest the underlying theory of the mti is correct 4 4 flow rate impacts on the t se relationship and comparison to diffusive tortuosity during preliminary data analysis of the mid range flow rate mti data a weak but non negligible correlation was observed between the linear pore velocity and the predicted value of t this observation is in keeping with conceptual theory supported by pore scale models and experimental evidence hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 hasan et al 2020 observed the macroscopic peclet number for the system influenced the ratio of mobile to immobile water content at the pore scale increasing the ratio of total immobile water to the total mobile water would logically increase the impact of non fickian transport in a porous media therefore we hypothesized that we would observe a correlation between flow rate and the t s e relationship the low and high flow rate experiments outlined in table 1 conducted to test this hypothesis were performed at full saturation and the 65 85 range of effective saturation under high and low flow rate conditions in all three columns the low flow experiments had specific darcy fluxes and linear pore velocities approximately 3 5 times lower than that of the original experiments while the high flow experiments were conducted at specific discharges and linear pore velocities around 100 fold higher than the original mid flow rate experiments as shown in table 1 the mti was estimated using the same methodology described for the original mid flow rate experiments and linear regression was performed on these data using eq 7 to find the best fit as both the diffusive tortuosity and the mti can be interpreted as a resistance to advective and diffusive solute fluxes we believed it was pertinent to compare the t s e relationships measured in these experiments with predicted diffusive tortuosity vs saturation relationship for the same medium there are two important notes regarding the mti and diffusive tortuosity first the mti was developed as the inverse of the diffusive tortuosity to satisfy a limiting condition in eq 7 second the diffusive tortuosity is a function of the total saturation not the effective saturation the t s e data are presented alongside the inverse of the moldrup et al 1997 equation for liquid phase diffusive tortuosity in fig 9 results from these experiments show that while the t s e relationship is somewhat sensitive to changes in flow rate in the mid to low flow rate range rapid flow rates can induce highly non fickian transport in porous media this is consistent with other experimental studies which demonstrate that increasing flow rate and grain size can cause deviations from flow rates predicted by the darcy s law i q relationship van lopik et al 2017 these results also demonstrate a direct correlation between increasing flow rate and increasing t values in the t s e relationship this evidence is congruent with current evidence from experimental studies and pore scale modelling hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 the low flow rate experiments produced t values that were similar but slightly lower on average to the t values from the mid flow rate experiments there was also a noticeable decrease in the predicted t values at the extrapolated lower end of the t s e curve furthermore there is a noticeable flattening towards 1 of the predicted t s e relationship for the low flow rate experiments this correlation indicates the mti correction becomes less important as diffusive flux starts to dominate over advective flux in keeping with the general theory of the mti further investigation at very low flow rates i e macroscopic peclet number in the 0 01 1 0 range would be required to confirm this observation the final major finding of this study is the notable difference between the inverse diffusive tortuosity saturation τ 1 s and the t s e relationship diffusive tortuosity impedes the diffusive solute flux in unsaturated porous media much more dramatically than the resistance to advective flux from increasingly non fickian transport at lower saturations furthermore many realistic soils will likely have t s e relationships with t values much less than one over most of the effective saturation range 0 1 this is because advective transport in field soils occurs in a small fraction of the total wetting phase volume payne et al 2008 this concept is typically referred to as the effective porosity or the mobile porosity of the medium payne et al 2008 while there is likely to be increased mobile and immobile zone solute exchange in these soils resulting in increased non fickian transport it has been demonstrated that the effective porosity of real soils often results in solute breakthrough 5 10 times earlier than predicted from the darcy flux water content relationship horton et al 1988 this 5 10 times earlier breakthrough corresponds to an mti of 0 1 0 2 at full saturation further investigation of the t s e relationship of real soils for typical saturations and flow rates is needed results from experimental analysis of real soils will indicate whether linear pore velocity is typically overestimated t 1 or underestimated t 1 from the standard darcy relationship 5 conclusions 5 1 comparison to previous studies and modelling efforts the mti model attempts to take the well studied effective porosity technique and method of moments used in saturated flow and scale them to work under variably saturated conditions using this simple experimentally supported semi empirical correlation researchers can now better account for non fickian transport in unsaturated porous media without the use of complex numerical models furthermore the introduction of a term which can account for advective flux tortuosity in the mobile phase represents a significant step forward in our understanding of flow and transport in unsaturated porous media however the mti method alone cannot capture some processes i e rate limited mobile immobile zone solute exchange which impact observations of solute transport the mti should be considered a technique which can supplement more complex models indeed this proof of concept study was designed to demonstrate how the mti could be successfully incorporated into more complex models such as the mim mrmt stochastic convection f ade or ctrw models as a supplement to this study we have demonstrated how the mti concept can be used in combination with the mim to directly quantify the correlation between effective saturation and advective flux tortuosity si padilla et al tortuosity analysis while a high purity silica sand was selected because of its inert sorptive properties uniform sand media is not necessarily the most conducive to the mti theory flow in sandy media can transition from the traditional mualem pipe flow at higher saturations to sheet flow at lower saturations the sheet flow transition causes a discontinuity in the physical mechanisms of transport at lower s e 0 30 effective saturations the mti is likely more useful for agricultural or less uniform soils where pipe flow is persistent across the entire range of effective saturation 5 2 implications for future work considering unsaturated advective transport of solutes future work on the transport of reactive solutes in unsaturated porous media can benefit from use of the mti method which allows for the correction for the non fickian component of the pore scale transport when estimating mass flux at the macroscopic scale most unsaturated transport models such as hydrus or feflow use the relationship between darcy flux based on relative permeability and water content to predict the linear pore velocity of solutes dhi wasy dhi wasy gmbh 2005 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 this relationship between the darcy flux and water content demonstrated in eq 4 has been widely used because past efforts regarding advective transport in the vadose zone were primarily optimized and utilized for the prediction of darcy flux rather than solute transport while darcy flux and linear pore velocity are correlated it is established that the standard darcy flux water content relationship is often unreliable for predicting solute movement in saturated soils horton et al 1988 the effective porosity based on the fraction of the porosity that contributes to mobile flow is shown to provide accurate estimations of solute advective transport in saturated media horton et al 1988 payne et al 2008 the theoretical underpinnings of the effective porosity technique and evidence from recent studies hasan et al 2020 hasan et al 2019 demonstrate that using the darcy flux water content approximation of linear pore velocity will produce inaccurate results of simulated solute transport in saturated and unsaturated conditions the same non fickian processes which result in the difference between measured and effective porosity are primarily controlled by immobile water which becomes increasingly important as saturation decreases the mti method takes the underlying idea of the effective porosity method and scales it to a correlation with effective saturation which can account for pore scale non fickian transport in a macroscopic model while existing macroscopic models can accurately simulate many important features of solute transport in unsaturated porous media dhi wasy dhi wasy gmbh 2005 guo et al 2020 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the correct prediction of linear pore velocity is essential for simulating the transport of widespread emerging contaminants that are reactive e g pfass in the vadose zone hatton et al 2018 5 3 suggestions for correcting models and improving future studies the mti method was designed to be easily integrated into existing models of unsaturated solute transport a t s e relationship can easily be determined for a porous medium with wetting and non wetting fluids of interest using a simple btc experiment with a conservative solute once the t s e relationship is determined the predicted t value simply divides the linear pore velocity calculated using the standard darcy flux water content relationship a custom written mti estimation program was compiled for windows and made readily available to users who wish to calculate the mti using conservative btc data stults 2020 because the mti was formulated similarly to the retardation factor term it can also be calculated using a method of moments technique this is done by creating a relative concentration dimensionless time btc using a conservative tracer as demonstrated in fig 5 and then calculating the actual dimensionless breakthrough time compared to the predicted breakthrough time dimensionless time equal to 1 by calculating the mti for a variably saturated porous medium before estimating the retardation factor researchers can better assess the impact of non fickian transport in their studies a standard correction should also be made to the traditional mim mrmt ctrw f ade and stochastic convection model to include and advective tortuosity term for advective solutes 6 summary a conceptual model was developed to macroscopically quantify pore scale non fickian transport processes which are dependent on wetting fluid saturation porous media characteristics wetting and non wetting phase interactions and wetting fluid hydrodynamics under equilibrium conditions these non fickian processes could be macroscopically quantified using a single lumped parameter term t referred to as the mass transfer index mti a strong correlation was observed between the mti and the effective saturation a semi empirical relationship between the mti and effective saturation was inferred from a limiting condition and results from past studies of transport in unsaturated soils this relationship referred to as the t s e relationship was calculated and validated through careful experimental observations the development of the mti method significantly advances the understanding and ability to predict solute transport in unsaturated soils credit

1387,water security is essential for sustainable economic and social development to ensure water security water engineering projects play an important role in regional developing program the coastal city zhuhai city suffers a challenge from both future increasing water demand and salinity intrusion to keep water security of the city several alternative projects are designed however as the high cost of the projects and the potential adverse influence a final projects portfolio as well as their construction order has not be decided to assist a proper decision of projects portfolio for local water security this study proposed a combined method with one vote veto and analytic hierarchy process to evaluate every projects portfolio from various perspectives the results show 1 to satisfy future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h it is recommended to adopt a projects portfolio including expanding existing reservoirs and constructing new reservoirs as its higher capacity utilization 96 87 relatively lower construction and operation costs 8 59 billion and 57 million respectively and lower ecological impact 2 to satisfy future water demand of 160 thousands m3 h or more transferring water from other cities should be an indispensable part for water security 3 channel reservoir is not recommended as its high construction and operation costs and high ecological impact this study evaluated different alternative projects for cities water security and provided a strong support for local government to decide their long term projects portfolio and their construction order the proposed method may be readily applied in other regions keywords water security salinity intrusion one vote veto analytic hierarchy process zhuhai city 1 introduction water security is one of the key issues for human society anca et al 2010 zhang and wang 2015 yin et al 2020 shortage of clean and available water resources restrict the sustainable economic and social development jain 2012 jia et al 2010 however water shortage is very common worldwide tsanis et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 wildman jr and forde 2012 schlamovitz and becker 2020 ladan 2019 kareem 2015 in 2017 844 million people lacked access to safe drinking water who 2017 marina et al 2018 bassel et al 2019 under the definition that water stress or extreme lack of water to satisfy human or ecological demands occurs when water supply 1700m3 person year rijsberman 2006 an estimated 2 billion people live under squalid conditions in areas of high water stress who 2008 obade and moore 2018 water shortage occurs due to natural or social factors natural factors include little precipitation uneven distribution of water resources episodic environmental disasters etc social factors include contaminants growing human population escalation in geopolitical conflicts and so on obade and moore 2018 salman et al 2014 wang et al 2019 nabi et al 2019 gu et al 2012 brown et al 2019 slavikova et al 2017 nowadays water shortage caused by social factors becomes a more and more serious problem especially in developing cities the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area is a typical humid area suffering water shortage as its booming human population and poor water quality reservoirs and water transfer projects play an important role for water source security for example shenzhen city in china constructed a reservoir of 0 18 billion capacity to store its alternate water sources which may satisfy cities water demand for 60 days the dong shen water supply engineering supplies 110 000 m3 freshwater for hong kong every year accounting for a major portion of water demand however water engineering can also cause unexpected adverse effects mono basin in california because of the large amount of water being diverted to los angeles experienced serious flow decrease causing serious public losses marston and cai 2016 aswan dam in egypt also caused downstream soil fertility decline salinization and other problems kashef 1981 shalash 1982 in the early days to evaluation a water engineering objective and constrains mainly focused on water dimension satisfied water demand is fundamental purpose there was a lack of interactive analysis on the social and economic factors with social development it is more closely between water resources utilization and regional economic development further various ecological problems caused by excessive exploitation and utilization of water resources has been paid more and more attention vörösmarty et al 2010 lehner et al 2011 experience with dam building warns that traditional approaches to water infrastructure development in a rapidly changing world carry severe risks of economic and environmental failure poff et al 2015 as a result it is particular important to conduct a considerate evaluation for water engineering necessity effectiveness and influences in both human economic needs and ecosystem health before construction rockström et al 2015 to assist an optimization water security strategy planning a large number of researches have done great contribution for example spiller et al 2015 defined the terms adaptive flexible and robust for water systems engineering and provided guidelines to select flexible designs for urban development types the research specified an evaluating indices system for the engineering similar research including hering et al 2013 wilderer and schreff 2000 another research direction is introducing a decision framework that explores trade offs in stakeholder about certain engineering e g poff et al 2015 zeitoun et al 2016 it is designed to manage risk of uncertainty and provide guidance to managers and decision makers by focusing on the vulnerability of engineering and ecological indicators to a range of hydrologic futures moreover some research applied a water energy food nexus approach to evaluate how a water resources program influencing food or energy system for instance bassel et al 2019 applied the approach to evaluate how different water engineering bridges the water gap in texas flammini et al 2014 proposed a water energy food method to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of different water projects those research evaluates performance of water resources engineering beyond water dimension which is in line with nowadays situation where connections between different systems are very close as mentioned evaluating performance of certain water engineering from multi indices multi stakeholders or cross system is important moreover for a region undergone the water security strategy planning decision makers prefer a long term projects portfolio that can satisfied increasing future water demand constrained by capital or other factors projects in the portfolio would not be constructed at the same time so a construction order of projects portfolio should also be optimized for both satisfying increasing water demand and capital efficiency however there hasn t been much research on this problem to address these requirements this study introduced a combined method with one vote veto and analytical hierarchy process ahp to select the optimal projects portfolio under different future water demand and to recommend the construction order for projects portfolio 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area zhuhai city is one of the five special economic zones in china in 2019 population of zhuhai is 2 02 million and gross regional product gdp is 343 6 billion cny it is located in the main estuary of the pearl river 21 48 22 27 n and 113 03 114 19 e has an area of 1732 km2 hills and plains account for 58 6 and 25 5 of the total land area its average annual precipitation is 2009 mm however due to lack of terrain for building large reservoirs most of rainfall goes straight to the sea the pearl river offers abundant water resources about 122 73 billion m3 a for zhuhai city however its temporal distribution is disproportional majority of the water is in rainy season april to september in dry season relatively less river flow causes a lower water level and causes seawater to flow back into inland rivers i e salinity intrusion rahman et al 2017 salinity intrusion is a seasonal natural phenomenon along the coastal areas talukder et al 2015 rahman and rahman 2015 if salinity intrusion flows back to water intakes the intake can not get freshwater as shown in fig 1 we drew a red line where chlorinity in water was up to 250 mg l according to historical observation data from hydrometric stations the area from the red line to the coast is salinity intrusion range the entire zhuhai city is located in the range causing a great threat to city s water security actually from 2003 to 2005 zhuhai city suffered serious water shortage due to the persistent salinity intrusion severe salinity intrusion also happened in 2019 to address the threat zhuhai city has created a river reservoir linking system rrl in the rrl system water intakes in the river are connected to reservoirs by pipelines fig 1 when water intakes work properly they not only satisfy water demand but also transfer freshwater to reservoir for storage when the intakes cannot work due to salinity intrusion the reservoir storage can then be offered as the supplement to satisfy the water demand depending on the rrl system zhuhai city successfully addresses the salinity intrusion problem and maintains water security aiming to become a great city with a population of 5 million zhuhai city is facing a new challenge that is to meet the predicted future water demand of 1 35 billion m3 a and a new strategy for water security is needed to be designed since the existing rrl system may not completely meet the requirement 2 2 basic projects basic projects are alternative for zhuhai city to satisfy future water demand we call them basic just because one or more of them can be combined as projects port folio project 1 p1 and project 2 p2 aim to build new valley reservoirs with storage capacity of 50 million m3 and 10 million m3 respectively projects 3 p3 and project 4 p4 aim to expand the existing east adding 19 million m3 storage capacity and west reservoirs adding 20 million m3 storage capacity respectively projects 5 p5 and projects 6 p6 plan to construct channel reservoirs topographically there is little advantage in building large valley reservoirs as a result constructing the channel reservoirs have been frequently discussed in recent years the construction of p5 and p6 may offer 24 million m3 capacity and 54 million m3 storage capacity respectively another strategy is diverting water from other cities project 7 p7 and project 8 p8 transfer water from zs city and jm city with ability of 1 2 million m3 d and 1 3 million m3 d respectively 2 3 water resources allocation we built a water resources allocation model calculated how different projects portfolio contributes to satisfy cities water demand under a severe salinity intrusion scenario 2 3 1 scenario of salinity intrusion the historical observation record of salinity intrusion from october 2004 to march 2005 see figure 2 was chosen as the baseline scenario to evaluate performance of different projects as the severe salinity intrusion event in recent years it caused a persistent freshwater shortage in zhuhai city thus this case study may help to evaluate the performance of different alternative projects in an adverse situation chlorinity is the parameter used for judging salinity the chlorinity was recorded hourly at three water intakes which are marked as green dots in fig 1 generally the water intakes supplies the city with pumping water from rivers however according to regulation in china if chlorinity around certain water intake was greater than 250 mg l the intake was required to shut down temporary as the result guangchang intake wi 1 was shut down 85 2 of the time while pinggang wi 2 and huangyanghe intake wi 4 were shut down 16 06 and 14 69 of the time respectively in the period from september of 2004 to march of 2005 2 3 2 water demand in late 2018 0 56 billion m3 water resources was consumed in zhuhai city of which 26 5 and 56 1 were supplied for industry and municipal usage respectively according to urban development goals zhuhai city may support 5 million population with predicted future water demand about 1 3 billion m3 a by 2035 to this end the future water demand is defined as 150 000 m3 h in this study moreover due to the uncertainty of the future water demand the water demand in the range from 120 000 m3 h to 190 000 m3 h is applied to evaluate optimal projects portfolio suiting different demands 2 3 3 allocation rules as previously mentioned zhuhai city has a rrl system cities water demand was primarily provided by the intakes in river the intakes and reservoir storage may complement each other as following under the situation of intakes shutdown due to high chlorinity fresh water may then be supplemented by the storage in reservoirs the reservoir storage may also be supplemented by the intakes after satisfying cities water demand the rrl system has shown to efficiently help zhuhai city address the salinity intrusion efficiently to reduce the freshwater shortage allocation rules are followed in allocation models for the alternative projects only water intake or storage capacity are re adjusted 2 3 4 constrains 1 salinity constraint for a given water intake the freshwater amount offered is defined based on the shutdown chlorinity of 250 mg l as 1 a jt 0 q jt 250 mg l a j q jt 250 mg l where j is number of water intake a jt is the freshwater amount that intake j can offer at time t q jt is the chlorinity at intake j at time t a j is the design capability of intake j 2 intakes constraint the sum of a jt a jt can be divided into three parts one for satisfying water demand q1 one for reservoirs supplementing storage q2 the rest is unutilized capacity q3 according to the allocation rules a jt is primarily used to satisfy the water demand the excess will be stored in reservoirs if all reservoirs are full the excess is considered as the unutilized capacity 2 a jt q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t 3 reservoirs constraint the reservoir constraints are defined as 3 v t 1 v t q 2 t q 4 t 4 v min v t v max 5 q 4 t v t v min 6 q 2 t v max v t where v t and v t 1 represent the reservoir storage at time t and t 1 respectively v min and v max represent the dead storage and total storage respectively q2 t represents the water amount pumped from water intakes q4 t represents reservoirs outflow furthermore to simulated a more severe scenario no inflow generated by precipitation is considered in this study the outflow is diverted to satisfy water demand only 4 water demand constraints water demands are satisfied in two ways water from intakes and water from the reservoirs based on the allocation rules water from intakes is mainly applied to satisfy water demand under the condition that water demand cannot be satisfied by water from intakes water from the reservoirs may be applied as the supplement 7 x t q 1 t q 4 t 8 x t d x t is the total amount of supplied water at time point t d is the total water demand at time point t 2 4 projects evaluation 2 4 1 evaluation indices 1 satisfied demand the satisfied demand sd is a key index to evaluate different projects portfolio it can be expressed as η1 i e the percentage of time steps that all water demand are satisfied p t 100 as 9 η 1 n m 100 p t x t d 100 10 in eq 9 n is the number of times steps at which all water demands are satisfied m is the total time steps in a research period 2 capacity utilization the capacity utilization cu is ratio of total q4 t to v max it is considered to evaluate whether the projects portfolio is over scale the over scale projects portfolio could satisfy water demand well however water resources stored in reservoirs were underutilized 11 η 2 q 4 t v max 100 3 other evaluation indices we also consider construction and operation cost cc and oc respectively degree of ecological environmental impact deei and difficulty degree of approval dda to evaluate projects from economic ecological and administrative perspectives respectively the construction cost is evaluated according to projects portfolio estimates the operation cost is calculated by energy consumption in pumping water both in water storage process and water transfer process the deei is marked a value in 0 0 5 1 depending on its ecological influence deei is set as 1 for the projects portfolio with greater influence deei is set as 0 for the projects portfolio with no influence otherwise deei is set as 0 5 dda evaluates whether the projects portfolio is in conflict with other existing policy dda is set as 1 for the projects portfolio that is in conflict with existing policy otherwise dda is set as 0 2 4 2 evaluation method one vote veto and analytic hierarchy process ahp are used to compare and select optimal projects portfolio the optimal project portfolio is obtained as following i satisfied demand is the index for one vote veto in this step the projects portfolio were applied to simulating water resources allocation under the defined scenario of salinity instruction according to the allocation results projects portfolio with 100 satisfied water demand were reserved for the next ahp evaluation ii applying ahp to evaluate the reserved project portfolios based on 5 other qualitative or quantitative indices indices have been preliminary ranked by method of paired comparison levels of relative importance of paired comparison are quantified by 1 3 5 7 9 as showed in table 1 finally the optimal project portfolio is obtained based on the ahp score i e the one with the highest ahp score see table 1 3 result 3 1 one vote veto based on satisfied demand first we evaluated performance of 8 basic projects one by one by the evaluation indices introduced in chapter 2 4 1 fig 3 graphs results of the indices of the basic projects respectively with defined future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h p1 p6 yield a low satisfied demand from 50 70 and a 100 capacity utilization it means that even with 100 reservoir storage utilization p1 p6 cannot meet future demand totally p7 and p8 may yield 100 satisfied demand by transferring water resources from other cities however the reservoir capacity utilization for p7 and p8 is 24 71 and 24 12 respectively which indicates p7 and p8 can almost supply future water demand and existing reservoir are underutilized from this point of view p7 or p8 is not an economic choice however for a one vote veto satisfied demand sd is the only metric that s considered so p7 and p8 is reserved in this stage and other projects are out of consideration moreover we evaluated performance of combination of basic projects as p7 or p8 can get a 100 sd already any projects combination with them are superfluous so only p1 p6 are applied for the combination every combination of basic projects is called projects portfolio in this paper we evaluated performance of every projects portfolio which are showed in fig 4 for one vote veto if a project portfolio could get a 100 sd it was depicted in orange color in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 when only two basic projects are combined sd can not reach 100 fig 4 a 100 satisfied water demand may be obtained with the combination of three or more alternative projects all projects portfolios that get 100 sd are reserved for next ahp evaluation including p7 and p8 3 2 ahp evaluation with one vote veto the projects which can not yield a 100 satisfied demand are out of consideration based on the rest indices ahp are applied to evaluate other projects portfolios the evaluation result are showed in fig 5 the highest score is assigned to the projects portfolio including p1 p3 p4 and p5 the red line in fig 5 capacity utilization of the projects portfolio is 96 87 meaning reservoirs capacity is used very well construction and operation costs are 8 59 billion and 57 million respectively moreover the deei and dda of the project are set as 1 meaning all contained projects in the projects portfolio have low ecological impact and are relatively easy to get approved under the ahp results to satisfied a future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h expanding water storage capacity the portfolio of p1 p3 p4 and p5 is better than transfer water from other cities p7 or p8 take p7 for an example p7 can get a satisfied demand of 100 however its reservoir capacity utilization is only 24 71 indicating existing reservoir storage is not utilized well moreover p7 results in relatively higher operation costs 74 million due to that large amount of water needs to be transferred from a long distance and also pumped to a relatively higher altitude specifically speaking the distance between water intake of p7 and r3 is almost 40 km and their elevation change is 41 m which caused the higher operation cost the ahp also indicated p5 is better than p6 to combine the projects portfolio under future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h p5 and p6 are both constructing channel reservoirs both of them have a relatively higher impact of environment and the ecology there difference are 1 p6 can offer a larger storage capacity 54 million m3 than p5 causing a relatively lower capacity utilization cu 2 p6 also yields the higher construction cost of 5 8 billion because its requirement of higher quality dam against storm tide and surrounding interception projects as for operation cost p6 is at a low altitude 0 m little electric consumption is required for water storage the operation cost is mainly incurred in transferring water from reservoir to water works which is about 0 07 billion year p5 is similar to p6 but p5 yields less construction cost and slightly higher operation cost compared to p6 3 3 under increasing water demand we also applied the one vote veto and ahp evaluation process to decided optimal projects portfolio under other situations in which the future water demands is increasing from 120 thousands m3 h to 190 thousands m3 h with the proposed method projects portfolio suiting different water demand is yielded as showed in table 2 when water demand is 120 130 thousands m3 h p3 satisfies all demand and yields the best overall score when water demand is 140 thousands m3 h the best option is projects portfolio with p1 and p3 when water demand increases to 160 thousands m3 h or 170 thousands m3 h p8 or p7 is the best choice respectively when water demand increases to 180 thousands m3 h the combination of p7 and p3 is the best option when water demand is 190 thousands m3 h the combination of p1 and p8 is the best option according to the results a strategy for the water security of zhuhai city can be concluded in what follows 1 p3 and p1 may be constructed firstly not only they can address a near term increasing demand from 120 thousands m3 h to 140 thousands m3 h but also p3 or p1 may be continue at work because they are the component of the optimal projects portfolio addressing long term increasing demand from 180 thousands m3 h to 190 thousands m3 h 2 p7 or p8 is totally necessary if water demand increased to 160 thousands m3 h or more under such water demand relaying on expanding local water storage capacity is no longer a better choice transferring water from other cities should be an indispensable part for zhuhai water resources as a result zhuhai should negotiate with jm city or zs city for the projects to be implemented properly 3 p2 and p6 should not be constructed because no optimal projects portfolio contains these two 4 p4 and p5 should not be constructed if water demand increases continuously p4 and p5 are selected only under the water demand of 150 thousands m3 h 4 discussion according to our results the proposed method contributes to local water security strategy planning from two aspects choose a superior project portfolios addressing future water demand increasing water demands is a challenge for many developing regions to satisfied future water demand water resources engineering play a more and more important role under a predicted future water demand there commonly are several alternative engineering projects and they can also be combined as many project portfolios choose a superior projects portfolio addressing future water demand is difficult not only supplying enough water resources but the cost efficiency and influence in environment and ecology should be considered the proposed method was established basing on these indices could yield a comprehensive evaluation among different portfolios and provide a strong support for local decision makers to choose a superiors one plan a construction order for long time projects portfolio constrained by capital and other factors water resources engineering in a projects portfolio are not constructed at the same time a appropriate construction order of them is very important to satisfied water demand in the near future several basic projects such as expanding local reservoirs p3 are applicable as the demand has not increased too much however the projects not only can satisfied water demand in the near future but was also included in portfolio addressing future water demand is better to be constructed earlier making the project valuable in the long run on the other hand some project is indispensable to satisfied future greater water demand such as transferring water from other cities p7 or p8 in this study planning such long time projects contributes to starting their preparations in advance and addressing water resources challenge well by choose a superior projects portfolio addressing different future water demand the method proposed in this article can indict whether a project can paly a role in a long time and whether a project is indispensable in the long future which contributes a lot for decision makes to plan an appropriate construction order for long time projects portfolio 5 conclusion as growing population and developing economic water the essential sources of municipal and production plays a more important role in social programme water engineering is basic strategy to maintain regional water security however it is important to evaluate water engineering necessity effectiveness and influences before the construction in this study a combined method with one vote veto and analytic hierarchy process is proposed and used to select the optimal projects portfolio for zhuhai water security addressing the challenge from both future increasing water demand and salinity intrusion by evaluating different projects portfolios from various perspectives the proposed method optimized a projects portfolio including expanding an existing reservoir and constructing a new valley reservoir in the near future and transferring water project in the long future to satisfy future water demand increasing from 120 thousands m3 h to 190 thousands m3 h the results prove that the proposed method provides strong support for projects selection and contributes to an forethought strategy program of

1387,water security is essential for sustainable economic and social development to ensure water security water engineering projects play an important role in regional developing program the coastal city zhuhai city suffers a challenge from both future increasing water demand and salinity intrusion to keep water security of the city several alternative projects are designed however as the high cost of the projects and the potential adverse influence a final projects portfolio as well as their construction order has not be decided to assist a proper decision of projects portfolio for local water security this study proposed a combined method with one vote veto and analytic hierarchy process to evaluate every projects portfolio from various perspectives the results show 1 to satisfy future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h it is recommended to adopt a projects portfolio including expanding existing reservoirs and constructing new reservoirs as its higher capacity utilization 96 87 relatively lower construction and operation costs 8 59 billion and 57 million respectively and lower ecological impact 2 to satisfy future water demand of 160 thousands m3 h or more transferring water from other cities should be an indispensable part for water security 3 channel reservoir is not recommended as its high construction and operation costs and high ecological impact this study evaluated different alternative projects for cities water security and provided a strong support for local government to decide their long term projects portfolio and their construction order the proposed method may be readily applied in other regions keywords water security salinity intrusion one vote veto analytic hierarchy process zhuhai city 1 introduction water security is one of the key issues for human society anca et al 2010 zhang and wang 2015 yin et al 2020 shortage of clean and available water resources restrict the sustainable economic and social development jain 2012 jia et al 2010 however water shortage is very common worldwide tsanis et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 wildman jr and forde 2012 schlamovitz and becker 2020 ladan 2019 kareem 2015 in 2017 844 million people lacked access to safe drinking water who 2017 marina et al 2018 bassel et al 2019 under the definition that water stress or extreme lack of water to satisfy human or ecological demands occurs when water supply 1700m3 person year rijsberman 2006 an estimated 2 billion people live under squalid conditions in areas of high water stress who 2008 obade and moore 2018 water shortage occurs due to natural or social factors natural factors include little precipitation uneven distribution of water resources episodic environmental disasters etc social factors include contaminants growing human population escalation in geopolitical conflicts and so on obade and moore 2018 salman et al 2014 wang et al 2019 nabi et al 2019 gu et al 2012 brown et al 2019 slavikova et al 2017 nowadays water shortage caused by social factors becomes a more and more serious problem especially in developing cities the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area is a typical humid area suffering water shortage as its booming human population and poor water quality reservoirs and water transfer projects play an important role for water source security for example shenzhen city in china constructed a reservoir of 0 18 billion capacity to store its alternate water sources which may satisfy cities water demand for 60 days the dong shen water supply engineering supplies 110 000 m3 freshwater for hong kong every year accounting for a major portion of water demand however water engineering can also cause unexpected adverse effects mono basin in california because of the large amount of water being diverted to los angeles experienced serious flow decrease causing serious public losses marston and cai 2016 aswan dam in egypt also caused downstream soil fertility decline salinization and other problems kashef 1981 shalash 1982 in the early days to evaluation a water engineering objective and constrains mainly focused on water dimension satisfied water demand is fundamental purpose there was a lack of interactive analysis on the social and economic factors with social development it is more closely between water resources utilization and regional economic development further various ecological problems caused by excessive exploitation and utilization of water resources has been paid more and more attention vörösmarty et al 2010 lehner et al 2011 experience with dam building warns that traditional approaches to water infrastructure development in a rapidly changing world carry severe risks of economic and environmental failure poff et al 2015 as a result it is particular important to conduct a considerate evaluation for water engineering necessity effectiveness and influences in both human economic needs and ecosystem health before construction rockström et al 2015 to assist an optimization water security strategy planning a large number of researches have done great contribution for example spiller et al 2015 defined the terms adaptive flexible and robust for water systems engineering and provided guidelines to select flexible designs for urban development types the research specified an evaluating indices system for the engineering similar research including hering et al 2013 wilderer and schreff 2000 another research direction is introducing a decision framework that explores trade offs in stakeholder about certain engineering e g poff et al 2015 zeitoun et al 2016 it is designed to manage risk of uncertainty and provide guidance to managers and decision makers by focusing on the vulnerability of engineering and ecological indicators to a range of hydrologic futures moreover some research applied a water energy food nexus approach to evaluate how a water resources program influencing food or energy system for instance bassel et al 2019 applied the approach to evaluate how different water engineering bridges the water gap in texas flammini et al 2014 proposed a water energy food method to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of different water projects those research evaluates performance of water resources engineering beyond water dimension which is in line with nowadays situation where connections between different systems are very close as mentioned evaluating performance of certain water engineering from multi indices multi stakeholders or cross system is important moreover for a region undergone the water security strategy planning decision makers prefer a long term projects portfolio that can satisfied increasing future water demand constrained by capital or other factors projects in the portfolio would not be constructed at the same time so a construction order of projects portfolio should also be optimized for both satisfying increasing water demand and capital efficiency however there hasn t been much research on this problem to address these requirements this study introduced a combined method with one vote veto and analytical hierarchy process ahp to select the optimal projects portfolio under different future water demand and to recommend the construction order for projects portfolio 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area zhuhai city is one of the five special economic zones in china in 2019 population of zhuhai is 2 02 million and gross regional product gdp is 343 6 billion cny it is located in the main estuary of the pearl river 21 48 22 27 n and 113 03 114 19 e has an area of 1732 km2 hills and plains account for 58 6 and 25 5 of the total land area its average annual precipitation is 2009 mm however due to lack of terrain for building large reservoirs most of rainfall goes straight to the sea the pearl river offers abundant water resources about 122 73 billion m3 a for zhuhai city however its temporal distribution is disproportional majority of the water is in rainy season april to september in dry season relatively less river flow causes a lower water level and causes seawater to flow back into inland rivers i e salinity intrusion rahman et al 2017 salinity intrusion is a seasonal natural phenomenon along the coastal areas talukder et al 2015 rahman and rahman 2015 if salinity intrusion flows back to water intakes the intake can not get freshwater as shown in fig 1 we drew a red line where chlorinity in water was up to 250 mg l according to historical observation data from hydrometric stations the area from the red line to the coast is salinity intrusion range the entire zhuhai city is located in the range causing a great threat to city s water security actually from 2003 to 2005 zhuhai city suffered serious water shortage due to the persistent salinity intrusion severe salinity intrusion also happened in 2019 to address the threat zhuhai city has created a river reservoir linking system rrl in the rrl system water intakes in the river are connected to reservoirs by pipelines fig 1 when water intakes work properly they not only satisfy water demand but also transfer freshwater to reservoir for storage when the intakes cannot work due to salinity intrusion the reservoir storage can then be offered as the supplement to satisfy the water demand depending on the rrl system zhuhai city successfully addresses the salinity intrusion problem and maintains water security aiming to become a great city with a population of 5 million zhuhai city is facing a new challenge that is to meet the predicted future water demand of 1 35 billion m3 a and a new strategy for water security is needed to be designed since the existing rrl system may not completely meet the requirement 2 2 basic projects basic projects are alternative for zhuhai city to satisfy future water demand we call them basic just because one or more of them can be combined as projects port folio project 1 p1 and project 2 p2 aim to build new valley reservoirs with storage capacity of 50 million m3 and 10 million m3 respectively projects 3 p3 and project 4 p4 aim to expand the existing east adding 19 million m3 storage capacity and west reservoirs adding 20 million m3 storage capacity respectively projects 5 p5 and projects 6 p6 plan to construct channel reservoirs topographically there is little advantage in building large valley reservoirs as a result constructing the channel reservoirs have been frequently discussed in recent years the construction of p5 and p6 may offer 24 million m3 capacity and 54 million m3 storage capacity respectively another strategy is diverting water from other cities project 7 p7 and project 8 p8 transfer water from zs city and jm city with ability of 1 2 million m3 d and 1 3 million m3 d respectively 2 3 water resources allocation we built a water resources allocation model calculated how different projects portfolio contributes to satisfy cities water demand under a severe salinity intrusion scenario 2 3 1 scenario of salinity intrusion the historical observation record of salinity intrusion from october 2004 to march 2005 see figure 2 was chosen as the baseline scenario to evaluate performance of different projects as the severe salinity intrusion event in recent years it caused a persistent freshwater shortage in zhuhai city thus this case study may help to evaluate the performance of different alternative projects in an adverse situation chlorinity is the parameter used for judging salinity the chlorinity was recorded hourly at three water intakes which are marked as green dots in fig 1 generally the water intakes supplies the city with pumping water from rivers however according to regulation in china if chlorinity around certain water intake was greater than 250 mg l the intake was required to shut down temporary as the result guangchang intake wi 1 was shut down 85 2 of the time while pinggang wi 2 and huangyanghe intake wi 4 were shut down 16 06 and 14 69 of the time respectively in the period from september of 2004 to march of 2005 2 3 2 water demand in late 2018 0 56 billion m3 water resources was consumed in zhuhai city of which 26 5 and 56 1 were supplied for industry and municipal usage respectively according to urban development goals zhuhai city may support 5 million population with predicted future water demand about 1 3 billion m3 a by 2035 to this end the future water demand is defined as 150 000 m3 h in this study moreover due to the uncertainty of the future water demand the water demand in the range from 120 000 m3 h to 190 000 m3 h is applied to evaluate optimal projects portfolio suiting different demands 2 3 3 allocation rules as previously mentioned zhuhai city has a rrl system cities water demand was primarily provided by the intakes in river the intakes and reservoir storage may complement each other as following under the situation of intakes shutdown due to high chlorinity fresh water may then be supplemented by the storage in reservoirs the reservoir storage may also be supplemented by the intakes after satisfying cities water demand the rrl system has shown to efficiently help zhuhai city address the salinity intrusion efficiently to reduce the freshwater shortage allocation rules are followed in allocation models for the alternative projects only water intake or storage capacity are re adjusted 2 3 4 constrains 1 salinity constraint for a given water intake the freshwater amount offered is defined based on the shutdown chlorinity of 250 mg l as 1 a jt 0 q jt 250 mg l a j q jt 250 mg l where j is number of water intake a jt is the freshwater amount that intake j can offer at time t q jt is the chlorinity at intake j at time t a j is the design capability of intake j 2 intakes constraint the sum of a jt a jt can be divided into three parts one for satisfying water demand q1 one for reservoirs supplementing storage q2 the rest is unutilized capacity q3 according to the allocation rules a jt is primarily used to satisfy the water demand the excess will be stored in reservoirs if all reservoirs are full the excess is considered as the unutilized capacity 2 a jt q 1 t q 2 t q 3 t 3 reservoirs constraint the reservoir constraints are defined as 3 v t 1 v t q 2 t q 4 t 4 v min v t v max 5 q 4 t v t v min 6 q 2 t v max v t where v t and v t 1 represent the reservoir storage at time t and t 1 respectively v min and v max represent the dead storage and total storage respectively q2 t represents the water amount pumped from water intakes q4 t represents reservoirs outflow furthermore to simulated a more severe scenario no inflow generated by precipitation is considered in this study the outflow is diverted to satisfy water demand only 4 water demand constraints water demands are satisfied in two ways water from intakes and water from the reservoirs based on the allocation rules water from intakes is mainly applied to satisfy water demand under the condition that water demand cannot be satisfied by water from intakes water from the reservoirs may be applied as the supplement 7 x t q 1 t q 4 t 8 x t d x t is the total amount of supplied water at time point t d is the total water demand at time point t 2 4 projects evaluation 2 4 1 evaluation indices 1 satisfied demand the satisfied demand sd is a key index to evaluate different projects portfolio it can be expressed as η1 i e the percentage of time steps that all water demand are satisfied p t 100 as 9 η 1 n m 100 p t x t d 100 10 in eq 9 n is the number of times steps at which all water demands are satisfied m is the total time steps in a research period 2 capacity utilization the capacity utilization cu is ratio of total q4 t to v max it is considered to evaluate whether the projects portfolio is over scale the over scale projects portfolio could satisfy water demand well however water resources stored in reservoirs were underutilized 11 η 2 q 4 t v max 100 3 other evaluation indices we also consider construction and operation cost cc and oc respectively degree of ecological environmental impact deei and difficulty degree of approval dda to evaluate projects from economic ecological and administrative perspectives respectively the construction cost is evaluated according to projects portfolio estimates the operation cost is calculated by energy consumption in pumping water both in water storage process and water transfer process the deei is marked a value in 0 0 5 1 depending on its ecological influence deei is set as 1 for the projects portfolio with greater influence deei is set as 0 for the projects portfolio with no influence otherwise deei is set as 0 5 dda evaluates whether the projects portfolio is in conflict with other existing policy dda is set as 1 for the projects portfolio that is in conflict with existing policy otherwise dda is set as 0 2 4 2 evaluation method one vote veto and analytic hierarchy process ahp are used to compare and select optimal projects portfolio the optimal project portfolio is obtained as following i satisfied demand is the index for one vote veto in this step the projects portfolio were applied to simulating water resources allocation under the defined scenario of salinity instruction according to the allocation results projects portfolio with 100 satisfied water demand were reserved for the next ahp evaluation ii applying ahp to evaluate the reserved project portfolios based on 5 other qualitative or quantitative indices indices have been preliminary ranked by method of paired comparison levels of relative importance of paired comparison are quantified by 1 3 5 7 9 as showed in table 1 finally the optimal project portfolio is obtained based on the ahp score i e the one with the highest ahp score see table 1 3 result 3 1 one vote veto based on satisfied demand first we evaluated performance of 8 basic projects one by one by the evaluation indices introduced in chapter 2 4 1 fig 3 graphs results of the indices of the basic projects respectively with defined future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h p1 p6 yield a low satisfied demand from 50 70 and a 100 capacity utilization it means that even with 100 reservoir storage utilization p1 p6 cannot meet future demand totally p7 and p8 may yield 100 satisfied demand by transferring water resources from other cities however the reservoir capacity utilization for p7 and p8 is 24 71 and 24 12 respectively which indicates p7 and p8 can almost supply future water demand and existing reservoir are underutilized from this point of view p7 or p8 is not an economic choice however for a one vote veto satisfied demand sd is the only metric that s considered so p7 and p8 is reserved in this stage and other projects are out of consideration moreover we evaluated performance of combination of basic projects as p7 or p8 can get a 100 sd already any projects combination with them are superfluous so only p1 p6 are applied for the combination every combination of basic projects is called projects portfolio in this paper we evaluated performance of every projects portfolio which are showed in fig 4 for one vote veto if a project portfolio could get a 100 sd it was depicted in orange color in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 when only two basic projects are combined sd can not reach 100 fig 4 a 100 satisfied water demand may be obtained with the combination of three or more alternative projects all projects portfolios that get 100 sd are reserved for next ahp evaluation including p7 and p8 3 2 ahp evaluation with one vote veto the projects which can not yield a 100 satisfied demand are out of consideration based on the rest indices ahp are applied to evaluate other projects portfolios the evaluation result are showed in fig 5 the highest score is assigned to the projects portfolio including p1 p3 p4 and p5 the red line in fig 5 capacity utilization of the projects portfolio is 96 87 meaning reservoirs capacity is used very well construction and operation costs are 8 59 billion and 57 million respectively moreover the deei and dda of the project are set as 1 meaning all contained projects in the projects portfolio have low ecological impact and are relatively easy to get approved under the ahp results to satisfied a future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h expanding water storage capacity the portfolio of p1 p3 p4 and p5 is better than transfer water from other cities p7 or p8 take p7 for an example p7 can get a satisfied demand of 100 however its reservoir capacity utilization is only 24 71 indicating existing reservoir storage is not utilized well moreover p7 results in relatively higher operation costs 74 million due to that large amount of water needs to be transferred from a long distance and also pumped to a relatively higher altitude specifically speaking the distance between water intake of p7 and r3 is almost 40 km and their elevation change is 41 m which caused the higher operation cost the ahp also indicated p5 is better than p6 to combine the projects portfolio under future water demand of 150 thousands m3 h p5 and p6 are both constructing channel reservoirs both of them have a relatively higher impact of environment and the ecology there difference are 1 p6 can offer a larger storage capacity 54 million m3 than p5 causing a relatively lower capacity utilization cu 2 p6 also yields the higher construction cost of 5 8 billion because its requirement of higher quality dam against storm tide and surrounding interception projects as for operation cost p6 is at a low altitude 0 m little electric consumption is required for water storage the operation cost is mainly incurred in transferring water from reservoir to water works which is about 0 07 billion year p5 is similar to p6 but p5 yields less construction cost and slightly higher operation cost compared to p6 3 3 under increasing water demand we also applied the one vote veto and ahp evaluation process to decided optimal projects portfolio under other situations in which the future water demands is increasing from 120 thousands m3 h to 190 thousands m3 h with the proposed method projects portfolio suiting different water demand is yielded as showed in table 2 when water demand is 120 130 thousands m3 h p3 satisfies all demand and yields the best overall score when water demand is 140 thousands m3 h the best option is projects portfolio with p1 and p3 when water demand increases to 160 thousands m3 h or 170 thousands m3 h p8 or p7 is the best choice respectively when water demand increases to 180 thousands m3 h the combination of p7 and p3 is the best option when water demand is 190 thousands m3 h the combination of p1 and p8 is the best option according to the results a strategy for the water security of zhuhai city can be concluded in what follows 1 p3 and p1 may be constructed firstly not only they can address a near term increasing demand from 120 thousands m3 h to 140 thousands m3 h but also p3 or p1 may be continue at work because they are the component of the optimal projects portfolio addressing long term increasing demand from 180 thousands m3 h to 190 thousands m3 h 2 p7 or p8 is totally necessary if water demand increased to 160 thousands m3 h or more under such water demand relaying on expanding local water storage capacity is no longer a better choice transferring water from other cities should be an indispensable part for zhuhai water resources as a result zhuhai should negotiate with jm city or zs city for the projects to be implemented properly 3 p2 and p6 should not be constructed because no optimal projects portfolio contains these two 4 p4 and p5 should not be constructed if water demand increases continuously p4 and p5 are selected only under the water demand of 150 thousands m3 h 4 discussion according to our results the proposed method contributes to local water security strategy planning from two aspects choose a superior project portfolios addressing future water demand increasing water demands is a challenge for many developing regions to satisfied future water demand water resources engineering play a more and more important role under a predicted future water demand there commonly are several alternative engineering projects and they can also be combined as many project portfolios choose a superior projects portfolio addressing future water demand is difficult not only supplying enough water resources but the cost efficiency and influence in environment and ecology should be considered the proposed method was established basing on these indices could yield a comprehensive evaluation among different portfolios and provide a strong support for local decision makers to choose a superiors one plan a

demand the method proposed in this article can indict whether a project can paly a role in a long time and whether a project is indispensable in the long future which contributes a lot for decision makes to plan an appropriate construction order for long time projects portfolio 5 conclusion as growing population and developing economic water the essential sources of municipal and production plays a more important role in social programme water engineering is basic strategy to maintain regional water security however it is important to evaluate water engineering necessity effectiveness and influences before the construction in this study a combined method with one vote veto and analytic hierarchy process is proposed and used to select the optimal projects portfolio for zhuhai water

1388,a one dimensional analytical model is proposed to analyze contaminant diffusion through a composite geomembrane cut off wall cgcw composed of a geomembrane gmb and a bentonite cut off wall bcw the model considers degradation process of contaminant and time dependent inlet boundary condition which are common in engineering practices moreover two limiting scenarios of the exit boundary condition ebc of cgcw for field conditions are taken into account including the flushing and non advective semi infinite aquifer ebcs the influence of boundary conditions and performance of cgcw are comprehensively investigated the results show that the upper and lower limits of the mass flux of the exit face of cgcw can be obtained by the models with flushing ebc and the model with non advective semi infinite aquifer ebc respectively in addition degradation has substantial influence on the contaminant migration and smaller half life in bcw results in smaller contaminant leakage the performance of cgcw can be improved by embedding gmb at a proper location which is related to the type of contaminant and ebc furthermore thickening hdpe gmb or adopting a coextruded evoh gmb is efficient to improve the performance of cgcw the present model can be used as an applicable tool for rational design of cgcw keywords composite cut off wall analytical model degradation time dependent boundary condition geomembrane 1 introduction in recent decades soil and groundwater pollution caused by factory sewage landfill leakage chemical storage tank accidents and pesticides abuse has seriously endangered human living space shackelford 2014 feng et al 2020 compared with remediation measures cut off wall is much cheaper and is especially suitable for contaminated sites which do not have to be remediated immediately malusis et al 2010 ding et al 2020 composite geomembrane cut off wall cgcw is one of the most effective technologies to prevent the horizontal migration of contaminants qian et al 2018 the cgcws are constructed using a bentonite slurry supported trench which is subsequently inserted a geomembrane gmb and backfilled slurry with low permeability e g soil bentonite sb cement bentonite cb soil cement bentonite scb bouazza et al 2002 compared with the traditional bentonite cut off walls bcws e g sb wall cb wall and scb wall the cgcw has a much lower hydraulic conductivity and better durability which is due to the extremely low hydraulic conductivity and strong chemical resistance of the gmb thomas and koerner 1996 zhan et al 2013 peng et al 2020 on the other hand the cgcw is a more complex multilayered system compared with the traditional slurry wall in general in order to mitigate the detrimental impact of advection and mechanical dispersion on the long term performance of a vertical barrier it is necessary to embed the cgcw with an intact gmb into an aquitard and implement hydraulic control measures during the service of the barrier such as pumping from a contaminated area rumer and ryan 1995 lagrega et al 2010 malusis et al 2010 whereas organic contaminants in the contaminated soil i e the inside aquifer can still migrate through the cgcw via molecular diffusion thereby threatening the external environment zhan et al 2013 furthermore most organic compounds are generally toxic at even very low concentration edil 2003 therefore it is substantially essential to study the migration of organic contaminants in a cgcw which is primarily governed by the diffusion adsorption and degradation processes although numerical and semi analytical methods have been developed by some researchers nguyen et al 2011 peng et al 2020 analytical method is a more efficient tool for preliminary design and can offer fundamental insight into the physical mechanisms as a conservative consideration in design contaminant transport through the vertical cut off wall can be generally regarded as a one dimensional problem prince et al 2000 mieles and zhan 2012 zhan et al 2013 shackelford 2014 therefore this paper will focus on one dimensional analytical model over the past decades several researchers have proposed steady state analytical models for contaminant migration through a cut off wall devlin and parker 1996 britton et al 2005 neville and andrews 2006 which failed to describe the transport of contaminant over time therefore some transient analytical models of single layered cut off wall have been developed which take into account the following exit boundary conditions denoted by ebc zero concentration rubin and rabideau 2000 li et al 2017 nonzero constant concentration chen et al 2018 zero gradient prince et al 2000 and semi infinite prince et al 2000 however the above studies simplified the exit boundary condition of the cut off wall ignoring the aquifer outside the cut off wall which might significantly influence the contaminant migration recently several analytical models have been proposed for contaminant transport through a cut off wall and a finite outside aquifer chen et al 2019 or a semi infinite outside aquifer xie et al 2018 obviously the above models considering double layered media cannot be directly applied to a cgcw with multilayered media fortunately zhan et al 2013 has proposed an analytical model for diffusion adsorption of organic contaminants in a cgcw considering a constant concentration inlet boundary condition denoted by ibc and a zero concentration exit boundary condition denoted by flushing ebc however the contaminant discharge and remediation in the inside aquifer would inevitably lead to the inlet concentration of vertical barrier changing over time khandelwal et al 1998 rabideau and khandelwal 1998 bayer et al 2004 zhang and qiu 2010 in addition the exit of cut off wall under field conditions generally falls between the two limiting scenarios zero concentration and semi infinite aquifer rabideau and khandelwal 1998 chen et al 2019 therefore a time dependent ibc and a semi infinite aquifer ebc need to be considered another limitation of the existing analytical work for cgcw is ignoring the effect of degradation to the authors knowledge degradation has been confirmed to be one of the governing processes during the contaminant migration in soils which can effectively remove the contaminants rabideau et al 1999 mitchell and santamarina 2005 palsikowski et al 2018 ren et al 2018 some researchers have found that the degradation rate of certain organic contaminants in barrier can be significantly increased via using bentonite modified by additives e g zero valent iron fe3o4 as the barrier material rabideau et al 1999 ain et al 2020 hence it is of great significance to consider the degradation process in barrier design several analytical models considering degradation have been developed for contaminant migration through double layered composite liners xie et al 2013 three layered composite liners wu et al 2016 feng et al 2019 pu et al 2019 and multilayered soils pérez guerrero et al 2013 shen and reible 2015 however the above works cannot consider contaminant source with changing concentration the objective of this study is to develop an analytical model for one dimensional diffusion of degradable contaminant through a cgcw considering a time dependent inlet boundary condition and two exit boundary conditions flushing and semi infinite aquifer the proposed model is verified first the effect of boundary conditions is then investigated in detail 2 model development 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 is a schematic diagram of contaminant transport through a cgcw aquifer system which consists of an inside bcw a gmb an outside bcw and an outside aquifer the origin of the coordinate system is at the inlet boundary of cgcw t w and t g are the thicknesses of the bcw and the gmb respectively l g represents the distance between inlet boundary and gmb in order to facilitate development of the analytical model the following basic assumptions are made 1 the cgcw with an intact gmb is keyed into an aquitard and a well hydraulic control measure is implemented thereby resulting in negligible advection and mechanical dispersion malusis et al 2010 zhan et al 2013 2 both the bcw and aquifer are assumed to be homogeneous saturated and isotropous and the contaminant concentration at the inlet boundary is assumed identical with depth so only horizontal molecular diffusion is considered zhan et al 2013 3 the adsorption of contaminants in the bcw and aquifer is assumed as a linear and equilibrium process xie et al 2018 chen et al 2019 4 the first order kinetic degradation model is used in the bcw and aquifer rabideau et al 1999 chen et al 2019 5 although a finite distance between cgcw and outlet boundary of aquifer l a has been considered in this conceptual model this paper focuses on the following two limiting scenarios of exit boundary condition of the non advective cgcw a flushing ebc l a 0 and a non advective semi infinite aquifer ebc l a is large enough thus in order to facilitate establishment of the model with the two mentioned ebcs the aquifer is also assumed to be non advective 2 2 problem formulation based on fick s second law shackelford and moore 2013 migration of contaminant can be described by the following governing equations in the inside bcw 1 c iw x t t d w r d w 2 c iw x t x 2 λ w c iw x t and in the gmb 2 c g x t t d g 2 c g x t x 2 and in the outside bcw 3 c ow x t t d w r d w 2 c ow x t x 2 λ w c ow x t and in the outside non advective aquifer 4 c a x t t d a r d a 2 c a x t x 2 λ a c a x t where c iw c g c ow and c a ml 3 are the contaminant concentrations in the inside bcw the gmb the outside bcw and the outside aquifer at any time t t respectively d w d g and d a l2t 1 are the effective diffusion coefficients of contaminant in the bcw the gmb and the aquifer respectively r d w and r d a dimensionless are the sorption retardation factors of contaminant in the bcw and the aquifer respectively λ w t 1 is the first order degradation constant of contaminant in the bcw the effective diffusion coefficients of bcw and aquifer can be described as follows shackelford and moore 2013 5 d w τ w d 0 d a τ a d 0 where d 0 l2t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of a contaminant in water at ambient temperature τ w and τ a dimensionless are the tortuosity factors of bcw and aquifer respectively in addition the sorption retardation factors of saturated bcw and aquifer can be described as shackelford and moore 2013 6 r d w 1 1 n w ρ 0 g s w k d w n w r d a 1 1 n a ρ 0 g s a k d a n a where n w and n a dimensionless are the porosities of bcw and aquifer respectively k d w and k d a m 1 l3 are the distribution coefficients g s w and g s a dimensionless are specific gravity values ρ 0 is the density of water ml 3 the first order degradation rate constant can be estimated as mitchell and santamarina 2005 7 λ w ln 2 t 1 2 w λ a ln 2 t 1 2 a where t 1 2 w and t 1 2 w t 1 are the half lives of an contaminant in bcw and aquifer respectively the entire system is assumed to be free of contaminant initially 8 c iw x t t 0 c g x t t 0 c ow x t t 0 c a x t t 0 0 the inlet boundary condition at the interface between the inside aquifer and the inside bcw can be expressed as 9 c iw x t x 0 c in t where c in t ml 3 is the concentration in the inside aquifer that can be a constant or a temporally variable function and the initial concentration of c in t is denoted by c 0 the partition of contaminant between inside surface of the gmb and the medium containing the contaminant can be regarded as an adsorption process of the gmb to the contaminant sangam and rowe 2001 if a gmb in contact with a solute in bcw reaches equilibrium there exists a relationship between the equilibrium concentration in the gmb and that in the bcw which can be described by a henry s law 10 k g c iw x t x l g c g x t x l g where k g is the partition coefficient between inside bcw and gmb and it is a constant for the given fluid gmb and temperature of interest in principle sangam and rowe 2001 the relationship of mass flux at the interface between inside bcw and gmb x l g is 11 n w d w c iw x t x x l g d g c g x t x x l g the desorption process from the gmb to the outside bcw can also be described by henry s law 12 c g x t x l g t g k g c ow x t x l g t g where k g is the partition coefficient between gmb and outside bcw which is assumed to be equal to k g sangam and rowe 2001 park et al 2011 the relationship of mass flux at the interface between gmb and outside bcw x l g t g is 13 d g c g x t x x l g t g n w d w c ow x t x x l g t g the continuity conditions of concentration and mass flux at the interface between outside bcw and

concentration at the outlet boundary is close to zero due to water flushing rabideau and khandelwal 1998 chen et al 2019 16 c a x t x t w l a 0 according to eq 16 when the value of l a is zero or large enough the exit of cgcw can be considered as a flushing ebc or a semi infinite aquifer ebc respectively 2 3 derivation of the analytical solution since the forms of governing equations for each part see eqs 1 4 are not the same it is difficult to obtain the general solution directly by transforming the relevant parameters of gmb the contaminant transport through the whole region can be simply described by a generalized governing equation 17 c i x t t d i r d i 2 c i x t x 2 λ i c i x t where i 1 2 3 4 represent the inside bcw the gmb the outside bcw and the outside aquifer respectively for gmb c 2 c g k g d 2 d g n 2 k g r d 2 1 λ 2 0 the other parameters are the same as before similarly the initial and boundary conditions eqs 8 16 can be rewritten as 18 c i x t t 0 0 i 1 2 3 4 19 c 1 x t x 0 c in t 20 c i x t x x i c i 1 x t x x i i 1 2 3 21 n i d i c i x t x x x i n i 1 d i 1 c i 1 x t x x x i i 1 2 3 22 c 4 x t x x 4 0 afterwards it is necessary to transform the time dependent boundary of the above problem into a time independent one according to duhamel s theorem özısık 1993 the auxiliary equations are established as 23 ψ i x t t d i r d i 2 ψ i x t x 2 λ i ψ i x t 24 ψ i x t t 0 0 i 1 2 3 4 25 ψ 1 x t x 0 1 26 ψ i x t x x i ψ i 1 x t x x i i 1 2 3 27 n i d i ψ i x t x x x i n i 1 d i 1 ψ i 1 x t x x x i i 1 2 3 28 ψ 4 x t x x 4 0 where ψ i x t is a dimensionless auxiliary function based on the zero concentration initial condition eq 18 the above auxiliary equations are equivalent to the generalized equations eqs 17 22 through the following integration 29 c i x t 0 t c in τ t ψ i x t τ dτ in order to solve the above auxiliary problem with non homogeneous boundary conditions two subfunctions φ i x and ζ i x t are introduced based on the superposition method 30 ψ i x t φ i x ζ i x t i 1 2 3 4 by submitting eq 30 into eqs 23 28 the auxiliary problem can be decomposed into two sub problems sub problem 1 is a steady state problem with non homogeneous boundary conditions in terms of subfunction φ i x and sub problem 2 is a transient problem with homogeneous boundary conditions in terms of subfunction ζ i x t the detailed description and derivation of the two sub problems are given in appendixes a and b respectively the general solution to φ i x in sub problem 1 can be expressed as follows 31 φ i x a i e r i x b i e r i x λ i 0 a i b i x λ i 0 i 1 2 3 4 where the coefficients a i b i and r i of sub problem 1 can be found in appendix a the general solution to ζ i x t in sub problem 2 is 32 ζ i x t m 1 k m ω m i x e β m t i 1 2 3 4 where the coefficients k m eigenvalues β m and eigenfunctions ω m i x of sub problem 2 can be obtained by applying separation of variables method and transfer matrix method with the detailed derivation given in appendix b substituting the solutions to the two sub problems eqs 31 and 32 into eq 30 the auxiliary function ψ i x t is obtained then the general solution to c i x t in the generalized governing equation eq 17 can be readily derived from eq 29 as 33 c i x t c in t a i e r i x b i e r i x m 1 k m ω m i x h m t λ i 0 c in t a i b i x m 1 k m ω m i x h m t λ i 0 i 1 2 3 4 where h m t c 0 0 t c in τ t e β m τ dτ e β m t the mass flux at the exit face of cgcw can be determined as 34 f w t n w d w c ow x t x x t w n w d w c in t b 3 m 1 k m h m t η m 3 μ 3 θ m 3 cos μ 3 θ

appendix 3 model verification 3 1 comparison with existing analytical model a pure diffusion problem of a non degradable contaminant in cgcw reported by zhan et al 2013 is chosen to verify the proposed model a common contaminant in soil and groundwater near landfills and petrol stations methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe is selected as the target contaminant a constant ibc c in t c 0 and a flushing ebc of bcw are used in this comparison thus the value of l a is zero and the half life of mtbe in the bcw t 1 2 w is infinite the cgcw contains a 0 6 m thick bcw t w and a 1 5 mm thick hdpe gmb t g which is embedded in the middle of bcw the other relevant parameters and their sources are listed in table 1 gillham et al 1984 yaws 1995 rowe and badv 1996 park et al 1997 park et al 2011 xu et al 2016 hong and shackelford 2017 eun et al 2018 xie et al 2018 the concentration profiles calculated by the present model and the model of zhan et al 2013 considering different elapsed time t agree perfectly well as shown in fig 2a 3 2 comparison with numerical model since no existing analytical model can consider contaminant transport in a cgcw with degradation process and source with time dependent concentration a numerical model built using the comsol multiphysics 5 3 is adopted to further verify the correctness of the present model two limiting exit boundary conditions of cgcw are considered in this section namely flushing boundary and semi infinite aquifer based on additional sensitivity analysis when l a is large enough 30 m in this paper the exit of cgcw can be regarded as an approximate semi infinite aquifer in the concerned time meanwhile two typical time dependent ibcs are specified at the inlet face including exponential decay type and finite pulse type which are common in cut off wall and soil van genuchten 1982 rabideau and khandelwal 1998 prince et al 2000 ding et al 2021 the exponential decay type ibc can be expressed as 35 c in t c 0 e λ s t where λ s is the first order decay constant which is assumed to be 0 013863 year 1 the finite pulse type ibc is assumed as 36 c in t c 0 0 8 c 0 t 30 years t 30 years in addition the half life values of mtbe in the bcw t 1 2 w and the aquifer t 1 2 a are assumed to be 50 years and infinite respectively the other parameters also refer to table 1 obviously the mtbe concentration distribution at 50 years predicted by the proposed model and the numerical model agree perfectly well fig 2b the above two verifications indicate that the proposed analytical model performs well in describing the migration of contaminant in cgcw 4 migration characteristics of contaminants in cgcw under different boundary conditions as aforementioned zhan et al 2013 proposed an analytical model for describing the diffusion of non degradable contaminants in a cgcw under a constant ibc and a flushing ebc of cgcw which can be regarded as a special case of the present model hence the model of zhan et al 2013 would inevitably have certain limitations in predicting the migration characteristics of contaminant through cgcw together with researching the effect of the embedded gmb this section compares four different combinations of inlet and exit boundary conditions of cgcw including case 1 constant ibc and semi infinite aquifer ebc with τ a 0 5 case 2 constant ibc and semi infinite aquifer ebc with τ a 0 7 case 3 constant ibc and flushing ebc and case 4 exponential decay type ibc and semi infinite aquifer ebc with τ a 0 5 mtbe and tol are chosen as the target contaminants to represent hydrophilic and hydrophobic organics respectively relevant parameters are listed in table 1 the exponential decay type ibc case 4 described by eq 35 has an initial value c 0 100 mg l which is also applied to the other three cases the mtbe and toluene tol concentration profiles for different boundary condition combinations at 50 years are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively fig 5 describes the effect of different boundary condition combinations on the relative concentration c w c 0 and mass flux f w at the exit face of cgcw for mtbe respectively obviously due to the extremely active groundwater outside the cgcw for flushing ebc case 3 the internal concentration in cgcw for case 3 is lower than that for case 1 or case 2 which has a non advective semi infinite aquifer ebc figs 3 and 4 this phenomenon indicates that the accelerated migration of contaminant outside the cgcw will lead to a decrease of concentration in the cgcw since the groundwater outside the cgcw in field falls between extremely active and stagnant conditions the real concentration in cgcw is within the range calculated by the model under the two mentioned ebcs flushing ebc and semi infinite aquifer ebc as shown in fig 5a the relative concentration c w c 0 under semi infinite aquifer ebc cases 1 and 2 keeps increasing during the concerned time however if the flushing ebc case 3 is considered the concentration at the exit face of cgcw c w cannot be used as the index for evaluating the breakthrough time since c w is always zero and will not reach the maximum allowable value hence concentration based evaluation methods have limitations in cgcw design notably the overall trend of mass flux at the exit face of cgcw f w is different from that of the relative concentration c w c 0 fig 5b the value of f w for the model with flushing ebc case 3 increases with the elapsed time and then remains constant whereas that for the model with semi infinite aquifer ebc case 1 or 2 gradually increases first to a peak at 47 years and then keeps decreasing the reason is as follows due to lack of the flushing effect of water the scenario under semi infinite aquifer ebc would cause the accumulation of contaminant in the cgcw thereby resulting in the decrease of concentration gradient and f w at the exit face of cgcw fig 5b also reveals that the model with flushing ebc and that with semi infinite aquifer ebc can be respectively considered as the conservative model and the most dangerous model if mass flux is selected as the evaluation index in addition by comparing case 1 and case 2 the concentration in the cgcw decreases with increasing the tortuosity factor of the aquifer τ a which is proportional to the effective diffusion coefficient of contaminant in aquifer d a but f w at the exit face of cgcw has a slightly increasing trend figs 3a and 4 for example with τ a increasing from 0 5 to 0 7 the value of f w increases by 7 from 0 22 to 0 238 mg year m2 at 50 years under semi infinite aquifer ebc whereas decreasing by 8 74 from 0 285 to 0 26 for the value of c w c 0 the above phenomenon indicates that changing the properties of aquifer may cause opposite variations of concentration and mass flux the contaminant discharge and decontamination in the inside aquifer would inevitably change the inlet concentration thereby affecting the migration of contaminant in the cgcw as shown in figs 3 and 4 c w c 0 and f w under the exponential decay type ibc case 4 are significantly lower than those under the constant concentration ibc case 1 obviously the transport of contaminant through the cgcw would be weakened by the potential remediation work or degradation in the contaminated area therefore time dependent ibc is more conducive for rational design of cgcw furthermore there is a significant concentration mutation between both sides of gmb x 0 3 m and x 0 3015 m for mtbe and both are higher than the internal concentration of the gmb 0 3 m x 0 3015 m fig 3 however in spite of a much higher concentration of tol in gmb the concentrations on both sides of hdpe gmb are sub equal indicating little effect of gmb on tol diffusion through a cgcw fig 4 the different migration characteristics between tol and mtbe are mainly due to the significantly different values of partition coefficient k g between gmb and bcw i e 86 7 for tol and 0 57 for mtbe therefore even though the diffusion coefficient of tol in gmb 3 77 10 13 m2 s is lower than that for mtbe 7 74 10 13 m2 s hdpe gmb has worse performance in impeding the migration of tol than that of mtbe due to higher surface sorption and desorption ability of tol on the gmb 5 performance analysis of cgcw although the migration of contaminants can be substantially delayed by a cgcw it will continue to endanger the surrounding environment and residents as time goes by therefore it is necessary to evaluate the performance of cgcw through parametric analysis of bcw and gmb in addition the flux assessment is adopted in this section to further compare the two limiting ebcs flushing and semi infinite aquifer a constant concentration with an initial value c 0 100 mg l is specified at the inlet boundary unless otherwise specified the relevant parameters refer to table 1 5 1 influence of contaminant degradation in bcw the effect of degradation in bcw on f w of mtbe under flushing ebc and semi infinite aquifer ebc is shown in fig 6 obviously a smaller half life in the bcw t 1 2 w results in a lower value of f w under the both ebcs for example for the reference case under semi infinite aquifer ebc fig 6a the required time to reach the peak decreases by 42 6 as t 1 2 w decreases from to 20 years and the relevant peak value of f w decreases by 44 8 from 0 221 to 0 122 mg year m2 in addition under both ebcs a significant reduction of f w is resulted from increasing the distribution coefficient k d w or decreasing tortuosity factor τ w in the bcw which are linearly proportional to sorption retardation factor r d w and diffusion coefficient d w respectively given the same τ w with k d w increasing from 0 2 to 0 6 ml g the peak value of f w decreases by 13 7 from 0 221 to 0 19 mg year m2 for case with t 1 2 w whereas significantly decreasing by 41 9 from 0 122 to 0 07 mg year m2 for case with t 1 2 w 20 years similarly when τ w decreases from 0 4 to 0 2 for case with t 1 2 w t 1 2 w 20 years the peak value of f w decreases by approximately 28 9 48 3 therefore shortening the half life of contaminant in the bcw is an efficient method to enhance the service performance of a cgcw 5 2 influence of gmb location in order to investigate the influence of hdpe gmb location three scenarios l g t w 6 t w 2 5 t w 6 are considered fig 7 shows the breakthrough curves in the form of f w of mtbe and tol considering flushing ebc and semi infinite aquifer ebc obviously f w of mtbe for different gmb locations is different from that of tol under flushing ebc the f w of mtbe for the scenario with l g 5 t w 6 is significantly larger than that for l g t w 6 indicating that gmb should be installed near the inlet face of cgcw fig 7a however a reverse phenomenon occurs when the target contaminant is tol fig 7b the results reveal that the performance of a cgcw can be optimized by selecting a proper embedding location of gmb in the barrier and the influence of contaminant type should be considered when designing the gmb location furthermore given the same contaminant the influence of gmb location on f w under flushing ebc is substantially different from that under semi infinite aquifer ebc the f w curves of l g t w 6 and l g 5 t w 6 under flushing ebc overlap and both are smaller or larger than that of l g t w 2 in fig 7a and b however under semi infinite aquifer ebc the f w curve for the scenario of l g t w 2 is between those for l g t w 6 and l g 5 t w 6 therefore the choice of exit boundary condition of cgcw is greatly important for determining the optimal location of gmb 5 3 influence of gmb type and thickness in recent years some new types of gmb have been used in composite liner such as a coextruded evoh gmb with an inner core of ethylene vinylalcohol evoh and outer layer of hdpe eun et al 2018 mcwatters and rowe 2018 to study the potential advantages of cgcw with a coextruded evoh gmb three scenarios of gmb are considered including 1 5 mm hdpe 3 0 mm hdpe and 1 5 mm coextruded evoh gmb the values of partition coefficient and diffusion coefficient of mtbe and tol in coextruded evoh gmb are listed in table 1 for mtbe compared to 1 5 mm hdpe gmb inserting a thicker hdpe gmb or a coextruded evoh gmb in a cgcw results in a significantly lower value of f w under the both ebcs fig 8a for the cgcw under flushing ebc semi infinite aquifer ebc the f w of mtbe at 50 years decreases by 30 8 25 8 as t g of hdpe gmb increases from 1 5 to 3 0 mm and reduces by 71 6 67 when a hdpe gmb is replaced by a coextruded evoh gmb for tol thickening the hdpe gmb or using a coextruded evoh gmb would result in reduction of f w by 4 1 5 8 or 24 17 8 under flushing ebc semi infinite aquifer ebc fig 8b obviously compared with thickening hdpe gmb adopting a coextruded evoh gmb has a more significant effect on enhancing the performance of cgcw 6 conclusions this study proposes a one dimensional analytical model for migration of degradable contaminant through a composite geomembrane cut off wall in which molecular diffusion linear sorption and degradation processes are considered duhamel s theorem is adopted to accommodate time dependent inlet boundary condition which is then solved by the separation of variables method the proposed analytical model is firstly verified against an existing analytical model and a numerical model some major conclusions are drawn based on parametric study as follows the models of cgcw under flushing and non advective semi infinite aquifer exit boundary conditions ebcs can obtain the upper and lower limits of mass flux at the exit face of cgcw as well as the lower and upper limits of contaminant concentration in the whole region nevertheless the flux based evaluation method is more suitable for cgcw design than the concentration based evaluation method which cannot be applied in the model with flushing ebc in addition compared with the constant inlet boundary condition ibc time dependent ibc is more conducive for rational design of cgcw degradation has substantial influence on the contaminant migration through a cgcw smaller half life in bcw weakens the migration process moreover inserting the gmb at the optimal location can also weaken the migration which is affected by the types of contaminant and exit boundary condition furthermore thickening hdpe gmb and adopting a coextruded evoh gmb is efficient

1388,a one dimensional analytical model is proposed to analyze contaminant diffusion through a composite geomembrane cut off wall cgcw composed of a geomembrane gmb and a bentonite cut off wall bcw the model considers degradation process of contaminant and time dependent inlet boundary condition which are common in engineering practices moreover two limiting scenarios of the exit boundary condition ebc of cgcw for field conditions are taken into account including the flushing and non advective semi infinite aquifer ebcs the influence of boundary conditions and performance of cgcw are comprehensively investigated the results show that the upper and lower limits of the mass flux of the exit face of cgcw can be obtained by the models with flushing ebc and the model with non advective semi infinite aquifer ebc respectively in addition degradation has substantial influence on the contaminant migration and smaller half life in bcw results in smaller contaminant leakage the performance of cgcw can be improved by embedding gmb at a proper location which is related to the type of contaminant and ebc furthermore thickening hdpe gmb or adopting a coextruded evoh gmb is efficient to improve the performance of cgcw the present model can be used as an applicable tool for rational design of cgcw keywords composite cut off wall analytical model degradation time dependent boundary condition geomembrane 1 introduction in recent decades soil and groundwater pollution caused by factory sewage landfill leakage chemical storage tank accidents and pesticides abuse has seriously endangered human living space shackelford 2014 feng et al 2020 compared with remediation measures cut off wall is much cheaper and is especially suitable for contaminated sites which do not have to be remediated immediately malusis et al 2010 ding et al 2020 composite geomembrane cut off wall cgcw is one of the most effective technologies to prevent the horizontal migration of contaminants qian et al 2018 the cgcws are constructed using a bentonite slurry supported trench which is subsequently inserted a geomembrane gmb and backfilled slurry with low permeability e g soil bentonite sb cement bentonite cb soil cement bentonite scb bouazza et al 2002 compared with the traditional bentonite cut off walls bcws e g sb wall cb wall and scb wall the cgcw has a much lower hydraulic conductivity and better durability which is due to the extremely low hydraulic conductivity and strong chemical resistance of the gmb thomas and koerner 1996 zhan et al 2013 peng et al 2020 on the other hand the cgcw is a more complex multilayered system compared with the traditional slurry wall in general in order to mitigate the detrimental impact of advection and mechanical dispersion on the long term performance of a vertical barrier it is necessary to embed the cgcw with an intact gmb into an aquitard and implement hydraulic control measures during the service of the barrier such as pumping from a contaminated area rumer and ryan 1995 lagrega et al 2010 malusis et al 2010 whereas organic contaminants in the contaminated soil i e the inside aquifer can still migrate through the cgcw via molecular diffusion thereby threatening the external environment zhan et al 2013 furthermore most organic compounds are generally toxic at even very low concentration edil 2003 therefore it is substantially essential to study the migration of organic contaminants in a cgcw which is primarily governed by the diffusion adsorption and degradation processes although numerical and semi analytical methods have been developed by some researchers nguyen et al 2011 peng et al 2020 analytical method is a more efficient tool for preliminary design and can offer fundamental insight into the physical mechanisms as a conservative consideration in design contaminant transport through the vertical cut off wall can be generally regarded as a one dimensional problem prince et al 2000 mieles and zhan 2012 zhan et al 2013 shackelford 2014 therefore this paper will focus on one dimensional analytical model over the past decades several researchers have proposed steady state analytical models for contaminant migration through a cut off wall devlin and parker 1996 britton et al 2005 neville and andrews 2006 which failed to describe the transport of contaminant over time therefore some transient analytical models of single layered cut off wall have been developed which take into account the following exit boundary conditions denoted by ebc zero concentration rubin and rabideau 2000 li et al 2017 nonzero constant concentration chen et al 2018 zero gradient prince et al 2000 and semi infinite prince et al 2000 however the above studies simplified the exit boundary condition of the cut off wall ignoring the aquifer outside the cut off wall which might significantly influence the contaminant migration recently several analytical models have been proposed for contaminant transport through a cut off wall and a finite outside aquifer chen et al 2019 or a semi infinite outside aquifer xie et al 2018 obviously the above models considering double layered media cannot be directly applied to a cgcw with multilayered media fortunately zhan et al 2013 has proposed an analytical model for diffusion adsorption of organic contaminants in a cgcw considering a constant concentration inlet boundary condition denoted by ibc and a zero concentration exit boundary condition denoted by flushing ebc however the contaminant discharge and remediation in the inside aquifer would inevitably lead to the inlet concentration of vertical barrier changing over time khandelwal et al 1998 rabideau and khandelwal 1998 bayer et al 2004 zhang and qiu 2010 in addition the exit of cut off wall under field conditions generally falls between the two limiting scenarios zero concentration and semi infinite aquifer rabideau and khandelwal 1998 chen et al 2019 therefore a time dependent ibc and a semi infinite aquifer ebc need to be considered another limitation of the existing analytical work for cgcw is ignoring the effect of degradation to the authors knowledge degradation has been confirmed to be one of the governing processes during the contaminant migration in soils which can effectively remove the contaminants rabideau et al 1999 mitchell and santamarina 2005 palsikowski et al 2018 ren et al 2018 some researchers have found that the degradation rate of certain organic contaminants in barrier can be significantly increased via using bentonite modified by additives e g zero valent iron fe3o4 as the barrier material rabideau et al 1999 ain et al 2020 hence it is of great significance to consider the degradation process in barrier design several analytical models considering degradation have been developed for contaminant migration through double layered composite liners xie et al 2013 three layered composite liners wu et al 2016 feng et al 2019 pu et al 2019 and multilayered soils pérez guerrero et al 2013 shen and reible 2015 however the above works cannot consider contaminant source with changing concentration the objective of this study is to develop an analytical model for one dimensional diffusion of degradable contaminant through a cgcw considering a time dependent inlet boundary condition and two exit boundary conditions flushing and semi infinite aquifer the proposed model is verified first the effect of boundary conditions is then investigated in detail 2 model development 2 1 conceptual model fig 1 is a schematic diagram of contaminant transport through a cgcw aquifer system which consists of an inside bcw a gmb an outside bcw and an outside aquifer the origin of the coordinate system is at the inlet boundary of cgcw t w and t g are the thicknesses of the bcw and the gmb respectively l g represents the distance between inlet boundary and gmb in order to facilitate development of the analytical model the following basic assumptions are made 1 the cgcw with an intact gmb is keyed into an aquitard and a well hydraulic control measure is implemented thereby resulting in negligible advection and mechanical dispersion malusis et al 2010 zhan et al 2013 2 both the bcw and aquifer are assumed to be homogeneous saturated and isotropous and the contaminant concentration at the inlet boundary is assumed identical with depth so only horizontal molecular diffusion is considered zhan et al 2013 3 the adsorption of contaminants in the bcw and aquifer is assumed as a linear and equilibrium process xie et al 2018 chen et al 2019 4 the first order kinetic degradation model is used in the bcw and aquifer rabideau et al 1999 chen et al 2019 5 although a finite distance between cgcw and outlet boundary of aquifer l a has been considered in this conceptual model this paper focuses on the following two limiting scenarios of exit boundary condition of the non advective cgcw a flushing ebc l a 0 and a non advective semi infinite aquifer ebc l a is large enough thus in order to facilitate establishment of the model with the two mentioned ebcs the aquifer is also assumed to be non advective 2 2 problem formulation based on fick s second law shackelford and moore 2013 migration of contaminant can be described by the following governing equations in the inside bcw 1 c iw x t t d w r d w 2 c iw x t x 2 λ w c iw x t and in the gmb 2 c g x t t d g 2 c g x t x 2 and in the outside bcw 3 c ow x t t d w r d w 2 c ow x t x 2 λ w c ow x t and in the outside non advective aquifer 4 c a x t t d a r d a 2 c a x t x 2 λ a c a x t where c iw c g c ow and c a ml 3 are the contaminant concentrations in the inside bcw the gmb the outside bcw and the outside aquifer at any time t t respectively d w d g and d a l2t 1 are the effective diffusion coefficients of contaminant in the bcw the gmb and the aquifer respectively r d w and r d a dimensionless are the sorption retardation factors of contaminant in the bcw and the aquifer respectively λ w t 1 is the first order degradation constant of contaminant in the bcw the effective diffusion coefficients of bcw and aquifer can be described as follows shackelford and moore 2013 5 d w τ w d 0 d a τ a d 0 where d 0 l2t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of a contaminant in water at ambient temperature τ w and τ a dimensionless are the tortuosity factors of bcw and aquifer respectively in addition the sorption retardation factors of saturated bcw and aquifer can be described as shackelford and moore 2013 6 r d w 1 1 n w ρ 0 g s w k d w n w r d a 1 1 n a ρ 0 g s a k d a n a where n w and n a dimensionless are the porosities of bcw and aquifer respectively k d w and k d a m 1 l3 are the distribution coefficients g s w and g s a dimensionless are specific gravity values ρ 0 is the density of water ml 3 the first order degradation rate constant can be estimated as mitchell and santamarina 2005 7 λ w ln 2 t 1 2 w λ a ln 2 t 1 2 a where t 1 2 w and t 1 2 w t 1 are the half lives of an contaminant in bcw and aquifer respectively the entire system is assumed to be free of contaminant initially 8 c iw x t t 0 c g x t t 0 c ow x t t 0 c a x t t 0 0 the inlet boundary condition at the interface between the inside aquifer and the inside bcw can be expressed as 9 c iw x t x 0 c in t where c in t ml 3 is the concentration in the inside aquifer that can be a constant or a temporally variable function and the initial concentration of c in t is denoted by c 0 the partition of contaminant between inside surface of the gmb and the medium containing the contaminant can be regarded as an adsorption process of the gmb to the contaminant sangam and rowe 2001 if a gmb in contact with a solute in bcw reaches equilibrium there exists a relationship between the equilibrium concentration in the gmb and that in the bcw which can be described by a henry s law 10 k g c iw x t x l g c g x t x l g where k g is the partition coefficient between inside bcw and gmb and it is a constant for the given fluid gmb and temperature of interest in principle sangam and rowe 2001 the relationship of mass flux at the interface between inside bcw and gmb x l g is 11 n w d w c iw x t x x l g d g c g x t x x l g the desorption process from the gmb to the outside bcw can also be described by henry s law 12 c g x t x l g t g k g c ow x t x l g t g where k g is the partition coefficient between gmb and outside bcw which is assumed to be equal to k g sangam and rowe 2001 park et al 2011 the relationship of mass flux at the interface between gmb and outside bcw x l g t g is 13 d g c g x t x x l g t g n w d w c ow x t x x l g t g the continuity conditions of concentration and mass flux at the interface between outside bcw and outside aquifer x t w are 14 c ow x t x t w c a x t x t w 15 n w d w c ow x t x x t w n a d a c a x t x x t w assuming downstream of the outside aquifer is a river or stream fig 1 the contamination concentration at the outlet boundary is close to zero due to water flushing rabideau and khandelwal 1998 chen et al 2019 16 c a x t x t w l a 0 according to eq 16 when the value of l a is zero or large enough the exit of cgcw can be considered as a flushing ebc or a semi infinite aquifer ebc respectively 2 3 derivation of the analytical solution since the forms of governing equations for each part see eqs 1 4 are not the same it is difficult to obtain the general solution directly by transforming the relevant parameters of gmb the contaminant transport through the whole region can be simply described by a generalized governing equation 17 c i x t t d i r d i 2 c i x t x 2 λ i c i x t where i 1 2 3 4 represent the inside bcw the gmb the outside bcw and the outside aquifer respectively for gmb c 2 c g k g d 2 d g n 2 k g r d 2 1 λ 2 0 the other parameters are the same as before similarly the initial and boundary conditions eqs 8 16 can be rewritten as 18 c i x t t 0 0 i 1 2 3 4 19 c 1 x t x 0 c in t 20 c i x t x x i c i 1 x t x x i i 1 2 3 21 n i d i c i x t x x x i n i 1 d i 1 c i 1 x t x x x i i 1 2 3 22 c 4 x t x x 4 0 afterwards it is necessary to transform the time dependent boundary of the above problem into a time independent one according to duhamel s theorem özısık 1993 the auxiliary equations are established as 23 ψ i x t t d i r d i 2 ψ i x t x 2 λ i ψ i x t 24 ψ i x t t 0 0 i 1 2 3 4 25 ψ 1 x t x 0 1 26 ψ i x t x x i ψ i 1 x t x x i i 1 2 3 27 n i d i ψ i x t x x x i n i 1 d i 1 ψ i 1 x t x x x i i 1 2 3 28 ψ 4 x t x x 4 0 where ψ i x t is a dimensionless auxiliary function based on the zero concentration initial condition eq 18 the above auxiliary equations are equivalent to the generalized equations eqs 17 22 through the following integration 29 c i x t 0 t c in τ t ψ i x t τ dτ in order to solve the above auxiliary problem with non homogeneous boundary conditions two subfunctions φ i x and ζ i x t are introduced based on the superposition method 30 ψ i x t φ i x ζ i x t i 1 2 3 4 by submitting eq 30 into eqs 23 28 the auxiliary problem can be decomposed into two sub problems sub problem 1 is a steady state problem with non homogeneous boundary conditions in terms of subfunction φ i x and sub problem 2 is a transient problem with homogeneous boundary conditions in terms of subfunction ζ i x t the detailed description and derivation of the two sub problems are given in appendixes a and b respectively the general solution to φ i x in sub problem 1 can be expressed as follows 31 φ i x a i e r i x b i e r i x λ i 0 a i b i x λ i 0 i 1 2 3 4 where the coefficients a i b i and r i of sub problem 1 can be found in appendix a the general solution to ζ i x t in sub problem 2 is 32 ζ i x t m 1 k m ω m i x e β m t i 1 2 3 4 where the coefficients k m eigenvalues β m and eigenfunctions ω m i x of sub problem 2 can be obtained by applying separation of variables method and transfer matrix method with the detailed derivation given in appendix b substituting the solutions to the two sub problems eqs 31 and 32 into eq 30 the auxiliary function ψ i x t is obtained then the general solution to c i x t in the generalized governing equation eq 17 can be readily derived from eq 29 as 33 c i x t c in t a i e r i x b i e r i x m 1 k m ω m i x h m t λ i 0 c in t a i b i x m 1 k m ω m i x h m t λ i 0 i 1 2 3 4

appendix 3 model verification 3 1 comparison with existing analytical model a pure diffusion problem of a non degradable contaminant in cgcw reported by zhan et al 2013 is chosen to verify the proposed model a common contaminant in soil and groundwater near landfills and petrol stations methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe is selected as the target contaminant a constant ibc c in t c 0 and a flushing ebc of bcw are used in this comparison thus the value of l a is zero and the half life of mtbe in the bcw t 1 2 w is infinite the cgcw contains a 0 6 m thick bcw t w and a 1 5 mm thick hdpe gmb t g which is embedded in the middle of bcw the other relevant parameters and their sources are listed in table 1 gillham et al 1984 yaws 1995 rowe and badv 1996 park et al 1997 park et al 2011 xu et al 2016 hong and shackelford 2017 eun et al 2018 xie et al 2018 the concentration profiles calculated by the present model and the model of zhan et al 2013 considering different elapsed time t agree perfectly well as shown in fig 2a 3 2 comparison with numerical model since no existing analytical model can consider contaminant transport in a cgcw with degradation process and source with time dependent concentration a numerical model built using the comsol multiphysics 5 3 is adopted to further verify the correctness of the present model two limiting exit boundary conditions of cgcw are considered in this section namely flushing boundary and semi infinite aquifer based on additional sensitivity analysis when l a is large enough 30 m in this paper the exit of cgcw can be regarded as an approximate semi infinite aquifer in the concerned time meanwhile two typical time dependent ibcs are specified at the inlet face including exponential decay type and finite pulse type which are common in cut off wall and soil van genuchten 1982 rabideau and khandelwal 1998 prince et al 2000 ding et al 2021 the exponential decay type ibc can be expressed as 35 c in t c 0 e λ s t where λ s is the first order decay constant which is assumed to be 0 013863 year 1 the finite pulse type ibc is assumed as 36 c in t c 0 0 8 c 0 t 30 years t 30 years in addition the half life values of mtbe in the bcw t 1 2 w and the aquifer t 1 2 a are assumed to be 50 years and infinite respectively the other parameters also refer to table 1 obviously the mtbe concentration distribution at 50 years predicted by the proposed model and the numerical model agree perfectly well fig 2b the above two verifications indicate that the proposed analytical model performs well in describing the migration of contaminant in cgcw 4 migration characteristics of contaminants in cgcw under different boundary conditions as aforementioned zhan et al 2013 proposed an analytical model for describing the diffusion of non degradable contaminants in a cgcw under a constant ibc and a flushing ebc of cgcw which can be regarded as a special case of the present model hence the model of zhan et al 2013 would inevitably have certain limitations in predicting the migration characteristics of contaminant through cgcw together with researching the effect of the embedded gmb this section compares four different combinations of inlet and exit boundary conditions of cgcw including case 1 constant ibc and semi infinite aquifer ebc with τ a 0 5 case 2 constant ibc and semi infinite aquifer ebc with τ a 0 7 case 3 constant ibc and flushing ebc and case 4 exponential decay type ibc and semi infinite aquifer ebc with τ a 0 5 mtbe and tol are chosen as the target contaminants to represent hydrophilic and hydrophobic organics respectively relevant parameters are listed in table 1 the exponential decay type ibc case 4 described by eq 35 has an initial value c 0 100 mg l which is also applied to the other three cases the mtbe and toluene tol concentration profiles for different boundary condition combinations at 50 years are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively fig 5 describes the effect of different boundary condition combinations on the relative concentration c w c 0 and mass flux f w at the exit face of cgcw for mtbe respectively obviously due to the extremely active groundwater outside the cgcw for flushing ebc case 3 the internal concentration in cgcw for case 3 is lower than that for case 1 or case 2 which has a non advective semi infinite aquifer ebc figs 3 and 4 this phenomenon indicates that the accelerated migration of contaminant outside the cgcw will lead to a decrease of concentration in the cgcw since the groundwater outside the cgcw in field falls between extremely active and stagnant conditions the real concentration in cgcw is within the range calculated by the model under the two mentioned ebcs flushing ebc and semi infinite aquifer ebc as shown in fig 5a the relative concentration c w c 0 under semi infinite aquifer ebc cases 1 and 2 keeps increasing during the concerned time however if the flushing ebc case 3 is considered the concentration at the exit face of cgcw c w cannot be used as the index for evaluating the breakthrough time since c w is always zero and will not reach the maximum allowable value hence concentration based evaluation methods have limitations in cgcw design notably the overall trend of mass flux at the exit face of cgcw f w is different from that of the relative concentration c w c 0 fig 5b the value of f w for the model with flushing ebc case 3 increases with the elapsed time and then remains constant whereas that for the model with semi infinite aquifer ebc case 1 or 2 gradually increases first to a peak at 47 years and then keeps decreasing the reason is as follows due to lack of the flushing effect of water the scenario under semi infinite aquifer ebc would cause the accumulation of contaminant in the cgcw thereby resulting in the decrease of concentration gradient and f w at the exit face of cgcw fig 5b also reveals that the model with flushing ebc and that with semi infinite aquifer ebc can be respectively considered as the conservative model and the most dangerous model if mass flux is selected as the evaluation index in addition by comparing case 1 and case 2 the concentration in the cgcw decreases with increasing the tortuosity factor of the aquifer τ a which is proportional to the effective diffusion coefficient of contaminant in aquifer d a but f w at the exit face of cgcw has a slightly increasing trend figs 3a and 4 for example with τ a increasing from 0 5 to 0 7 the value of f w increases by 7 from 0 22 to 0 238 mg year m2 at 50 years under semi infinite aquifer ebc whereas decreasing by 8 74 from 0 285 to 0 26 for the value of c w c 0 the above phenomenon indicates that changing the properties of aquifer may cause opposite variations of concentration and mass flux the contaminant discharge and decontamination in the inside aquifer would inevitably change the inlet concentration thereby affecting the migration of contaminant in the cgcw as shown in figs 3 and 4 c w c 0 and f w under the exponential decay type ibc case 4 are significantly lower than those under the constant concentration ibc case 1 obviously the transport of contaminant through the cgcw would be weakened by the potential remediation work or degradation in the contaminated area therefore time dependent ibc is more conducive for rational design of cgcw furthermore there is a significant concentration mutation between both sides of gmb x 0 3 m and x 0 3015 m for mtbe and both are higher than the internal concentration of the gmb 0 3 m x 0 3015 m fig 3 however in spite of a much higher concentration of tol in gmb the concentrations on both sides of hdpe gmb are sub equal indicating little effect of gmb on tol diffusion through a cgcw fig 4 the different migration characteristics between tol and mtbe are mainly due to the significantly different values of partition coefficient k g between gmb and bcw i e 86 7 for tol and 0 57 for mtbe therefore even though the diffusion coefficient of tol in gmb 3 77 10 13 m2 s is lower than that for mtbe 7 74 10 13 m2 s hdpe gmb has worse performance in impeding the migration of tol than that of mtbe due to higher surface sorption and desorption ability of tol on the gmb 5 performance analysis of cgcw although the migration of contaminants can be substantially delayed by a cgcw it will continue to endanger the surrounding environment and residents as time goes by therefore it is necessary to evaluate the performance of cgcw through parametric analysis of bcw and gmb in addition the flux assessment is adopted in this section to further compare the two limiting ebcs flushing and semi infinite aquifer a constant concentration with an initial value c 0 100 mg l is specified at the inlet boundary unless otherwise specified the relevant parameters refer to table 1 5 1 influence of contaminant degradation in bcw the effect of degradation in bcw on f w of mtbe under flushing ebc and semi infinite aquifer ebc is shown in fig 6 obviously a smaller half life in the bcw t 1 2 w results in a lower value of f w under the both ebcs for example for the reference case under semi infinite aquifer ebc fig 6a the required time to reach the peak decreases by 42 6 as t 1 2 w decreases from to 20 years and the relevant peak value of f w decreases by 44 8 from 0 221 to 0 122 mg year m2 in addition under both ebcs a significant reduction of f w is resulted from increasing the distribution coefficient k d w or decreasing tortuosity factor τ w in the bcw which are linearly proportional to sorption retardation factor r d w and diffusion coefficient d w respectively given the same τ w with k d w increasing from 0 2 to 0 6 ml g the peak value of f w decreases by 13 7 from 0 221 to 0 19 mg year m2 for case with t 1 2 w whereas significantly decreasing by 41 9 from 0 122 to 0 07 mg year m2 for case with t 1 2 w 20 years similarly when τ w decreases from 0 4 to 0 2 for case with t 1 2 w t 1 2 w 20 years the peak value of f w decreases by approximately 28 9 48 3 therefore shortening the half life of contaminant in the bcw is an efficient method to enhance the service performance of a cgcw 5 2 influence of gmb location in order to investigate the influence of hdpe gmb location three scenarios l g t w 6 t w 2 5 t w 6 are considered fig 7 shows the breakthrough curves in the form of f w of mtbe and tol considering flushing ebc and semi infinite aquifer ebc obviously f w of mtbe for different gmb locations is different from that of tol under flushing ebc the f w of mtbe for the scenario with l g 5 t w 6 is significantly larger than that for l g t w 6 indicating that gmb should be installed near the inlet face of cgcw fig 7a however a reverse phenomenon occurs when the target contaminant is tol fig 7b the results reveal that the performance of a cgcw can be optimized by selecting a proper embedding location of gmb in the barrier and the influence of contaminant type should be considered when designing the gmb location furthermore given the same contaminant the influence of gmb location on f w under flushing ebc is substantially different from that under semi infinite aquifer ebc the f w curves of l g t w 6 and l g 5 t w 6 under flushing ebc overlap and both are smaller or larger than that of l g t w 2 in fig 7a and b however under semi infinite aquifer ebc the f w curve for the scenario of l g t w 2 is between those for l g t w 6 and l g 5 t w 6 therefore the choice of exit boundary condition of cgcw is greatly important for determining the optimal location of gmb 5 3 influence of gmb type and thickness in recent years some new types of gmb have been used in composite liner such as a coextruded evoh gmb with an inner core of ethylene vinylalcohol evoh and outer layer of hdpe eun et al 2018 mcwatters and rowe 2018 to study the potential advantages of cgcw with a coextruded evoh gmb three scenarios of gmb are considered including 1 5 mm hdpe 3 0 mm hdpe and 1 5 mm coextruded evoh gmb the values of partition coefficient and diffusion coefficient of mtbe and tol in coextruded evoh gmb are listed in table 1 for mtbe compared to 1 5 mm hdpe gmb inserting a thicker hdpe gmb or a coextruded evoh gmb in a cgcw results in a significantly lower value of f w under the both ebcs fig 8a for the cgcw under flushing ebc semi infinite aquifer ebc the f w of mtbe at 50 years decreases by 30 8 25 8 as t g of hdpe gmb increases from 1 5 to 3 0 mm and reduces by 71 6 67 when a hdpe gmb is replaced by a coextruded evoh gmb for tol thickening the hdpe gmb or using a coextruded evoh gmb would result in reduction of f w by 4 1 5 8 or 24 17 8 under flushing ebc semi infinite aquifer ebc fig 8b obviously compared with thickening hdpe gmb adopting a coextruded evoh gmb has a more significant effect on enhancing the performance of cgcw 6 conclusions this study proposes a one dimensional analytical model for migration of degradable contaminant through a composite geomembrane cut off wall in which molecular diffusion linear sorption and degradation processes are considered duhamel s theorem is adopted to accommodate time dependent inlet boundary condition which is then solved by the separation of variables method the proposed analytical model is firstly verified against an existing analytical model and a numerical model some major conclusions are drawn based on parametric study as follows the models of cgcw under flushing and non advective semi infinite aquifer exit boundary conditions ebcs can obtain the upper and lower limits of mass flux at the exit face of cgcw as well as the lower and upper limits of contaminant concentration in the whole region nevertheless the flux based evaluation method is more suitable for cgcw design than the concentration based evaluation method which cannot be applied in the model with flushing ebc in addition compared with the constant inlet boundary condition ibc time dependent ibc is more conducive for rational design of cgcw degradation has substantial influence on the contaminant migration through a cgcw smaller half life in bcw weakens the migration process moreover inserting the gmb at the optimal location can also weaken the migration which is affected by the types of contaminant and exit boundary condition furthermore thickening hdpe gmb and adopting a coextruded evoh gmb is efficient

1389,trace element te pollution in groundwater resources is one of the major concerns in both developing and developed countries as it can directly affect human health arsenic as barium ba and rubidium rb can be considered as tes naturally present in groundwater due to water rock interactions in campania plain cp aquifers in south italy their concentration could be predicted via some readily available input variables using an algorithm like the iterative classifier optimizer ico for regression and novel hybrid algorithms with additive regression ar ico attribute selected classifier asc ico and bagging ba ico in this regard 244 groundwater samples were collected from water wells within the cp and analyzed with respect to the electrical conductivity ph major ions and selected tes to develop the models the available dataset was divided randomly into two subsets for model training 70 of the dataset and evaluation 30 of the dataset respectively based on the correlation coefficient r different input variables combinations were constructed to find the most effective one each model s performance was evaluated using common statistical and visual metrics results indicated that the prediction of as and ba concentrations strongly depends on hco3 while na is the most effective variable on rb prediction also the findings showed that the most powerful predictive models were those that used all the available input variables according to models performance evaluation metrics the hybrid asc ico outperformed other hybrid ba and ar ico and standalone ico algorithms to predict as and ba concentrations while both hybrid asc and ba ico models had higher accuracy and lower error than other algorithms for rb prediction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords trace element machine learning hybrid model iterative classifier optimizer campania plain groundwater pollution 1 introduction groundwater represents one of the main freshwater resources on earth providing water supplies for human consumption considering industrial and agricultural activities as well as social development recently some natural and socio economical aspects have negatively affected groundwater quality and availability generating negative impacts on soil health crop yield and finally on human health the rapid population growth zhang et al 2020 bao and fang 2007 along with over exploitation of water resources kazakis 2018 rakib et al 2020 the increasingly urban expansion the poor local watershed management land cover change kim et al 2018 and finally climate change related issues mastrocicco et al 2019a todd et al 2012 are only some of these aforementioned aspects during the last decades the concept of groundwater quality and in particular the issue of trace elements tes abundance in solution has attracted more and more attention worldwide becoming one of the main serious environmental pollution turdi and yang 2016 the groundwater tes composition can depend on natural factors such as i the lithology of the aquifer which specifies the main water rock interaction and ii the quality of recharge waters which may be affected by human activities generally the anthropogenic pollution of tes is widely attributed to mining operations coynel et al 2007 gandy et al 2007 the industrial use of metals li et al 2014 and sometimes also connected to various agricultural activities busico et al 2018 wongsasuluk et al 2014 the presence of tes in groundwater has become an important issue because it may affect water utilization kouras et al 2007 as the accumulation of tes in all the environmental sectors soil sediment water biota etc can cause a potential risk to human health due to the transfer of these elements in aquatic media their uptake by plants and subsequent introduction into the food chain he et al 2020 varol 2020 al rmalli et al 2005 among the tes arsenic as is considered one of the major groundwater pollutants as it is the 20th most abundant element inside the earth s crust herath et al 2016 high levels of as in groundwater can be ascribable in the same way to natural source and anthropogenic activities specifically in the natural environment as is a ubiquitous heavy metalloid and is extremely toxic to all living organisms the united states environmental protection agency usepa has stated how those people exposed to the chronic assumption of as through drinking water could manifest a significant increase in the risk of different types of cancers since 1993 the world health organization who has recommended a maximum safe concentration of as for drinking water of 10 μg l another te generally connected with as is barium ba ba in groundwater primarily derives from natural sources of water bearing igneous and sedimentary rocks through the dissolution of ba hosting minerals these ba bearing minerals especially baryte baso4 are generally characterized by a very low solubility that could inhibit the spread of large amounts of ba in groundwater but baso4 is also very unstable in reducing environments therefore so4 2 may control ba behavior in the aqueous environment in volcanic aquifers ba concentrations strictly depend on the relative abundance of this element in volcanizes and on the intensity of alteration processes of the host rock cuoco et al 2020 2010 generally the ba concentration in drinking water is not regulated by directives or drinking water standards but along with other tes can represent a threat to humans plants and animals safety luu et al 2009 together with as and ba rubidium rb is also another te naturally found within the earth s crust in the rock forming silicate minerals such as potassium feldspars and micas wagner 2011 due to its high solubility in water rb can be easily leached from the soil into groundwater similar to ba rb concentration in water is not regulated but the chronic effect of rubidium chloride on the human has been reported from the usepa considering the occurrence of the earlier mentioned tes in groundwater can generate various problems through groundwater utilization as potable water an accurate prediction of te levels as water quality indicators is crucial for water resources management and planning and sustainability however direct water sampling cannot be practical due to the high costs of sampling and analyses several numerical models i e modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 harbaugh et al 2000 feflow trefry and muffels 2007 sutra voss 1984 voss and provost 2002 etc have been developed and tested to predict pollutant concentrations in groundwater however these models show some limitations including i they are limited to site specific assessment ii they are generally time consuming and iii they demand a large amount of data especially concerning aquifer structure wagner 1992 recently machine learning ml algorithms have more and more attracted researchers attention due to their advantages compared to numerical predictive models such as i the possibility to use a large dataset with a different scale ii the tendency to be more user friendly than numerical models iii the insensitivity to missing data and finally iv the possibility to perform models with a low amount of data however they can be limited by the poor quality of the input dataset the poor data quality can be due to random errors in data collection as well as missing data which can limit the performance of the ml algorithm despite its complexity several ml algorithms have been successfully applied in geoscience fields lary et al 2016 dramsch 2020 for example logistic regression analysis lra liu et al 2011 artificial neural network ann shakeri abdolmaleki et al 2018 gholami et al 2016 support vector machine svm gholami et al 2011 abobakr yahya et al 2019 choubin et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis sonmez et al 2018 wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm barzegar et al 2018 fuzzy logic based decision making approach vadiati et al 2016 and generalized additive model morton and henderson 2008 murphy et al 2019 however these methodologies are not error free and have some drawbacks such as i the ann algorithm has shown very poor prediction power if not enough temporal data are used as training dataset kisi et al 2004 ii the svm application requires a preliminary evaluation of the various kernels function to utilize according to the situation waseem ahmad et al 2018 iii the anfis and fuzzy logic models have a drawback in an accurate prediction of weights in membership function bui et al 2016 and finally iv the elm needs a large dataset for training to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages of traditional ml models a new type of ml algorithms e g random tree rt random forest rf m5prime m5p reduced error pruning tree reptree random committee rc and instance based k nearest neighbors ibk have been developed in the last decades these algorithms have successfully been applied to investigate several issues connected to the fields of hydrology climatology and hydraulics for example hussain and khan 2020 compared rf against the mlp and svm for monthly river flow forecasting and concluded that rf outperforms the developed models shamshirband et al 2020 assessed how m5p showed higher performance than svm and gene expression programming for standardized streamflow index the newer ml algorithms have been also used in hydrology to simulate nitrate no3 and strontium sr concentrations in porous aquifer using gaussian process gp and decision tree algorithms bui et al 2020a to enhance the prediction of water quality index wqi in river system through bagging and cross validation parameter selection models bui et al 2020b to quantify suspended sediment transport using random committee and random subspace models khosravi et al 2018 to estimate reference evaporation via decision tree khosravi et al 2019 and to simulate solar radiation using rf rt and reptree sharafati et al 2019 specifically the bagging and cross validation techniques are commonly used to increase model stability and accuracy and to estimate the overall model s performance respectively recent studies have also stated that the prediction performance can be further enchanted using hybrid techniques there are different techniques of hybridization to enhance modeling performance such as metaheuristic optimization jing et al 2019 and ensemble methods zaier et al 2010 the current study focuses on utilizing three different hybrid models including bagging ba additive regression ar and attribute selected classifier asc for water quality modeling the iterative classifier optimizer ico algorithm as standalone model and also base learner to establish hybrid ba ico ar ico and asc ico were chosen for this study to the best of the authors knowledge the ico algorithm has not been yet used in the geoscience field advantage of ar algorithm is that no matter the dimension of the covariates we know the asc removes redundant information and consequently decreases dimensionality which leads to high accuracy and also low processing time moreover this research represents the first attempt to hybridize the asc and ico for water quality prediction purposes consequently the aims of this study are i to explore the capability of the ico algorithm in predicting the concentration of selected tes e g as ba and rb and ii to explore the ability of different hybrid ml techniques i e hybrid ico with ba asc and ar to enhance the predictive accuracy of te concentrations a shallow porous aquifer located in the campanian plain cp in the south of italy has been chosen for application of the proposed models due to the variety of data the coexistence of both anthropogenic and geogenic pollution rufino et al 2019 busico et al 2017b 2018 cuoco et al 2015 2 study area the northern part of the cp located in southern italy was chosen as a study area in this research fig 1 generally the cp is a vast extensional basin derived by the two flanks of the southern apennines and the eastern tyrrhenian margin which occurred during the quaternary period casciello et al 2006 this resulted in the collapse of a large section of the area which consequently was infilled with deep layers of continental and marine deposits like alluvial and lagoon materials interfingered with the deposition of volcanic products connected to the explosive eruptions of the three main volcanic districts somma vesuvio roccamonfina and campi flegrei santangelo et al 2017 these volcanic systems are the result of an extensional tectonic across the continental margin rolandi et al 2003 scandone et al 1991 the campanian ignimbrite ci is the main pyroclastic product of the cp consisting of a trachytic tuff that erupted from the phlegrean fields around 37 39 ky bp de vivo et al 2001 the ci shows the largest thicknesses close to the carbonate reliefs with a gradual decrease towards the volturno river where the tuff has been largely eroded by the volturno river itself from a geological point of view the cp is characterized by four main outcropping units i carbonate massif mainly limestones ii quaternary alluvial deposits clays silts and peat beds iii pyroclastic porous deposits trachytic and phonolithic pyroclastic materials sands and cinerite and finally iv sandbars and dune along the coastal zone each one of these units offers a different degree of protection against pollutant percolation from the soil surface as they are characterized by different vertical hydraulic conductivities that can intensify or reduce the percolation of the pollutants the cp is characterized by a multilayer aquifer system with a shallow and one or several deep aquifer s the shallow unconfined aquifer of the cp the object of this study is hosted in the sedimentary formation upon the volcanic material in the center of the plain and sandy beach dune sediments in the coastal zone amorosi et al 2012 mastrocicco et al 2019b the main groundwater flow is directed towards the tyrrhenian sea with a direction ne to sw the primary groundwater recharge comes by precipitations and two main lateral inflows from the karst and volcanic aquifers busico et al 2018 allocca et al 2007 a mediterranean climate characterizes the cp with cold winters followed by dry summers the mean annual precipitation in the plain varies between 800 and 1000 mm mastrocicco et al 2019a busico et al 2017b mainly occurring in the wet period october may and with a mean annual temperature of 17 c land use is very heterogeneous in the cp and mainly dominated by agricultural and farming activities with the urban area covering approximately 30 of the cp 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis the water quality dataset investigated within the study has been obtained from busico et al 2018 and includes electrical conductivity ec ph ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl as ba and rb moreover the same dataset was previously utilized by bui et al 2020a for testing other ml algorithms a brief of the water sampling and analytical methodologies is described below totally 244 groundwater samples were collected in cp from agricultural 60 residential 35 and municipal wells 5 the location of the sampling wells is shown in fig 1 the physio chemical variables including ec and ph were measured in situ using a multi parameter probe hi 991300 hanna together with total alkalinity as hco3 using 0 1 m hcl and methyl orange as indicator collected samples were analyzed in the geochemical laboratory at the university of campania luigi vanvitelli the major ions including ca2 mg2 k na cl no3 and so4 2 were analyzed with a dionex ic 120 ion chromatographer using four in laboratory prepared calibrations standards containing a specific amount of the detected ions 0 5 5 25 50 mg l 1 the precision and accuracy of the overall analyses were tested through measurements of certified standard solutions merk tes e g as ba and rb were determined using an agilent 7500 ce icp ms with an intact interference reaction cell ors tech according to cuoco et al 2017 2013 accuracy and precision were checked following the usepa methodology and the relative percentage error for precision was less than 7 the overall precision of the chemical analyses was checked by ionic balance which was within 5 as recommended by domenico and schwartz 1998 to establish models e g ico ar ico ba ico and asc ico all 244 samples i e ec ph ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl as potential input variables and as ba and rb separately as models outputs were divided randomly into two sub groups where 70 of dataset was applied for model building i e training set while the remaining 30 was used for model evaluation i e testing set after partitioning the dataset all the variables were normalized between 0 and 1 based on the maximum and minimum values of each variable the normalization is carried out to accelerate model calibration and achieve convergence in the training step moreover the effect of variables with different unites was eliminated in the modeling process barzegar et al 2019 3 2 determination of the most effective input variables the selection of effective variables represents a crucial step to correctly enhances the predictive performance of developed algorithms for the study the pearson s correlation coefficient r between potential input variables i e ph ec hco3 so4 2 na k mg2 ca2 and outputs i e as ba and rb was calculated to establish the degree of importance of each variable in the prediction of each target variable variables with a null effective or low degree of importance considering an r threshold limit of 0 1 were removed from the modeling process moreover the same variable rank was used as a basic approach to construct the different input combinations and investigate their performance at the first stage for each target variable the input candidate with the highest correlation coefficient was selected as the first input variable next the variable with the second highest r value was added to the first input candidate and the second input combination was constructed the successively adding variables approach was continued until the input candidate with the lowest r value was added all the input variable combination scenario are presented in table 1 after constructing the input variable combinations they were further considered to develop each model ico and hybrid ar ico ba ico and asc ico and finally the effectiveness of each input combination was examined through the root mean square error rmse where the lower the rmse the higher the effectiveness of each input combination 3 3 models parameter optimization there are three main steps in modeling processes that greatly could affect the overall performance i data quality and its effectiveness ii a proper selection of input combination and finally iii the parameter optimization of each algorithm the optimized value for each model s hyperparameter differs case by case hence the optimum values of hyperparameters need to be determined for each study the most widely used method is a trial and error approach through an open source software waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka 3 9 for this purpose first the default model s parameter values were applied and modeling was performed then the higher and lower values of the hyperparameters were considered arbitrarily and the result was compared to find the optimum value where the lowest rmse in the training phase was used to identify optimal hyperparameter values 3 4 models theory background 3 4 1 iterative classifier optimizer ico the ico is an algorithm created to optimize the number of iterations in each performance through a cross validation approach this algorithm can easily handle missing nominal and binary classes such as numeric nominal binary and empty nominal attributes saad 2018 the startup of this algorithm is divided into two different steps first after a general model run the results are compared with measured real values secondly the feedback obtained is submitted back to the model to further learn and fine tuning the results 3 4 2 additive regression ar the nonparametric ar model was firstly introduced by stone 1985 the main principle of this model is to choose the target variable y i with i 1 2 n where it can be represented as a set of arbitrary functions f j j 1 2 p using the input variables x i1 x i2 x ip respectively the mathematical equation for this model is presented as xu and lin 2017 1 y i j 1 p f j x ij μ i μ i iid 0 σ 2 where f j x ij is a nonparametric function fitted from the data the μ i represents the random error term that has a mean value of 0 and variance σ 2 summarizing the ar model can be considered as a normal potentially nonlinear regression model that includes inside a linear regression as a special case 3 4 3 attribute selected classifier asc one of the most crucial phases in the process of ml is the attribute or feature selection since generally a common dataset could contain multiple attributes multiple and irrelevant attributes in modeling can decrease the accuracy of the model and also increase the processing time attribute selection is therefore a technique used to extract relevant attributes and define a ranking among the various attributes that constitute a dataset it is a wrapper approach that reduces the dimensionality of training and test data by removing the redundant attributes in the training step paes et al 2014 a classifier regressor an evaluator and a final search algorithm are involved in the asc model thornton et al 2013 3 4 4 bagging ba bagging ba is one of the most strong and reliable ensemble methods usually utilized to solve classification and regression problems the method can reduce and impair the drawback that affects the component learners and together increase the recognition rate of unstable regression in bagging each training set is constructed by forming a bootstrap replicate of the original training set thus it can enhance the predictive capability of the base algorithm breiman 1996 bootstrap is a sampling technique where a sample is chosen out of a set using the replacement method in this algorithm the training process is divided and into three main sequential steps i first the data are selected randomly several times from the primary training dataset to create a number of sub datasets ii then base learning algorithm is chosen to train the created sub datasets and to obtain the sequence of predictive function finally iii the outcome is selected bauer and kohavi 1999 the ba method has been usually applied in different fields to improve the results of many base learner models like trees mert et al 2014 svms pham et al 2018 and naïve bayes trees pham et al 2017 3 5 model evaluation and comparison two main groups of visual framework and quantitative metrics were applied to evaluate the performance of the models the utilized visually based methods in this study were scatter plot bar graph box plot and taylor diagram these methodologies can provide some useful information that cannot be detected using quantitative methods for instance line graph and box plot provide information about how accurately maximum and minimum values are predicted moreover the box plot gives some information about how accurate the predicted mean and first and third quartile values are taylor diagram benefits from rmse r and standard deviation values simultaneously quantitative assessment of the model s performance is useful over the visual methods in evaluating the accuracy and ranking of the models in this study several quantitative metrics including rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage of bias pbias were used to assess the performance of the developed models rmse and mae errors have the same unit as the target variable thus their results are easy to interpret nse is a dimensionless metric which able the result for a comprehensive and reasonable comparison pbias is a robust and widely used criterion in model evaluation these metrics were calculated as follows moriasi et al 2007 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n m p 0 rmse 3 mae 1 n i 1 n m p 0 mae 4 nse 1 i 1 n m p 2 i 1 n m m 2

respectively the lower rmse and mae the higher the prediction power would be the reference value for nse are 0 75 nse 1 00 very good performance 0 65 nse 0 75 good performance 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory performance 0 40 nse 0 50 acceptable performance and nse 0 4 unsatisfactory performance ayele et al 2017 pbias is used to determine the overprediction or underprediction of algorithms moriasi et al 2007 also pbias 10 10 pbias 15 15 pbias 25 and pbias 25 are responsible for very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance legates and mccabe 1999 4 results and analysis 4 1 hydrogeochemical background a comprehensive hydrogeochemical background of the study area describing all the main processes that characterize the shallow aquifer in the area is available in busico et al 2017a 2017b and busico et al 2018 to summarize the groundwater s chemical characteristics reflect the hydrological and geological structure of the study area here a concomitance of different processes i carbonate and volcanic water recharge ii seawater intrusion and iii anthropogenic pressure has been identified busico et al 2018 fig 2 shows the piper diagram of the groundwater samples belonging to cp s aquifer based on this diagram several hydrogeochemical processes occurred in the aquifer as i a ca2 hco3 hydrogeochemical facies due to the recharge from limestone formations that characterize most of the sample located in the left part of the diagram ii a na k hco3 composition down in the diagram due to the interaction of the water with igneous materials mainly with reworked ic and recharge from volcanic formations in the central parts of the plain iii a na cl facies right part of the diagram within the coastal area and finally iv anomalous concentration of so4 2 upper part of the diagram connected to anthropogenic pollution and correlated with no3 concentrations the lateral recharge from volcanic formation along with the interaction with reworked tuff materials has been identified as the two main hydrogeological processes in the study area these processes are also responsible for the presence of some tes e g as rb and ba in groundwater in particular the main sources of ba and rb elements in the cp groundwater are represented by the volcanoes of ic and the permeable products of roccamonfina volcano located in the ne of the area busico et al 2018 cuoco et al 2010 2017 ba and rb are instead lithophyle elements normally present in little concentration trace in the glasses and minerals of ic ba 20 700 ppm rb 200 570 ppm as well as roccamonfina volcanites ba 160 1700 ppm rb 100 1120 ppm whose abundance depends on petrogenetic dynamics forni et al 2016 civetta et al 1997 due to the different crustal contamination of originating magma conticelli et al 2008 rouchon et al 2008 the leaching of host rock and groundwater transport dynamics rufino et al 2019 are the main responsible for the detected ba and rb concentrations in the cp groundwater rb and ba are alkaline earth and alkali metals respectively thus they form cations with the gas type electronic configuration in water solution a type metals stumm and morgan 1996 and are present in solution as free ions the ion exchange process significantly affects ba and rb concentrations since the kinetics of these kinds of reactions are one thousand times faster than mineral glass hydrolysis brantley et al 2008 as in oxygenated aqueous systems and neutral ph is mobile in anion form as h2aso4 as is strongly adsorbed and removed from water solution by the presence of precipitating iron as amorphous fe oxy hydroxides cuoco et al 2020 aiuppa et al 2000 in the cp the as is detected in volcanic aquifers at an average concentration of 10 μg l and it attains the higher concentrations 80 100 μg l in the presence of low eh co2 saturated groundwater busico et al 2020 2018 cuoco et al 2010 busico et al 2018 have highlighted how especially the water rock interaction with volcanic material such as tuff and lavas are responsible of as and rb presence in groundwater which could be further accompanied by higher ba concentration considering this assumption the increasing concentrations of these tes can drive to groundwater availability problem making necessary their monitoring and prediction through time 4 2 importance of input variables the choice of the best input variables to each considered outputs represents the first important step in developing an accurate ml predictive model eliminating the irrelevant input variables not only results in obtaining a good predictive model but also contributed to decreases the complexity of the model structure according to r values table s1 the hco3 0 35 showed the higher correlation with as along all parameters followed by ca2 0 28 ec 0 22 ph 0 13 na 0 05 mg2 0 02 so4 2 0 01 and k 0 00 similarly hco3 is also considered the most effective input variable to predict ba with the higher pearson correlation 0 53 followed by ec 0 50 mg2 0 51 ca2 0 44 cl 0 35 na 0 29 ph 0 28 and k 0 01 sodium instead is the highly correlated variable for rb prediction 0 51 followed by ec 0 44 ph 0 42 cl 0 37 hco3 0 32 so4 2 0 24 k 0 21 and ca2 0 06 4 3 models evaluation and comparison after constructing the input combinations they were all further used to train the four considered models ico ba ico ar ico and asc ico and then evaluated with the testing dataset to find the best combination for each model based on the r value metric a ratio of 70 30 for training and testing data respectively was used accordingly with common literature khosravi et al 2018 as can be seen in fig 3 a c the highest r value for both train and test steps in all four models belongs to the last input combination where the larger number of input variables are incorporated i e combination no 4 for as prediction and combinations no 7 for both ba and rb prediction table 1 this is results confirmed the difficulty in simulate tes which require more relevant input variables with a sufficient degree of the correlation coefficient to enhance models the scatter plots of measured versus predicted tes values are shown in figs 4 6 for as ba and rb prediction respectively it is observed that the predicted as concentrations using the asc ico fig 4c model obtained the best prediction performance with an r2 of 0 911 whilst the standalone ico model fig 4a showed the most scattered values with respect to the measured as concentrations with an r2 of 0 829 similar to the as prediction models the scatter plots of the predicted and measured ba concentrations showed that the asc ico fig 5c model r2 0 866 outperformed followed by ar ico fig 5b r2 0 859 ba ico fig 5d r2 0 809 and finally base ico fig 5a r2 0 655 in the case of rb prediction the scatter plots between the predicted and measured rb fig 6 illustrated that the predicted rb through hybrid asc ico and ba ico fig 6c d models with an r2 of 0 879 followed by the ar ico fig 6b r2 0 878 are mostly closed to the measured rb compared to rb predicted ico model with r2 0 777 which revealed to be the most scattered in rb prediction the box plot for the developed models to predict as concentration is shown in fig s1a all developed models can predict the as medians q50 satisfactorily the asc ico can predict the first quartile q25 and third quartile q75 much better than other models moreover it can be seen that the individual ico model cannot capture the q25 and minimum as concentration values fig s2a the box plot of the measured and predicted ba and rb fig s2b c shows that all the models perform quite similarly in predicting the maximum minimum and q75 of ba and rb concentrations however they are slightly different in predicting the q50 and q25 it is observed that hybrid models can capture the q25 and q50 of the considered tes concentrations much better than individual ico the taylor diagram of the developed models for predicting as is illustrated in fig s2a it is observed that the predicted as levels through hybrid models are close to the measured as levels based on correlation coefficient and standard deviation parameters and the individual ico predicted as levels are far from the measured as levels although the hybrid models performance in predicting as are close in the taylor diagram the ar ico shows a slightly better performance than the measured values taylor diagram for predicting ba concentration fig s2 shows that the individual ico is far from the measured point with a correlation and normalized standard deviation nsd of 0 82 and 0 62 respectively it is observed that the hybrid asc ico correlation 0 94 and nsd 0 79 model placed in the closest position to the measured point followed by ar ico correlation 0 93 and nsd 0 79 and ba ico correlation 0 90 and nsd 0 79 indicating their good performance compared to each other results revealed that all three hybrid algorithms approximately have the same performance in rb prediction fig 8c while only asc ico has a slightly closer nsd to the measured value 4 4 statistical indicators the comparison of the statistical indicators e g r2 rmse mae nse and pbias for as predicting models fig s3 in terms of models error indicates that the asc ico has the lowest error rmse 2 03 μg l mae 1 53 μg l followed by the ar ico rmse 2 05 μg l mae 1 59 μg l the ba ico rmse 2 13 μg l mae 1 67 μg l and finally base ico rmse 2 54 μg l mae 1 99 μg l accordingly to moriasi et al 2007 individual and all the hybrid ico models were categorized as very good performance 0 75 nse 1 00 the pbias values for all developed models were negative indicating an overprediction of as concentrations for ba prediction the asc ico has the lowest error rmse 14 89 μg l mae 10 08 μg l followed by the ar ico rmse 15 14 μg l mae 10 30 μg l the ba ico rmse 17 26 μg l mae 11 32 μg l and base ico rmse 23 00 μg l mae 15 34 μg l the calculated nse metrics of the developed models for predicting ba indicates that the ico is categorized as a good model 0 65 nse 0 75 while the hybrid models are categorized as very good predictive models 0 75 nse 1 00 similar to the as prediction models the pbias values for all developed ba prediction models are negative indicating a little overprediction of ba concentrations calculated statistical metrics for rb predicting indicate similar performance for the asc ico and ba ico rmse 34 73 μg l mae 24 22 μg l nse 0 86 pbias 15 20 where outperform the other models however the performance of the ar ico rmse 34 86 μg l mae 24 36 μg l nse 0 86 pbias 16 21 is slightly lower than hybrid models mentioned earlier based on the nse metric all developed models to predict rb concentration are categorized as very good prediction power the pbias indicator indicates an overprediction of rb prediction through developed models 5 discussions the main drivers for the regional geogenic groundwater pollution in the study area are a rainfall with a mean annual of 800 1000 mm b negligible run off c mild evapotranspiration rates mastrocicco et al 2019a and d water rock interactions in both vadose and saturated zones in particular the high value of as that are up to ten times higher than who indications 10 μg l are sometimes also accompanied by higher values of ba and rb the presence of these tes attested to the importance of the volcanic tuff water rock interaction in the area thus three tes as ba and rb that together characterize the volcanic process were considered in the present study the standalone ico model and three hybrid models in which the ico was used as the base learner ar ico asc ico and ba ico were successfully employed for the predictive modeling of selected tes as ba rb level in groundwater according to the results both ico and developed hybrid models are able to predict tes concentrations in groundwater however the hybrid models achieve better prediction accuracy with a higher correlation coefficient and lower error than the corresponding individual ml model in predicting as ba and rb concentrations specifically the higher prediction performance of hybrid algorithms is resulting from increasing the models flexibility power through hybridization khosravi et al 2018 yaseen et al 2017 the proper selection of the input variables is one of the most important steps in the modeling process which could significantly affect the results some researchers put all inputs in the models simultaneously hameed et al 2016 and some others used different methods like multiple linear regression to select the best input variables barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 however this causes increasing model complexity and or lower prediction performance khosravi et al 2019 also the results reveal that removing the variables with null effectiveness increased the model prediction performance which is in agreement with the previous studies e g pradhan 2010 and bui et al 2016 in the current study different input combinations were tested to find the most effective ones yaseen et al 2017 rezaie balf et al 2017 2019 ebtehaj et al 2018 the ar hybrid models outperform the ba hybrid model s performance in predicting as and ba concentrations except for the case of rb therefore in developing hybrid models different algorithms should be tested to find the best predictive model which is not unique for all water quality variable predictions few studies that have focused on the capability of the ml models in predicting tes in water in a recent study bui et al 2020a applied several algorithms including gp m5p rf and rt for predictive modeling of strontium sr in the groundwater in the same plain the gp model outperformed followed by the rf m5p and rt in predicting sr concentrations using water physicochemical variables e g temperature ph ec hco3 f cl so4 2 na k mg2 and ca2 although developed models in bui et al 2020a 2020b are different in respect to the current study the results of the current study support the ability of other ml algorithm types i e ico in predicting the tes in the case of using the hybrid algorithms in predictive modeling omran et al 2016 applied three ml models including multilayer perceptron svms and gp regression and four regression tree models e g m5p rept m5 rules and decision stump and two hybrid methods including ar and ba with each of the seven individual models as the base classifier to predict the compressive strength of concrete they concluded that the ensemble based algorithms improved the prediction accuracy of the four regression tree models but had less success on the other three ml predictive models so the current study supports the findings of omran et al 2016 with the demonstrated potential of ml in predicting the water quality variables this research encourages conducting further research on testing the developed models in other different geoscience and environmental fields future research should also be directed towards the use of the developed models by incorporating different aquifer hydrogeological parameters e g water table discharge rate groundwater recharge vadose zone media etc that may affect tes concentrations in groundwater finally the used algorithms could also be applied in a larger dataset including several aquifers from italy in order to compare different hydrogeochemical processes and predict groundwater quality deterioration 6 conclusions the present study proposed standalone ico and hybrid algorithms of ar ico asc ico and ba ico for predicting tes concentration i e as ba and rb at campania plain south italy the main findings of the current research are as follows 1 the concentration of as ba and rb elements can be successfully predicted through the applied standalone and hybrid ml algorithms 2 prediction accuracy of as and ba elements strongly depends on hco3 while rb depends on na concentration 3 the input combination leads to noticeably different predictive performances since the effect of each input variable on the output is not the same 4 involving all input variables enhances models prediction power 5 asc algorithm can improve the prediction capability of ico more than ba and ar as asc ico had higher prediction capability for as and ba concentration prediction while both asc ico and ba ico outperform other models for rb concentration prediction 6 the prediction powers of the hybrid asc ico models are 9 3 24 6 and 12 8 higher than the prediction power of the standalone ico algorithm for as ba and rb prediction respectively based on the nse metric overall the results of this study showed how the chosen algorithms can provide an accurate prediction of as ba and rb groundwater concentrations in a shallow alluvial aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

1389,trace element te pollution in groundwater resources is one of the major concerns in both developing and developed countries as it can directly affect human health arsenic as barium ba and rubidium rb can be considered as tes naturally present in groundwater due to water rock interactions in campania plain cp aquifers in south italy their concentration could be predicted via some readily available input variables using an algorithm like the iterative classifier optimizer ico for regression and novel hybrid algorithms with additive regression ar ico attribute selected classifier asc ico and bagging ba ico in this regard 244 groundwater samples were collected from water wells within the cp and analyzed with respect to the electrical conductivity ph major ions and selected tes to develop the models the available dataset was divided randomly into two subsets for model training 70 of the dataset and evaluation 30 of the dataset respectively based on the correlation coefficient r different input variables combinations were constructed to find the most effective one each model s performance was evaluated using common statistical and visual metrics results indicated that the prediction of as and ba concentrations strongly depends on hco3 while na is the most effective variable on rb prediction also the findings showed that the most powerful predictive models were those that used all the available input variables according to models performance evaluation metrics the hybrid asc ico outperformed other hybrid ba and ar ico and standalone ico algorithms to predict as and ba concentrations while both hybrid asc and ba ico models had higher accuracy and lower error than other algorithms for rb prediction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords trace element machine learning hybrid model iterative classifier optimizer campania plain groundwater pollution 1 introduction groundwater represents one of the main freshwater resources on earth providing water supplies for human consumption considering industrial and agricultural activities as well as social development recently some natural and socio economical aspects have negatively affected groundwater quality and availability generating negative impacts on soil health crop yield and finally on human health the rapid population growth zhang et al 2020 bao and fang 2007 along with over exploitation of water resources kazakis 2018 rakib et al 2020 the increasingly urban expansion the poor local watershed management land cover change kim et al 2018 and finally climate change related issues mastrocicco et al 2019a todd et al 2012 are only some of these aforementioned aspects during the last decades the concept of groundwater quality and in particular the issue of trace elements tes abundance in solution has attracted more and more attention worldwide becoming one of the main serious environmental pollution turdi and yang 2016 the groundwater tes composition can depend on natural factors such as i the lithology of the aquifer which specifies the main water rock interaction and ii the quality of recharge waters which may be affected by human activities generally the anthropogenic pollution of tes is widely attributed to mining operations coynel et al 2007 gandy et al 2007 the industrial use of metals li et al 2014 and sometimes also connected to various agricultural activities busico et al 2018 wongsasuluk et al 2014 the presence of tes in groundwater has become an important issue because it may affect water utilization kouras et al 2007 as the accumulation of tes in all the environmental sectors soil sediment water biota etc can cause a potential risk to human health due to the transfer of these elements in aquatic media their uptake by plants and subsequent introduction into the food chain he et al 2020 varol 2020 al rmalli et al 2005 among the tes arsenic as is considered one of the major groundwater pollutants as it is the 20th most abundant element inside the earth s crust herath et al 2016 high levels of as in groundwater can be ascribable in the same way to natural source and anthropogenic activities specifically in the natural environment as is a ubiquitous heavy metalloid and is extremely toxic to all living organisms the united states environmental protection agency usepa has stated how those people exposed to the chronic assumption of as through drinking water could manifest a significant increase in the risk of different types of cancers since 1993 the world health organization who has recommended a maximum safe concentration of as for drinking water of 10 μg l another te generally connected with as is barium ba ba in groundwater primarily derives from natural sources of water bearing igneous and sedimentary rocks through the dissolution of ba hosting minerals these ba bearing minerals especially baryte baso4 are generally characterized by a very low solubility that could inhibit the spread of large amounts of ba in groundwater but baso4 is also very unstable in reducing environments therefore so4 2 may control ba behavior in the aqueous environment in volcanic aquifers ba concentrations strictly depend on the relative abundance of this element in volcanizes and on the intensity of alteration processes of the host rock cuoco et al 2020 2010 generally the ba concentration in drinking water is not regulated by directives or drinking water standards but along with other tes can represent a threat to humans plants and animals safety luu et al 2009 together with as and ba rubidium rb is also another te naturally found within the earth s crust in the rock forming silicate minerals such as potassium feldspars and micas wagner 2011 due to its high solubility in water rb can be easily leached from the soil into groundwater similar to ba rb concentration in water is not regulated but the chronic effect of rubidium chloride on the human has been reported from the usepa considering the occurrence of the earlier mentioned tes in groundwater can generate various problems through groundwater utilization as potable water an accurate prediction of te levels as water quality indicators is crucial for water resources management and planning and sustainability however direct water sampling cannot be practical due to the high costs of sampling and analyses several numerical models i e modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 harbaugh et al 2000 feflow trefry and muffels 2007 sutra voss 1984 voss and provost 2002 etc have been developed and tested to predict pollutant concentrations in groundwater however these models show some limitations including i they are limited to site specific assessment ii they are generally time consuming and iii they demand a large amount of data especially concerning aquifer structure wagner 1992 recently machine learning ml algorithms have more and more attracted researchers attention due to their advantages compared to numerical predictive models such as i the possibility to use a large dataset with a different scale ii the tendency to be more user friendly than numerical models iii the insensitivity to missing data and finally iv the possibility to perform models with a low amount of data however they can be limited by the poor quality of the input dataset the poor data quality can be due to random errors in data collection as well as missing data which can limit the performance of the ml algorithm despite its complexity several ml algorithms have been successfully applied in geoscience fields lary et al 2016 dramsch 2020 for example logistic regression analysis lra liu et al 2011 artificial neural network ann shakeri abdolmaleki et al 2018 gholami et al 2016 support vector machine svm gholami et al 2011 abobakr yahya et al 2019 choubin et al 2019 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis sonmez et al 2018 wavelet extreme learning machine wa elm barzegar et al 2018 fuzzy logic based decision making approach vadiati et al 2016 and generalized additive model morton and henderson 2008 murphy et al 2019 however these methodologies are not error free and have some drawbacks such as i the ann algorithm has shown very poor prediction power if not enough temporal data are used as training dataset kisi et al 2004 ii the svm application requires a preliminary evaluation of the various kernels function to utilize according to the situation waseem ahmad et al 2018 iii the anfis and fuzzy logic models have a drawback in an accurate prediction of weights in membership function bui et al 2016 and finally iv the elm needs a large dataset for training to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages of traditional ml models a new type of ml algorithms e g random tree rt random forest rf m5prime m5p reduced error pruning tree reptree random committee rc and instance based k nearest neighbors ibk have been developed in the last decades these algorithms have successfully been applied to investigate several issues connected to the fields of hydrology climatology and hydraulics for example hussain and khan 2020 compared rf against the mlp and svm for monthly river flow forecasting and concluded that rf outperforms the developed models shamshirband et al 2020 assessed how m5p showed higher performance than svm and gene expression programming for standardized streamflow index the newer ml algorithms have been also used in hydrology to simulate nitrate no3 and strontium sr concentrations in porous aquifer using gaussian process gp and decision tree algorithms bui et al 2020a to enhance the prediction of water quality index wqi in river system through bagging and cross validation parameter selection models bui et al 2020b to quantify suspended sediment transport using random committee and random subspace models khosravi et al 2018 to estimate reference evaporation via decision tree khosravi et al 2019 and to simulate solar radiation using rf rt and reptree sharafati et al 2019 specifically the bagging and cross validation techniques are commonly used to increase model stability and accuracy and to estimate the overall model s performance respectively recent studies have also stated that the prediction performance can be further enchanted using hybrid techniques there are different techniques of hybridization to enhance modeling performance such as metaheuristic optimization jing et al 2019 and ensemble methods zaier et al 2010 the current study focuses on utilizing three different hybrid models including bagging ba additive regression ar and attribute selected classifier asc for water quality modeling the iterative classifier optimizer ico algorithm as standalone model and also base learner to establish hybrid ba ico ar ico and asc ico were chosen for this study to the best of the authors knowledge the ico algorithm has not been yet used in the geoscience field advantage of ar algorithm is that no matter the dimension of the covariates we know the asc removes redundant information and consequently decreases dimensionality which leads to high accuracy and also low processing time moreover this research represents the first attempt to hybridize the asc and ico for water quality prediction purposes consequently the aims of this study are i to explore the capability of the ico algorithm in predicting the concentration of selected tes e g as ba and rb and ii to explore the ability of different hybrid ml techniques i e hybrid ico with ba asc and ar to enhance the predictive accuracy of te concentrations a shallow porous aquifer located in the campanian plain cp in the south of italy has been chosen for application of the proposed models due to the variety of data the coexistence of both anthropogenic and geogenic pollution rufino et al 2019 busico et al 2017b 2018 cuoco et al 2015 2 study area the northern part of the cp located in southern italy was chosen as a study area in this research fig 1 generally the cp is a vast extensional basin derived by the two flanks of the southern apennines and the eastern tyrrhenian margin which occurred during the quaternary period casciello et al 2006 this resulted in the collapse of a large section of the area which consequently was infilled with deep layers of continental and marine deposits like alluvial and lagoon materials interfingered with the deposition of volcanic products connected to the explosive eruptions of the three main volcanic districts somma vesuvio roccamonfina and campi flegrei santangelo et al 2017 these volcanic systems are the result of an extensional tectonic across the continental margin rolandi et al 2003 scandone et al 1991 the campanian ignimbrite ci is the main pyroclastic product of the cp consisting of a trachytic tuff that erupted from the phlegrean fields around 37 39 ky bp de vivo et al 2001 the ci shows the largest thicknesses close to the carbonate reliefs with a gradual decrease towards the volturno river where the tuff has been largely eroded by the volturno river itself from a geological point of view the cp is characterized by four main outcropping units i carbonate massif mainly limestones ii quaternary alluvial deposits clays silts and peat beds iii pyroclastic porous deposits trachytic and phonolithic pyroclastic materials sands and cinerite and finally iv sandbars and dune along the coastal zone each one of these units offers a different degree of protection against pollutant percolation from the soil surface as they are characterized by different vertical hydraulic conductivities that can intensify or reduce the percolation of the pollutants the cp is characterized by a multilayer aquifer system with a shallow and one or several deep aquifer s the shallow unconfined aquifer of the cp the object of this study is hosted in the sedimentary formation upon the volcanic material in the center of the plain and sandy beach dune sediments in the coastal zone amorosi et al 2012 mastrocicco et al 2019b the main groundwater flow is directed towards the tyrrhenian sea with a direction ne to sw the primary groundwater recharge comes by precipitations and two main lateral inflows from the karst and volcanic aquifers busico et al 2018 allocca et al 2007 a mediterranean climate characterizes the cp with cold winters followed by dry summers the mean annual precipitation in the plain varies between 800 and 1000 mm mastrocicco et al 2019a busico et al 2017b mainly occurring in the wet period october may and with a mean annual temperature of 17 c land use is very heterogeneous in the cp and mainly dominated by agricultural and farming activities with the urban area covering approximately 30 of the cp 3 materials and methods

totally 244 groundwater samples were collected in cp from agricultural 60 residential 35 and municipal wells 5 the location of the sampling wells is shown in fig 1 the physio chemical variables including ec and ph were measured in situ using a multi parameter probe hi 991300 hanna together with total alkalinity as hco3 using 0 1 m hcl and methyl orange as indicator collected samples were analyzed in the geochemical laboratory at the university of campania luigi vanvitelli the major ions including ca2 mg2 k na cl no3 and so4 2 were analyzed with a dionex ic 120 ion chromatographer using four in laboratory prepared calibrations standards containing a specific amount of the detected ions 0 5 5 25 50 mg l 1 the precision and accuracy of the overall analyses were tested through measurements of certified standard solutions merk tes e g as ba and rb were determined using an agilent 7500 ce icp ms with an intact interference reaction cell ors tech according to cuoco et al 2017 2013 accuracy and precision were checked following the usepa methodology and the relative percentage error for precision was less than 7 the overall precision of the chemical analyses was checked by ionic balance which was within 5 as recommended by domenico and schwartz 1998 to establish models e g ico ar ico ba ico and asc ico all 244 samples i e ec ph ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl as potential input variables and as ba and rb separately as models outputs were divided randomly into two sub groups where 70 of dataset was applied for model building i e training set while the remaining 30 was used for model evaluation i e testing set after partitioning the dataset all the variables were normalized between 0 and 1 based on the maximum and minimum values of each variable the normalization is carried out to accelerate model calibration and achieve convergence in the training step moreover the effect of variables with different unites was eliminated in the modeling process barzegar et al 2019 3 2 determination of the most effective input variables the selection of effective variables represents a crucial step to correctly enhances the predictive performance of developed algorithms for the study the pearson s correlation coefficient r between potential input variables i e ph ec hco3 so4 2 na k mg2 ca2 and outputs i e as ba and rb was calculated to establish the degree of importance of each variable in the prediction of each target variable variables with a null effective or low degree of importance considering an r threshold limit of 0 1 were removed from the modeling process moreover the same variable rank was used as a basic approach to construct the different input combinations and investigate their performance at the first stage for each target variable the input candidate with the highest correlation coefficient was selected as the first input variable next the variable with the second highest r value was added to the first input candidate and the second input combination was constructed the successively adding variables approach was continued until the input candidate with the lowest r value was added all the input variable combination scenario are presented in table 1 after constructing the input variable combinations they were further considered to develop each model ico and hybrid ar ico ba ico and asc ico and finally the effectiveness of each input combination was examined through the root mean square error rmse where the lower the rmse the higher the effectiveness of each input combination 3 3 models parameter optimization there are three main steps in modeling processes that greatly could affect the overall performance i data quality and its effectiveness ii a proper selection of input combination and finally iii the parameter optimization of each algorithm the optimized value for each model s hyperparameter differs case by case hence the optimum values of hyperparameters need to be determined for each study the most widely used method is a trial and error approach through an open source software waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka 3 9 for this purpose first the default model s parameter values were applied and modeling was performed then the higher and lower values of the hyperparameters were considered arbitrarily and the result was compared to find the optimum value where the lowest rmse in the training phase was used to identify optimal hyperparameter values 3 4 models theory background 3 4 1 iterative classifier optimizer ico the ico is an algorithm created to optimize the number of iterations in each performance through a cross validation approach this algorithm can easily handle missing nominal and binary classes such as numeric nominal binary and empty nominal attributes saad 2018 the startup of this algorithm is divided into two different steps first after a general model run the results are compared with measured real values secondly the feedback obtained is submitted back to the model to further learn and fine tuning the results 3 4 2 additive regression ar the nonparametric ar model was firstly introduced by stone 1985 the main principle of this model is to choose the target variable y i with i 1 2 n where it can be represented as a set of arbitrary functions f j j 1 2 p using the input variables x i1 x i2 x ip respectively the mathematical equation for this model is presented as xu and lin 2017 1 y i j 1 p f j x ij μ i μ i iid 0 σ 2 where f j x ij is a nonparametric function fitted from the data the μ i represents the random error term that has a mean value of 0 and variance σ 2 summarizing the ar model can be considered as a normal potentially nonlinear regression model that includes inside a linear regression as a special case 3 4 3 attribute selected classifier asc one of the most crucial phases in the process of ml is the attribute or feature selection since generally a common dataset could contain multiple attributes multiple and irrelevant attributes in modeling can decrease the accuracy of the model and also increase the processing time attribute selection is therefore a technique used to extract relevant attributes and define a ranking among the various attributes that constitute a dataset it is a wrapper approach that reduces the dimensionality of training and test data by removing the redundant attributes in the training step paes et al 2014 a classifier regressor an evaluator and a final search algorithm are involved in the asc model thornton et al 2013 3 4 4 bagging ba bagging ba is one of the most strong and reliable ensemble methods usually utilized to solve classification and regression problems the method can reduce and impair the drawback that affects the component learners and together increase the recognition rate of unstable regression in bagging each training set is constructed by forming a bootstrap replicate of the original training set thus it can enhance the predictive capability of the base algorithm breiman 1996 bootstrap is a sampling technique where a sample is chosen out of a set using the replacement method in this algorithm the training process is divided and into three main sequential steps i first the data are selected randomly several times from the primary training dataset to create a number of sub datasets ii then base learning algorithm is chosen to train the created sub datasets and to obtain the sequence of predictive function finally iii the outcome is selected bauer and kohavi 1999 the ba method has been usually applied in different fields to improve the results of many base learner models like trees mert et al 2014 svms pham et al 2018 and naïve bayes trees pham et al 2017 3 5 model evaluation and comparison two main groups of visual framework and quantitative metrics were applied to evaluate the performance of the models the utilized visually based methods in this study were scatter plot bar graph box plot and taylor diagram these methodologies can provide some useful information that cannot be detected using quantitative methods for instance line graph and box plot provide information about how accurately maximum and minimum values are predicted moreover the box plot gives some information about how accurate the predicted mean and first and third quartile values are taylor diagram benefits from rmse r and standard deviation values simultaneously quantitative assessment of the model s performance is useful over the visual methods in evaluating the accuracy and ranking of the models in this study several quantitative metrics including rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage of bias pbias were used to assess the performance of the developed models rmse and mae errors have the same unit as the target variable thus their results are easy to interpret nse is a dimensionless metric which able the result for a comprehensive and reasonable comparison pbias is a robust and widely used criterion in model evaluation these metrics were calculated as follows moriasi et al 2007 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n m p 0 rmse 3 mae 1 n i 1 n m p 0 mae 4 nse 1 i 1 n m p 2 i 1 n m m 2 nse 1 5 pbias i 1 n m p i 1 n m 100 pbias 6 r 2 i 1 n m m p p i 1 n m m 2 i 1 n p p 2 2 0 r 2 1 where m p m p and n are measured predicted mean measured mean predicted and the number of data respectively the lower rmse and mae the higher the prediction power would be the reference value for nse are 0 75 nse 1 00 very good performance 0 65 nse 0 75 good performance 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory performance 0 40 nse 0 50 acceptable performance and nse 0 4 unsatisfactory performance ayele et al 2017 pbias is used to determine the overprediction or underprediction of algorithms moriasi et al 2007 also pbias 10 10 pbias 15 15 pbias 25 and pbias 25 are responsible for very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance legates and mccabe 1999 4 results and analysis 4 1 hydrogeochemical background a comprehensive hydrogeochemical background of the study area describing all the main processes that characterize the shallow aquifer in the area is available in busico et al 2017a 2017b and busico et al 2018 to summarize the groundwater s chemical characteristics reflect the hydrological and geological structure of the study area here a concomitance of different processes i carbonate and volcanic water recharge ii seawater intrusion and iii anthropogenic pressure has been identified busico et al 2018 fig 2 shows the piper diagram of the groundwater samples belonging to cp s aquifer based on this diagram several hydrogeochemical processes occurred in the aquifer as i a ca2 hco3 hydrogeochemical facies due to the recharge from limestone formations that characterize most of the sample located in the left part of the diagram ii a na k hco3 composition down in the diagram due to the interaction of the water with igneous materials mainly with reworked ic and recharge from volcanic formations in the central parts of the plain iii a na cl facies right part of the diagram within the coastal area and finally iv anomalous concentration of so4 2 upper part of the diagram connected to anthropogenic pollution and correlated with no3 concentrations the lateral recharge from volcanic formation along with the interaction with reworked tuff materials has been identified as the two main hydrogeological processes in the study area these processes are also responsible for the presence of some tes e g as rb and ba in groundwater in particular the main sources of ba and rb elements in the cp groundwater are represented by the volcanoes of ic and the permeable products of roccamonfina volcano located in the ne of the area busico et al 2018 cuoco et al 2010 2017 ba and rb are instead lithophyle elements normally present in little concentration trace in the glasses and minerals of ic ba 20 700 ppm rb 200 570 ppm as well as roccamonfina volcanites ba 160 1700 ppm rb 100 1120 ppm whose abundance depends on petrogenetic dynamics forni et al 2016 civetta et al 1997 due to the different crustal contamination of originating magma conticelli et al 2008 rouchon et al 2008 the leaching of host rock and groundwater transport dynamics rufino et al 2019 are the main responsible for the detected ba and rb concentrations in the cp groundwater rb and ba are alkaline earth and alkali metals respectively thus they form cations with the gas type electronic configuration in water solution a type metals stumm and morgan 1996 and are present in solution as free ions the ion exchange process significantly affects ba and rb concentrations since the kinetics of these kinds of reactions are one thousand times faster than mineral glass hydrolysis brantley et al 2008 as in oxygenated aqueous systems and neutral ph is mobile in anion form as h2aso4 as is strongly adsorbed and removed from water solution by the presence of precipitating iron as amorphous fe oxy hydroxides cuoco et al 2020 aiuppa et al 2000 in the cp the as is detected in volcanic aquifers at an average concentration of 10 μg l and it attains the higher concentrations 80 100 μg l in the presence of low eh co2 saturated groundwater busico et al 2020 2018 cuoco et al 2010 busico et al 2018 have highlighted how especially the water rock interaction with volcanic material such as tuff and lavas are responsible of as and rb presence in groundwater which could be further accompanied by higher ba concentration considering this assumption the increasing concentrations of these tes can drive to groundwater availability problem making necessary their monitoring and prediction through time 4 2 importance of input variables the choice of the best input variables to each considered outputs represents the first important step in developing an accurate ml predictive model eliminating the irrelevant input variables not only results in obtaining a good predictive model but also contributed to decreases the complexity of the model structure according to r values table s1 the hco3 0 35 showed the higher correlation with as along all parameters followed by ca2 0 28 ec 0 22 ph 0 13 na 0 05 mg2 0 02 so4 2 0 01 and k 0 00 similarly hco3 is also considered the most effective input variable to predict ba with the higher pearson correlation 0 53 followed by ec 0 50 mg2 0 51 ca2 0 44 cl 0 35 na 0 29 ph 0 28 and k 0 01 sodium instead is the highly correlated variable for rb prediction 0 51 followed by ec 0 44 ph 0 42 cl 0 37 hco3 0 32 so4 2 0 24 k 0 21 and ca2 0 06 4 3 models evaluation and comparison after constructing the input combinations they were all further used to train the four considered models ico ba ico ar ico and asc ico and then evaluated with the testing dataset to find the best combination for each model based on the r value metric a ratio of 70 30 for training and testing data respectively was used accordingly with common literature khosravi et al 2018 as can be seen in fig 3 a c the highest r value for both train and test steps in all four models belongs to the last input combination where the larger number of input variables are incorporated i e combination no 4 for as prediction and combinations no 7 for both ba and rb prediction table 1 this is results confirmed the difficulty in simulate tes which require more relevant input variables with a sufficient degree of the correlation coefficient to enhance models the scatter plots of measured versus predicted tes values are shown in figs 4 6 for as ba and rb prediction respectively it is observed that the predicted as concentrations using the asc ico fig 4c model obtained the best prediction performance with an r2 of 0 911 whilst the standalone ico model fig 4a showed the most scattered values with respect to the measured as concentrations with an r2 of 0 829 similar to the as prediction models the scatter plots of the predicted and measured ba concentrations showed that the asc ico fig 5c model r2 0 866 outperformed followed by ar ico fig 5b r2 0 859 ba ico fig 5d r2 0 809 and finally base ico fig 5a r2 0 655 in the case of rb prediction the scatter plots between the predicted and measured rb fig 6 illustrated that the predicted rb through hybrid asc ico and ba ico fig 6c d models with an r2 of 0 879 followed by the ar ico fig 6b r2 0 878 are mostly closed to the measured rb compared to rb predicted ico model with r2 0 777 which revealed to be the most scattered in rb prediction the box plot for the developed models to predict as concentration is shown in fig s1a all developed models can predict the as medians q50 satisfactorily the asc ico can predict the first quartile q25 and third quartile q75 much better than other models moreover it can be seen that the individual ico model cannot capture the q25 and minimum as concentration values fig s2a the box plot of the measured and predicted ba and rb fig s2b c shows that all the models perform quite similarly in predicting the maximum minimum and q75 of ba and rb concentrations however they are slightly different in predicting the q50 and q25 it is observed that hybrid models can capture the q25 and q50 of the considered tes concentrations much better than individual ico the taylor diagram of the developed models for predicting as is illustrated in fig s2a it is observed that the predicted as levels through hybrid models are close to the measured as levels based on correlation coefficient and standard deviation parameters and the individual ico predicted as levels are far from the measured as levels although the hybrid models performance in predicting as are close in the taylor diagram the ar ico shows a slightly better performance than the measured values taylor diagram for predicting ba concentration fig s2 shows that the individual ico is far from the measured point with a correlation and normalized standard deviation nsd of 0 82 and 0 62 respectively it is observed that the hybrid asc ico correlation 0 94 and nsd 0 79 model placed in the closest position to the measured point followed by ar ico correlation 0 93 and nsd 0 79 and ba ico correlation 0 90 and nsd 0 79 indicating their good performance compared to each other results revealed that all three hybrid algorithms approximately have the same performance in rb prediction fig 8c while only asc ico has a slightly closer nsd to the measured value 4 4 statistical indicators the comparison of the statistical indicators e g r2 rmse mae nse and pbias for as predicting models fig s3 in terms of models error indicates that the asc ico has the lowest error rmse 2 03 μg l mae 1 53 μg l followed by the ar ico rmse 2 05 μg l mae 1 59 μg l the ba ico rmse 2 13 μg l mae 1 67 μg l and finally base ico rmse 2 54 μg l mae 1 99 μg l accordingly to moriasi et al 2007 individual and all the hybrid ico models were categorized as very good performance 0 75 nse 1 00 the pbias values for all developed models were negative indicating an overprediction of as concentrations for ba prediction the asc ico has the lowest error rmse 14 89 μg l mae 10 08 μg l followed by the ar ico rmse 15 14 μg l mae 10 30 μg l the ba ico rmse 17 26 μg l mae 11 32 μg l and base ico rmse 23 00 μg l mae 15 34 μg l the calculated nse metrics of the developed models for predicting ba indicates that the ico is categorized as a good model 0 65 nse 0 75 while the hybrid models are categorized as very good predictive models 0 75 nse 1 00 similar to the as prediction models the pbias values for all developed ba prediction models are negative indicating a little overprediction of ba concentrations calculated statistical metrics for rb predicting indicate similar performance for the asc ico and ba ico rmse 34 73 μg l mae 24 22 μg l nse 0 86 pbias 15 20 where outperform the other models however the performance of the ar ico rmse 34 86 μg l mae 24 36 μg l nse 0 86 pbias 16 21 is slightly lower than hybrid models mentioned earlier based on the nse metric all developed models to predict rb concentration are categorized as very good prediction power the pbias indicator indicates an overprediction of rb prediction through developed models 5 discussions the main drivers for the regional geogenic groundwater pollution in the study area are a rainfall with a mean annual of 800 1000 mm b negligible run off c mild evapotranspiration rates mastrocicco et al 2019a and d water rock interactions in both vadose and saturated zones in particular the high value of as that are up to ten times higher than who indications 10 μg l are sometimes also accompanied by higher values of ba and rb the presence of these tes attested to the importance of the volcanic tuff water rock interaction in the area thus three tes as ba and rb that together characterize the volcanic process were considered in the present study the standalone ico model and three hybrid models in which the ico was used as the base learner ar ico asc ico and ba ico were successfully employed for the predictive modeling of selected tes as ba rb level in groundwater according to the results both ico and developed hybrid models are able to predict tes concentrations in groundwater however the hybrid models achieve better prediction accuracy with a higher correlation coefficient and lower error than the corresponding individual ml model in predicting as ba and rb concentrations specifically the higher prediction performance of hybrid algorithms is resulting from increasing the models flexibility power through hybridization khosravi et al 2018 yaseen et al 2017 the proper selection of the input variables is one of the most important steps in the modeling process which could significantly affect the results some researchers put all inputs in the models simultaneously hameed et al 2016 and some others used different methods like multiple linear regression to select the best input variables barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 however this causes increasing model complexity and or lower prediction performance khosravi et al 2019 also the results reveal that removing the variables with null effectiveness increased the model prediction performance which is in agreement with the previous studies e g pradhan 2010 and bui et al 2016 in the current study different input combinations were tested to find the most effective ones yaseen et al 2017 rezaie balf et al 2017 2019 ebtehaj et al 2018 the ar hybrid models outperform the ba hybrid model s performance in predicting as and ba concentrations except for the case of rb therefore in developing hybrid models different algorithms should be tested to find the best predictive model which is not unique for all water quality variable predictions few studies that have focused on the capability of the ml models in predicting tes in water in a recent study bui et al 2020a applied several algorithms including gp m5p rf and rt for predictive modeling of strontium sr in the groundwater in the same plain the gp model outperformed followed by the rf m5p and rt in predicting sr concentrations using water physicochemical variables e g temperature ph ec hco3 f cl so4 2 na k mg2 and ca2 although developed models in bui et al 2020a 2020b are different in respect to the current study the results of the current study support the ability of other ml algorithm types i e ico in predicting the tes in the case of using the hybrid algorithms in predictive modeling omran et al 2016 applied three ml models including multilayer perceptron svms and gp regression and four regression tree models e g m5p rept m5 rules and decision stump and two hybrid methods including ar and ba with each of the seven individual models as the base classifier to predict the compressive strength of concrete they concluded that the ensemble based algorithms improved the prediction accuracy of the four regression tree models but had less success on the other three ml predictive models so the current study supports the findings of omran et al 2016 with the demonstrated potential of ml in predicting the water quality variables this research encourages conducting further research on testing the developed models in other different geoscience and environmental fields future research should also be directed towards the use of the developed models by incorporating different aquifer hydrogeological parameters e g water table discharge rate groundwater recharge vadose zone media etc that may affect tes concentrations in groundwater finally the used algorithms could also be applied in a larger dataset including several aquifers from italy in order to compare different hydrogeochemical processes and predict groundwater quality deterioration 6 conclusions the present study proposed standalone ico and hybrid algorithms of ar ico asc ico and ba ico for predicting tes concentration i e as ba and rb at campania plain south italy the main findings of the current research are as follows 1 the concentration of as ba and rb elements can be successfully predicted through the applied standalone and hybrid ml algorithms 2 prediction accuracy of as and ba elements strongly depends on hco3 while rb depends on na concentration 3 the input combination leads to noticeably different predictive performances since the effect of each input variable on the output is not the same 4 involving all input variables enhances models prediction power 5 asc algorithm can improve the prediction capability of ico more than ba and ar as asc ico had higher prediction capability for as and ba concentration prediction while both asc ico and ba ico outperform other models for rb concentration prediction 6 the prediction powers of the hybrid asc ico models are 9 3 24 6 and 12 8 higher than the prediction power of the standalone ico algorithm for as ba and rb prediction respectively based on the nse metric overall the results of this study showed how the chosen algorithms can provide an accurate prediction of as ba and rb groundwater concentrations in a shallow alluvial aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
