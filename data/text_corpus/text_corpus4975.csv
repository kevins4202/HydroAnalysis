24875,significant increases in the population of the echinoid bioeroder diadema mexicanum that may soon follow severe el niño events such as in 1982 1983 can have a significant negative impact on the carbonate budget of coral reefs we developed a spatially explicit model that uses agent based modeling techniques to simulate the interactions between damselfish and sea urchins on an eastern pacific coral reef following an el niño southern oscillation enso event where high echinoid abundances and low coral cover were prevalent our modeling study suggests that the agonistic behavior of damselfish towards echinoids invading their defended algal lawn territories has a magnifying effect on the degree of bioerosion attributed to echinoids this is due to the increased likelihood that sea urchins ejected from damselfish territories will form concentrated aggregations and remain grazing and eroding coral for longer periods of time this is a novel insight that contrasts with the previous understanding of the positive effect that damselfish have on reef carbonate budgets by protecting carbonate substrates that lie within their defended algal lawn territories the increased degradation of coral stands attributed to the indirect damselfish effect if it results in sea urchins eroding subsurface coral framework structures causing instability and collapse especially during periods of high water motion may contribute to the fracturing of large portions of coral framework blocks affecting the recovery trajectory of reefs following a severe el niño disturbance event keywords agent based model bioerosion eastern tropical pacific el niño southern oscillation damselfish sea urchins coral mortality introduction trophic and non trophic interactions can have significant influences on ecosystems schmitz 2009 for example aggression or predation can lead to shifts in habitat use in many organisms marine as well as terrestrial pringle et al 2019 on eastern pacific coral reefs population and movement dynamics of a sea urchin diadema mexicanum can be positively or negatively influenced by damselfish stegastes acapulcoensis aggression glynn 1990 hixon 1997 2015 jones 1991 karlson 1999 kaufman 1977 pennings 1997 potts 1977 vine 1974 in defending their algal lawn territories damselfishes aid sammarco 1980 wellington 1982 or interfere lobel 1980 potts 1977 with sea urchins by providing trophic resources or in limiting grazing time respectively but damselfish also influence coral recruitment competitive outcomes among corals kaufman 1977 reduce coral mortality from predators and competitors glynn and colgan 1988 sammarco and carleton 1982 sammarco and williams 1982 and affect bioerosive processes risk and sammarco 1982 sammarco et al 1987 strömberg and kvarnemo 2005 thus a tight coupling of movement and population dynamics of sea urchins and damselfish behaviors and abundance can be expected that in turn will influence corals and reef building accretion but the net influence of this multi faceted interaction on the ecosystem and on reef building are still poorly understood it furthermore remains unquantified whether the spatial distribution of damselfish on a panamanian coral reef uva island might exacerbate the erosion and degradation of the reef framework especially following severe el niño southern oscillation enso events such as in 1982 1983 the fundamental ecological interactions between damselfish which cultivate and protect algal lawn territories and sea urchins that graze on algae and in the process erode coral substrates are herein explored in a modeling study based on empirical observations enso events cortés et al 1984 glynn 1983 1984 robinson 1985 von prahl 1983 trigger these interactions by precipitating increases in sea urchin population abundances eakin 1996 glynn 1988 sea urchins attempting to invade and graze on algal lawns are aggressively ejected by damselfish and tend to form aggregations outside of defended lawn territories the sea urchin aggregations persist and result in severe coral erosion bioerosion eakin 1996 2001 glynn 1988 later sea urchin declines coincided with loss of topographic complexity suggesting echinoid population collapse was precipitated by their increased bioerosional activity and loss of sheltering habitat eakin 2001 after their population collapse uva reef experienced robust recovery and its present day morphology consists of patches with high live coral cover interspersed with areas of little to no coral cover strewn with dead coral rubble fong et al 2017 from this sequence of events we derive the testable null hypothesis that damselfish ejection of sea urchins from their territories has no effect on coral bioerosion our empirical observations support an alternative hypothesis namely that the defense of algal lawns by damselfish can indeed promote sea urchin aggregations that exacerbate coral bioerosion thus a spatially heterogeneous pattern of high and low densities of sea urchins will lead to areas of increased erosion versus areas of favored coral growth by protecting their algal lawns from sea urchins the damselfish at the same time may create a refuge for corals high densities of damselfish territories could therefore protect corals which is in contrast to the caribbean where some damselfish species kill corals to establish their territories and can therefore negatively impact coral health precht et al 2010 vermeij et al 2015 to evaluate the suspected role of damselfish sea urchin interaction we developed a spatially explicit model of a study site located on uva reef gulf of chiriquí panama following an el niño southern oscillation enso event that resulted in high echinoid abundances and low coral cover using agent based modeling techniques to simulate the daily interactions between damselfish and sea urchins across both space and time to explore whether this alternative hypothesis could indeed be supported 2 methods 2 1 study site studies were conducted at the uva island coral reef 7 48 46 n 81 45 35 w in the gulf of chiriquí pacific panama fig 1 a and b this reef is 2 5 ha in planar area shallow 1 6 m depth and is situated in a sheltered nw facing embayment the principal framework building corals are ramose pocilloporid species mainly pocillopora damicornis and pocillopora elegans a bathymetric map fig 1 c was produced in may 2010 using a downward directed adcp acoustic doppler current profiler sontec riverprofiler that collected velocity as well as bathymetric information mapped depths were the average obtained from all three transducers on the adcp depth was corrected against tidal state and anchored on mean low tide using tidal information from panama city republic of panama irregularly spaced survey points were extrapolated to a regular grid over the survey area in order to produce a combination of a surface and contour plot each depth contour represents a depth gradient of 50 cm at site i fig 1 c where damselfish counts were performed is a 4 5 m2 pocilloporid monitoring plot established by r h richmond in 1984 this site henceforth denoted as monitored coral plot mp is located in the fore reef slope zone with pre enso el niño southern oscillation high coral cover 70 which declined to nearly 0 coral cover during and immediately following the 1982 83 warm water bleaching event no damselfish were observed within the mp they were located only around the periphery for our modeling study we assumed that damselfish would not occupy locations within the mp and that only sea urchins could access the mp non quantitative surveys were also conducted on the forereef slope at the southwestern arm of the reef denoted as site ii these surveys demonstrated that high pocilloporid cover topographic complexity and abundances of damselfish and sea urchins were similar to the principal study site i 2 2 the model the model in this study was implemented as an agent based model abm the model offers a novel approach for studying the complex interactions between sea urchins and damselfish and differs from other recent spatial simulation models of coral reef dynamics langmead and sheppard 2004 sleeman et al 2005 mumby et al 2006 yñiguez et al 2008 sandin and mcnamara 2012 eynaud et al 2016 in our abm in contrast to other recent spatial simulation models sea urchin agents can interact with each other across time and space enabling the emergence of sea urchin aggregations when sufficiently high densities of sea urchins in close proximity collected within cells in the square lattice the purpose of this abm was to simulate the daily interactions between damselfish and sea urchins on both a spatial and temporal scale on a tropical eastern pacific reef during post enso high urchin abundance conditions and low coral cover to test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of the damselfish stegastes acapulcoensis at uva reef contributes to the severe degradation of reef frameworks by driving higher levels of echinoid bioerosion the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 and was developed using the r programming language version 1 0 153 2009 2017 rstudio inc r core team 2013 the source code and input files for the model can be found in the public code repository at https github com pglynn4793 damsel urchin bioerosion model 2 2 1 scale of model the model domain consists of a square lattice containing 256 cells 16 16 m2 with periodic boundary conditions to be known as the study site each cell representing 1 m 2 of reef fig 2 cells may contain damselfish echinoids or both the upper half portion of the square represents the reef base and the lower half of the square the reef slope sea urchins can move unconstrained across reef zone boundaries sea urchins may also move outside of the boundaries of the study site a process was implemented to replenish the study site with sea urchins on a periodic basis to maintain the sea urchin abundances established as initial conditions for each reef zone see section 2 7 4 the 4 5 m2 mp is inscribed within the lower half portion of the square bordering the reef base the temporal scale of the model is daily 24 h and simulation tests were executed for 365 time steps 1year since interactions between damselfish and sea urchins differ between day and night glynn 1988 we randomly select day or night at each time step to facilitate the either daytime or nighttime urchin damselfish dynamics 2 2 2 entities entities in this abm are individual sea urchins damselfish and aggregations of sea urchins their interactions are modeled across a spatial and temporal scale interactions occur when individual sea urchins or grazing sea urchin aggregations travel across grid cells and encounter algal lawns occupied by damselfish table 1 2 2 2 1 echinoids the echinoid diadema mexicanum experienced a significant increase in abundance at uva reef following the 1982 1983 el niño event glynn 1988 fig 3 a echinoid densities varied on uva reef with means of 40 6 ind m 2 in the deeper reef base zone and 20 2 ind m 2 in the shallower reef slope eakin 2001 glynn 1988 quantified the bioerosive impact on dead coral with a mean loss due to abrasion of 0 2 g caco3 ind 1 day 1 individual echinoids can exhibit homing or non homing behaviors if echinoids exhibit an affinity for a specific site within the coral framework this is known as homing behavior carpenter 1984 2 2 2 2 aggregation of echinoids several tropical echinoid species including diadema mexicanum may form aggregations that consist of hundreds of individuals glynn 1988 observed occasional fronts of d mexicanum on uva reef consisting of a few hundred individuals grazing along the periphery of algal lawns aggregations of echinoids behave as social units pearse and arch 1969 they exhibit a degree of persistence remaining in aggregations in the same area for several days responding to external stimuli as a single unit while aggregations may change in shape size and position they are believed to be formed in response to high population densities where individuals are more likely to come into contact echinoid aggregations can result in significant carbonate erosion due to the large numbers of individuals that may remain in a particular location for several days 2 2 2 3 damselfish individuals of the damselfish stegastes acapulcoensis fig 3 b were observed to eject the echinoid diadema mexicanum from their algal lawns at uva reef glynn 1988 glynn quantified the ejection rates of echinoids invading damselfish protected algal lawns by observing damselfish agonistic behavior in 3 min trial periods and counting the number of echinoids that remained glynn found that damselfish exhibited agonistic behavior and echinoid ejection only during daylight hours eakin 1987 found and quantified that the degree of damselfish agonism towards invading echinoids was related to damselfish size smaller damselfish were less likely to exhibit agonistic behavior than larger damselfish itzkowitz 1978 observed that larger damselfish exhibited dominance over smaller damselfish and that size mediated spatial distribution of damselfish was correlated with proximity to preferred habitat we assumed that the mp site represented preferred damselfish habitat due to its high topographic complexity wellington and victor 1985 on the uva island reef damselfish that were harassed in situ by hand waving typically defended their territories for 1 2 min and then would swim towards the mp to find shelter among pocillopora colonies of high topographic relief glynn 2017 pers observation 2 2 3 state variables a collection of vectors v i j t i 1 16 j 1 16 t 0 365 was used to represent the state of the system for each time step t and for each grid cell in the square lattice indexed by the subscripts ij where i is the horizontal component of the grid cell location and j the vertical component the components of the vector νij t are defined in table 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the model is run on a daily basis for a period of 1 year 365 time steps the sequencing of the model processes is shown in a flow diagram fig 4 with more detailed descriptions of the sea urchin foraging behavior fig 5 and inter species interaction processes fig 6 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 emergence the spatial distribution of sea urchins emerges from the foraging behavior of sea urchin model agents and the interspecific interactions that occur between individual sea urchins sea urchin aggregations and damselfish agents fig 7 demonstrates the emergence of sea urchin aggregations resulting from a thigmotaxic behavior response of sea urchins clustered together in close proximity 2 4 2 interaction sea urchin individuals or sea urchins that form aggregations may move to adjacent grid cells or remain in their current cell according to the foraging behavior that is implemented in the model damselfish agents were modeled to implement agonistic behaviors towards invading sea urchins these behaviors were modeled as stochastic processes that were based on diurnal response the size of the damselfish and the duration of the agonistic response fig 6 if a sea urchin agent moves to a cell that is occupied by a damselfish and if the occupying damselfish exhibits sufficiently aggressive behavior towards the invading sea urchin agents this will result in the invading sea urchin agent being ejected back to their originating cell sea urchin aggregations may also interact with other sea urchin aggregations when a sea urchin aggregation is scheduled to move to an adjacent cell that also contains a sea urchin aggregation the invading sea urchin aggregation will be ejected back to its originating cell 2 4 3 stochasticity stochastic processes were implemented in the model to simulate the initial seeding of damselfish and echinoid population distributions the foraging behaviors of echinoids the formation and dissolution of echinoid aggregations and the agonistic interactions between damselfish and echinoids table 3 these processes were implemented as probability distributions or as sampling distributions sampling distributions were generated from frequency data obtained from field measurements and published studies 2 4 4 aggregations populations of tropical sea urchins including diadema mexicanum may form into aggregations that consist of hundreds of individuals occasional fronts of d mexicanum on uva reef may consist of up to a few hundred individuals grazing along the periphery of algal lawns glynn 1988 these aggregations exhibit their own behaviors hence their assignment as agents separate from individual urchins 2 4 5 observation to support data analysis and hypothesis testing the spatial distribution of sea urchins across grid cells the cumulative carbonate erosion within the mp the frequency of sea urchin aggregations occupying grid cells within the mp the number of ejections of sea urchins back into their grid cells all within the mp and the size and number of sea urchin aggregations was collected at the end of each simulation model run 2 5 initialization the initial condition for our model is 90 coral mortality throughout the study site with dead coral encrusted with coralline algae we also assumed that the mp is the only region within the study site that maintains high topographic complexity over the one year period used for our simulation model test runs based on eakin 2001 who found that the topographic complexity of the uva reef slope was unchanged following the 1982 1983 enso maintaining high topographic complexity is necessary to ensure that the spatial distribution of damselfish remains stable over time wellington and victor 1985 finally we assume that there was sufficient algal encrusted dead coral rubble available within the study site to provide echinoids with a consistent food supply eakin 2001 the initialization process includes the loading of parameter data table 4 probability and sampling distributions table 3 data that define the spatial extent of the model the seeding of grid cells with sea urchins according to the abundance distributions for each reef zone and the seeding of grid cells with damselfish using damselfish size and distance from mp frequency distributions larger more aggressive damselfish are more likely to be placed closer to the mp than smaller less aggressive damselfish 2 6 input data the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels submodels represent the various processes implemented in the model labeled using italics on the process flow charts figs 4 6 2 7 1 seeding the seeding of grid cells with sea urchins and damselfish was performed at the initiation of each model simulation run we sampled an echinoid abundance distribution according to which reef zone a grid cell is located within x a s for reef slope or x a b reef base to determine the number of echinoids to place in the cell table 3 we excluded the initial placement of echinoids in cells that harbored damselfish to determine if a grid cell is to be seeded with a damselfish the geometric distance from the grid cell to the mp was calculated and the damselfish abundance sampling distribution f a i table 3 that corresponds to the distance from the current cell to the mp was selected and sampled for the occurrence of a damselfish the sampling distribution f a i was generated from empirical data obtained from surveys of damselfish that were performed around the periphery of the mp site on uva reef a scuba diver swam around the periphery of the mp in increments of 1 m out to 8 m we determined if a damselfish was occupying an algal lawn by harassing damselfish by hand waving in proximity 0 25 to 0 5 m distant and observing for any territorial defensive response in return if a defensive response was elicited we tagged the location of the damselfish territory using a gps device a garmin gps 72h model with a dilution of precision less than 3 m we captured the location of each damselfish occupied algal lawn using gps coordinates n 53 coordinate pairs from the coordinates we calculated the geometric distances to the closest point on the mp and produced damselfish abundance sampling distributions f a i as a function of distance from the mp for each distance interval of 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m and 6 m or more if we determined that a grid cell was to be seeded with a damselfish we also needed to assign a length cm to the damselfish placed in the grid cell eakin 1987 quantified the agonistic responses of damselfish towards invading sea urchins according to their lengths we generated a damselfish agonistic response sampling distribution f r j based on eakin s data table 3 that were sampled to determine the agonistic response of a damselfish towards invading sea urchins according to the length of the damselfish myrberg 1972 quantified the nip dominance interactions between smaller and larger damselfish a sufficiently aggressive smaller damselfish may supplant a slightly larger damselfish from its algal lawn however the likelihood of this event was not quantified to enable some variation in the size of damselfish placed in a cell to account for the possibility that a smaller damselfish may supplant or replace a larger one we used the size based sampling distribution of damselfish agonism at uva reef f r j to determine which size of damselfish to place in a cell table 3 we associated damselfish size to proximity to the mp such that the two largest fish sizes 10 2 and 10 1 cm were eligible for placement 1 m from the mp the next two largest fish sizes 9 9 and 9 6 cm were eligible for placement 2 m from the mp and so forth we determined the size of damselfish to place in a cell by sampling the damselfish agonistic response sampling distribution f r j and if the response was agonistic we placed the larger of the two fish in the cell we assumed that damselfish that were initially seeded in a grid cell would remain in that cell over a one year time span the time duration used for our test runs itzkowitz 1978 found through manipulation experiments that damselfish that were removed from their habitat were replaced within 24 hours by individuals of similar size to those removed 2 7 2 sea urchin aggregation formation we modeled the possible formation of sea urchin aggregations we assumed that a minimum of 20 ind m 2 table 4 is the threshold for the potential formation of an echinoid aggregation pearse and arch 1969 we randomly placed n points n number of sea urchins in current cell that represent the centroids of each of n urchins within a 1 m2 cell we then used the k means clustering algorithm to find the existence of clusters within a cell we started with one cluster and determined if the number of individuals in the cluster exceeded the minimum threshold of 20 ind m 2 if so we determined if the sea urchins were packed close enough to form an aggregation we obtained the total sum of squares computed by the k means cluster algorithm for the n sea urchins and calculated the ratio ρ as ρ τ m a x n τ n where τ m a x n is the total sum of squares for n sea urchins that are packed close enough together so that the spines of each sea urchin were in contact and τn is the total sum of squares computed for the n sea urchins if ρ 0 05 we assumed the cluster of echinoids had formed an aggregation ρ 0 05 is representative of d mexicanum with a mean test diameter of 2 cm glynn 1988 and whose spines are within 2 cm of the spines of neighboring echinoids of the same test diameter if the number of sea urchins in the cluster is less than 20 individuals or if ρ 0 05 we performed the k means cluster algorithm with two clusters then three clusters and so on until we either found a cluster of more than 20 individuals with ρ 0 05 or we could not find any clusters that would satisfy this criterion if we found the existence of a sea urchin aggregation in a cell for each sea urchin in the cell that was not a member of the aggregation but was located within 10 cm of the aggregation we sampled from the distribution fj to determine if the sea urchin would join the aggregation table 3 this is in accordance with field observations pearse and arch 1969 where it was found that 6 out of 9 times individual sea urchins located within 10 cm of an aggregation joined the aggregation we also modeled the disaggregation of sea urchin aggregations this was required to prevent the perpetual existence of aggregations and to also break up any aggregations that were too large in excess of 300 individuals m 2 table 4 we sampled the distribution fd table 3 for each time step to determine if an existing aggregation should disaggregate into smaller groups of cohorts if an aggregation is to be disaggregated we sample from the distribution fg table 3 that indicates the number of equal sized groups of cohorts into which the aggregation will be split 2 7 3 sea urchin homing if sea urchins in a grid cell are not exhibiting aggregation behavior and their abundance does not exceed 20 ind m 2 table 4 it is possible that the sea urchins may be exhibiting an affinity to a specific cavity within the coral framework this is known as homing behavior carpenter 1984 carpenter found that the frequency of homing behavior percent returns to the same cavity of diadema antillarum was negatively correlated with sea urchin density we used the linear relationship established by carpenter table 4 to determine if echinoids are exhibiting homing behavior the linear function uses sea urchin abundance as the predictor variable and returns the probability that a sea urchin will exhibit homing behavior this probability is used to dynamically create a sampling distribution to determine if a sea urchin is exhibiting homing behavior and if so the sea urchin will return to its cell at the end of the current time step 2 7 4 sea urchin linear movement linear movement of sea urchins was modeled on a daily basis by sampling a non central chi squared distribution to simulate normally distributed movement along x and y axes on a two dimensional plane glynn et al 2017 we used the non central chi squared distribution defined as fx x 2 1 5 for computing the linear movement of non aggregating sea urchins where λ 1 5 is the mean distance of travel from the initial location of a sea urchin and we used fx x 2 1 0 for computing the linear movement of aggregating sea urchins where λ 1 0 is the mean distance of travel from the initial location of a sea urchin table 3 once the distance of linear movement for a sea urchin entity individual or aggregation is established the direction of travel is determined by randomly sampling from a list of candidate cells located within a 5 m 5 m von neumann neighborhood consisting of 24 cells where the originating cell is the center of the neighborhood if a sea urchin aggregation is scheduled to move to a new cell and the number of individuals in the aggregation moving from the current cell combined with the number of individuals in the destination cell exceeds 300 sea urchins or if another aggregation is encountered table 4 the sea urchin aggregation will be ejected back to its current cell the model domain consists of a square lattice containing 256 cells 16 16 m2 with periodic boundary conditions for movement of sea urchins across cells the upper half portion of the square represents the reef base and the lower half of the square the reef slope sea urchins can move unconstrained across reef zone boundaries sea urchins may move outside of the study site we established a boundary condition to account for sea urchins that may move outside the study site where the objective is to maintain relatively constant sea urchin densities per reef zone within the study site eakin 2001 found that sea urchin densities in the reef slope and reef base zones remained relatively stable for several years following the 1982 1983 el niño event we assumed that a relatively constant flux of sea urchins moving into the study site and leaving the study site is maintained following the movement of sea urchins we calculate the mean of sea urchin population density for both the reef base and reef zone and restock any significant deficits in sea urchins within a particular zone with additional sea urchins the sea urchins are randomly placed in cells positioned in the outer two layers of a zone boundary to simulate sea urchins entering the study site from outside its boundaries 2 7 5 interspecific interaction when sea urchins move to a grid cell they may encounter a damselfish that is occupying that cell we modeled the agonistic response of damselfish towards invading sea urchins fig 6 for sea urchin aggregations in particular if the agonistic response of a damselfish is sufficiently strong to result in the ejection of an invading sea urchin aggregation the aggregation will be ejected back to its originating cell pearse and arch 1969 found that with sufficient prodding sea urchin aggregations moved back away from the point of irritation as a single unit glynn 1988 quantified highly aggressive agonistic responses by damselfish towards sea urchins as continuous aggression exceeding 3 min 2 7 6 bioerosion the continuous grazing of high post enso abundances of sea urchins on dead coral substrata at uva reef is the primary contributor of bioerosion of the coral framework glynn 1988 we assumed sea urchins feeding continuously with a mean daily bioerosion rate of 0 2 g ind 1 day 1 glynn 1988 the reef slope zone at uva reef location of mp maintained high topographic complexity several years following the 1982 1983 enso eakin 2001 this ensures that sufficient carbonate substrates exist for grazing by sea urchins over the duration of one year we calculated a bioerosion score at the end of each test run of the model the bioerosion score is an estimate of the weight of caco3 eroded within the mp by echinoid aggregations on a daily basis g m 2 day 1 we singled out echinoid aggregations because they represent a significant bioerosive threat to the reef framework due to their large number of concentrated individuals temporal and spatial persistence and unified movement of cohorts the bioerosion score is computed as follows β i ω ε k 1 6 μ i ω γ k ρ γ k β i ω g m 2 day 1 of caco3 eroded by echinoid aggregations for test run i 1 2 250 for test category ω 0 1 where ω 0 represents tests conducted with no damselfish present and ω 1 are tests conducted

performed a total of n 500 test runs of the model using two categories of testing n1 250 tests with the presence of damselfish and n0 250 tests without the presence of damselfish all test runs had a duration of 1 year a total of 365 daily time steps the stochastic processes used to simulate biological and ecological processes enabled us to obtain a range of responses 2 9 statistical analysis we developed a randomization test procedure manly 1998 to test the null hypothesis that the difference in the mean bioerosion score for the n1 250 test runs with the presence of damselfish and the mean bioerosion score of the n0 250 test runs without the presence of damselfish is not statistically different the details of the randomization test procedure are contained in the appendix 2 10 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that represent the daily mean bioerosion rate of individual sea urchins and the affinity for sea urchins to form aggregations to assess their effect on the main response variable of bioerosion score g m 2 day 1 we chose the low and high end of the range of bioerosion rates for diadema mexicanum individuals quantified by glynn 1988 at the uva island reef where the low end value is 0 11 g day 1 and the high end value is 0 24 g day 1 the aggregation affinity threshold parameter was increased and decreased by 25 from the baseline value of 0 05 the higher value of 0 0625 corresponds to a higher threshold for individual sea urchins to form an aggregation sea urchins are more tightly clustered than for the value of 0 05 the lower value of 0 04 corresponds to a lower threshold for individual sea urchins to form an aggregation sea urchins are more loosely clustered than for the value of 0 05 3 results mean sea urchin ejection event count frequencies within the mp for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish are present was 0 886 0 036 ejections m 2 day 1 mean sd fig 8 a sea urchin ejection event count frequencies were binned in intervals of 0 01 ejections m 2 day 1 the mean sea urchin ejection event count frequency included ejection events resulting from damselfish aggression and from ejection events caused when a sea urchin aggregation attempted to move to another cell in the mp that also contained a sea urchin aggregation the mean sea urchin ejection event count frequency not attributed to damselfish agonism was 0 1647 0 1164 ejections m 2 day 1 mean sd mean damselfish population density count frequencies for n1 250 test cases was 0 21 0 02 ind m 2 mean sd fig 8 b damselfish population density was

250 test cases where damselfish were not present was 1 526 0 847 g m 2 day 1 mean sd fig 8 d bioerosion scores were binned in intervals of 0 1 g m 2 day 1 a linear regression model was used to fit the relationship between damselfish density ind m 2 and sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present fig 9 a the linear regression model was defined by the equation y 0 09936 x 1 0411 where x represents damselfish density and y the response in sea urchin ejection events the model was statistically significant with p 0 00001596 and r2 0 07247 a linear regression model was used to fit the relationship between the natural logarithm of sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 and sea urchin aggregation frequency aggregations m 2 day 1 for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present fig 9 b sea urchin aggregation frequency is a measure of how often sea urchin aggregations occupy cells located within the mp the linear regression model is defined by the equation y 0 0303474 log x 1 0 0372109 where x represents the frequency of sea urchin ejection events and y the response in sea urchin aggregation frequency the model is statistically significant with p 0 00000002048 and r2 0 1193 a poisson regression model with the dispersion parameter ratio of variance to mean allowed to vary was used to fit the relationship between bioerosion scores g m 2 day 1 that quantify bioerosion within the mp and frequency of sea urchin aggregations within the mp aggreg m 2 day 1 for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present fig 9 c the poisson regression model was defined by the equation y e 41 2683 x 0 6598 where y is the predicted bioerosion score g m 2 day 1 for test category 1 damselfish present and x is the sea urchin aggregation frequency within the mp ind m 2 day 1 with dispersion parameter of 0 285355 and residual deviance of 63 786 with 248 degrees of freedom dof the deviance goodness of fit test was used to determine how closely our model fits the observed data we obtained p 0 999995 which indicates we cannot reject the proposed poisson regression model finally we tested whether the influence of the damselfish sea urchin interaction was indeed significant we computed δ the difference of the mean of the distribution of bioerosion scores b 1 for n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present and the mean of the distribution of bioerosion scores b 0 for n0 250 test cases without the presence of damselfish and obtained δ 0 5596 g m 2 da y 1 the null hypothesis was defined as p p δ k δ 0 001 for k 1 n where p the probability that δ is the same size or smaller than a randomly selected δ k from δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n exceeds 0 1 using a significance level α 0 01 the null hypothesis states that δ can be explained as just another value found within the distribution δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n which are the differences in bioerosion scores obtained from the randomization procedure performed on b 0 and b 1 the alternative hypothesis was defined as p p δ k δ 0 001 for k 1 n it states that δ cannot be explained as just another value found within the distribution δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n δ is at least the same size or larger than 99 9 of the values in δ and therefore the bioerosion scores in the distribution b 1are statistically different than the bioerosion scores in the distribution b 0 we needed to choose a minimum number of randomizations n to perform to obtain a sufficient number of δ k so that the significance level α was close to the level that would be obtained considering all possible numbers of randomizations marriott 1979 quantified a methodology for determining the minimum number of randomizations given values for p and α for p 0 001 and α 0 01 n 5000 or more randomizations are sufficient to ensure that the significance level α is close to the level for all possible randomizations we performed a total of n 1000000 trials and produced a distribution δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n where each δ k is the difference of the means computed from each randomization trial performed on b 1 and b 0 fig 10 illustrates a histogram of the frequency counts of the difference in means of bioerosion scores obtained from the randomization trials δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n for k 1 1 000 000 with an arrow pointing to the estimated location of δ 0 5596 g m 2 da y 1 we found m a x 1 k 1000000 δ k 0 3982 g m 2 da y 1 we found no δ k that exceeded δ 0 5596 g m 2 day 1 fig 10 this difference reflects the indirect damselfish effect which results in greater bioerosion we concluded that sufficient evidence existed that the distribution of bioerosion scores with damselfish present b 1 showed a mean bioerosive effect that was signficantly greater than the distribution of bioerosion scores with damselfish absent b 0 the difference in bioerosive effect δ results in an additional annual caco3 consumption of 4 085 kg inside the mp 0 204 kg m 2 yr 1 3 1 model verification the model was verified to ensure that it provides an accurate representation of the uva reef environment following the 1982 1983 el niño event in particular verification analysis was performed to determine if the abundance distributions of damselfish and sea urchins and the bioerosion levels of dead coral framework attributed to sea urchins obtained from our simulation test runs were consistent with field observations the damselfish population density distribution statistics of 0 21 0 02 ind m 2 mean sd found for n1 250 test cases were significantly different from field surveys performed in the gulf of panama wellington and victor 1985 where pocillopora patches of high topographic complexity demonstrated a mean damselfish density of 0 32 0 13 ind m 2 mean sd two sample t test t 26 556 df 999 p 0

mean sd obtained from simulation testing results were significantly different from the sea urchin population surveys performed at uva reef by eakin 2001 following the 1982 1983 el niño event of 40 6 7

difference of 1 59 ind m 2 the bioerosion score obtained from simulation testing for the reef slope zone not including the mp of 4 148 0 156 g m 2 day 1 mean sd was significantly different from the mean sea urchin bioerosion measured at the reef slope on uva reef eakin 1996 of 2 84 g m 2 day 1 t 41 503 df 999 p 0 0000000000000022 mean difference of 1 318 g m 2 day 1 3 2 parameter sensitivity we conducted testing to determine the sensitivity of the bioerosion response to the parameters of individual daily bioerosion per individual sea urchin and the aggregation affinity threshold parameter table 5 we compared the bioerosion response distributions for each of the five test cases fig 11 the coefficients of variation for the bioerosion response for the high cvhigh 0 3696 and low cvlow 0 3570 daily carbonate erosion per individual sea urchin were similar to the baseline test scenario cvbaseline 0 4029 the bioerosion response was very sensitive to a 25 change in the aggregation affinity threshold parameter in either direction from the baseline value of 0 05 for the high aggregation affinity threshold there was a significant decline in the mean bioerosion response when compared to the bioerosion response for the baseline test cases kolmogorov smirnov test d 0 96 p 0 00000000000000022 a higher threshold for a group of sea urchins in close proximity to form into aggregations resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of aggregations that were formed within the mp correspondingly there was a significant increase in the bioerosion response for the low aggregation affinity threshold when compared to the bioerosion response for the baseline test cases kolmogorov smirnov test d 0 6988 p 0 0000000000000002 a lower threshold for a group of sea urchins in close proximity to form into aggregations resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of aggregations that were formed within the mp 4 discussion our modeling study confirms a strong interaction between damselfish and sea urchins and that damselfish agonistic behavior towards invading echinoids contributes to a complex indirect effect on the overall caco3 budget of a coral reef the bioerosion score frequencies where damselfish were present was 2 0842 0 8398 g m 2 day 1 which are significantly different than the bioerosion score frequencies of 1 526 0 847 g m 2 day 1 where damselfish are not present two sample t test t 45 177 df 9999 p 0 0000000000000022 mean difference of 0 5502828 these results are consistent with δ 0 5596 the difference of the mean of the distribution of bioerosion scores obtained from n 1 000 000 randomization test trials the damselfish s acapulcoensis prevents entry of d mexicanum onto their algal lawns on pacific reefs in panamá during daylight hours contributing to the preservation of caco3 glynn 1988 within the territorial algal lawns of 0 15 kg m 2 yr 1 on the reef slope and 0 33 kg m 2 yr 1 at the reef base eakin 1996 our study further clarified this interaction and found that an increase in the number of sea urchin aggregations that are ejected back into the mp monitored plot by damselfish resulted in an exponential increase of the bioerosive effect caused by sea urchin aggregations we found that such aggregations could remain entrapped within coral patches in response to damselfish aggression two mechanisms appeared at work damselfish ejecting sea urchins back into the mp and their tendency to remain aggregated the ejection of sea urchin aggregations back into the mp increased their grazing time and erosive action inside the mp this may be explained by the spatial distribution of damselfish surrounding the mp the spatial and abundance distributions of sea urchins emerging from the interspecies dynamic with damselfish is shown in fig 7 the plots show from simulation data the emergence of sea urchin aggregations within the mp with some sea urchin aggregations containing very high abundances of sea urchins sea urchin aggregations that successfully invaded the mp and attempted to move out encountered larger more aggressive damselfish close to the mp which increased the likelihood of being ejected back to their originating cell within the mp the cohesiveness of the sea urchin aggregations seemingly offers an advantage of defense from predators and competitors echinoid individuals in aggregations respond in unison moving as a unit and with spine posturing directed toward potential threats this behavior has been reported in several species of diadema worldwide pearse and arch 1969 snyder and snyder 1970 the damselfish aggression against select members of the aggregation therefore affects the entire group explaining how an entire aggregation can become trapped in an area by fish at its borders the modeled mean damselfish population density of 0 21 0 02 ind m 2 mean se found for n1 250 test cases conforms with field surveys in the gulf of panama wellington and victor 1985 0 32 0 13 s e individuals m 2 in pocillopora patches of high topographic complexity and our model suggests that damselfish density number of individuals m 2 fig 9 a and the frequency of sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 are related while the low r2 value of the linear model suggests that damselfish population density explains little of the variance in sea urchin ejection events the statistical significance of the linear model indicates a positive trend with increasing damselfish density resulting in an increase in the mean number of sea urchin ejection events the poisson regression model used to fit the relationship between bioerosion scores g m 2 cell 1 day 1 and sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 fig 9 c suggests a positive correlation increase in sea urchin ejection events resulted in an exponential increase in the bioerosive effect caused by sea urchin aggregations being ejected back into the mp the exponential response may be attributed to the cumulative effect of the increasing number of sea urchins contained within large aggregations 200 individuals that are ejected back into the mp an intricate ecological mechanism fig 12 links the spatial distribution of damselfish the movement of sea urchin aggregations and bioerosion 1 higher damselfish density predicts an increase in the frequency of sea urchin aggregations that are ejected back into the mp sea urchin aggregations that attempt to leave the mp encounter larger more aggressive damselfish around the periphery of the mp this is because the mp represents preferred habitat for damselfish due to its high topographic complexity eakin 2001 wellington and victor 1985 with the size mediated spatial distribution of damselfish around preferred habitat itzkowitz 1978 larger more aggressive damselfish tend to occupy territories in proximity to the mp the increase in damselfish density individuals m 2 predicted an increase in the number of sea urchin aggregations ejected back into the mp when they attempt to leave fig 9 a 2 an increase in the frequency of sea urchin aggregations that are ejected back into the mp predicts an increase in the amount of time that they remain within the mp aggreg m 2 day 1 fig 9 b 3 an increase in the incidence of sea urchin aggregations inside the mp causes an increase in the carbonate erosion positive exponential correlation between an increase in sea urchin aggregation frequency inside the mp aggreg m 2 day 1 and amount of bioerosion attributed to sea urchin aggregations g m 2 day 1 fig 9 c 10 eakin 1996 developed a caco3 budget model for the uva reef that accounts for production by corals and coralline algae erosion by sea urchins infauna fish and other motile organisms and the retention of sediments eakin calculated bioerosion attributed to sea urchins for each reef zone by using destruction rates from bucket experiments the estimate of 4 148 0 156 g m 2 day 1 we obtained for bioerosion rates in the reef slope exclusive of bioerosion rates within the mp is significantly different than the 2 84 g m 2 day 1 eakin obtained the bucket experiments did not account for the additional bioerosive effect of sea urchin aggregations emerging from intra species dynamics between sea urchins we excluded the bioerosion estimates of the mp from our model verification analysis because of the additional bioerosion attributed to the indirect damselfish effect which eakin also did not consider in his caco3 budget model glynn and colgan 1992 found that sea urchin bioerosion underestimates the amount of reef framework destruction because sea urchins often undercut coral colonies that are then more susceptible to toppling and further breakage our study found an additional annual caco3 erosion of 4 085 kg inside the mp 0 204 kg m 2 yr 1 with post enso conditions of low coral cover and high sea urchin abundances this represents a 20 increase from the annual caco3 erosion attributed to sea urchins in the fore reef slope at uva reef estimated by eakin s 1996 caco3 budget model we found the mean frequency of occurrence of sea urchin aggregations within the mp when damselfish are present to be 0 0079716 aggreg m 2 day 1 compared to 0 005854 aggreg m 2 day 1within the mp when damselfish are not present sea urchin abundances collapsed between 1994 1998 resulting in the uva reef slope accretion changing from a net erosional state of 0 53 kg m 2 yr 1 to a net depositional state of 0 21 kg m 2 yr 1 eakin 2001 the additional bioerosive effect from sea urchin aggregations entrapped within the mp is more concentrated within specific locations in the coral framework due to the spatial co location of the sea urchin aggregations we posit that this additional bioerosive effect if it results in sea urchins eroding subsurface framework structures causing instability and collapse especially during periods of elevated turbulence must be considerable potentially resulting in the fracturing of large portions of coral framework blocks further study is required to quantify the relationship between subsurface bioerosion and framework stability sandin and mcnamara 2012 and eynaud et al 2016 developed spatially explicit models to explore benthic competition on coral reefs both models implemented herbivore grazing patterns on a spatial scale to explore how grazing of fleshy algae that competes with corals for space can promote reef recovery by providing a favorable environment for coral recruitment and reef accretion this is in contrast with our study where we explored the bioerosive effect of sea urchins on reefs with low coral cover and high numbers of sea urchins following an enso event that resulted in significant levels of coral bleaching and subsequent coral mortality in our abm individual sea urchin agents could interact with each other across time and space enabling the emergence of sea urchin aggregations when sufficiently high densities of sea urchins in close proximity collected within cells in the square lattice the emergence of aggregation behavior results in higher levels of bioerosion since the sea urchin aggregations exhibit more spatially constrained grazing patterns than collections of individual sea urchins two agent based modeling studies that incorporated coral bleaching and mortality disturbances on western pacific reefs demonstrated nil to only minor coral framework degradation compared to the major effects observed in our study in panama morrison and addison 2008 study in american samoa included enso induced coral bleaching and mortality disturbances that could potentially result in reef framework destruction and the subsequent loss of habitat for molluscan resources relatively steady shellfish exploitation over approximately 1500 years suggested continuous habitat availability and stability of marine resource use excluding climatic enso impacts a second study miñarro et al 2018 also considering warm phase enso coral bleaching disturbances showed declines in coral cover during enso events but rapid intra annual recovery following bleaching frequency cycles of 2 and 10 years with slow but positive coral recovery over periods of 20 years perhaps this western versus eastern pacific difference is due to the eastern pacific enso regime being one of the dominant and most consequential climate variations on earth yeh et al 2018 another contributing factor is the highly efficient bioeroding echinoid diadema mexicanum which occurs abundantly on eastern pacific reefs but not in the western pacific alvarado et al 2012 eakin 1996 glynn 1988 in another iconic eastern pacific coral reef area in the galapagos the damselfish sea urchin interaction has also been demonstrated glynn 1988 reefs in the southern and central islands were quickly lost to bioerosion by sea urchins after mortality in 1982 3 but the role of the indirect damselfish effect resulting in the formation of sea urchin aggregations has not yet been investigated glynn et al 2017 bioeroding sea urchins and damselfish occur together along the entire eastern pacific reef province alvarado et al 2017 and therefore the influence of the herein described interaction between the two species on overall rates of bioerosion is potentially significant region wide credit author statement peter j glynn conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

24875,significant increases in the population of the echinoid bioeroder diadema mexicanum that may soon follow severe el niño events such as in 1982 1983 can have a significant negative impact on the carbonate budget of coral reefs we developed a spatially explicit model that uses agent based modeling techniques to simulate the interactions between damselfish and sea urchins on an eastern pacific coral reef following an el niño southern oscillation enso event where high echinoid abundances and low coral cover were prevalent our modeling study suggests that the agonistic behavior of damselfish towards echinoids invading their defended algal lawn territories has a magnifying effect on the degree of bioerosion attributed to echinoids this is due to the increased likelihood that sea urchins ejected from damselfish territories will form concentrated aggregations and remain grazing and eroding coral for longer periods of time this is a novel insight that contrasts with the previous understanding of the positive effect that damselfish have on reef carbonate budgets by protecting carbonate substrates that lie within their defended algal lawn territories the increased degradation of coral stands attributed to the indirect damselfish effect if it results in sea urchins eroding subsurface coral framework structures causing instability and collapse especially during periods of high water motion may contribute to the fracturing of large portions of coral framework blocks affecting the recovery trajectory of reefs following a severe el niño disturbance event keywords agent based model bioerosion eastern tropical pacific el niño southern oscillation damselfish sea urchins coral mortality introduction trophic and non trophic interactions can have significant influences on ecosystems schmitz 2009 for example aggression or predation can lead to shifts in habitat use in many organisms marine as well as terrestrial pringle et al 2019 on eastern pacific coral reefs population and movement dynamics of a sea urchin diadema mexicanum can be positively or negatively influenced by damselfish stegastes acapulcoensis aggression glynn 1990 hixon 1997 2015 jones 1991 karlson 1999 kaufman 1977 pennings 1997 potts 1977 vine 1974 in defending their algal lawn territories damselfishes aid sammarco 1980 wellington 1982 or interfere lobel 1980 potts 1977 with sea urchins by providing trophic resources or in limiting grazing time respectively but damselfish also influence coral recruitment competitive outcomes among corals kaufman 1977 reduce coral mortality from predators and competitors glynn and colgan 1988 sammarco and carleton 1982 sammarco and williams 1982 and affect bioerosive processes risk and sammarco 1982 sammarco et al 1987 strömberg and kvarnemo 2005 thus a tight coupling of movement and population dynamics of sea urchins and damselfish behaviors and abundance can be expected that in turn will influence corals and reef building accretion but the net influence of this multi faceted interaction on the ecosystem and on reef building are still poorly understood it furthermore remains unquantified whether the spatial distribution of damselfish on a panamanian coral reef uva island might exacerbate the erosion and degradation of the reef framework especially following severe el niño southern oscillation enso events such as in 1982 1983 the fundamental ecological interactions between damselfish which cultivate and protect algal lawn territories and sea urchins that graze on algae and in the process erode coral substrates are herein explored in a modeling study based on empirical observations enso events cortés et al 1984 glynn 1983 1984 robinson 1985 von prahl 1983 trigger these interactions by precipitating increases in sea urchin population abundances eakin 1996 glynn 1988 sea urchins attempting to invade and graze on algal lawns are aggressively ejected by damselfish and tend to form aggregations outside of defended lawn territories the sea urchin aggregations persist and result in severe coral erosion bioerosion eakin 1996 2001 glynn 1988 later sea urchin declines coincided with loss of topographic complexity suggesting echinoid population collapse was precipitated by their increased bioerosional activity and loss of sheltering habitat eakin 2001 after their population collapse uva reef experienced robust recovery and its present day morphology consists of patches with high live coral cover interspersed with areas of little to no coral cover strewn with dead coral rubble fong et al 2017 from this sequence of events we derive the testable null hypothesis that damselfish ejection of sea urchins from their territories has no effect on coral bioerosion our empirical observations support an alternative hypothesis namely that the defense of algal lawns by damselfish can indeed promote sea urchin aggregations that exacerbate coral bioerosion thus a spatially heterogeneous pattern of high and low densities of sea urchins will lead to areas of increased erosion versus areas of favored coral growth by protecting their algal lawns from sea urchins the damselfish at the same time may create a refuge for corals high densities of damselfish territories could therefore protect corals which is in contrast to the caribbean where some damselfish species kill corals to establish their territories and can therefore negatively impact coral health precht et al 2010 vermeij et al 2015 to evaluate the suspected role of damselfish sea urchin interaction we developed a spatially explicit model of a study site located on uva reef gulf of chiriquí panama following an el niño southern oscillation enso event that resulted in high echinoid abundances and low coral cover using agent based modeling techniques to simulate the daily interactions between damselfish and sea urchins across both space and time to explore whether this alternative hypothesis could indeed be supported 2 methods 2 1 study site studies were conducted at the uva island coral reef 7 48 46 n 81 45 35 w in the gulf of chiriquí pacific panama fig 1 a and b this reef is 2 5 ha in planar area shallow 1 6 m depth and is situated in a sheltered nw facing embayment the principal framework building corals are ramose pocilloporid species mainly pocillopora damicornis and pocillopora elegans a bathymetric map fig 1 c was produced in may 2010 using a downward directed adcp acoustic doppler current profiler sontec riverprofiler that collected velocity as well as bathymetric information mapped depths were the average obtained from all three transducers on the adcp depth was corrected against tidal state and anchored on mean low tide using tidal information from panama city republic of panama irregularly spaced survey points were extrapolated to a regular grid over the survey area in order to produce a combination of a surface and contour plot each depth contour represents a depth gradient of 50 cm at site i fig 1 c where damselfish counts were performed is a 4 5 m2 pocilloporid monitoring plot established by r h richmond in 1984 this site henceforth denoted as monitored coral plot mp is located in the fore reef slope zone with pre enso el niño southern oscillation high coral cover 70 which declined to nearly 0 coral cover during and immediately following the 1982 83 warm water bleaching event no damselfish were observed within the mp they were located only around the periphery for our modeling study we assumed that damselfish would not occupy locations within the mp and that only sea urchins could access the mp non quantitative surveys were also conducted on the forereef slope at the southwestern arm of the reef denoted as site ii these surveys demonstrated that high pocilloporid cover topographic complexity and abundances of damselfish and sea urchins were similar to the principal study site i 2 2 the model the model in this study was implemented as an agent based model abm the model offers a novel approach for studying the complex interactions between sea urchins and damselfish and differs from other recent spatial simulation models of coral reef dynamics langmead and sheppard 2004 sleeman et al 2005 mumby et al 2006 yñiguez et al 2008 sandin and mcnamara 2012 eynaud et al 2016 in our abm in contrast to other recent spatial simulation models sea urchin agents can interact with each other across time and space enabling the emergence of sea urchin aggregations when sufficiently high densities of sea urchins in close proximity collected within cells in the square lattice the purpose of this abm was to simulate the daily interactions between damselfish and sea urchins on both a spatial and temporal scale on a tropical eastern pacific reef during post enso high urchin abundance conditions and low coral cover to test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of the damselfish stegastes acapulcoensis at uva reef contributes to the severe degradation of reef frameworks by driving higher levels of echinoid bioerosion the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 and was developed using the r programming language version 1 0 153 2009 2017 rstudio inc r core team 2013 the source code and input files for the model can be found in the public code repository at https github com pglynn4793 damsel urchin bioerosion model 2 2 1 scale of model the model domain consists of a square lattice containing 256 cells 16 16 m2 with periodic boundary conditions to be known as the study site each cell representing 1 m 2 of reef fig 2 cells may contain damselfish echinoids or both the upper half portion of the square represents the reef base and the lower half of the square the reef slope sea urchins can move unconstrained across reef zone boundaries sea urchins may also move outside of the boundaries of the study site a process was implemented to replenish the study site with sea urchins on a periodic basis to maintain the sea urchin abundances established as initial conditions for each reef zone see section 2 7 4 the 4 5 m2 mp is inscribed within the lower half portion of the square bordering the reef base the temporal scale of the model is daily 24 h and simulation tests were executed for 365 time steps 1year since interactions between damselfish and sea urchins differ between day and night glynn 1988 we randomly select day or night at each time step to facilitate the either daytime or nighttime urchin damselfish dynamics 2 2 2 entities entities in this abm are individual sea urchins damselfish and aggregations of sea urchins their interactions are modeled across a spatial and temporal scale interactions occur when individual sea urchins or grazing sea urchin aggregations travel across grid cells and encounter algal lawns occupied by damselfish table 1 2 2 2 1 echinoids the echinoid diadema mexicanum experienced a significant increase in abundance at uva reef following the 1982 1983 el niño event glynn 1988 fig 3 a echinoid densities varied on uva reef with means of 40 6 ind m 2 in the deeper reef base zone and 20 2 ind m 2 in the shallower reef slope eakin 2001 glynn 1988 quantified the bioerosive impact on dead coral with a mean loss due to abrasion of 0 2 g caco3 ind 1 day 1 individual echinoids can exhibit homing or non homing behaviors if echinoids exhibit an affinity for a specific site within the coral framework this is known as homing behavior carpenter 1984 2 2 2 2 aggregation of echinoids several tropical echinoid species including diadema mexicanum may form aggregations that consist of hundreds of individuals glynn 1988 observed occasional fronts of d mexicanum on uva reef consisting of a few hundred individuals grazing along the periphery of algal lawns aggregations of echinoids behave as social units pearse and arch 1969 they exhibit a degree of persistence remaining in aggregations in the same area for several days responding to external stimuli as a single unit while aggregations may change in shape size and position they are believed to be formed in response to high population densities where individuals are more likely to come into contact echinoid aggregations can result in significant carbonate erosion due to the large numbers of individuals that may remain in a particular location for several days 2 2 2 3 damselfish individuals of the damselfish stegastes acapulcoensis fig 3 b were observed to eject the echinoid diadema mexicanum from their algal lawns at uva reef glynn 1988 glynn quantified the ejection rates of echinoids invading damselfish protected algal lawns by observing damselfish agonistic behavior in 3 min trial periods and counting the number of echinoids that remained glynn found that damselfish exhibited agonistic behavior and echinoid ejection only during daylight hours eakin 1987 found and quantified that the degree of damselfish agonism towards invading echinoids was related to damselfish size smaller damselfish were less likely to exhibit agonistic behavior than larger damselfish itzkowitz 1978 observed that larger damselfish exhibited dominance over smaller damselfish and that size mediated spatial distribution of damselfish was correlated with proximity to preferred habitat we assumed that the mp site represented preferred damselfish habitat due to its high topographic complexity wellington and victor 1985 on the uva island reef damselfish that were harassed in situ by hand waving typically defended their territories for 1 2 min and then would swim towards the mp to find shelter among pocillopora colonies of high topographic relief glynn 2017 pers observation 2 2 3 state variables a collection of vectors v i j t i 1 16 j 1 16 t 0 365 was used to represent the state of the system for each time step t and for each grid cell in the square lattice indexed by the subscripts ij where i is the horizontal component of the grid cell location and j the vertical component the components of the vector νij t are defined in table 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the model is run on a daily basis for a period of 1 year 365 time steps the sequencing of the model processes is shown in a flow diagram fig 4 with more detailed descriptions of the sea urchin foraging behavior fig 5 and inter species interaction processes fig 6 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 emergence the spatial distribution of sea urchins emerges from the foraging behavior of sea urchin model agents and the interspecific interactions that occur between individual sea urchins sea urchin aggregations and damselfish agents fig 7 demonstrates the emergence of sea urchin aggregations resulting from a thigmotaxic behavior response of sea urchins clustered together in close proximity 2 4 2 interaction sea urchin individuals or sea urchins that form aggregations may move to adjacent grid cells or remain in their current cell according to the foraging behavior that is implemented in the model damselfish agents were modeled to implement agonistic behaviors towards invading sea urchins these behaviors were modeled as stochastic processes that were based on diurnal response the size of the damselfish and the duration of the agonistic response fig 6 if a sea urchin agent moves to a cell that is occupied by a damselfish and if the occupying damselfish exhibits sufficiently aggressive behavior towards the invading sea urchin agents this will result in the invading sea urchin agent being ejected back to their originating cell sea urchin aggregations may also interact with other sea urchin aggregations when a sea urchin aggregation is scheduled to move to an adjacent cell that also contains a sea urchin aggregation the invading sea urchin aggregation will be ejected back to its originating cell 2 4 3 stochasticity stochastic processes were implemented in the model to simulate the initial seeding of damselfish and echinoid population distributions the foraging behaviors of echinoids the formation and dissolution of echinoid aggregations and the agonistic interactions between damselfish and echinoids table 3 these processes were implemented as probability distributions or as sampling distributions sampling distributions were generated from frequency data obtained from field measurements and published studies 2 4 4 aggregations populations of tropical sea urchins including diadema mexicanum may form into aggregations that consist of hundreds of individuals occasional fronts of d mexicanum on uva reef may consist of up to a few hundred individuals grazing along the periphery of algal lawns glynn 1988 these aggregations exhibit their own behaviors hence their assignment as agents separate from individual urchins 2 4 5 observation to support data analysis and hypothesis testing the spatial distribution of sea urchins across grid cells the cumulative carbonate erosion within the mp the frequency of sea urchin aggregations occupying grid cells within the mp the number of ejections of sea urchins back into their grid cells all within the mp and the size and number of sea urchin aggregations was collected at the end of each simulation model run 2 5 initialization the initial condition for our model is 90 coral mortality throughout the study site with dead coral encrusted with coralline algae we also assumed that the mp is the only region within the study site that maintains high topographic complexity over the one year period used for our simulation model test runs based on eakin 2001 who found that the topographic complexity of the uva reef slope was unchanged following the 1982 1983 enso maintaining high topographic complexity is necessary to ensure that the spatial distribution of damselfish remains stable over time wellington and victor 1985 finally we assume that there was sufficient algal encrusted dead coral rubble available within the study site to provide echinoids with a consistent food supply eakin 2001 the initialization process includes the loading of parameter data table 4 probability and sampling distributions table 3 data that define the spatial extent of the model the seeding of grid cells with sea urchins according to the abundance distributions for each reef zone and the seeding of grid cells with damselfish using damselfish size and distance from mp frequency distributions larger more aggressive damselfish are more likely to be placed closer to the mp than smaller less aggressive damselfish 2 6 input data the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels submodels represent the various processes implemented in the model labeled using italics on the process flow charts figs 4 6 2 7 1 seeding the seeding of grid cells with sea urchins and damselfish was performed at the initiation of each model simulation run we sampled an echinoid abundance distribution according to which reef zone a grid cell is located within x a s for reef slope or x a b reef base to determine the number of echinoids to place in the cell table 3 we excluded the initial placement of echinoids in cells that harbored damselfish to determine if a grid cell is to be seeded with a damselfish the geometric distance from the grid cell to the mp was calculated and the damselfish abundance sampling distribution f a i table 3 that corresponds to the distance from the current cell to the mp was selected and sampled for the occurrence of a damselfish the sampling distribution f a i was generated from empirical data obtained from surveys of damselfish that were performed around the periphery of the mp site on uva reef a scuba diver swam around the periphery of the mp in increments of 1 m out to 8 m we determined if a damselfish was occupying an algal lawn by harassing damselfish by hand waving in proximity 0 25 to 0 5 m distant and observing for any territorial defensive response in return if a defensive response was elicited we tagged the location of the damselfish territory using a gps device a garmin gps 72h model with a dilution of precision less than 3 m we captured the location of each damselfish occupied algal lawn using gps coordinates n 53 coordinate pairs from the coordinates we calculated the geometric distances to the closest point on the mp and produced damselfish abundance sampling distributions f a i as a function of distance from the mp for each distance interval of 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m and 6 m or more if we determined that a grid cell was to be seeded with a damselfish we also needed to assign a length cm to the damselfish placed in the grid cell eakin 1987 quantified the agonistic responses of damselfish towards invading sea urchins according to their lengths we generated a damselfish agonistic response sampling distribution f r j based on eakin s data table 3 that were sampled to determine the agonistic response of a damselfish towards invading sea urchins according to the length of the damselfish myrberg 1972 quantified the nip dominance interactions between smaller and larger damselfish a sufficiently aggressive smaller damselfish may supplant a slightly larger damselfish from its algal lawn however the likelihood of this event was not quantified to enable some variation in the size of damselfish placed in a cell to account for the possibility that a smaller damselfish may supplant or replace a larger one we used the size based sampling distribution of damselfish agonism at uva reef f r j to determine which size of damselfish to place in a cell table 3 we associated damselfish size to proximity to the mp such that the two largest fish sizes 10 2 and 10 1 cm were eligible for placement 1 m from the mp the next two largest fish sizes 9 9 and 9 6 cm were eligible for placement 2 m from the mp and so forth we determined the size of damselfish to place in a cell by sampling the damselfish agonistic response sampling distribution f r j and if the response was agonistic we placed the larger of the two fish in the cell we assumed that damselfish that were initially seeded in a grid cell would remain in that cell over a one year time span the time duration used for our test runs itzkowitz 1978 found through manipulation experiments that damselfish that were removed from their habitat were replaced within 24 hours by individuals of similar size to those removed 2 7 2 sea urchin aggregation formation we modeled the possible formation of sea urchin aggregations we assumed that a minimum of 20 ind m 2 table 4 is the threshold for the potential formation of an echinoid aggregation pearse and arch 1969 we randomly placed n points n number of sea urchins in current cell that represent the centroids of each of n urchins within a 1 m2 cell we then used the k means clustering algorithm to find the existence of clusters within a cell we started with one cluster and determined if the number of individuals in the cluster exceeded the minimum threshold of 20 ind m 2 if so we determined if the sea urchins were packed close enough to form an aggregation we obtained the total sum of squares computed by the k means cluster algorithm for the n sea urchins and calculated the ratio ρ as ρ τ m a x n τ n where τ m a x n is the total sum of squares for n sea urchins that are packed close enough together so that the spines of each sea urchin were in contact and τn is the total sum of squares computed for the n sea urchins if ρ 0 05 we assumed the cluster of echinoids had formed an aggregation ρ 0 05 is representative of d mexicanum with a mean test diameter of 2 cm glynn 1988 and whose spines are within 2 cm of the spines of neighboring echinoids of the same test diameter if the number of sea urchins in the cluster is less than 20 individuals or if ρ 0 05 we performed the k means cluster algorithm with two clusters then three clusters and so on until we either found a cluster of more than 20 individuals with ρ 0 05 or we could not find any clusters that would satisfy this criterion if we found the existence of a sea urchin aggregation in a cell for each sea urchin in the cell that was not a member of the aggregation but was located within 10 cm of the aggregation we sampled from the distribution fj to determine if the sea urchin would join the aggregation table 3 this is in accordance with field observations pearse and arch 1969 where it was found that 6 out of 9 times individual sea urchins located within 10 cm of an aggregation joined the aggregation we also modeled the disaggregation of sea urchin aggregations this was required to prevent the perpetual existence of aggregations and to also break up any aggregations that were too large in excess of 300 individuals m 2 table 4 we sampled the distribution fd table 3 for each time step to determine if an existing aggregation should disaggregate into smaller groups of cohorts if an aggregation is to be disaggregated we sample from the distribution fg table 3 that indicates the number of equal sized groups of cohorts into which the aggregation will be split 2 7 3 sea urchin homing if sea urchins in a grid cell are not exhibiting aggregation behavior and their abundance does not exceed 20 ind m 2 table 4 it is possible that the sea urchins may be exhibiting an affinity to a specific cavity within the coral framework this is known as homing behavior carpenter 1984 carpenter found that the frequency of homing behavior percent returns to the same cavity of diadema antillarum was negatively correlated with sea urchin density we used the linear relationship established by carpenter table 4 to determine if echinoids are exhibiting homing behavior the linear function uses sea urchin abundance as the predictor variable and returns the probability that a sea urchin will exhibit homing behavior this probability is used to dynamically create a sampling distribution to determine if a sea urchin is exhibiting homing behavior and if so the sea urchin will return to its cell at the end of the current time step 2 7 4 sea urchin linear movement linear movement of sea urchins was modeled on a daily basis by sampling a non central chi squared distribution to simulate normally distributed movement along x and y axes on a two dimensional plane glynn et al 2017 we used the non central chi squared distribution defined as fx x 2 1 5 for computing the linear movement of non aggregating sea urchins where λ 1 5 is the mean distance of travel from the initial location of a sea urchin and we used fx x 2 1 0 for computing the linear movement of aggregating sea urchins where λ 1 0 is the mean distance of travel from the initial location of a sea urchin table 3 once the distance of linear movement for a sea urchin entity individual or aggregation is established the direction of travel is determined by randomly sampling from a list of candidate cells located within a 5 m 5 m von neumann neighborhood consisting of 24 cells where the originating cell is the center of the neighborhood if a sea urchin aggregation is scheduled to move to a new cell and the number of individuals in the aggregation moving from the current cell combined with the number of individuals in the destination cell exceeds 300 sea urchins or if another aggregation is encountered table 4 the sea urchin aggregation will be ejected back to its current cell the model domain consists of a square lattice containing 256 cells 16 16 m2 with periodic boundary conditions for movement of sea urchins across cells the upper half portion of the square represents the reef base and the lower half of the square the reef slope sea urchins can move unconstrained across reef zone boundaries sea urchins may move outside of the study site we established a boundary condition to account for sea urchins that may move outside the study site where the objective is to maintain relatively constant sea urchin densities per reef zone within the study site eakin 2001 found that sea urchin densities in the reef slope and reef base zones remained relatively stable for several years following the 1982 1983 el niño event we assumed that a relatively constant flux of sea urchins moving into the study site and leaving the study site is maintained following the movement of sea urchins we calculate the mean of sea urchin population density for both the reef base and reef zone and restock any significant deficits in sea urchins within a particular zone with additional sea urchins the sea urchins are randomly placed in cells positioned in the outer two layers of a zone boundary to simulate sea urchins entering the study site from outside its boundaries 2 7 5 interspecific interaction when sea urchins move to a grid cell they may encounter a damselfish that is occupying that cell we modeled the agonistic response of damselfish towards invading sea urchins fig 6 for sea urchin aggregations in particular if the agonistic response of a damselfish is sufficiently strong to result in the ejection of an invading sea urchin aggregation the aggregation will be ejected back to its originating cell pearse and arch 1969 found that with sufficient prodding sea urchin aggregations moved back away from the point of irritation as a single unit glynn 1988 quantified highly aggressive agonistic responses by damselfish towards sea urchins as continuous aggression exceeding 3 min 2 7 6 bioerosion the continuous grazing of high post enso abundances of sea urchins on dead coral substrata at uva reef is the primary contributor of bioerosion of the coral framework glynn 1988 we assumed sea urchins feeding continuously with a mean daily bioerosion rate of 0 2 g ind 1 day 1 glynn 1988 the reef slope zone at uva reef location of mp maintained high topographic complexity several years following the 1982 1983 enso eakin 2001 this ensures that sufficient carbonate substrates exist for grazing by sea urchins over the duration of one year we calculated a bioerosion score at the end of each test run of the model the bioerosion score is an estimate of the weight of caco3 eroded within the mp by echinoid aggregations on a daily basis g m 2 day 1 we singled out echinoid aggregations because they represent a significant bioerosive threat to the reef framework due to their large number of concentrated individuals temporal and spatial persistence and unified movement of cohorts the bioerosion score is computed as follows β i ω ε k 1 6 μ i ω γ k ρ γ k β i ω g m 2 day 1 of caco3 eroded by echinoid aggregations for test run i 1 2 250 for test category ω 0 1 where ω 0 represents tests conducted with no damselfish present and ω 1 are tests conducted

performed a total of n 500 test runs of the model using two categories of testing n1 250 tests with the presence of damselfish and n0 250 tests without the presence of damselfish all test runs had a duration of 1 year a total of 365 daily time steps the stochastic processes used to simulate biological and ecological processes enabled us to obtain a range of responses 2 9 statistical analysis we developed a randomization test procedure manly 1998 to test the null hypothesis that the difference in the mean bioerosion score for the n1 250 test runs with the presence of damselfish and the mean bioerosion score of the n0 250 test runs without the presence of damselfish is not statistically different the details of the randomization test procedure are contained in the appendix 2 10 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that represent the daily mean bioerosion rate of individual sea urchins and the affinity for sea urchins to form aggregations to assess their effect on the main response variable of bioerosion score g m 2 day 1 we chose the low and high end of the range of bioerosion rates for diadema mexicanum individuals quantified by glynn 1988 at the uva island reef where the low end value is 0 11 g day 1 and the high end value is 0 24 g day 1 the aggregation affinity threshold parameter was increased and decreased by 25 from the baseline value of 0 05 the higher value of 0 0625 corresponds to a higher threshold for individual sea urchins to form an aggregation sea urchins are more tightly clustered than for the value of 0 05 the lower value of 0 04 corresponds to a lower threshold for individual sea urchins to form an aggregation sea urchins are more loosely clustered than for the value of 0 05 3 results mean sea urchin ejection event count frequencies within the mp for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish are present was 0 886 0 036 ejections m 2 day 1 mean sd fig 8 a sea urchin ejection event count frequencies were binned in intervals of 0 01 ejections m 2 day 1 the mean sea urchin ejection event count frequency included ejection events resulting from damselfish aggression and from ejection events caused when a sea urchin aggregation attempted to move to another cell in the mp that also contained a sea urchin aggregation the mean sea urchin ejection event count frequency not attributed to damselfish agonism was 0 1647 0 1164 ejections m 2 day 1 mean sd mean damselfish population density count frequencies for n1 250 test cases was 0 21 0 02 ind m 2 mean sd fig 8 b damselfish population density was binned in intervals of 0 01 ind m 2 bioerosion score frequencies for n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present was 2 0842 0 8398 g m 2 day 1 mean sd fig 8 c bioerosion score frequencies for n1 250 test cases where damselfish were not present was 1 526 0 847 g m 2 day 1 mean sd fig 8 d bioerosion scores were binned in intervals of 0 1 g m 2 day 1 a linear regression model was used to fit the relationship between damselfish density ind m 2 and sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present fig 9 a the linear regression model was defined by the equation y 0 09936 x 1 0411 where x represents damselfish density and y the response in sea urchin ejection events the model was statistically significant with p 0 00001596 and r2 0 07247 a linear regression model was used to fit the relationship between the natural logarithm of sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 and sea urchin aggregation frequency aggregations m 2 day 1 for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present fig 9 b sea urchin aggregation frequency is a measure of how often sea urchin aggregations occupy cells located within the mp the linear regression model is defined by the equation y 0 0303474 log x 1 0 0372109 where x represents the frequency of sea urchin ejection events and y the response in sea urchin aggregation frequency the model is statistically significant with p 0 00000002048 and r2 0 1193 a poisson regression model with the dispersion parameter ratio of variance to mean allowed to vary was used to fit the relationship between bioerosion scores g m 2 day 1 that quantify bioerosion within the mp and frequency of sea urchin aggregations within the mp aggreg m 2 day 1 for the n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present fig 9 c the poisson regression model was defined by the equation y e 41 2683 x 0 6598 where y is the predicted bioerosion score g m 2 day 1 for test category 1 damselfish present and x is the sea urchin aggregation frequency within the mp ind m 2 day 1 with dispersion parameter of 0 285355 and residual deviance of 63 786 with 248 degrees of freedom dof the deviance goodness of fit test was used to determine how closely our model fits the observed data we obtained p 0 999995 which indicates we cannot reject the proposed poisson regression model finally we tested whether the influence of the damselfish sea urchin interaction was indeed significant we computed δ the difference of the mean of the distribution of bioerosion scores b 1 for n1 250 test cases where damselfish were present and the mean of the distribution of bioerosion scores b 0 for n0 250 test cases without the presence of damselfish and obtained δ 0 5596 g m 2 da y 1 the null hypothesis was defined as p p δ k δ 0 001 for k 1 n where p the probability that δ is the same size or smaller than a randomly selected δ k from δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n exceeds 0 1 using a significance level α 0 01 the null hypothesis states that δ can be explained as just another value found within the distribution δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n which are the differences in bioerosion scores obtained from the randomization procedure performed on b 0 and b 1 the alternative hypothesis was defined as p p δ k δ 0 001 for k 1 n it states that δ cannot be explained as just another value found within the distribution δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n δ is at least the same size or larger than 99 9 of the values in δ and therefore the bioerosion scores in the distribution b 1are statistically different than the bioerosion scores in the distribution b 0 we needed to choose a minimum number of randomizations n to perform to obtain a sufficient number of δ k so that the significance level α was close to the level that would be obtained considering all possible numbers of randomizations marriott 1979 quantified a methodology for determining the minimum number of randomizations given values for p and α for p 0 001 and α 0 01 n 5000 or more randomizations are sufficient to ensure that the significance level α is close to the level for all possible randomizations we performed a total of n 1000000 trials and produced a distribution δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n where each δ k is the difference of the means computed from each randomization trial performed on b 1 and b 0 fig 10 illustrates a histogram of the frequency counts of the difference in means of bioerosion scores obtained from the randomization trials δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n for k 1 1 000 000 with an arrow pointing to the estimated location of δ 0 5596 g m 2 da y 1 we found m a x 1 k 1000000 δ k 0 3982 g m 2 da y 1 we found no δ k that exceeded δ 0 5596 g m 2 day 1 fig 10 this difference reflects the indirect damselfish effect which results in greater bioerosion we concluded that sufficient evidence existed that the distribution of bioerosion scores with damselfish present b 1 showed a mean bioerosive effect that was signficantly greater than the distribution of bioerosion scores with damselfish absent b 0 the difference in bioerosive effect δ results in an additional annual caco3 consumption of 4 085 kg inside the mp 0 204 kg m 2 yr 1 3 1 model verification the model was verified to ensure that it provides an accurate representation of the uva reef environment following the 1982 1983 el niño event in particular verification analysis was performed to determine if the abundance distributions of damselfish and sea urchins and the bioerosion levels of dead coral framework attributed to sea urchins obtained from our simulation test runs were consistent with field observations the damselfish population density distribution statistics of 0 21 0 02 ind m 2 mean sd found for n1 250 test cases were significantly different from field surveys performed in the gulf of panama wellington and victor 1985 where pocillopora patches of high topographic complexity demonstrated a mean damselfish density of 0 32 0 13 ind m 2 mean sd two sample t test t 26 556 df 999 p 0

mean sd obtained from simulation testing results were significantly different from the sea urchin population surveys performed at uva reef by eakin 2001 following the 1982 1983 el niño event of 40 6 7

difference of 1 59 ind m 2 the bioerosion score obtained from simulation testing for the reef slope zone not including the mp of 4 148 0 156 g m 2 day 1 mean sd was significantly different from the mean sea urchin bioerosion measured at the reef slope on uva reef eakin 1996 of 2 84 g m 2 day 1 t 41 503 df 999 p 0 0000000000000022 mean difference of 1 318 g m 2 day 1 3 2 parameter sensitivity we conducted testing to determine the sensitivity of the bioerosion response to the parameters of individual daily bioerosion per individual sea urchin and the aggregation affinity threshold parameter table 5 we compared the bioerosion response distributions for each of the five test cases fig 11 the coefficients of variation for the bioerosion response for the high cvhigh 0 3696 and low cvlow 0 3570 daily carbonate erosion per individual sea urchin were similar to the baseline test scenario cvbaseline 0 4029 the bioerosion response was very sensitive to a 25 change in the aggregation affinity threshold parameter in either direction from the baseline value of 0 05 for the high aggregation affinity threshold there was a significant decline in the mean bioerosion response when compared to the bioerosion response for the baseline test cases kolmogorov smirnov test d 0 96 p 0 00000000000000022 a higher threshold for a group of sea urchins in close proximity to form into aggregations resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of aggregations that were formed within the mp correspondingly there was a significant increase in the bioerosion response for the low aggregation affinity threshold when compared to the bioerosion response for the baseline test cases kolmogorov smirnov test d 0 6988 p 0 0000000000000002 a lower threshold for a group of sea urchins in close proximity to form into aggregations resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of aggregations that were formed within the mp 4 discussion our modeling study confirms a strong interaction between damselfish and sea urchins and that damselfish agonistic behavior towards invading echinoids contributes to a complex indirect effect on the overall caco3 budget of a coral reef the bioerosion score frequencies where damselfish were present was 2 0842 0 8398 g m 2 day 1 which are significantly different than the bioerosion score frequencies of 1 526 0 847 g m 2 day 1 where damselfish are not present two sample t test t 45 177 df 9999 p 0 0000000000000022 mean difference of 0 5502828 these results are consistent with δ 0 5596 the difference of the mean of the distribution of bioerosion scores obtained from n 1 000 000 randomization test trials the damselfish s acapulcoensis prevents entry of d mexicanum onto their algal lawns on pacific reefs in panamá during daylight hours contributing to the preservation of caco3 glynn 1988 within the territorial algal lawns of 0 15 kg m 2 yr 1 on the reef slope and 0 33 kg m 2 yr 1 at the reef base eakin 1996 our study further clarified this interaction and found that an increase in the number of sea urchin aggregations that are ejected back into the mp monitored plot by damselfish resulted in an exponential increase of the bioerosive effect caused by sea urchin aggregations we found that such aggregations could remain entrapped within coral patches in response to damselfish aggression two mechanisms appeared at work damselfish ejecting sea urchins back into the mp and their tendency to remain aggregated the ejection of sea urchin aggregations back into the mp increased their grazing time and erosive action inside the mp this may be explained by the spatial distribution of damselfish surrounding the mp the spatial and abundance distributions of sea urchins emerging from the interspecies dynamic with damselfish is shown in fig 7 the plots show from simulation data the emergence of sea urchin aggregations within the mp with some sea urchin aggregations containing very high abundances of sea urchins sea urchin aggregations that successfully invaded the mp and attempted to move out encountered larger more aggressive damselfish close to the mp which increased the likelihood of being ejected back to their originating cell within the mp the cohesiveness of the sea urchin aggregations seemingly offers an advantage of defense from predators and competitors echinoid individuals in aggregations respond in unison moving as a unit and with spine posturing directed toward potential threats this behavior has been reported in several species of diadema worldwide pearse and arch 1969 snyder and snyder 1970 the damselfish aggression against select members of the aggregation therefore affects the entire group explaining how an entire aggregation can become trapped in an area by fish at its borders the modeled mean damselfish population density of 0 21 0 02 ind m 2 mean se found for n1 250 test cases conforms with field surveys in the gulf of panama wellington and victor 1985 0 32 0 13 s e individuals m 2 in pocillopora patches of high topographic complexity and our model suggests that damselfish density number of individuals m 2 fig 9 a and the frequency of sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 are related while the low r2 value of the linear model suggests that damselfish population density explains little of the variance in sea urchin ejection events the statistical significance of the linear model indicates a positive trend with increasing damselfish density resulting in an increase in the mean number of sea urchin ejection events the poisson regression model used to fit the relationship between bioerosion scores g m 2 cell 1 day 1 and sea urchin ejection events ejections m 2 day 1 fig 9 c suggests a positive correlation increase in sea urchin ejection events resulted in an exponential increase in the bioerosive effect caused by sea urchin aggregations being ejected back into the mp the exponential response may be attributed to the cumulative effect of the increasing number of sea urchins contained within large aggregations 200 individuals that are ejected back into the mp an intricate ecological mechanism fig 12 links the spatial distribution of damselfish the movement of sea urchin aggregations and bioerosion 1 higher damselfish density predicts an increase in the frequency of sea urchin aggregations that are ejected back into the mp sea urchin aggregations that attempt to leave the mp encounter larger more aggressive damselfish around the periphery of the mp this is because the mp represents preferred habitat for damselfish due to its high topographic complexity eakin 2001 wellington and victor 1985 with the size mediated spatial distribution of damselfish around preferred habitat itzkowitz 1978 larger more aggressive damselfish tend to occupy territories in proximity to the mp the increase in damselfish density individuals m 2 predicted an increase in the number of sea urchin aggregations ejected back into the mp when they attempt to leave fig 9 a 2 an increase in the frequency of sea urchin aggregations that are ejected back into the mp predicts an increase in the amount of time that they remain within the mp aggreg m 2 day 1 fig 9 b 3 an increase in the incidence of sea urchin aggregations inside the mp causes an increase in the carbonate erosion positive exponential correlation between an increase in sea urchin aggregation frequency inside the mp aggreg m 2 day 1 and amount of bioerosion attributed to sea urchin aggregations g m 2 day 1 fig 9 c 10 eakin 1996 developed a caco3 budget model for the uva reef that accounts for production by corals and coralline algae erosion by sea urchins infauna fish and other motile organisms and the retention of sediments eakin calculated bioerosion attributed to sea urchins for each reef zone by using destruction rates from bucket experiments the estimate of 4 148 0 156 g m 2 day 1 we obtained for bioerosion rates in the reef slope exclusive of bioerosion rates within the mp is significantly different than the 2 84 g m 2 day 1 eakin obtained the bucket experiments did not account for the additional bioerosive effect of sea urchin aggregations emerging from intra species dynamics between sea urchins we excluded the bioerosion estimates of the mp from our model verification analysis because of the additional bioerosion attributed to the indirect damselfish effect which eakin also did not consider in his caco3 budget model glynn and colgan 1992 found that sea urchin bioerosion underestimates the amount of reef framework destruction because sea urchins often undercut coral colonies that are then more susceptible to toppling and further breakage our study found an additional annual caco3 erosion of 4 085 kg inside the mp 0 204 kg m 2 yr 1 with post enso conditions of low coral cover and high sea urchin abundances this represents a 20 increase from the annual caco3 erosion attributed to sea urchins in the fore reef slope at uva reef estimated by eakin s 1996 caco3 budget model we found the mean frequency of occurrence of sea urchin aggregations within the mp when damselfish are present to be 0 0079716 aggreg m 2 day 1 compared to 0 005854 aggreg m 2 day 1within the mp when damselfish are not present sea urchin abundances collapsed between 1994 1998 resulting in the uva reef slope accretion changing from a net erosional state of 0 53 kg m 2 yr 1 to a net depositional state of 0 21 kg m 2 yr 1 eakin 2001 the additional bioerosive effect from sea urchin aggregations entrapped within the mp is more concentrated within specific locations in the coral framework due to the spatial co location of the sea urchin aggregations we posit that this additional bioerosive effect if it results in sea urchins eroding subsurface framework structures causing instability and collapse especially during periods of elevated turbulence must be considerable potentially resulting in the fracturing of large portions of coral framework blocks further study is required to quantify the relationship between subsurface bioerosion and framework stability sandin and mcnamara 2012 and eynaud et al 2016 developed spatially explicit models to explore benthic competition on coral reefs both models implemented herbivore grazing patterns on a spatial scale to explore how grazing of fleshy algae that competes with corals for space can promote reef recovery by providing a favorable environment for coral recruitment and reef accretion this is in contrast with our study where we explored the bioerosive effect of sea urchins on reefs with low coral cover and high numbers of sea urchins following an enso event that resulted in significant levels of coral bleaching and subsequent coral mortality in our abm individual sea urchin agents could interact with each other across time and space enabling the emergence of sea urchin aggregations when sufficiently high densities of sea urchins in close proximity collected within cells in the square lattice the emergence of aggregation behavior results in higher levels of bioerosion since the sea urchin aggregations exhibit more spatially constrained grazing patterns than collections of individual sea urchins two agent based modeling studies that incorporated coral bleaching and mortality disturbances on western pacific reefs demonstrated nil to only minor coral framework degradation compared to the major effects observed in our study in panama morrison and addison 2008 study in american samoa included enso induced coral bleaching and mortality disturbances that could potentially result in reef framework destruction and the subsequent loss of habitat for molluscan resources relatively steady shellfish exploitation over approximately 1500 years suggested continuous habitat availability and stability of marine resource use excluding climatic enso impacts a second study miñarro et al 2018 also considering warm phase enso coral bleaching disturbances showed declines in coral cover during enso events but rapid intra annual recovery following bleaching frequency cycles of 2 and 10 years with slow but positive coral recovery over periods of 20 years perhaps this western versus eastern pacific difference is due to the eastern pacific enso regime being one of the dominant and most consequential climate variations on earth yeh et al 2018 another contributing factor is the highly efficient bioeroding echinoid diadema mexicanum which occurs abundantly on eastern pacific reefs but not in the western pacific alvarado et al 2012 eakin 1996 glynn 1988 in another iconic eastern pacific coral reef area in the galapagos the damselfish sea urchin interaction has also been demonstrated glynn 1988 reefs in the southern and central islands were quickly lost to bioerosion by sea urchins after mortality in 1982 3 but the role of the indirect damselfish effect resulting in the formation of sea urchin aggregations has not yet been investigated glynn et al 2017 bioeroding sea urchins and damselfish occur together along the entire eastern pacific reef province alvarado et al 2017 and therefore the influence of the herein described interaction between the two species on overall rates of bioerosion is potentially significant region wide credit author statement peter j glynn conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

24876,the european seabass dicentrarchus labrax is a species of particular ecological and economic importance stock assessments have recently revealed the worrying state of the northern stock probably due to overfishing and a series of poor recruitments the extent to which these poor recruitments are due to environmental variability is difficult to assess as the processes driving the seabass life cycle are poorly known here we investigate how food availability and temperature may affect the growth and survival of wild seabass at the individual scale to this end we developed a bioenergetics model based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory we applied it to seabass population of the northeast atlantic region bay of biscay english channel area throughout their entire life cycle we calibrated the model using a combination of age related length and weight datasets two were from aquaculture experiments larvae and juveniles raised at 15 and 20 c and one from a wild population juveniles and adults collected during surveys or fish market sampling by calibrating the scaled functional response that rules the ingestion of food and using average temperature conditions experienced by wild seabass obtained from tagged individuals the model was able to reproduce the duration of the different stages the growth of the individuals the number of batches and their survival to starvation we also captured one of the major differences encountered in the life traits of the species farmed fish mature earlier than wild fish 3 to 4 years old vs 6 years old on average for females respectively probably due to better feeding conditions and higher temperature we explored the growth and survival of larvae and juveniles by exposing the individuals to varying temperatures and food levels including total starvation we show that early life stages of seabass have a strong capacity to deal with food deprivation the model estimated that first feeding larvae could survive 17 days at 15 c we also tested individual variability by adjusting the specific maximum assimilation rate and found that larvae and juveniles with higher assimilation capacity better survived low food levels at a higher temperature we discuss our results in the context of the recent years of poor recruitment faced by european seabass keywords dicentrarchus labrax northeast atlantic dynamic energy budget theory growth starvation early life stages 1 introduction european seabass dicentrarchus labrax is a species of high economic value in europe which production relies primarily on aquaculture 81 852 t in 2016 eumofa 2018 and fishing both commercial and recreational anglers target seabass and fishing pressure has rapidly increased from 2 000 t in the late 1970s to more than 9 000 t in 2006 before becoming stable around 6 000 t in 2013 ices 2012 since then the state of the northern stock one of the four stocks defined by ices i e irish sea celtic sea english channel and southern north sea has been worrying as highlighted by the rapid decline in spawning stock biomass and a series of poor recruitments probably due to continued excessive fishing pressure the resilience of fish populations is based on their ability to complete their life cycle and maintain abundance through recruitment peck et al 2014 the recruitment success is partly determined by the reproductive potential of the adults and by the survival rate of early life stages chambers trippel 2012 which strongly relies on environmental conditions according to houde hoyt 1987 eggs yolk sac larvae larvae and juveniles are the most vulnerable stages due to high rates of predation starvation and other dietary deficiencies or to deleterious oceanographic conditions that transport them to unsuitable environments however despite their ecological and economical importance the recruitment dynamics of the european seabass early life stages is still poorly known besides this species is reported to spawn in winter fritsch et al 2007 pawson et al 2007 when environmental conditions can be considered as suboptimal in terms of temperature and food availability which raises questions about eggs and larvae survival during the planktonic phase bioenergetics models are suitable tools to study the impact of environmental variability on the recruitment success of seabass early life stages they make it possible to study biological and physiological processes on an individual scale in relation to the environment by translating the specific environmental conditions experienced by the fish into individual performance growth survival and investment in reproduction to achieve this bioenergetics models quantify the energy fluxes between an organism and its environment in particular models using the dynamic energetic budget deb theory kooijman 2010 translate an individual s physiological functions into a reduced number of differential equations it allows the construction of a dynamic model related to the environment without having to conduct laboratory experiments to quantify input i e ingestion and assimilation and output i e excretion respiration and locomotion fluxes as in the scope for growth sfg models winberg 1956 and it relies only on existing length and weight at age data besides in this theory the rules of energy conservation are followed and the flux of energy to reproduction is explicitly described deb models are commonly used to study some of the fish physiological characteristics e g jusup et al 2011 and they are useful to investigate the impacts of environmental changes i e temperature and food availability on fish growth and reproduction e g pecquerie et al 2009 and pethybridge et al 2013 lika et al 2014 and stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 successfully parametrized deb models for seabass they used data from mediterranean farmed seabass and focussed on early life stages i e larvae and juveniles our primary aim in the present study was therefore to develop a deb model for wild european seabass using full life cycle data besides given the worrying state of the northern stock revealed by ices we chose to apply the model to the northeast atlantic and to focus on a region stretching from the bay of biscay to the english channel preliminary analyses revealed that fitting the model of stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 to our northeast atlantic dataset resulted in an overestimation of seabass growth particularly for the juveniles see supplementary material this along with the recognized genetic differences between mediterranean and atlantic populations tine et al 2014 argued for compiling new data and estimating new deb parameters for wild european seabass to reach our aim we calibrated an abj deb model using length and weight data from both farmed larvae and juveniles and wild juveniles and adults atlantic specimens we then evaluated the model s ability to reproduce very distinct life history traits displayed by farmed and wild individuals we applied the model to study two key processes the growth and survival of early life stages we evaluated the survival capacity of seabass larvae and juveniles to a range of temperatures and food levels we also introduced individual variability to study its impact on larval survival in limited food conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 the abj deb model applied to seabass the standard deb model kooijman 2010 chapter 2 quantifies the metabolic dynamics of an individual organism during its entire life cycle and describes the processes of growth maintenance and reproduction here we used an abj model marques et al 2018 which is a standard deb model with a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis two forcing variables drive the abj model temperature and food availability the conversion between food availability and ingestion is obtained using the holling type ii functional response 1 f x x k x where x is the food density and xk the half saturation constant f can take values between 0 food deprivation and 1 feeding ad libitum an individual is described by four state variables the reserve energy e j the structural volume v j the maturity eh j which is the cumulative energy invested to become more complex i e development of new organs installation of regulation systems kooijman 2010 chapter 2 and the reproduction buffer er j links between these variables are summarised in fig 1 the dynamics of the state variables are described by differential equations table 1 which were solved using the finite difference method with the euler numerical scheme an organism assimilates the food energy following the flux p a j d and added to the energy reserve molecules waiting to be used to fuel metabolic processes the stored energy is then mobilised flux p c j d for somatic maintenance and growth with the fraction κ while the rest 1 κ is used for maturity maintenance and maturation juveniles or reproduction adults maintenance always has priority over the other processes in other words if the costs of somatic and or maturity maintenance cannot be paid from reserve the individual dies of starvation table 1 summarises the equations of the standard deb model fluxes the standard deb model works for isomorphs i e organisms that do not change in shape we assume that this is the case during the period from egg to non feeding larval stages as well as from juvenile to adult stages this means that the shape coefficient δm that links the volumetric length l cm and the physical length lw cm by l δ m l w kooijman 2010 is constant for feeding larvae the change in shape is given by the shape correction function table 1 augustine et al 2011 with δmb and δmj corresponding to the shape coefficients for eggs non feeding larvae and juveniles adults respectively and lb and lj corresponding to the volumetric lengths at birth sensu deb i e mouth opening and metamorphosis respectively lb and lj are saved during the simulation and used in post treatment to calculate the shape correction function table 1 the metabolic acceleration table 1 accounts for the exponential growth increase of the larvae until metamorphosis it affects the maximum surface area specific assimilation rate p a m j cm 2 d 1 and the energy conductance v cm d 1 thereby the acceleration of growth relies on an increasing amount of intake and reserve mobilization during the larval stage the temperature affects all the fluxes as enzymatic processes are accelerated within a given temperature range according to kooijman 2010 we used the extended arrhenius relationship to quantify the temperature effect on all fluxes 2 k t k t 1 exp t a t 1 t a t 1 exp t al t 1 t al t l exp t ah t h t ah t 1 1 exp t al t t al t l exp t ah t h

thermal tolerance range respectively 10 c and 28 c in kelvin in the model and tal and tah the arrhenius temperatures for these boundaries the standard deb model operates over the entire life cycle and differentiates three life stages embryo juvenile and adult as each one of these deb stages may include different biological stages and because we aim to study the early life stages we considered five life stages the egg and non feeding larval stage does not feed or reproduce i e the embryo sensu deb feeding larva and juvenile stage feeds but does not reproduce i e juvenile sensu deb and the adult stage feeds and reproduces transitions between stages occur at specific thresholds of maturity eh an egg hatches at e h e h h a non feeding larva starts feeding at e h e h b the metamorphosis occurs at e h e h j and a juvenile becomes mature at e h e h p during the two first life stages an individual lives on its reserves p a 0 after the mouth opening the flux p a depends on food availability the energy in reserve e0 j for an egg was estimated at 2 8 j using the biochemical composition of seabass eggs from wild genitors acclimatized to captivity for 4 to 6 years devauchelle coves 1988 we acknowledge that genetic selection as well as experimental conditions may have modified the energy content of the eggs used in our experiments as compared to the value of devauchelle coves 1988 and that wild eggs may also have different energy content but with no means of estimating these differences we used the best available information moreover this value was included in the range proposed by riis vestergaard 2002 who developed a generalization to calculate the energy density of marine pelagic fish eggs by averaging the energy density as a function of the percentage of the oil globule compared to the total egg volume as specified in kooijman 2010 chapter 2 strategies to handle er are species specific and the management of this buffer can be adapted in each deb model hereafter we summarised the rules used in this model for adults the spawning season was set between january and may to cover all potential spawning over the entire study area from the bay of biscay to the english channel the energy of one batch is defined as 3 e b n b e 0 w w with nb the relative batch fecundity nb 104 eggs g of female stéphane lallement 2018 pers comm e0 the energy of an egg and ww the wet weight of the individual 4 w w d v l 3 e ρ e d v d v d r ρ r d v d v d with dv dvd ρe and ρr as defined in table 3 according to mayer et al 1990 seabass can produce between two and four batches per year for simplicity and because it does not change the seasonal bioenergetic the reproduction buffer was emptied once a year as soon as it contained enough energy during the spawning season then this energy was converted into a number of batches following the equation 5 n e r κ r n b e 0 w w with n the number of batches κr the fraction of reproduction energy fixed in eggs table 2 and er nb e 0 ww as defined previously in the case of prolonged starvation various levels of response can be considered kooijman 2010 chapter 4 here we chose to continue the standard reserve dynamics until death occurred the κ rule for allocation was kept unchanged no shrinkage occurred 2 2 calibration of a model adapted to the atlantic wild seabass population 2 2 1 data description length at age and weight at age datasets were used to calibrate the deb model data for wild seabass were available in the ifremer database bargeo this database contains all biological measurements and estimated biological parameters length weight age puberty sex etc of wild individuals collected for ifremer at fish markets by observers at sea or during scientific cruises catching adult cgfs and evhoe or juvenile nourdem seabass over the period 2000 2016 a total of more than 8 000 individuals 3 402 from the english channel and 4 948 from the bay of biscay aged between 6 months and 22 years were sampled and considered for this analysis in the database the age is provided in years for the model age was converted to a value corresponding to the number of days between the day of capture and the hypothesis that the individuals were born on february the 2nd length at age and weight at age data collected during aquaculture experiments carried out by ifremer pfom arn lab were added to the dataset two experiments on larvae and juveniles were considered howald et al 2019 the first with individuals between one week and four years old fed ad libitum at a temperature of 15 c then varying for juveniles but for sake of simplicity considered as constant around 15 c for the whole experiment and the second with individuals between 1 week and 8 months old raised at 20 c and fed ad libitum 2 2 2 parameters estimation a fundamental assumption when calibrating the abj deb model for wild seabass was that the model structure and parameters would be similar between wild and domestic strains although genetic selection in aquaculture may have changed the growth pattern of domestic strains our datasets could not account for such differences between strains differences can therefore only be explained by variations in the forcing variables temperature and food availability that are driving the model the calibration process was performed by fitting the growth patterns of three average individuals to two experimental howald et al 2019 and one wild datasets for the experimental datasets temperature and food availability were kept constant with the scaled functional response f equal to 1 i e larvae and juveniles fed ad libitum and a temperature of either 15 c or 20 c depending on the experiment for the wild dataset f was unknown and considered as a parameter to estimate at this stage we assumed that f does not evolve seasonally for seabass based on the observation that there was no significant weight evolution over the year in our dataset for the temperature we used data collected by wild tagged seabass and published by heerah et al 2017 and de pontual et al 2018 in these studies electronic tags recorded at high frequency approx every 90 s the temperature and depth experienced by 1220 european seabass along the atlantic french coast between 2010 and 2012 and 2014 and 2016 a maximum of two years of data were recorded due to battery capacity our aim with this data was to reconstruct a climatology as accurate as possible of the temperatures experienced by adult seabass in the wild for each day of the year we averaged the temperature experienced by all individuals with a temperature record fig 2 annual variations were not taken in consideration because the temperature data did not cover the temporal range of the length and weight at age data extracted from the ifremer database for parameter estimation we used the global estimation method cmaes covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies bäck schwefel 1993 with the fortran library pcmalib müller et al 2009 as detailed in gatti et al 2017 this method estimates the best set of parameters across the entire parameter space even in the case of a large number of parameters 15 in this

the value is linked to the mean the variables are length and weight whereas the stages are larvae both non feeding larvae and feeding larvae juveniles and adults the adult stage lasts much longer than the other stages fifteen years vs three months for larvae and six years for juveniles in our calibration with sizes and weights covering a broad range of values to better balance the fit with the

wild drogou 2018 pers comm while σ is a standard deviation calculated for length at puberty and set arbitrarily for the others lengths as we had no information on reproduction at different food levels we chose to use the general value for animals following marques et al 2018 and set the maturity maintenance rate coefficient that control the sink of reserve linked to maturity k j equal to 0 002 d 1 we were also missing information to calibrate the energy density for structure ρv and reserve ρe we calculated those parameters by following lika et al 2011 and set ρv ρe 23431 j g 1 we also set the specific density of the wet mass dv and dry mass dvd at 1 g cm 3 and 0 2 g cm 3 respectively we then optimized 15 parameters κ p a m v eg p m ta e h h e h b e h j e h p δmb δmj tal tah and f for the wild dataset the description of these parameters and their values after optimization are summarised in table 2 as well as the parameters we set in our model based on data from the literature for initializing the model we used the parameters from lika et al 2014 as the parameter tah modifies the correction factor even before reaching the upper critical temperature th we kept tah in the list of parameters to be estimated claireaux lagardère 1999 showed that above 20 c metabolic fluxes start to decrease we therefore considered that the dataset of larvae raised at 20 c contained information for estimating tah our estimated value appeared very similar to the value of stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 2 2 3 model validation seven checks were performed to validate our optimized parameter set in comparison to the literature first we checked whether the duration of the egg stage agreed with the literature devauchelle coves 1988 7 d 414 455 119 728 l n t with d the incubation duration in hours and t the temperature in degree celsius we then checked if birth sensu deb i e mouth opening at 19 c and 9 c occurred around 4 and 14 days post hatching respectively barnabé et al 1976 we also looked at the survival of larvae without food at 19 c and controlled that the number of batches was within the range of two to four batches per year as shown by in mayer et al 1990 finally we checked the age at first maturity in aquaculture at 15 c and in the wild and verified that the growth efficiency 8 κ g d vd ρ v e g was close to 0 8 marques et al 2018 and below 1 to ensure mass conservation for model validation we used an independent length at age and weight at age dataset for atlantic seabass larvae raised in aquaculture since egg fertilization with temperatures varying during the whole experiment fig 3 and individuals fed ad libitum f 1 allal et al unpublished ifremer marbec lab to validate the model hypothesis tests were made on the parameters of the regression between observed and predicted values for both length and weight 2 3 using the model to investigate the effects of varying temperatures and food levels on young seabass to evaluate the impact of food availability and temperature on the survival of seabass early life stages we carried out three numerical experiments experiment 1 focused on the ability of young seabass to survive starvation here we numerically analysed the ability to survive starvation as a function of i the timing of spawning and ii the state of the individual when food deprivation begins we considered 12 spawning dates one for each month of the year to test the impact of the environment i e mostly temperature on the survival of young seabass to starvation we also initiated the food deprivation at four different states mouth opening and 1 2 and 3 months after mouth opening to assess how this affects survival to food deprivation the temperature was similar to that used for the wild dataset calibration fig 2 and food was set similar to the f calibrated for the wild dataset table 2 until starvation begins f 0 experiment 2 numerically investigated whether the life history of larvae during their drift i e the planktonic phase would have an impact on their survival capacity to starvation once they have reached the nursery to this end we tested different scenarios of temperature 10 15 20 and 25 c and food level f 1 or f 0 2 before starting food deprivation at 1 2 cm i e the minimal size of larvae observed in english channel nurseries jennings pawson 1992 experiment 3 numerically investigated how the environmental conditions affect the growth of seabass larvae and their potential to reach a nursery larvae are considered to survive and recruit if after three to four months the average drift time according to reynolds et al 2003 they reach a minimum size of 1 2 cm jennings pawson 1992 we used the scenario of experiment 2 and the environmental conditions of our wild dataset i e the calibrated f and t of fig 2 and checked the size of the larvae after 110 days some level of individual variability was also introduced in this experiment to assess the properties of our model at an individual scale and evaluate the sensitivity of the model to variations of one deb parameter only technically we studied the impact of changing the specific maximum assimilation rate p a m on the growth of larvae we choose this parameter as the main source of individual variability following the body size scaling relationships defined by the deb theory kooijman 2010 chap 8 these body size scaling relationships stipulate that among species only the specific maximum assimilation rate and the different maturity levels covary with maximum length the other primary parameters being constant kooijman 2010 chap 8 pecquerie et al 2011 here we applied this reasoning to individuals of the same population based on the observed variability of maximum sizes within the population for each scenario we simulated 30 individuals with different values of p a m the 30 values were determined to obtain individuals with an asymptotic length l w eq 9 between 58 and 94 cm the target was a normal distribution centred around 80 cm the asymptotic length for our study area bertignac 1987 9 l w f l m δ mj f κ p a m s m p m δ mj with f κ p a m sm p m and δmj as detailed in table 2 3 results 3 1 model calibration the deb model fitted well our three length at age datasets as illustrated in fig 4 for all life stages for wild larvae the age in days was not available and our estimation assumed that they were all born in february this could partly explain why some individuals at the age of about 200 days are longer than others at the age of 500 days fig 4 another explanation could be inter annual growth variability the model underestimated the weight for all datasets and fig 5 shows that the absolute difference between the model and the data increases with time the relative difference appeared very variable with a mean difference of 67 for larvae and 10 for juveniles at 20 c and of 13 for larvae and 15 for juveniles at 15 c for the wild dataset the mean difference was 18 for juveniles 21 for adults 6 to 11 years old and 6 for the two other groups of adults we then run a regression between observed and predicted weight values for the first months of life 0 110 days as we focused on the first life stages our results demonstrate that the model reproduces the observations well at 15 c but slightly overestimates the weight at 20 c fig 6 the root mean squared errors rmse were 0 007 at 15 c and 0 08 at 20 c the relative differences for larvae about three to four months old at 15 and 20 c were 7 on day 127 and 9 on day 106 respectively this level of errors was judged acceptable we thus kept this parameterization for the rest of the study our model was able to produce some interesting results individuals from aquaculture experiments mature earlier than individuals from the wild table 4 this can be seen on the modelled weight curves fig 5 as the curves show sudden stalls when the reproduction occurs i e a batch of eggs is released 3 2 model validation our model was used to predict a large number of observable properties for which we found corresponding values in the literature these properties were not used during the calibration procedure and were used as validation data table 3 the number of days for the first stages was well reproduced as well as reproduction properties i e number of batches and age at first spawning in different conditions the survival time was slightly overestimated i e 11 days at 19 c vs 8 days in experimental conditions we also validated our model using an independent dataset of growth data length and weight at varying temperatures allal et al unpublished fig 7 the model predicted the growth values well with a relative error of 4 4 for length and 7 6 for weight the regression between observed and predicted values were y 0 90x 0 06 with r² 0 99 for length and y 1 05x 1 82 with r² 0 97 for weight the student s t test revealed that the intercept was not significantly different from 0 the new equations were y 0 90x for length and y 1 14x for weight and the regression validated 3 3 survival of larvae and early juveniles to starvation the ability of larvae and early juveniles to survive starvation was tested at different times of starvation onset i e different spawning months and ages cf experiment 1 and fig 8 our results demonstrate that the season at which starvation occurs is the main factor explaining the survival of the larvae with the longest survival times occurring when starvation happens in winter lowest temperatures besides when starvation starts straight at mouth opening individuals born during the first months of the year appear to survive starvation longer than those born in the middle or at the end of the year 19 34 days vs 13 22 days when food deprivation starts at one month old the same pattern is observed although slightly shifted towards autumn larvae appear to endure starvation better between october and april than during the rest of the year 22 33 days vs around 20 days on the other hand if starvation starts at three months old individuals born during summer and autumn appear more resistant to starvation than the others 16 25 days in july and 22 34 days in october vs 12 16 days in april we also observed that larvae or juveniles are more sensitive to starvation when food deprivation starts about two months after birth blue squares in fig 8 3 4 effect of temperature and food history on the survival of young seabass fig 9 shows the impact of temperature and food history on the survival of seabass larvae as tested during experiment 2 as implied by the deb theory we observed that the survival capacity of larvae decreases with temperature as well as the energy in reserve at the end of the experiment larvae fed at f 1 had 46 j on average whereas those fed at f 0 2 had 8 j on average our results also indicate that larvae fed ad libitum f 1 survive starvation longer than those fed at f 0 2 finally the difference in survival time between the two experiments decreased with temperature the individuals fed ad libitum at 10 c surviving 15 days longer than those fed at f 0 2 whereas at 25 c they survived only 2 more days 3 5 effect of temperature food history and individual variability on the growth of young seabass experiment 3 tested the impacts of temperature and food history on the growth of larvae and assessed variability at the individual scale as explained in the methods we consider that a larva successfully survived if it reached 1 2 cm in length the recruitment size within 110 days fig 10 illustrates the mean sizes reached by the 30 individuals with different p a m in the eight environmental conditions after 110 days at 10 c neither the individuals fed ad libitum nor those fed at f 0 2 survived until recruitment at 15 c the 30 individuals fed ad libitum survived while all the others died at 20 c the 30 individuals fed ad libitum all survived while only seven of those fed at f 0 2 those with an asymptotic length of more than 84 cm would have survived the planktonic larval phase fig 11 finally at 25 c all individuals survived in both populations in the conditions of the wild dataset the seven smaller individuals i e those with an asymptotic length of less than 73 cm did not survive fig 11 4 discussion the deb parameters for atlantic european seabass were estimated with a robust method based on an evolutionary algorithm the estimation was performed using three atlantic population datasets two from aquaculture experiments and one from the wild using this approach we estimated food availability i e the scaled functional response f 0 833 for the wild individuals of our study area bay of biscay english channel the model predicted a large number of properties which were in agreement with data from the literature notably farmed individuals appeared to grow faster and reach full maturity earlier than wild individuals mainly because they are fed ad libitum and raised at higher temperatures the model was then used to carry out three experiments that demonstrated i higher starvation survival rates when eggs are hatch in winter ii the importance of food throughout the planktonic phase and iii the need of food in spring in nurseries for this study we performed a new parametrization of the european seabass deb model and compared the parameters to the model of stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 table 2 the two calibrations showed differences in the fish lengths and ages at hatching birth metamorphosis and puberty table 4 the individuals of the stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 s model grow faster they reach puberty earlier even if their puberty length is longer i e 53 38 cm against 42 cm similarly we noted differences in lengths at metamorphosis a stage transition that is complicated to determine and which occurs earlier in individuals with an atlantic origin this observation is in agreement with darias et al 2008 who highlighted significant changes in the transcriptome of atlantic seabass larvae at 20 c between days 17 and 31 post hatching and which could correspond to metamorphosis overall our model improves the predictions of atlantic seabass growth in length however weight predictions can still be improved we used our model to study fish growth in relation to temperature and food availability generally individuals in aquaculture grow faster because they are well fed and raised at higher temperatures e g person le ruyet et al 2004 and they reach full puberty earlier e g pawson 2000 than wild populations our deb model was able to reproduce these characteristics figs 4 and 5 with an initial spawning at six years old for females which is close to previous observations in atlantic seabass populations kennedy fitzmaurice 1972 pawson pickett 1996 whereas according to puberty tests the initial spawning of farmed female seabass is around three to four years old e g forniés et al 2001 servili 2018 pers comm we then used the model to explore the effects of selected environmental factors i e food and temperature on egg and larval biological traits in the wild including growth and survival the aim was to provide some understanding of the poor recruitment events experienced by seabass in the northeast atlantic since 2010 ices 2018 the spawning season of seabass occurs in winter fritsch et al 2007 pawson et al 2007 which was put forward by warlen burke 1990 as an advantage for the migration of the larvae to nurseries indeed drifting larvae encounter fewer predators or competitors for food during winter and when they reach nursery estuaries in spring temperatures start rising which allows them to achieve faster growth however in winter in our study area the seawater temperature is colder and phytoplankton and zooplankton are less abundant than during spring and autumn when planktonic production is the highest pingree garcia soto 2014 this led us to use our deb model to assess the effect of temperature and food availability on the growth and survival of early life stages i e planktonic phase and in the nurseries during our first experiment which tested the ability of seabass larvae to survive food deprivation we observed that individuals born between january and april may coped better with total food deprivation than individuals born later fig 8 on the other hand if starvation starts when larvae reach their nurseries i e at about three to four months old individuals born at the beginning of the year appear less resistant to starvation fig 8 this means that if spawning takes place in winter the seabass larvae or young juveniles that reach nurseries in summer need food to survive with experiment 2 we investigated the impact of temperature and food history during the planktonic phase on starvation survival in the nurseries our results indicate that at low temperatures the food history of the larvae affects their capacity to survive starvation in nurseries fig 9 in the wild since the drift occurs in winter when food is scarce the availability of food at nurseries seems to be essential for the survival of the recruits according to our results these findings indicate that low food levels at nurseries could be one of the factors explaining the poor recruitments observed over the past few years besides according to martinho et al 2009 and vinagre et al 2009 factors that most influence the good recruitment of seabass in nurseries are high river runoff and heavy rainfall which probably support planktonic production through nutrients inputs with experiment 3 we investigated the impact of temperature and food history during the drift on the growth of seabass larvae again we observed that individuals raised at low temperatures require sufficiently good environmental conditions i e temperature and food during the first three to four months of their life to grow to size of at least 1 2 cm in length and reach nurseries alive these results indicate that between 10 and 15 c i e winter temperatures food availability is a key factor for seabass larvae to grow sufficiently and reach nurseries alive it is possible that the spawning period of the european seabass may be timed by a trade off between optimal temperatures and food availability during the drift introducing individual scale variability in experiment 3 did not significantly change the effect of environmental conditions fig 10 shows that at 10 15 and 25 c the variability inserted in the simulation did not change the model response and all individuals either survived or died on the other hand at 20 c the response varied depending on the individual assimilation rate fig 11 shows that at a very low food level only individuals with high assimilation capacity i e high p a m can survive a drift at 20 c in the context of climate change with rising temperatures and lower food level in the north atlantic bopp et al 2013 our results tend to suggest that individuals with a higher assimilation rate will be better able to recruit than others 5 conclusion for the first time a deb model was calibrated for northeast atlantic wild european seabass the use of aquaculture experiments and wild population datasets for calibration provided a robust estimation of the deb parameters our original approach reproduce known traits differences between wild seabass and farmed seabass with the latter growing faster and reaching full puberty earlier food availability is a model input which is difficult to assess in the wild however through our calibration procedure we were able to calculate an estimate showing that wild individuals are not fed ad libitum the model also provided evidence of the seabass tolerance to temperature and food level variations confirming the adaptation of this fish to winter spawning in the open ocean indeed in our model larvae were able to survive long term food deprivation we related it to their capacity to survive a drift of about three months with difficult environmental conditions i e low temperature and low food levels we also stress the need for abundant food in the nurseries for the survival of individuals and suggest that a lack of food could explain the low recruitment of the past years the future application of this model is to link it to a spatially explicit model at the individual scale to study the connectivity between different seabass functional areas and in particular between spawning areas and nurseries declaration of competing

24876,the european seabass dicentrarchus labrax is a species of particular ecological and economic importance stock assessments have recently revealed the worrying state of the northern stock probably due to overfishing and a series of poor recruitments the extent to which these poor recruitments are due to environmental variability is difficult to assess as the processes driving the seabass life cycle are poorly known here we investigate how food availability and temperature may affect the growth and survival of wild seabass at the individual scale to this end we developed a bioenergetics model based on the dynamic energy budget deb theory we applied it to seabass population of the northeast atlantic region bay of biscay english channel area throughout their entire life cycle we calibrated the model using a combination of age related length and weight datasets two were from aquaculture experiments larvae and juveniles raised at 15 and 20 c and one from a wild population juveniles and adults collected during surveys or fish market sampling by calibrating the scaled functional response that rules the ingestion of food and using average temperature conditions experienced by wild seabass obtained from tagged individuals the model was able to reproduce the duration of the different stages the growth of the individuals the number of batches and their survival to starvation we also captured one of the major differences encountered in the life traits of the species farmed fish mature earlier than wild fish 3 to 4 years old vs 6 years old on average for females respectively probably due to better feeding conditions and higher temperature we explored the growth and survival of larvae and juveniles by exposing the individuals to varying temperatures and food levels including total starvation we show that early life stages of seabass have a strong capacity to deal with food deprivation the model estimated that first feeding larvae could survive 17 days at 15 c we also tested individual variability by adjusting the specific maximum assimilation rate and found that larvae and juveniles with higher assimilation capacity better survived low food levels at a higher temperature we discuss our results in the context of the recent years of poor recruitment faced by european seabass keywords dicentrarchus labrax northeast atlantic dynamic energy budget theory growth starvation early life stages 1 introduction european seabass dicentrarchus labrax is a species of high economic value in europe which production relies primarily on aquaculture 81 852 t in 2016 eumofa 2018 and fishing both commercial and recreational anglers target seabass and fishing pressure has rapidly increased from 2 000 t in the late 1970s to more than 9 000 t in 2006 before becoming stable around 6 000 t in 2013 ices 2012 since then the state of the northern stock one of the four stocks defined by ices i e irish sea celtic sea english channel and southern north sea has been worrying as highlighted by the rapid decline in spawning stock biomass and a series of poor recruitments probably due to continued excessive fishing pressure the resilience of fish populations is based on their ability to complete their life cycle and maintain abundance through recruitment peck et al 2014 the recruitment success is partly determined by the reproductive potential of the adults and by the survival rate of early life stages chambers trippel 2012 which strongly relies on environmental conditions according to houde hoyt 1987 eggs yolk sac larvae larvae and juveniles are the most vulnerable stages due to high rates of predation starvation and other dietary deficiencies or to deleterious oceanographic conditions that transport them to unsuitable environments however despite their ecological and economical importance the recruitment dynamics of the european seabass early life stages is still poorly known besides this species is reported to spawn in winter fritsch et al 2007 pawson et al 2007 when environmental conditions can be considered as suboptimal in terms of temperature and food availability which raises questions about eggs and larvae survival during the planktonic phase bioenergetics models are suitable tools to study the impact of environmental variability on the recruitment success of seabass early life stages they make it possible to study biological and physiological processes on an individual scale in relation to the environment by translating the specific environmental conditions experienced by the fish into individual performance growth survival and investment in reproduction to achieve this bioenergetics models quantify the energy fluxes between an organism and its environment in particular models using the dynamic energetic budget deb theory kooijman 2010 translate an individual s physiological functions into a reduced number of differential equations it allows the construction of a dynamic model related to the environment without having to conduct laboratory experiments to quantify input i e ingestion and assimilation and output i e excretion respiration and locomotion fluxes as in the scope for growth sfg models winberg 1956 and it relies only on existing length and weight at age data besides in this theory the rules of energy conservation are followed and the flux of energy to reproduction is explicitly described deb models are commonly used to study some of the fish physiological characteristics e g jusup et al 2011 and they are useful to investigate the impacts of environmental changes i e temperature and food availability on fish growth and reproduction e g pecquerie et al 2009 and pethybridge et al 2013 lika et al 2014 and stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 successfully parametrized deb models for seabass they used data from mediterranean farmed seabass and focussed on early life stages i e larvae and juveniles our primary aim in the present study was therefore to develop a deb model for wild european seabass using full life cycle data besides given the worrying state of the northern stock revealed by ices we chose to apply the model to the northeast atlantic and to focus on a region stretching from the bay of biscay to the english channel preliminary analyses revealed that fitting the model of stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 to our northeast atlantic dataset resulted in an overestimation of seabass growth particularly for the juveniles see supplementary material this along with the recognized genetic differences between mediterranean and atlantic populations tine et al 2014 argued for compiling new data and estimating new deb parameters for wild european seabass to reach our aim we calibrated an abj deb model using length and weight data from both farmed larvae and juveniles and wild juveniles and adults atlantic specimens we then evaluated the model s ability to reproduce very distinct life history traits displayed by farmed and wild individuals we applied the model to study two key processes the growth and survival of early life stages we evaluated the survival capacity of seabass larvae and juveniles to a range of temperatures and food levels we also introduced individual variability to study its impact on larval survival in limited food conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 the abj deb model applied to seabass the standard deb model kooijman 2010 chapter 2 quantifies the metabolic dynamics of an individual organism during its entire life cycle and describes the processes of growth maintenance and reproduction here we used an abj model marques et al 2018 which is a standard deb model with a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis two forcing variables drive the abj model temperature and food availability the conversion between food availability and ingestion is obtained using the holling type ii functional response 1 f x x k x where x is the food density and xk the half saturation constant f can take values between 0 food deprivation and 1 feeding ad libitum an individual is described by four state variables the reserve energy e j the structural volume v j the maturity eh j which is the cumulative energy invested to become more complex i e development of new organs installation of regulation systems kooijman 2010 chapter 2 and the reproduction buffer er j links between these variables are summarised in fig 1 the dynamics of the state variables are described by differential equations table 1 which were solved using the finite difference method with the euler numerical scheme an organism assimilates the food energy following the flux p a j d and added to the energy reserve molecules waiting to be used to fuel metabolic processes the stored energy is then mobilised flux p c j d for somatic maintenance and growth with the fraction κ while the rest 1 κ is used for maturity maintenance and maturation juveniles or reproduction adults maintenance always has priority over the other processes in other words if the costs of somatic and or maturity maintenance cannot be paid from reserve the individual dies of starvation table 1 summarises the equations of the standard deb model fluxes the standard deb model works for isomorphs i e organisms that do not change in shape we assume that this is the case during the period from egg to non feeding larval stages as well as from juvenile to adult stages this means that the shape coefficient δm that links the volumetric length l cm and the physical length lw cm by l δ m l w kooijman 2010 is constant for feeding larvae the change in shape is given by the shape correction function table 1 augustine et al 2011 with δmb and δmj corresponding to the shape coefficients for eggs non feeding larvae and juveniles adults respectively and lb and lj corresponding to the volumetric lengths at birth sensu deb i e mouth opening and metamorphosis respectively lb and lj are saved during the simulation and used in post treatment to calculate the shape correction function table 1 the metabolic acceleration table 1 accounts for the exponential growth increase of the larvae until metamorphosis it affects the maximum surface area specific assimilation rate p a m j cm 2 d 1 and the energy conductance v cm d 1 thereby the acceleration of growth relies on an increasing amount of intake and reserve mobilization during the larval stage the temperature affects all the fluxes as enzymatic processes are accelerated within a given temperature range according to kooijman 2010 we used the extended arrhenius relationship to quantify the temperature effect on all fluxes 2 k t k t 1 exp t a t 1 t a t 1 exp t al t 1 t al t l exp t ah t h t ah t 1 1 exp t al t t al t l exp t ah t h

thermal tolerance range respectively 10 c and 28 c in kelvin in the model and tal and tah the arrhenius temperatures for these boundaries the standard deb model operates over the entire life cycle and differentiates three life stages embryo juvenile and adult as each one of these deb stages may include different biological stages and because we aim to study the early life stages we considered five life stages the egg and non feeding larval stage does not feed or reproduce i e the embryo sensu deb feeding larva and juvenile stage feeds but does not reproduce i e juvenile sensu deb and the adult stage feeds and reproduces transitions between stages occur at specific thresholds of maturity eh an egg hatches at e h e h h a non feeding larva starts feeding at e h e h b the metamorphosis occurs at e h e h j and a juvenile becomes mature at e h e h p during the two first life stages an individual lives on its reserves p a 0 after the mouth opening the flux p a depends on food availability the energy in reserve e0 j for an egg was estimated at 2 8 j using the biochemical composition of seabass eggs from wild genitors acclimatized to captivity for 4 to 6 years devauchelle coves 1988 we acknowledge that genetic selection as well as experimental conditions may have modified the energy content of the eggs used in our experiments as compared to the value of devauchelle coves 1988 and that wild eggs may also have different energy content but with no means of estimating these differences we used the best available information moreover this value was included in the range proposed by riis vestergaard 2002 who developed a generalization to calculate the energy density of marine pelagic fish eggs by averaging the energy density as a function of the percentage of the oil globule compared to the total egg volume as specified in kooijman 2010 chapter 2 strategies to handle er are species specific and the management of this buffer can be adapted in each deb model hereafter we summarised the rules used in this model for adults the spawning season was set between january and may to cover all potential spawning over the entire study area from the bay of biscay to the english channel the energy of one batch is defined as 3 e b n b e 0 w w with nb the relative batch fecundity nb 104 eggs g of female stéphane lallement 2018 pers comm e0 the energy of an egg and ww the wet weight of the individual 4 w w d v l 3 e ρ e d v d v d r ρ r d v d v d with dv dvd ρe and ρr as defined in table 3 according to mayer et al 1990 seabass can produce between two and four batches per year for simplicity and because it does not change the seasonal bioenergetic the reproduction buffer was emptied once a year as soon as it contained enough energy during the spawning season then this energy was converted into a number of batches following the equation 5 n e r κ r n b e 0 w w with n the number of batches κr the fraction of reproduction energy fixed in eggs table 2 and er nb e 0 ww as defined previously in the case of prolonged starvation various levels of response can be considered kooijman 2010 chapter 4 here we chose to continue the standard reserve dynamics until death occurred the κ rule for allocation was kept unchanged no shrinkage occurred 2 2 calibration of a model adapted to the atlantic wild seabass population 2 2 1 data description length at age and weight at age datasets were used to calibrate the deb model data for wild seabass were available in the ifremer database bargeo this database contains all biological measurements and estimated biological parameters length weight age puberty sex etc of wild individuals collected for ifremer at fish markets by observers at sea or during scientific cruises catching adult cgfs and evhoe or juvenile nourdem seabass over the period 2000 2016 a total of more than 8 000 individuals 3 402 from the english channel and 4 948 from the bay of biscay aged between 6 months and 22 years were sampled and considered for this analysis in the database the age is provided in years for the model age was converted to a value corresponding to the number of days between the day of capture and the hypothesis that the individuals were born on february the 2nd length at age and weight at age data collected during aquaculture experiments carried out by ifremer pfom arn lab were added to the dataset two experiments on larvae and juveniles were considered howald et al 2019 the first with individuals between one week and four years old fed ad libitum at a temperature of 15 c then varying for juveniles but for sake of simplicity considered as constant around 15 c for the whole experiment and the second with individuals between 1 week and 8 months old raised at 20 c and fed ad libitum 2 2 2 parameters estimation a fundamental assumption when calibrating the abj deb model for wild seabass was that the model structure and parameters would be similar between wild and domestic strains although genetic selection in aquaculture may have changed the growth pattern of domestic strains our datasets could not account for such differences between strains differences can therefore only be explained by variations in the forcing variables temperature and food availability that are driving the model the calibration process was performed by fitting the growth patterns of three average individuals to two experimental howald et al 2019 and one wild datasets for the experimental datasets temperature and food availability were kept constant with the scaled functional response f equal to 1 i e larvae and juveniles fed ad libitum and a temperature of either 15 c or 20 c depending on the experiment for the wild dataset f was unknown and considered as a parameter to estimate at this stage we assumed that f does not evolve seasonally for seabass based on the observation that there was no significant weight evolution over the year in our dataset for the temperature we used data collected by wild tagged seabass and published by heerah et al 2017 and de pontual et al 2018 in these studies electronic tags recorded at high frequency approx every 90 s the temperature and depth experienced by 1220 european seabass along the atlantic french coast between 2010 and 2012 and 2014 and 2016 a maximum of two years of data were recorded due to battery capacity our aim with this data was to reconstruct a climatology as accurate as possible of the temperatures experienced by adult seabass in the wild for each day of the year we averaged the temperature experienced by all individuals with a temperature record fig 2 annual variations were not taken in consideration because the temperature data did not cover the temporal range of the length and weight at age data extracted from the ifremer database for parameter estimation we used the global estimation method cmaes covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategies bäck schwefel 1993 with the fortran library pcmalib müller et al 2009 as detailed in gatti et al 2017 this method estimates the best set of parameters across the entire parameter space even in the case of a large number of parameters 15 in this

the other stages fifteen years vs three months for larvae and six years for juveniles in our calibration with sizes and weights covering a broad range of values to better balance the fit with the

wild drogou 2018 pers comm while σ is a standard deviation calculated for length at puberty and set arbitrarily for the others lengths as we had no information on reproduction at different food levels we chose to use the general value for animals following marques et al 2018 and set the maturity maintenance rate coefficient that control the sink of reserve linked to maturity k j equal to 0 002 d 1 we were also missing information to calibrate the energy density for structure ρv and reserve ρe we calculated those parameters by following lika et al 2011 and set ρv ρe 23431 j g 1 we also set the specific density of the wet mass dv and dry mass dvd at 1 g cm 3 and 0 2 g cm 3 respectively we then optimized 15 parameters κ p a m v eg p m ta e h h e h b e h j e h p δmb δmj tal tah and f for the wild dataset the description of these parameters and their values after optimization are summarised in table 2 as well as the parameters we set in our model based on data from the literature for initializing the model we used the parameters from lika et al 2014 as the parameter tah modifies the correction factor even before reaching the upper critical temperature th we kept tah in the list of parameters to be estimated claireaux lagardère 1999 showed that above 20 c metabolic fluxes start to decrease we therefore considered that the dataset of larvae raised at 20 c contained information for estimating tah our estimated value appeared very similar to the value of stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 2 2 3 model validation seven checks were performed to validate our optimized parameter set in comparison to the literature first we checked whether the duration of the egg stage agreed with the literature devauchelle coves 1988 7 d 414 455 119 728 l n t with d the incubation duration in hours and t the temperature in degree celsius we then checked if birth sensu deb i e mouth opening at 19 c and 9 c occurred around 4 and 14 days post hatching respectively barnabé et al 1976 we also looked at the survival of larvae without food at 19 c and controlled that the number of batches was within the range of two to four batches per year as shown by in mayer et al 1990 finally we checked the age at first maturity in aquaculture at 15 c and in the wild and verified that the growth efficiency 8 κ g d vd ρ v e g was close to 0 8 marques et al 2018 and below 1 to ensure mass conservation for model validation we used an independent length at age and weight at age dataset for atlantic seabass larvae raised in aquaculture since egg fertilization with temperatures varying during the whole experiment fig 3 and individuals fed ad libitum f 1 allal et al unpublished ifremer marbec lab to validate the model hypothesis tests were made on the parameters of the regression between observed and predicted values for both length and weight 2 3 using the model to investigate the effects of varying temperatures and food levels on young seabass to evaluate the impact of food availability and temperature on the survival of seabass early life stages we carried out three numerical experiments experiment 1 focused on the ability of young seabass to survive starvation here we numerically analysed the ability to survive starvation as a function of i the timing of spawning and ii the state of the individual when food deprivation begins we considered 12 spawning dates one for each month of the year to test the impact of the environment i e mostly temperature on the survival of young seabass to starvation we also initiated the food deprivation at four different states mouth opening and 1 2 and 3 months after mouth opening to assess how this affects survival to food deprivation the temperature was similar to that used for the wild dataset calibration fig 2 and food was set similar to the f calibrated for the wild dataset table 2 until starvation begins f 0 experiment 2 numerically investigated whether the life history of larvae during their drift i e the planktonic phase would have an impact on their survival capacity to starvation once they have reached the nursery to this end we tested different scenarios of temperature 10 15 20 and 25 c and food level f 1 or f 0 2 before starting food deprivation at 1 2 cm i e the minimal size of larvae observed in english channel nurseries jennings pawson 1992 experiment 3 numerically investigated how the environmental conditions affect the growth of seabass larvae and their potential to reach a nursery larvae are considered to survive and recruit if after three to four months the average drift time according to reynolds et al 2003 they reach a minimum size of 1 2 cm jennings pawson 1992 we used the scenario of experiment 2 and the environmental conditions of our wild dataset i e the calibrated f and t of fig 2 and checked the size of the larvae after 110 days some level of individual variability was also introduced in this experiment to assess the properties of our model at an individual scale and evaluate the sensitivity of the model to variations of one deb parameter only technically we studied the impact of changing the specific maximum assimilation rate p a m on the growth of larvae we choose this parameter as the main source of individual variability following the body size scaling relationships defined by the deb theory kooijman 2010 chap 8 these body size scaling relationships stipulate that among species only the specific maximum assimilation rate and the different maturity levels covary with maximum length the other primary parameters being constant kooijman 2010 chap 8 pecquerie et al 2011 here we applied this reasoning to individuals of the same population based on the observed variability of maximum sizes within the population for each scenario we simulated 30 individuals with different values of p a m the 30 values were determined to obtain individuals with an asymptotic length l w eq 9 between 58 and 94 cm the target was a normal distribution centred around 80 cm the asymptotic length for our study area bertignac 1987 9 l w f l m δ mj f κ p a m s m p m δ mj with f κ p a m sm p m and δmj as detailed in table 2 3 results 3 1 model calibration the deb model fitted well our three length at age datasets as illustrated in fig 4 for all life stages for wild larvae the age in days was not available and our estimation assumed that they were all born in february this could partly explain why some individuals at the age of about 200 days are longer than others at the age of 500 days fig 4 another explanation could be inter annual growth variability the model underestimated the weight for all datasets and fig 5 shows that the absolute difference between the model and the data increases with time the relative difference appeared very variable with a mean difference of 67 for larvae and 10 for juveniles at 20 c and of 13 for larvae and 15 for juveniles at 15 c for the wild dataset the mean difference was 18 for juveniles 21 for adults 6 to 11 years old and 6 for the two other groups of adults we then run a regression between observed and predicted weight values for the first months of life 0 110 days as we focused on the first life stages our results demonstrate that the model reproduces the observations well at 15 c but slightly overestimates the weight at 20 c fig 6 the root mean squared errors rmse were 0 007 at 15 c and 0 08 at 20 c the relative differences for larvae about three to four months old at 15 and 20 c were 7 on day 127 and 9 on day 106 respectively this level of errors was judged acceptable we thus kept this parameterization for the rest of the study our model was able to produce some interesting results individuals from aquaculture experiments mature earlier than individuals from the wild table 4 this can be seen on the modelled weight curves fig 5 as the curves show sudden stalls when the reproduction occurs i e a batch of eggs is released 3 2 model validation our model was used to predict a large number of observable properties for which we found corresponding values in the literature these properties were not used during the calibration procedure and were used as validation data table 3 the number of days for the first stages was well reproduced as well as reproduction properties i e number of batches and age at first spawning in different conditions the survival time was slightly overestimated i e 11 days at 19 c vs 8 days in experimental conditions we also validated our model using an independent dataset of growth data length and weight at varying temperatures allal et al unpublished fig 7 the model predicted the growth values well with a relative error of 4 4 for length and 7 6 for weight the regression between observed and predicted values were y 0 90x 0 06 with r² 0 99 for length and y 1 05x 1 82 with r² 0 97 for weight the student s t test revealed that the intercept was not significantly different from 0 the new equations were y 0 90x for length and y 1 14x for weight and the regression validated 3 3 survival of larvae and early juveniles to starvation the ability of larvae and early juveniles to survive starvation was tested at different times of starvation onset i e different spawning months and ages cf experiment 1 and fig 8 our results demonstrate that the season at which starvation occurs is the main factor explaining the survival of the larvae with the longest survival times occurring when starvation happens in winter lowest temperatures besides when starvation starts straight at mouth opening individuals born during the first months of the year appear to survive starvation longer than those born in the middle or at the end of the year 19 34 days vs 13 22 days when food deprivation starts at one month old the same pattern is observed although slightly shifted towards autumn larvae appear to endure starvation better between october and april than during the rest of the year 22 33 days vs around 20 days on the other hand if starvation starts at three months old individuals born during summer and autumn appear more resistant to starvation than the others 16 25 days in july and 22 34 days in october vs 12 16 days in april we also observed that larvae or juveniles are more sensitive to starvation when food deprivation starts about two months after birth blue squares in fig 8 3 4 effect of temperature and food history on the survival of young seabass fig 9 shows the impact of temperature and food history on the survival of seabass larvae as tested during experiment 2 as implied by the deb theory we observed that the survival capacity of larvae decreases with temperature as well as the energy in reserve at the end of the experiment larvae fed at f 1 had 46 j on average whereas those fed at f 0 2 had 8 j on average our results also indicate that larvae fed ad libitum f 1 survive starvation longer than those fed at f 0 2 finally the difference in survival time between the two experiments decreased with temperature the individuals fed ad libitum at 10 c surviving 15 days longer than those fed at f 0 2 whereas at 25 c they survived only 2 more days 3 5 effect of temperature food history and individual variability on the growth of young seabass experiment 3 tested the impacts of temperature and food history on the growth of larvae and assessed variability at the individual scale as explained in the methods we consider that a larva successfully survived if it reached 1 2 cm in length the recruitment size within 110 days fig 10 illustrates the mean sizes reached by the 30 individuals with different p a m in the eight environmental conditions after 110 days at 10 c neither the individuals fed ad libitum nor those fed at f 0 2 survived until recruitment at 15 c the 30 individuals fed ad libitum survived while all the others died at 20 c the 30 individuals fed ad libitum all survived while only seven of those fed at f 0 2 those with an asymptotic length of more than 84 cm would have survived the planktonic larval phase fig 11 finally at 25 c all individuals survived in both populations in the conditions of the wild dataset the seven smaller individuals i e those with an asymptotic length of less than 73 cm did not survive fig 11 4 discussion the deb parameters for atlantic european seabass were estimated with a robust method based on an evolutionary algorithm the estimation was performed using three atlantic population datasets two from aquaculture experiments and one from the wild using this approach we estimated food availability i e the scaled functional response f 0 833 for the wild individuals of our study area bay of biscay english channel the model predicted a large number of properties which were in agreement with data from the literature notably farmed individuals appeared to grow faster and reach full maturity earlier than wild individuals mainly because they are fed ad libitum and raised at higher temperatures the model was then used to carry out three experiments that demonstrated i higher starvation survival rates when eggs are hatch in winter ii the importance of food throughout the planktonic phase and iii the need of food in spring in nurseries for this study we performed a new parametrization of the european seabass deb model and compared the parameters to the model of stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 table 2 the two calibrations showed differences in the fish lengths and ages at hatching birth metamorphosis and puberty table 4 the individuals of the stavrakidis zachou et al 2018 s model grow faster they reach puberty earlier even if their puberty length is longer i e 53 38 cm against 42 cm similarly we noted differences in lengths at metamorphosis a stage transition that is complicated to determine and which occurs earlier in individuals with an atlantic origin this observation is in agreement with darias et al 2008 who highlighted significant changes in the transcriptome of atlantic seabass larvae at 20 c between days 17 and 31 post hatching and which could correspond to metamorphosis overall our model improves the predictions of atlantic seabass growth in length however weight predictions can still be improved we used our model to study fish growth in relation to temperature and food availability generally individuals in aquaculture grow faster because they are well fed and raised at higher temperatures e g person le ruyet et al 2004 and they reach full puberty earlier e g pawson 2000 than wild populations our deb model was able to reproduce these characteristics figs 4 and 5 with an initial spawning at six years old for females which is close to previous observations in atlantic seabass populations kennedy fitzmaurice 1972 pawson pickett 1996 whereas according to puberty tests the initial spawning of farmed female seabass is around three to four years old e g forniés et al 2001 servili 2018 pers comm we then used the model to explore the effects of selected environmental factors i e food and temperature on egg and larval biological traits in the wild including growth and survival the aim was to provide some understanding of the poor recruitment events experienced by seabass in the northeast atlantic since 2010 ices 2018 the spawning season of seabass occurs in winter fritsch et al 2007 pawson et al 2007 which was put forward by warlen burke 1990 as an advantage for the migration of the larvae to nurseries indeed drifting larvae encounter fewer predators or competitors for food during winter and when they reach nursery estuaries in spring temperatures start rising which allows them to achieve faster growth however in winter in our study area the seawater temperature is colder and phytoplankton and zooplankton are less abundant than during spring and autumn when planktonic production is the highest pingree garcia soto 2014 this led us to use our deb model to assess the effect of temperature and food availability on the growth and survival of early life stages i e planktonic phase and in the nurseries during our first experiment which tested the ability of seabass larvae to survive food deprivation we observed that individuals born between january and april may coped better with total food deprivation than individuals born later fig 8 on the other hand if starvation starts when larvae reach their nurseries i e at about three to four months old individuals born at the beginning of the year appear less resistant to starvation fig 8 this means that if spawning takes place in winter the seabass larvae or young juveniles that reach nurseries in summer need food to survive with experiment 2 we investigated the impact of temperature and food history during the planktonic phase on starvation survival in the nurseries our results indicate that at low temperatures the food history of the larvae affects their capacity to survive starvation in nurseries fig 9 in the wild since the drift occurs in winter when food is scarce the availability of food at nurseries seems to be essential for the survival of the recruits according to our results these findings indicate that low food levels at nurseries could be one of the factors explaining the poor recruitments observed over the past few years besides according to martinho et al 2009 and vinagre et al 2009 factors that most influence the good recruitment of seabass in nurseries are high river runoff and heavy rainfall which probably support planktonic production through nutrients inputs with experiment 3 we investigated the impact of temperature and food history during the drift on the growth of seabass larvae again we observed that individuals raised at low temperatures require sufficiently good environmental conditions i e temperature and food during the first three to four months of their life to grow to size of at least 1 2 cm in length and reach nurseries alive these results indicate that between 10 and 15 c i e winter temperatures food availability is a key factor for seabass larvae to grow sufficiently and reach nurseries alive it is possible that the spawning period of the european seabass may be timed by a trade off between optimal temperatures and food availability during the drift introducing individual scale variability in experiment 3 did not significantly change the effect of environmental conditions fig 10 shows that at 10 15 and 25 c the variability inserted in the simulation did not change the model response and all individuals either survived or died on the other hand at 20 c the response varied depending on the individual assimilation rate fig 11 shows that at a very low food level only individuals with high assimilation capacity i e high p a m can survive a drift at 20 c in the context of climate change with rising temperatures and lower food level in the north atlantic bopp et al 2013 our results tend to suggest that individuals with a higher assimilation rate will be better able to recruit than others 5 conclusion for the first time a deb model was calibrated for northeast atlantic wild european seabass the use of aquaculture experiments and wild population datasets for calibration provided a robust estimation of the deb parameters our original approach reproduce known traits differences between wild seabass and farmed seabass with the latter growing faster and reaching full puberty earlier food availability is a model input which is difficult to assess in the wild however through our calibration procedure we were able to calculate an estimate showing that wild individuals are not fed ad libitum the model also provided evidence of the seabass tolerance to temperature and food level variations confirming the adaptation of this fish to winter spawning in the open ocean indeed in our model larvae were able to survive long term food deprivation we related it to their capacity to survive a drift of about three months with difficult environmental conditions i e low temperature and low food levels we also stress the need for abundant food in the nurseries for the survival of individuals and suggest that a lack of food could explain the low recruitment of the past years the future application of this model is to link it to a spatially explicit model at the individual scale to study the connectivity between different seabass functional areas and in particular between spawning areas and nurseries declaration of competing

24877,the black lipped pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera is extensively farmed in french polynesia to produce black pearls for a sustainable management of marine resources studying interactions between organisms and environment and the associated factors and processes that will impact their life cycle and thus modulate population dynamics is a major research priority here we describe black lipped pearl oyster energy acquisition and use and its control by temperature and food concentration within the dynamic energy budget deb theory framework the model parametrization was based on literature data and a specific laboratory experiment model validation was carried out thanks to historical in situ datasets and a dedicated field survey three theoretical environmental scenarios were built to investigate the response of the pearl oyster to environmental variations we successfully modeled a wide range of life stage specific traits and processes especially the delayed acceleration of growth after settlement applying the model on field data collected at three different culture sites required only one free fitted parameter the half saturation coefficient xk which controls how ingestion depends on food density xk integrates all variations linked to the trophic environment analysis of the kinetics of energy fluxes under theoretical environmental scenarios suggests that temperature variations induce seasonality of reproduction in a species thought to spawn opportunistically throughout the whole year the major influence of food concentration fluctuations on growth rate and reproductive effort is highlighted the model showed the lower performances associated with recovery time between food rich and starvation periods the implications of these findings in the context of black pearl farming in a changing environment are discussed keywords bivalve physiology bioenergetics dynamic energy budget theory environmental change pearl farming 1 introduction in french polynesia pearl production is based on the culture of a single species the black lipped pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera andréfouët et al 2012 a suspension feeding bivalve living in the oligotrophic waters of atoll lagoons and coral reefs pearl oyster aquaculture takes place mostly in atoll lagoons and has a major economic and social function since it employs about 1500 workers in remote atolls and represents the second income of the territory behind tourism ispf 2016 supply of juvenile oysters to farmers is largely dependent on the natural collection of larvae on artificial substrates and spat collecting variability and effectiveness impact the pearl industry at the lagoon scale spatio temporal spat collection variability depends on the multiple factors that drive reproduction larval development and recruitment success tropical atolls lagoons are often described as stable and homogenous environments with high temperature and low biomass of the different planktonic communities and with small seasonal variations e g charpy et al 1997 dufour et al 1999 torréton and dufour 1996 behind this apparent stability french polynesian atoll lagoons experience spatial and temporal variations of temperature and food availability at both intra and inter lagoon scales according to seasons and geographical positions charpy et al 1997 lefebvre et al 2012 thomas et al 2010 previous studies fournier et al 2012b thomas et al 2012 suggested that these environmental variations impact oyster s life history traits such as the reproduction efficiency and pelagic larval duration which are two key life steps for spat collection success however in these remote exploited ecosystems the influence of these local environmental conditions on this oyster s life history and ultimately on black pearl farming sustainability has remained poorly studied so far besides the individual differences of metabolic process inherent to the oyster such as nutrition capacity growth or reproduction rates long ky and le moullac 2017 the growth and development of the pearl oyster depend on complex interactions between physiology environmental conditions and food availability e g chávez villalba et al 2013 doroudi et al 1999 pouvreau et al 2000b to quantify the consequences of environmental variability on p margaritifera physiology fournier 2011 and thomas et al 2011 built two distinct dynamic energy budget deb models for the adult and the larval stages respectively at that time the most suitable method for parameter estimation van der meer 2006 constrained the authors to partially calibrate their models based on crassostrea gigas parameters these models have shown their ability to realistically simulate various physiological processes and thus have laid a solid foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the factors underlying pearl oyster sensitivity to environmental fluctuations such as recruitment variations in space and time thomas et al 2016a however an integrative model for the full p margaritifera life cycle able to describe continuously growth reproduction larval development and recruitment potential was still missing as the sustainable management of marine resources relies on the estimation of the species current and future sizes fitness abundances and distributions a full life cycle model is critical to model future population dynamics and the influence of changes in environmental factors deb theory kooijman 2010 offers a framework that describes the metabolic organization underlying the physiological functions of an organism in a fluctuating environment based on a restricted number of assumptions written out as mathematical formulas this theory allows the description of growth development and reproduction throughout an organism s life cycle as a function of available food and temperature its application is challenging because the state variables and parameters are abstract quantities that are not directly observable recent developments allow estimating all parameters of a deb model using standard empirical datasets marques et al 2018 such calibrated deb models have already been useful to predict the effects of global change and better understand species geographical patterns environmental stressors effects bio production optimization and management of exploited resources e g desforges et al 2017 molnár et al 2011 muller et al 2019 here deb theory was applied to assess the pearl oyster s life cycle sensitivity to the spatial and temporal variations of temperature and food with a particular emphasis on growth reproduction and larval development the parameters were estimated using a wide range of datasets provided by the literature and supplemented by a specific laboratory experiment sangare et al 2019 the model was then validated using data specifically acquired for this study as well as independent historical in situ data from three contrasted environments finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate how life history traits can vary within a wide range of environmental conditions known to occur or that may potentially occur in french polynesian atoll lagoons the implications in the context of black pearl farming are discussed 2 material and methods an approach combining in situ monitoring laboratory experiment and modeling with observation calibration validation and application was used for our objectives we provide here a short overview of our method before developing it in the next sections a recent development specifically the amp project was used to fully calibrate the model marques et al 2018 a field survey took place in the lagoon of ahe tuamotu french polynesia where oyster s reproduction growth and environmental data were monitored simultaneously the collected data were used jointly with literature data to validate the model ability to describe oyster s life history traits in three contrasted environments across the french polynesian latitudes ahe takapoto and gambier then scenarios of food and temperature fluctuations were implemented to investigate the theoretical pearl oyster s response to environmental variations these steps are detailed below 2 1 study site the ahe atoll is located at 14 29 s 146 18 w 500 km northeast of tahiti island in the northern tuamotu archipelago fig 1 ahe lagoon is a 142 km2 semi enclosed atoll with a mean depth close to 42 m and a lagoon wide e flushing time of approximately 80 days dumas et al 2012 the only active deep pass is located in the north western part of the lagoon and several shallow reef flat spillways less than 50 cm depth are distributed along the reef rim mainly on the south facing side of the rim ahe is a pilot site for pearl farming research program since 15 years andréfouët et al 2012 as it hosts an important pearl farming activity the atoll already benefits from a 3d hydrodynamical model dumas et al 2012 which was extensively used for larval dispersal investigations thomas et al 2016a 2 2 field work adult growth reproduction and environment data in ahe atoll chlorophyll a chl a concentration as a proxy for food availability and temperature were monitored during a six months field survey february to august 2017 at 2 different sampling stations fig 1 assumed to be environmentally contrasted thomas et al 2012 all measuring devices were placed at a depth of 5 m directly on the rearing lines where the animals sampled were attached see below temperature was recorded every 4 hours by ibcode22l temperature

2017 smatch probes measurements accuracy was controlled by comparing with direct measurement of chl a every 6 weeks water samples 500 ml were taken and filtered on gf f whatman filters ca 0 7 µm pore size chl a was extracted from phytoplankton cells during 8 h in the dark in 6 ml of ethanol 70 concentration of chl a was then quantified by chl a fluorescence determined using a trilogy fluorimeter calibrated with chl a standard sigma and equipped with the appropriates optical filters welschmeyer 1994 three cohorts of oysters per sampling site were used to monitor growth and reproductive effort in the first two ones 2 groups of 30 oysters with initial average lengths equal to 9 5 1 cm mean standard deviation and 12 1 cm were monitored for growth measurement four measurements were performed at the beginning of each of the aforementioned sampling period the measurement of shell length hynd 1955 was carried out according to a conservative method of individual labeling for the third cohort a total of 1440 p margaritifera at the adult stage mean size 11 1 cm was divided on 48 batches of 30 individuals and 24 batches were placed at each station on rearing lines the measurement of the reproductive effort was weekly recorded at each station during 6 months every 7 days at each station from february to august 2017 the gonado digital index gdi was measured on 30 individuals gdi measurements were obtained by image analysis of the sagittal section of the gonado visceral mass image processing on adobe photoshop cs3 then analysis by imagej 1 51j8 a description of the present sampling schemes and methods are also detailed in fournier et al 2012b finally for comparison with deb model outputs the gdi which is a surface area ratio was converted to a gameto somatic index gamsi which is a mass ratio between reproduction buffer and flesh weight assuming no relative differences in weights between the components of the gonado visceral mass the following relationship was used to calculate gamsi from field data 1 gamsi gdi w w visc w w where w w v i s c is the wet weight of the visceral mass and ww the total flesh wet weight 2 3 model description to describe the growth development and reproduction of p margaritifera as a function of temperature and food conditions we developed a bioenergetic model which relies on the concepts of deb theory kooijman 2010 fig 2 and see appendix a for the general description and equations of the different fluxes the model revisits with new data and parameterization design marques et al 2018 the works of thomas et al 2011 and fournier 2011 who applied the standard deb model to p margaritifera at the larval and adult stage respectively our objective was to obtain a single set of parameters with some stage specific ones to represent the full life cycle of p margaritifera according to the deb models previously developed for bivalves bourlès et al 2009 in case of starvation the maintenance costs were prioritized over reproduction then growth if needed when the mobilized reserve does not cover all maintenances costs the reproduction buffer takes over note that no lysis of the structure was allowed in our model hence the individual dies if the reserve and the reproduction buffer cannot cover maintenance costs spawning is triggered according to an opportunistic strategy le moullac et al 2012 pouvreau et al 2000a 2000c regardless of the environmental conditions i e neither food nor temperature threshold are required for spawning when gamsi the ratio between the gonadic and total dry flesh mass see eq 7 below reaches a given threshold gamsithreshold a part of the reproduction buffer is released the parameter spawnratio defines this amount of stored energy which is released at each spawn according to fournier 2011 and our own unpublished data of gamsi and histological analysis for 40 individuals right after spawning triggered by thermal choc 80 of the spawners had a gamsi close to 0 15 while the other 20 totally emptied their stored gonad products the deb model presented here specifies the complete life cycle of p margaritifera it is of the asj type which takes into account the delayed acceleration of growth rate that is reported by sangare et al 2019 to occur right after settlement the model assumed isomorphy except between the settlement and juvenile stage where metabolism accelerates following the rules for v1 morphy kooijman 2014 until the oyster reaches the juvenile stage the consequence is that growth is not only accelerated by a larger intake but also by a larger mobilization from reserve in comparison to an isomorph under this assumption values of surface area specific assimilation rate pam and energy conductance v after the metamorphosis depend on the feeding history during the larval stage which may partly explain the natural variability in parameters between individuals of the same species kooijman et al 2011 this phase is called type m acceleration sm and we refer the reader to kooijman 2014 for a detailed description the egg energy content e 0 is fixed from calculations made by acosta salmón 2004 stage transitions occur at defined thresholds of the cumulated energy into maturation eh fig 3 an embryo becomes a larva at e h e h b settles and metamorphoses changes its shape at e h e h s reaches juvenile stage without change in morphology at e h e h j and matures into an adult at e h e h p metabolic acceleration occurs from settlement until juvenile stage in addition the model incorporates one shape coefficient for the adult δm and a different one for the larvae δm larv since larvae morphometry changes at settlement southgate and lucas 2011 finally the full model of the temperature correction was used with high and low boundaries of the optimal temperature range being specified and parameterized see appendix a b a simpler form with one parameter is often used in deb studies when solely temperature conditions within the optimal range are considered this is the case in the older version of the deb model for p margaritifera fournier 2011 and most bivalves studies with the exception of thomas et al 2011 throughout

estimation the amp procedure was applied with matlab r2017b to infer the deb model parameters marques et al 2018 this method uses experimental and field observations at different life stages and calibrates the parameters thanks to a nelder mead numerical optimization that minimizes the difference between observed and predicted values based on a weighted least squares criterion initial values of the parameters were set following thomas et al 2011 and fournier 2011 thirty datasets from the literature were used for model calibration ranging from length or age at different life stages to respiration rate at different conditions of food and temperature sangare et al 2019 the list of input data extracted from the literature is available at nathanael sangare 2019 amp pinctada

ingestion is the only parameter of the p margaritifera deb model that can be tuned freely for further applications in contrasting environments alunno bruscia et al 2011 fournier et al 2012a thomas et al 2011 this environment specific coefficient reflects the variability in oyster food and specifically the quantitative and qualitative effects of inorganic material and phytoplankton species on the feeding response of p margaritifera in this way the simulation of oyster growth in different pacific tropical ecosystems is possible with a single set of parameters with xk as the only free fitting parameter 2 6 model validation to assess the accuracy of the model simulations and its generalization to other french polynesian atoll lagoons modelled description of the pearl oyster life cycle was tested on four in situ datasets of growth and reproduction at different life stages and in contrasted environments table 1 these datasets were all independent from those used for model parametrization the data from lot 3 allowed to test the model ability to describe pearl oyster performances at different life stage and latitudes and longitudes far from the pilot site of ahe since gambier island is located by 23 s conversely tapakoto atoll is only 115 km away from ahe validation simulations were run in the conditions of food and temperature that were monitored simultaneously along with the respective biological dataset the parameter xk was readjusted for each atoll according to the description of the food conditions and or the age of the oysters several missing values of chl a

to account for the inter individual variability of the validation datasets 2 3 4 the deb model was applied using a multi individual based modeling strategy the initial individual conditions of the simulations were computed according to the real oyster s length and flesh weights measured individually on each sampled oyster at the first sampling point of each dataset individual simulations were performed and then pooled together to compute average patterns the agreement between field observations and model simulations was evaluated by linear regression between the samples mean value of observations x and the mean value of individual simulations y which was tested against the y x model at the alpha error threshold of 5 the r² coefficient of determination allowed us to evaluate how much of the variance was explained by the model 2 7 sensitivity analysis to environmental conditions the sensitivity of the pearl oyster life history traits to environmental conditions was assessed with three theoretical environmental scenarios taking into account a wide range of temperatures and food concentrations that occur in tropical atoll lagoons especially in french polynesia the effect of temperature on p margaritifera growth and reproduction was investigated within the range 23 to 34 c this range brackets the french polynesia typical seasonal variations ranging from 27 to 30 c in the northern tuamotu archipelago and 23 5 to 28 5 c in the gambier islands le moullac et al 2012 pouvreau et al 2000d and also includes temperature maxima observed during el niño events andréfouët et al 2018 the effects of food availability on p margaritifera growth and reproduction were investigated within the range 0 05 to 1 µgchl a l 1 in french polynesian atoll lagoon chl a concentrations range from 0 1 to 0 7 µgchl a l 1 with extreme values of 0 05 µgchl a l 1 in the open ocean and 1 2 µgchl a l 1 in mataiva atoll andréfouët et al 2001 delesalle and sournia 1992 independently of the atoll mean annual concentration important variations of the planktonic ecosystem may occur at different time scales and have been mostly related to grazing pressure delesalle et al 2001 fournier 2011 sakka et al 1999 thomas et al 2010 basic spectral analysis fast fourier transform function from matlab r2107b on food concentrations time series provided by the 4 validation datasets see above were performed for further representation of food variations thereby three theoretical scenarios were performed 1 the influence of temperature and food concentrations were assessed by comparing oysters life history traits in constant environmental conditions ranging from 0 05 to 1 µgchl a l 1 for food and 23 to 34 c for temperature 2 the effect of yearly seasonal temperature variations on life history traits was investigated using sinusoid functions period 365 days with a total amplitude ranging from 2 to 8 c and that oscillated around several values ranging from 22 to 35 c minimum and maximum temperatures occurred respectively in the middle of austral winter and summer here the food concentration was fixed and set at the average value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 based on observations by charpy et al 1997 from 16 tuamotu atoll lagoons 3 the influence of phytoplankton biomass variations was investigated by considering oscillations around the reference values of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 µgchl a l 1 at a mean temperature of 28 5 c charpy et al 1997 fournier 2011 thomas et al 2010 amplitude variations were set to vary from 0 1 to 1 µgchl a l 1 note that the minimum values were set to 0 01 µgchl a l 1 to keep realistic the dynamic equilibrium of the grazer phytoplankton system the phytoplankton biomass turnover rate was investigated by setting the oscillation periods from once a year to two days simulations were first performed with the values for xk calibrated in laboratory on larvae and adults feeding on cultivated micro algae isochrysis lutea and chaetoceros gracilis table 2 this assumption does not represent the real variability of food quality and or appetence of the oysters when considering total chl a measurements alunno bruscia et al 2011 thus simulations 1 and 2 were also performed with the values for xk adjusted during in situ model validation life history traits of interest were set according to the constraints inherent to spat collection and pearl production

corresponded to that calibrated for larvae experimentally 0 6 μgchl a l 1 table 2 for in situ rearing not supplied with cultured algae fig 4 b c and d the half saturation parameter was calibrated at 0 2 μgchl a l 1 to obtain a better fit between simulations and observations despite a slight underestimation of the growth rate after day 11 for the rearing in mesocosm fig 4 c the simulation fits were highly significant with r2 equal to 0 995 0 937 0 943 0 967 respectively for the simulations a b c and d with p values 0 0001 3 2 2 dataset 2 simulations compared with the validation dataset 2 are presented in fig 5 here the half saturation coefficients were adjusted at 0 7 mg pom l 1 for the age group 1 and 0 5 mg pom l 1 for age group 2 and 3 to obtain better fits this way r2 were equal to 0 864 and 0 884 respectively for the age group 1 and 2 with p values 0 0001 and simulations for age group 3 gave an r2 equal to 0 373 with a p value of 0 015 pouvreau et al 2000a suggested from their study respectively 1 2 and 4 spawning events for the age group 1 2 and 3 represented by blue arrows on the fig 5 these conclusions are not confirmed by the new simulations that suggested for each age group one spawning event per individual during the year of survey marked by drops in the thin lines on fig 5 individuals spawned continuously during several months fig 5 braces from august to january for the age groups 1 and 3 fig 5 a c and from mid september to mid january for the age group 2 fig 5 b in any case 80 or more of the spawning events occurred between mid september and mid december 3 2 3 dataset 3 simulations of shell length and dry flesh mass evolution in gambier islands are compared with the validation dataset 3 in fig 6 here the value of the half saturation coefficient xk was readjusted at 0 1 μgchl a l 1 to improve the fits the simulations usually remained in the range of the observed values except for the large underestimation of the flesh dry mass between february and may fig 6 a r2 0 561 p value 0 0277 and an overestimation of the shell length from june to august fig 6 b r2 0 904 p value 0 001 le moullac et al 2012 suggested 3 spawning events fig 6 blue arrows in december march and june here these conclusions are not confirmed by the simulations that suggested one spawn per individual occurring asynchronously throughout the year sharp decrease in the thin lines 3 2 4 dataset 4 environmental conditions from stations 1 3 fig 1 are shown fig 7 a b respectively time series of gameto somatic index variations are plotted on fig 7 c d no readjustment of xk from the value calibrated in laboratory xk 0 2 μgchl a l 1 were needed to obtain better fits a steady decrease of temperature from about 30 to 27 c was recorded during the period of observation february to august or the middle of the austral summer and winter respectively according to the observations food concentration and biological measurements did not show clearly defined seasonal variations peaks of chl a concentration happened occasionally during the year gametogenesis occurred when food availability allowed it and spawning took place asynchronously the whole year fig 7 no massive spawning event could be clearly identified during the field survey here the model did not accurately reproduce gamsi variations with r2 equals to 0 057 and 0 125 and p value equals to 0 1841 and 0 1679 respectively to the fig 7 c d however the mean value remained relevant within the general range of fluctuations and clusters of asynchronous spawns occurred when observed gamsi decreased fig 7 arrows note that a slight decrease of gamsi occurred at station 3 between mid april and mid may without associated spawning events according to the model simulations this decrease was due to a low food concentration which led the organisms to pay maintenance costs from the reproduction buffer individuals simulated at the station 1 were able to reproduce once or twice depending on the initial conditions of their gonads while individuals from station 3 spawned only once during the simulation the model accurately described shell growth at different ages and contrasted location within the lagoon of ahe fig 8 with r2 very close to 0 99 and p value 0 0001 since individual shell length values and dynamics were very close to each other only the mean values of the observed and simulated data are plotted for the sake of clarity 3 3 sensitivity analysis to environmental conditions generally the model predicted low oysters performances at low temperature and food and improved physiological performances with rising conditions until the temperature reached 34 5 c fig 9 appendix b after which degrading performances prevented oysters long term survival 3 3 1 simulation 1 sensitivity to mean environmental values simulation 1 assessed the influence of constant food and temperature levels set at their mean values half saturation coefficients were set to 0 2 and 0 6 µgchl a l 1 for adults and larvae respectively the temperature from 24 to 30 c and food availability from 0 1 to 0 9 µg chl a l 1 is represented by rectangles on the fig 9 to highlight the range of french polynesian atoll lagoon conditions delesalle and sournia 1992 within these ranges we predicted a possible theoretic pld from 10 to 70 days fig 9 a 2 to 14 spawning events a year for a 13 cm shell length oyster fig 9 b and a commercial size was reached at 12 to 40 months after egg fertilization fig 9 c according to the dataset 2 gambier islands experienced annually a mean food of 0 19 µgchl a l 1 a mean temperature of 25 5 c and a half saturation coefficient xk suitable for validation equal to 0 1 µgchl a l 1 in these conditions a 13 cm shell length oyster would be able to spawn six times a year and the fertilized eggs would reach a commercial size after 23 months not shown up north in ahe atoll the dataset 4 framed food and temperature at 0 21 µgchl a l 1 and 28 5 c respectively with a xk equal to 0 2 µgchl a l 1 thus a 13 cm shell length oyster could reproduce 5 times a year and fertilized eggs would reach a commercial size after 24 months similarly for the value of xk 0 2 µgchl a l 1 which was reported in situ for larvae in ahe dataset 1 pld would range between 10 to 20 days in the northern tuamotu archipelago not shown when respectively released in austral summer 30 c and winter 27 c no larvae datasets were available to assess xk in gambier island thus under the assumption that the half saturation coefficient does not differ between locations the pld in gambier would range from 17 to 27 days depending on whether spawning occurred in the summer 28 5 c or winter 23 5 c 3 3 2 simulation 2 sensitivity to seasonal temperature variations simulation 2 informs on how the seasonal temperature variations affect the growth and reproductive effort of oysters with simulations performed at constant food levels 0 2 µgchl a l 1 but at various mean temperatures and amplitude variations fig 10 seasonal changes occurred at a slow time scale that did not influence larval development which is more sensitive to the relative variations at the time of development see fig 9 a seasonal amplitudes affected oysters growth and reproduction differently depending on the average annual temperature for instance for a mean temperature value of 26 c no effect of the seasonal variations was reported on growth or reproduction but at 29 c the time to reach commercial size slowed to 5 months and reproduction effort was divided by 1 5 along the gradient of temperature amplitude fig 10 according to the actual range of temperature conditions occurring in french polynesia fig 10 rectangles oysters needed from 23 to 26 months to reach a commercial size fig 10 a and spawners of 13 cm shell length could reproduce 4 to 5 times a year fig 10 b a mean fluctuation of 2 to 3 c occur in the northern tuamotu archipelago where the mean annual temperature comes close to 28 5 c whereas a mean variation of 5 to 6 c for an average annual temperature of 25 5 c is recorded in the gambier islands then using xk values suitable see above for ahe atoll and gambier islands it appeared that oysters needed 23 months to reach a commercial size while spawners can reproduce 5 times a year in any case seasonal fluctuations of temperatures introduced seasonality of reproductive outputs for a mean annual temperature of 28 c and seasonal amplitude greater than 4 c three of the five spawning events reported by the simulations occurred when temperature is above 28 c on the other hand reproduction occurred at more regular intervals over the year when the temperature difference between austral summer and winter is below 4 c 3 3 3 simulation 3 sensitivity to phytoplankton biomass stability the preliminary spectral analysis of the environmental conditions of the validation datasets datasets 1 2 3 and 4 did not reveal any periodic signal in food variations not shown the absence of a regular time interval between food rich and starvation periods suggested that fluctuation can be approximated by random variation in the field here only results for oscillations that ranged from 0 1 to 1 µgchl a l 1 around the reference value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 are represented changing the reference food concentration had qualitatively no impact on the general pattern of the life history traits indeed the shape of the isoclines would just be redrawn around the horizontal line defined by the chosen reference value fig 11 dotted lines reference value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 the amplitude of food variations was related to the total amount of food available for oysters and a food variation lower than the reference value reflected stable food conditions over time below 0 2 µgchl a l 1 fig 11 dotted lines below this reference oysters energy management induced small growth variations fig 11 a and reproductive efforts fig 11 b within these limits the time required to reach commercial size varied from 23 to 26 months and the yearly number of spawns varied from 3 to 5 events conversely if the cycle amplitude was greater than the reference value for food variations of life history traits became mainly driven by the oscillation period oscillation period was related to alternating plentiful and starvation phases at high cycle amplitudes above 0 2 µgchl a l 1 fig 11 dotted lines when this oscillation period decreases i e from yearly to 2 days the duration of extreme condition periods ad libitum or starvation decreases thus depending on the duration of these extreme conditions the time required to reach commercial size varied from 29 to 24 months fig 11a andreproductive effort ranged from 4 to 0 spawning events fig 11b for the above food scenarios the total amount of food available on a given period of time is mostly driven by the duration of the oscillations rather than the amplitude of the oscillations consequently for a given amplitude the differences between life history traits is driven by recovery after starvation this had a major impact on reproduction for instance for an amplitude cycle of 0 6 µgchl a l 1 no reproduction is allowed for oscillation periods between 1 5 to 3 months fig 11 b conversely energy distribution lead oysters to slow growth at high oscillation period and vice versa fig 11 a no differences were reported on the pld for amplitude of variations under 0 2 µg chl a l 1 and or turnover rates faster than one month with a time of 20 days required to reach settlement not shown otherwise pld ranged from 20 to 70 days if the cycle of food variation started with a decrease and ranked from 10 to 20 in case of an increase 4 discussion 4 1 critical examination of the new deb model calibration the new deb calibration for p margaritifera leads to one single model with primary parameters applicable all along the life cycle compared to previous deb models applied to p margaritifera that described separately larvae and adult phases fournier 2011 thomas et al 2011 the new full life cycle calibration brings together a wide range of datasets ranging from simple age at birth to respiration curve at different food level and temperature by considering all life stages in a single model this new deb model for p margaritifera is more suitable for future ecotoxicological physiological or biophysical ecology investigation this is also a first step towards integrated population and ecosystem dynamic models compared to the larval and adult phase deb models fournier 2011 thomas et al 2011 we obtained different parameter values for the metabolic rates at the reference temperature of 20 c for instance the general specific cost of maintenance p m that was previously calibrated at 24 and 54 j cm 3 d 1 for the larvae and adults respectively dropped to a common value of 5 4 j cm 3 d 1 in this study this compound parameter is directly related to the allocation fraction to soma κ and the maximum surface specific assimilation rate pam thus the new calibration induces an increase of κ from 0 45 and 0 53 respectively for larvae and adult to 0 75 and a decrease of pam from 13 and 795 respectively for larvae and adult to 3 06 j cm 2 d 1 the newly calibrated values of κ and pam remain consistent with the general patterns identified for bivalves kooijman 2013 e g tridacna gigas a tropical bivalve had a κ of 0 83 and a pam of 5 11 j cm 2 d 1 at the reference temperature of 20 c moving from two separated models to one single model did not affect thus far the description of the different life stages growth curves were well captured with r2 0 9 previous fournier 2011 and new deb models respected the general patterns of observed mean flesh mass and reproductive effort model construction prioritized maintenance before growth and reproduction and no maintenance cost could be paid from structure therefore in poor conditions shell growth that is a proxy for structural growth stopped while flesh mass or reproduction buffer decreased which is in agreement with observed patterns chávez villalba et al 2013 linard et al 2011 in the model the differences between compartment reserve structure and reproduction buffer dynamics implied that the various life history traits were not reproduced with the same accuracy along the entire life cycle for instance shell growths were the best fitted measurements at any life stage and for any type of environments fig 4 fig 8 conversely flesh dry masses accuracy was more variable across time with achieved r2 depending on the age class ranging from 0 56 to 0 91 fig 5 fig 6 a this is consistent with the idea that weight fluctuates within individual of the same length and that inter individual variability increases with age pace et al 2006 regarding gameto somatic index gamsi evolution the model was less accurate fig 7 c d with low r2 and substantial dissimilarity between observed and simulated patterns the discrepancies translate some difficulties for the model to accurately capture gametogenesis variations and spawning events in a variable environment part of the variance might be due to the sampling mode which is lethal hence the measured cohorts were different at each time step while simulations referred to a single cohort only thus the initial conditions of each sampling point could differ in addition the sensitivity to this initial condition was likely more acute considering the chosen reproduction opportunistic strategy le moullac et al 2012 pouvreau et al 2000c this modeling strategy does not consider endogenous or exogenous factors assumed to favor the synchronicity of spawning southgate and lucas 2011 and it is thus difficult to reproduce accurately the sudden decrease of gamsi as observed in the field a non lethal sampling mode such as the high frequency non invasive hfni valvometry that can record spawning event from the valves activity bernard et al 2016 might improve model outputs and general understanding of spawning determinism conservative versus lethal sampling and simulation strategies cannot explain alone the general underestimation of flesh dry mass that was modeled in gambier for several months e g from february to may fig 6 a a more likely explanation could be a lack of accuracy regarding the description of the amount of energy available in the field by using total chlorophyll a as proxy for food this last hypothesis is reinforced by the need to keep the half saturation coefficient xk as a free fitting parameter as alunno bruscia et al 2011 has previously described for c gigas xk integrates all variations related to the trophic environment this includes food sources variations of food nutritive quality different selection of the filtered particles and variability in assimilation efficiency according to the particles actually ingested as such the presence of a food source that is poorly or not captured by the chlorophyll a might explain the disagreement between observations and simulations of weight picoche et al 2014 it is known for other bivalves sauriau and kang 2000 that filtration selection and ingestion capacities depend on life stage or on prey sizes overall high values correspond to poor trophic quality or low appetence for the available food from there the model suggests that cultivated micro algae are less appropriate to feed pearl oysters than in situ species validation dataset 1 and in situ phytoplankton is more palatable for growing oysters validation dataset 2 these results remain consistent with the fact that p margaritifera also feed in situ on achlorophyllous organisms following the work of fournier 2011 and picoche et al 2014 further work on pearl oyster trophic regime planktonic communities and their nutritional value would be warranted jointly with weight measurement 4 2 sensitivity analysis to environmental conditions the constant behavior of temperature and food availability conditions in simulation 1 did not correspond to a real environment however as mean annual temperature is function of the latitude and mean chl a concentration function of the lagoon water residence time andréfouët et al 2001 delesalle and sournia 1992 fixing in such a way the mean annual values created a partition between lagoons with different potentials and modes for oyster production lagoons from the northern tuamotu archipelago experience higher mean annual temperature than those experienced by the gambier islands and first appear to be more suitable for oysters growth fig 9 however due to different food qualities suggested by different values of xk and based on the standard mean annual value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 the performances are better in gambier than northern tuamotu thus far pld data are unavailable for gambier this prevents the appropriate adjustment of xk and the assessment of model predictions but for growth until commercial sizes are reached the simulations agreed with pouvreau and prasil 2001 observations with 24 and 25 months respectively in the gambier and northern tuamotu to reach 10 cm these results highlight the need to take into account food quality jointly with temperature to explain past pearl farming performances and in anticipation of environmental changes for planning future farming high seasonal temperature fluctuation had for general impact to decrease growth and reproductive effort modulo the mean annual value fig 10 from simulation 2 performances decreased jointly with rising seasonal variations but this sensitivity to seasonal fluctuation declined when the mean temperature dropped in french polynesia small seasonal variations are associated with high mean annual temperatures and vice versa according to energetic dynamics increasing temperatures accelerate energetic flux until an optimum thus high temperature variations introduce a seasonality in reproduction with increased spawning during the warm season the role of seasonal temperature variations and phytoplankton blooms on bivalve reproduction and synchronicity has been demonstrated for species in temperate environments e g philippart et al 2012 ruiz et al 1992 to assess the influence of the environment on the p margaritifera reproduction opportunistic strategy described by fournier et al 2012b it could be useful to sample gamsi along a gradient of atolls that experiment various temperature seasonal differences this way it would be also easier to further assess the influence of various endogenous or exogenous factors in spawning synchronicity simulation 3 suggested contrasted responses of the black lipped pearl oyster to phytoplankton biomass fluctuations energetic dynamics implies that oysters accessing similar amount of food cumulative but with different variations of concentrations across time will react differently in particular the duration of extreme condition periods implies different recovery needs after starvation and the consequences are expressed in the life history traits for instance gametogenesis duration has to be taken into consideration to explain the patchy results in simulation 3 above the reference food concentration the proximity between gametogenesis completion time and oscillation period prevented the reproduction buffer from filling up completely during the plenty period the oyster became unable to reproduce while in the same time the cumulative amount of food available in the environment is supposed to allow 5 spawns within a year fig 9 b in agreement with fournier et al 2012b and pouvreau et al 2000c who linked food concentration with reproductive effort and synchronicity simulation 3 confirms that food availability is the main driver of reproduction the results from the three theoretical scenarios highlight the importance of environmental variations rather than mean annual conditions to model and infer physiological traits food and temperature variations have significant impact on energy dynamics since temperature drives the speed of exchanges between compartments and food controls the amount of energy in circulation simulating a constant environment cannot reproduce the low physiological performances induced by environmental fluctuations such as the compensation during starvation periods by reserves or the differences of energetic flux kinetics following temperature variation practically the absence of a regular predictable time interval between plenty and starvation periods makes difficult to infer the best possible locations for pearl farming the range of conditions represented by the various simulations had no impact on larval development this is due to the time scale which are significantly different between pelagic larval duration and environmental changes in our simulations at small time scale pld ranging from 10 to 70 days the maximal theoretical values from our simulations are simulated depending on the season and or the trajectory up or down taken by the food availability variation simulations 1 3 the 70 day extreme pld has never been observed and will probably seldom occur in realistic environment with all mortality causes present disease predation significant variations of temperature and food concentration are reported at short space and time intervals within a given lagoon thomas et al 2010 thus mortality rate environmental heterogeneity and larval behavior partly explain the 15 to 35 days pld reported in the literature sangare et al 2019 thomas et al 2014 here the results indirectly confirm that a spatial environmental heterogeneity plays a significant role in recruitment by influencing growth rate and indirectly mortality and dispersion time high frequency monitoring of the environment in space and time emerge as a critical bottleneck for realistic modeling of larvae development and dispersal 4 3 perspectives according to this study most of the existing data on in situ growth and reproduction for p margaritifera agree with the results of the deb model when considering adequate food and temperature variations thus adequately considering future environmental conditions may provide insights in the future trends of p margaritifera life history traits expression in the next few decades changes in ocean currents and temperature are projected to alter the surface and productivity of ecological areas near the south pacific subtropical gyre leading to reduced phytoplankton biomass and average size in the ocean which may also impact lagoons bell et al 2013 adult p margaritifera feed preferentially on planktonic organism larger than 2 µm fournier et al 2012a loret et al 2000 and according to our model simulations such changes could affect pearl oyster reproduction and growth and eventually pearl farming yields it would be interesting in the future to monitor the environmental changes and track the trajectories followed by each lagoon ecosystem within our simulation space and infer possible problems obviously simulations remain coarse simplification of the real environment and various other factors might temperate the results this could include fast environmental variations as well as physiological or genetical adaptations few studies have looked at the role of genetics in shaping pearl oyster life traits and thus on the potential of adaptation to changing conditions joubert et al 2014 investigated the environmental control underlying the molecular mechanisms of shell growth and ky and le moullac 2017 highlighted the non negligible part of genetics on growth variability we suggest that further work on these aspects is warranted at the intra lagoon scale phytoplankton abundance is highly dependent on water exchange from the ocean through the atoll rim but the influence of pearl farming activity itself on plankton concentration should not be overlooked lefebvre et al 2012 pagano et al 2017 and hulot et al 2018 suggested significant depletion of planktonic organism concentration in aquaculture areas which can be induced by tidal flushing and by the grazing pressure of the filter feeder communities long periods of low phytoplankton biomass followed by intense sporadic blooms have been reported in french polynesian atolls lagoons sakka et al 1999 but lack of high frequency data on phytoplankton communities and biomass makes difficult to accurately characterize the magnitudes and periods of these events and the role of pearl farming itself on these mechanisms finally to scale up the limit of the black lipped pearl oyster response to the environment conditions a suggested approach would be i the integration of the deb model into an individual based model for the population level bacher and gangnery 2006 thomas et al 2016b sangare et al in prep ii coupling this population model with a biogeochemical and an environmental model able to provide food temperature and the conditions of larval transport such design would expand the work of thomas et al 2016a on p margaritifera who characterized larval growth and dispersal in a dynamic environment by coupling the deb model for larvae with a hydrodynamic model 5 conclusion by its ability to accurately describe a wide range of p margaritifera physiological traits in contrasted environment the calibrated full life cycle deb model provides new opportunities to address questions spanning from physiological limits and adaptations to pearl farming sustainability from the tested environmental scenarios the simulations shed light on the influence of variations of temperature food availability and quality on p margaritifera life history traits expression from both the environmental and physiological point of view more observations are required for a better assessment of reproduction potential adequately considering future environmental conditions and testing them within this new calibrated deb model may provide a powerful tool

24877,the black lipped pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera is extensively farmed in french polynesia to produce black pearls for a sustainable management of marine resources studying interactions between organisms and environment and the associated factors and processes that will impact their life cycle and thus modulate population dynamics is a major research priority here we describe black lipped pearl oyster energy acquisition and use and its control by temperature and food concentration within the dynamic energy budget deb theory framework the model parametrization was based on literature data and a specific laboratory experiment model validation was carried out thanks to historical in situ datasets and a dedicated field survey three theoretical environmental scenarios were built to investigate the response of the pearl oyster to environmental variations we successfully modeled a wide range of life stage specific traits and processes especially the delayed acceleration of growth after settlement applying the model on field data collected at three different culture sites required only one free fitted parameter the half saturation coefficient xk which controls how ingestion depends on food density xk integrates all variations linked to the trophic environment analysis of the kinetics of energy fluxes under theoretical environmental scenarios suggests that temperature variations induce seasonality of reproduction in a species thought to spawn opportunistically throughout the whole year the major influence of food concentration fluctuations on growth rate and reproductive effort is highlighted the model showed the lower performances associated with recovery time between food rich and starvation periods the implications of these findings in the context of black pearl farming in a changing environment are discussed keywords bivalve physiology bioenergetics dynamic energy budget theory environmental change pearl farming 1 introduction in french polynesia pearl production is based on the culture of a single species the black lipped pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera andréfouët et al 2012 a suspension feeding bivalve living in the oligotrophic waters of atoll lagoons and coral reefs pearl oyster aquaculture takes place mostly in atoll lagoons and has a major economic and social function since it employs about 1500 workers in remote atolls and represents the second income of the territory behind tourism ispf 2016 supply of juvenile oysters to farmers is largely dependent on the natural collection of larvae on artificial substrates and spat collecting variability and effectiveness impact the pearl industry at the lagoon scale spatio temporal spat collection variability depends on the multiple factors that drive reproduction larval development and recruitment success tropical atolls lagoons are often described as stable and homogenous environments with high temperature and low biomass of the different planktonic communities and with small seasonal variations e g charpy et al 1997 dufour et al 1999 torréton and dufour 1996 behind this apparent stability french polynesian atoll lagoons experience spatial and temporal variations of temperature and food availability at both intra and inter lagoon scales according to seasons and geographical positions charpy et al 1997 lefebvre et al 2012 thomas et al 2010 previous studies fournier et al 2012b thomas et al 2012 suggested that these environmental variations impact oyster s life history traits such as the reproduction efficiency and pelagic larval duration which are two key life steps for spat collection success however in these remote exploited ecosystems the influence of these local environmental conditions on this oyster s life history and ultimately on black pearl farming sustainability has remained poorly studied so far besides the individual differences of metabolic process inherent to the oyster such as nutrition capacity growth or reproduction rates long ky and le moullac 2017 the growth and development of the pearl oyster depend on complex interactions between physiology environmental conditions and food availability e g chávez villalba et al 2013 doroudi et al 1999 pouvreau et al 2000b to quantify the consequences of environmental variability on p margaritifera physiology fournier 2011 and thomas et al 2011 built two distinct dynamic energy budget deb models for the adult and the larval stages respectively at that time the most suitable method for parameter estimation van der meer 2006 constrained the authors to partially calibrate their models based on crassostrea gigas parameters these models have shown their ability to realistically simulate various physiological processes and thus have laid a solid foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the factors underlying pearl oyster sensitivity to environmental fluctuations such as recruitment variations in space and time thomas et al 2016a however an integrative model for the full p margaritifera life cycle able to describe continuously growth reproduction larval development and recruitment potential was still missing as the sustainable management of marine resources relies on the estimation of the species current and future sizes fitness abundances and distributions a full life cycle model is critical to model future population dynamics and the influence of changes in environmental factors deb theory kooijman 2010 offers a framework that describes the metabolic organization underlying the physiological functions of an organism in a fluctuating environment based on a restricted number of assumptions written out as mathematical formulas this theory allows the description of growth development and reproduction throughout an organism s life cycle as a function of available food and temperature its application is challenging because the state variables and parameters are abstract quantities that are not directly observable recent developments allow estimating all parameters of a deb model using standard empirical datasets marques et al 2018 such calibrated deb models have already been useful to predict the effects of global change and better understand species geographical patterns environmental stressors effects bio production optimization and management of exploited resources e g desforges et al 2017 molnár et al 2011 muller et al 2019 here deb theory was applied to assess the pearl oyster s life cycle sensitivity to the spatial and temporal variations of temperature and food with a particular emphasis on growth reproduction and larval development the parameters were estimated using a wide range of datasets provided by the literature and supplemented by a specific laboratory experiment sangare et al 2019 the model was then validated using data specifically acquired for this study as well as independent historical in situ data from three contrasted environments finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate how life history traits can vary within a wide range of environmental conditions known to occur or that may potentially occur in french polynesian atoll lagoons the implications in the context of black pearl farming are discussed 2 material and methods an approach combining in situ monitoring laboratory experiment and modeling with observation calibration validation and application was used for our objectives we provide here a short overview of our method before developing it in the next sections a recent development specifically the amp project was used to fully calibrate the model marques et al 2018 a field survey took place in the lagoon of ahe tuamotu french polynesia where oyster s reproduction growth and environmental data were monitored simultaneously the collected data were used jointly with literature data to validate the model ability to describe oyster s life history traits in three contrasted environments across the french polynesian latitudes ahe takapoto and gambier then scenarios of food and temperature fluctuations were implemented to investigate the theoretical pearl oyster s response to environmental variations these steps are detailed below 2 1 study site the ahe atoll is located at 14 29 s 146 18 w 500 km northeast of tahiti island in the northern tuamotu archipelago fig 1 ahe lagoon is a 142 km2 semi enclosed atoll with a mean depth close to 42 m and a lagoon wide e flushing time of approximately 80 days dumas et al 2012 the only active deep pass is located in the north western part of the lagoon and several shallow reef flat spillways less than 50 cm depth are distributed along the reef rim mainly on the south facing side of the rim ahe is a pilot site for pearl farming research program since 15 years andréfouët et al 2012 as it hosts an important pearl farming activity the atoll already benefits from a 3d hydrodynamical model dumas et al 2012 which was extensively used for larval dispersal investigations thomas et al 2016a 2 2 field work adult growth reproduction and environment data in ahe atoll chlorophyll a chl a concentration as a proxy for food

calibrated with chl a standard sigma and equipped with the appropriates optical filters welschmeyer 1994 three cohorts of oysters per sampling site were used to monitor growth and reproductive effort in the first two ones 2 groups of 30 oysters with initial average lengths equal to 9 5 1 cm mean standard deviation and 12 1 cm were monitored for growth measurement four measurements were performed at the beginning of each of the aforementioned sampling period the measurement of shell length hynd 1955 was carried out according to a conservative method of individual labeling for the third cohort a total of 1440 p margaritifera at the adult stage mean size 11 1 cm was divided on 48 batches of 30 individuals and 24 batches were placed at each station on rearing lines the measurement of the reproductive effort was weekly recorded at each station during 6 months every 7 days at each station from february to august 2017 the gonado digital index gdi was measured on 30 individuals gdi measurements were obtained by image analysis of the sagittal section of the gonado visceral mass image processing on adobe photoshop cs3 then analysis by imagej 1 51j8 a description of the present sampling schemes and methods are also detailed in fournier et al 2012b finally for comparison with deb model outputs the gdi which is a surface area ratio was converted to a gameto somatic index gamsi which is a mass ratio between reproduction buffer and flesh weight assuming no relative differences in weights between the components of the gonado visceral mass the following relationship was used to calculate gamsi from field data 1 gamsi gdi w w visc w w where w w v i s c is the wet weight of the visceral mass and ww the total flesh wet weight 2 3 model description to describe the growth development and reproduction of p margaritifera as a function of temperature and food conditions we developed a bioenergetic model which relies on the concepts of deb theory kooijman 2010 fig 2 and see appendix a for the general description and equations of the different fluxes the model revisits with new data and parameterization design marques et al 2018 the works of thomas et al 2011 and fournier 2011 who applied the standard deb model to p margaritifera at the larval and adult stage respectively our objective was to obtain a single set of parameters with some stage specific ones to represent the full life cycle of p margaritifera according to the deb models previously developed for bivalves bourlès et al 2009 in case of starvation the maintenance costs were prioritized over reproduction then growth if needed when the mobilized reserve does not cover all maintenances costs the reproduction buffer takes over note that no lysis of the structure was allowed in our model hence the individual dies if the reserve and the reproduction buffer cannot cover maintenance costs spawning is triggered according to an opportunistic strategy le moullac et al 2012 pouvreau et al 2000a 2000c regardless of the environmental conditions i e neither food nor temperature threshold are required for spawning when gamsi the ratio between the gonadic and total dry flesh mass see eq 7 below reaches a given threshold gamsithreshold a part of the reproduction buffer is released the parameter spawnratio defines this amount of stored energy which is released at each spawn according to fournier 2011 and our own unpublished data of gamsi and histological analysis for 40 individuals right after spawning triggered by thermal choc 80 of the spawners had a gamsi close to 0 15 while the other 20 totally emptied their stored gonad products the deb model presented here specifies the complete life cycle of p margaritifera it is of the asj type which takes into account the delayed acceleration of growth rate that is reported by sangare et al 2019 to occur right after settlement the model assumed isomorphy except between the settlement and juvenile stage where metabolism accelerates following the rules for v1 morphy kooijman 2014 until the oyster reaches the juvenile stage the consequence is that growth is not only accelerated by a larger intake but also by a larger mobilization from reserve in comparison to an isomorph under this assumption values of surface area specific assimilation rate pam and energy conductance v after the metamorphosis depend on the feeding history during the larval stage which may partly explain the natural variability in parameters between individuals of the same species kooijman et al 2011 this phase is called type m acceleration sm and we refer the reader to kooijman 2014 for a detailed description the egg energy content e 0 is fixed from calculations made by acosta salmón 2004 stage transitions occur at defined thresholds of the cumulated energy into maturation eh fig 3 an embryo becomes a larva at e h e h b settles and metamorphoses changes its shape at e h e h s reaches juvenile stage without change in morphology at e h e h j and matures into an adult at e h e h p metabolic acceleration occurs from settlement until juvenile stage in addition the model incorporates one shape coefficient for the adult δm and a different one for the larvae δm larv since larvae morphometry changes at settlement southgate and lucas 2011 finally the full model of the temperature correction was used with high and low boundaries of the optimal temperature range being specified and parameterized see appendix a b a simpler form with one parameter is often used in deb studies when solely temperature conditions within the optimal range are considered this is the case in the older version of the deb model for p margaritifera fournier 2011 and most bivalves studies with the exception of thomas et al 2011 throughout

calibrates the parameters thanks to a nelder mead numerical optimization that minimizes the difference between observed and predicted values based on a weighted least squares criterion initial values of the parameters were set following thomas et al 2011 and fournier 2011 thirty datasets from the literature were used for model calibration ranging from length or age at different life stages to respiration rate at different conditions of food and temperature sangare et al 2019 the list of input data extracted from the literature is available at nathanael sangare 2019 amp pinctada

ingestion is the only parameter of the p margaritifera deb model that can be tuned freely for further applications in contrasting environments alunno bruscia et al 2011 fournier et al 2012a thomas et al 2011 this environment specific coefficient reflects the variability in oyster food and specifically the quantitative and qualitative effects of inorganic material and phytoplankton species on the feeding response of p margaritifera in this way the simulation of oyster growth in different pacific tropical ecosystems is possible with a single set of parameters with xk as the only free fitting parameter 2 6 model validation to assess the accuracy of the model simulations and its generalization to other french polynesian atoll lagoons modelled description of the pearl oyster life cycle was tested on four in situ datasets of growth and reproduction at different life stages and in contrasted environments table 1 these datasets were all independent from those used for model parametrization the data from lot 3 allowed to test the model ability to describe pearl oyster performances at different life stage and latitudes and longitudes far from the pilot site of ahe since gambier island is located by 23 s conversely tapakoto atoll is only 115 km away from ahe validation simulations were run in the conditions of food and temperature that were monitored simultaneously along with the respective biological dataset the parameter xk was readjusted for each atoll according to the description of the food conditions and or the age of the oysters several missing values of chl a

to account for the inter individual variability of the validation datasets 2 3 4 the deb model was applied using a multi individual based modeling strategy the initial individual conditions of the simulations were computed according to the real oyster s length and flesh weights measured individually on each sampled oyster at the first sampling point of each dataset individual simulations were performed and then pooled together to compute average patterns the agreement between field observations and model simulations was evaluated by linear regression between the samples mean value of observations x and the mean value of individual simulations y which was tested against the y x model at the alpha error threshold of 5 the r² coefficient of determination allowed us to evaluate how much of the variance was explained by the model 2 7 sensitivity analysis to environmental conditions the sensitivity of the pearl oyster life history traits to environmental conditions was assessed with three theoretical environmental scenarios taking into account a wide range of temperatures and food concentrations that occur in tropical atoll lagoons especially in french polynesia the effect of temperature on p margaritifera growth and reproduction was investigated within the range 23 to 34 c this range brackets the french polynesia typical seasonal variations ranging from 27 to 30 c in the northern tuamotu archipelago and 23 5 to 28 5 c in the gambier islands le moullac et al 2012 pouvreau et al 2000d and also includes temperature maxima observed during el niño events andréfouët et al 2018 the effects of food availability on p margaritifera growth and reproduction were investigated within the range 0 05 to 1 µgchl a l 1 in french polynesian atoll lagoon chl a concentrations range from 0 1 to 0 7 µgchl a l 1 with extreme values of 0 05 µgchl a l 1 in the open ocean and 1 2 µgchl a l 1 in mataiva atoll andréfouët et al 2001 delesalle and sournia 1992 independently of the atoll mean annual concentration important variations of the planktonic ecosystem may occur at different time scales and have been mostly related to grazing pressure delesalle et al 2001 fournier 2011 sakka et al 1999 thomas et al 2010 basic spectral analysis fast fourier transform function from matlab r2107b on food concentrations time series provided by the 4 validation datasets see above were performed for further representation of food variations thereby three theoretical scenarios were performed 1 the influence of temperature and food concentrations were assessed by comparing oysters life history traits in constant environmental conditions ranging from 0 05 to 1 µgchl a l 1 for food and 23 to 34 c for temperature 2 the effect of yearly seasonal temperature variations on life history traits was investigated using sinusoid functions period 365 days with a total amplitude ranging from 2 to 8 c and that oscillated around several values ranging from 22 to 35 c minimum and maximum temperatures occurred respectively in the middle of austral winter and summer here the food concentration was fixed and set at the average value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 based on observations by charpy et al 1997 from 16 tuamotu atoll lagoons 3 the influence of phytoplankton biomass variations was investigated by considering oscillations around the reference values of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 µgchl a l 1 at a mean temperature of 28 5 c charpy et al 1997 fournier 2011 thomas et al 2010 amplitude variations were set to vary from 0 1 to 1 µgchl a l 1 note that the minimum values were set to 0 01 µgchl a l 1 to keep realistic the dynamic equilibrium of the grazer phytoplankton system the phytoplankton biomass turnover rate was investigated by setting the oscillation periods from once a year to two days simulations were first performed with the values for xk calibrated in laboratory on larvae and adults feeding on cultivated micro algae isochrysis lutea and chaetoceros gracilis table 2 this assumption does not represent the real variability of food quality and or appetence of the oysters when considering total chl a measurements alunno bruscia et al 2011 thus simulations 1 and 2 were also performed with the values for xk adjusted during in situ model validation life history traits of interest were set according to the constraints inherent to spat collection and pearl production

html during the model parameterization the scaled functional response was assumed to be equal to 0 3 and 0 1 for in situ data representing the austral summer and winter respectively the functional response for the ad libitum experimental data sets was set to 0 9 instead of the possible maximum f 1 because it was rather unclear how optimal the nutritional value of the cultivated phytoplankton

corresponded to that calibrated for larvae experimentally 0 6 μgchl a l 1 table 2 for in situ rearing not supplied with cultured algae fig 4 b c and d the half saturation parameter was calibrated at 0

highly significant with r2 equal to 0 995 0 937 0 943 0 967 respectively for the simulations a b c and d with p values 0 0001 3 2 2 dataset 2 simulations compared with the validation dataset 2 are presented in fig 5 here the half saturation coefficients were adjusted at 0 7 mg pom l 1 for the age group 1 and 0 5 mg pom l 1 for age group 2 and 3 to obtain better fits this way r2 were equal to 0 864 and 0 884 respectively for the age group 1 and 2 with p values 0 0001 and simulations for age group 3 gave an r2 equal to 0 373 with a p value of 0 015 pouvreau et al 2000a suggested from their study respectively 1 2 and 4 spawning events for the age group 1 2 and 3 represented by blue arrows on the fig 5 these conclusions are not confirmed by the new simulations that suggested for each age group one spawning event per individual during the year of survey marked by drops in the thin lines on fig 5 individuals spawned continuously during several months fig 5 braces from august to january for the age groups 1 and 3 fig 5 a c and from mid september to mid january for the age group 2 fig 5 b in any case 80 or more of the spawning events occurred between mid september and mid december 3 2 3 dataset 3 simulations of shell length and dry flesh mass evolution in gambier islands are compared with the validation dataset 3 in fig 6 here the value of the half saturation coefficient xk was readjusted at 0 1 μgchl a l 1 to improve the fits the simulations usually remained in the range of the observed values except for the large underestimation of the flesh dry mass between february and may fig 6 a r2 0 561 p value 0 0277 and an overestimation of the shell length from june to august fig 6 b r2 0 904 p value 0 001 le moullac et al 2012 suggested 3 spawning events fig 6 blue arrows in december march and june here these conclusions are not confirmed by the simulations that suggested one spawn per individual occurring asynchronously throughout the year sharp decrease in the thin lines 3 2 4 dataset 4 environmental conditions from stations 1 3 fig 1 are shown fig 7 a b respectively time series of gameto somatic index variations are plotted on fig 7 c d no readjustment of xk from the value calibrated in laboratory xk 0 2 μgchl a l 1 were needed to obtain better fits a steady decrease of temperature from about 30 to 27 c was recorded during the period of observation february to august or the middle of the austral summer and winter respectively according to the observations food concentration and biological measurements did not show clearly defined seasonal variations peaks of chl a concentration happened occasionally during the year gametogenesis occurred when food availability allowed it and spawning took place asynchronously the whole year fig 7 no massive spawning event could be clearly identified during the field survey here the model did not accurately reproduce gamsi variations with r2 equals to 0 057 and 0 125 and p value equals to 0 1841 and 0 1679 respectively to the fig 7 c d however the mean value remained relevant within the general range of fluctuations and clusters of asynchronous spawns occurred when observed gamsi decreased fig 7 arrows note that a slight decrease of gamsi occurred at station 3 between mid april and mid may without associated spawning events according to the model simulations this decrease was due to a low food concentration which led the organisms to pay maintenance costs from the reproduction buffer individuals simulated at the station 1 were able to reproduce once or twice depending on the initial conditions of their gonads while individuals from station 3 spawned only once during the simulation the model accurately described shell growth at different ages and contrasted location within the lagoon of ahe fig 8 with r2 very close to 0 99 and p value 0 0001 since individual shell length values and dynamics were very close to each other only the mean values of the observed and simulated data are plotted for the sake of clarity 3 3 sensitivity analysis to environmental conditions generally the model predicted low oysters performances at low temperature and food and improved physiological performances with rising conditions until the temperature reached 34 5 c fig 9 appendix b after which degrading performances prevented oysters long term survival 3 3 1 simulation 1 sensitivity to mean environmental values simulation 1 assessed the influence of constant food and temperature levels set at their mean values half saturation coefficients were set to 0 2 and 0 6 µgchl a l 1 for adults and larvae respectively the temperature from 24 to 30 c and food availability from 0 1 to 0 9 µg chl a l 1 is represented by rectangles on the fig 9 to highlight the range of french polynesian atoll lagoon conditions delesalle and sournia 1992 within these ranges we predicted a possible theoretic pld from 10 to 70 days fig 9 a 2 to 14 spawning events a year for a 13 cm shell length oyster fig 9 b and a commercial size was reached at 12 to 40 months after egg fertilization fig 9 c according to the dataset 2 gambier islands experienced annually a mean food of 0 19 µgchl a l 1 a mean temperature of 25 5 c and a half saturation coefficient xk suitable for validation equal to 0 1 µgchl a l 1 in these conditions a 13 cm shell length oyster would be able to spawn six times a year and the fertilized eggs would reach a commercial size after 23 months not shown up north in ahe atoll the dataset 4 framed food and temperature at 0 21 µgchl a l 1 and 28 5 c respectively with a xk equal to 0 2 µgchl a l 1 thus a 13 cm shell length oyster could reproduce 5 times a year and fertilized eggs would reach a commercial size after 24 months similarly for the value of xk 0 2 µgchl a l 1 which was reported in situ for larvae in ahe dataset 1 pld would range between 10 to 20 days in the northern tuamotu archipelago not shown when respectively released in austral summer 30 c and winter 27 c no larvae datasets were available to assess xk in gambier island thus under the assumption that the half saturation coefficient does not differ between locations the pld in gambier would range from 17 to 27 days depending on whether spawning occurred in the summer 28 5 c or winter 23 5 c 3 3 2 simulation 2 sensitivity to seasonal temperature variations simulation 2 informs on how the seasonal temperature variations affect the growth and reproductive effort of oysters with simulations performed at constant food levels 0 2 µgchl a l 1 but at various mean temperatures and amplitude variations fig 10 seasonal changes occurred at a slow time scale that did not influence larval development which is more sensitive to the relative variations at the time of development see fig 9 a seasonal amplitudes affected oysters growth and reproduction differently depending on the average annual temperature for instance for a mean temperature value of 26 c no effect of the seasonal variations was reported on growth or reproduction but at 29 c the time to reach commercial size slowed to 5 months and reproduction effort was divided by 1 5 along the gradient of temperature amplitude fig 10 according to the actual range of temperature conditions occurring in french polynesia fig 10 rectangles oysters needed from 23 to 26 months to reach a commercial size fig 10 a and spawners of 13 cm shell length could reproduce 4 to 5 times a year fig 10 b a mean fluctuation of 2 to 3 c occur in the northern tuamotu archipelago where the mean annual temperature comes close to 28 5 c whereas a mean variation of 5 to 6 c for an average annual temperature of 25 5 c is recorded in the gambier islands then using xk values suitable see above for ahe atoll and gambier islands it appeared that oysters needed 23 months to reach a commercial size while spawners can reproduce 5 times a year in any case seasonal fluctuations of temperatures introduced seasonality of reproductive outputs for a mean annual temperature of 28 c and seasonal amplitude greater than 4 c three of the five spawning events reported by the simulations occurred when temperature is above 28 c on the other hand reproduction occurred at more regular intervals over the year when the temperature difference between austral summer and winter is below 4 c 3 3 3 simulation 3 sensitivity to phytoplankton biomass stability the preliminary spectral analysis of the environmental conditions of the validation datasets datasets 1 2 3 and 4 did not reveal any periodic signal in food variations not shown the absence of a regular time interval between food rich and starvation periods suggested that fluctuation can be approximated by random variation in the field here only results for oscillations that ranged from 0 1 to 1 µgchl a l 1 around the reference value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 are represented changing the reference food concentration had qualitatively no impact on the general pattern of the life history traits indeed the shape of the isoclines would just be redrawn around the horizontal line defined by the chosen reference value fig 11 dotted lines reference value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 the amplitude of food variations was related to the total amount of food available for oysters and a food variation lower than the reference value reflected stable food conditions over time below 0 2 µgchl a l 1 fig 11 dotted lines below this reference oysters energy management induced small growth variations fig 11 a and reproductive efforts fig 11 b within these limits the time required to reach commercial size varied from 23 to 26 months and the yearly number of spawns varied from 3 to 5 events conversely if the cycle amplitude was greater than the reference value for food variations of life history traits became mainly driven by the oscillation period oscillation period was related to alternating plentiful and starvation phases at high cycle amplitudes above 0 2 µgchl a l 1 fig 11 dotted lines when this oscillation period decreases i e from yearly to 2 days the duration of extreme condition periods ad libitum or starvation decreases thus depending on the duration of these extreme conditions the time required to reach commercial size varied from 29 to 24 months fig 11a andreproductive effort ranged from 4 to 0 spawning events fig 11b for the above food scenarios the total amount of food available on a given period of time is mostly driven by the duration of the oscillations rather than the amplitude of the oscillations consequently for a given amplitude the differences between life history traits is driven by recovery after starvation this had a major impact on reproduction for instance for an amplitude cycle of 0 6 µgchl a l 1 no reproduction is allowed for oscillation periods between 1 5 to 3 months fig 11 b conversely energy distribution lead oysters to slow growth at high oscillation period and vice versa fig 11 a no differences were reported on the pld for amplitude of variations under 0 2 µg chl a l 1 and or turnover rates faster than one month with a time of 20 days required to reach settlement not shown otherwise pld ranged from 20 to 70 days if the cycle of food variation started with a decrease and ranked from 10 to 20 in case of an increase 4 discussion 4 1 critical examination of the new deb model calibration the new deb calibration for p margaritifera leads to one single model with primary parameters applicable all along the life cycle compared to previous deb models applied to p margaritifera that described separately larvae and adult phases fournier 2011 thomas et al 2011 the new full life cycle calibration brings together a wide range of datasets ranging from simple age at birth to respiration curve at different food level and temperature by considering all life stages in a single model this new deb model for p margaritifera is more suitable for future ecotoxicological physiological or biophysical ecology investigation this is also a first step towards integrated population and ecosystem dynamic models compared to the larval and adult phase deb models fournier 2011 thomas et al 2011 we obtained different parameter values for the metabolic rates at the reference temperature of 20 c for instance the general specific cost of maintenance p m that was previously calibrated at 24 and 54 j cm 3 d 1 for the larvae and adults respectively dropped to a common value of 5 4 j cm 3 d 1 in this study this compound parameter is directly related to the allocation fraction to soma κ and the maximum surface specific assimilation rate pam thus the new calibration induces an increase of κ from 0 45 and 0 53 respectively for larvae and adult to 0 75 and a decrease of pam from 13 and 795 respectively for larvae and adult to 3 06 j cm 2 d 1 the newly calibrated values of κ and pam remain consistent with the general patterns identified for bivalves kooijman 2013 e g tridacna gigas a tropical bivalve had a κ of 0 83 and a pam of 5 11 j cm 2 d 1 at the reference temperature of 20 c moving from two separated models to one single model did not affect thus far the description of the different life stages growth curves were well captured with r2 0 9 previous fournier 2011 and new deb models respected the general patterns of observed mean flesh mass and reproductive effort model construction prioritized maintenance before growth and reproduction and no maintenance cost could be paid from structure therefore in poor conditions shell growth that is a proxy for structural growth stopped while flesh mass or reproduction buffer decreased which is in agreement with observed patterns chávez villalba et al 2013 linard et al 2011 in the model the differences between compartment reserve structure and reproduction buffer dynamics implied that the various life history traits were not reproduced with the same accuracy along the entire life cycle for instance shell growths were the best fitted measurements at any life stage and for any type of environments fig 4 fig 8 conversely flesh dry masses accuracy was more variable across time with achieved r2 depending on the age class ranging from 0 56 to 0 91 fig 5 fig 6 a this is consistent with the idea that weight fluctuates within individual of the same length and that inter individual variability increases with age pace et al 2006 regarding gameto somatic index gamsi evolution the model was less accurate fig 7 c d with low r2 and substantial dissimilarity between observed and simulated patterns the discrepancies translate some difficulties for the model to accurately capture gametogenesis variations and spawning events in a variable environment part of the variance might be due to the sampling mode which is lethal hence the measured cohorts were different at each time step while simulations referred to a single cohort only thus the initial conditions of each sampling point could differ in addition the sensitivity to this initial condition was likely more acute considering the chosen reproduction opportunistic strategy le moullac et al 2012 pouvreau et al 2000c this modeling strategy does not consider endogenous or exogenous factors assumed to favor the synchronicity of spawning southgate and lucas 2011 and it is thus difficult to reproduce accurately the sudden decrease of gamsi as observed in the field a non lethal sampling mode such as the high frequency non invasive hfni valvometry that can record spawning event from the valves activity bernard et al 2016 might improve model outputs and general understanding of spawning determinism conservative versus lethal sampling and simulation strategies cannot explain alone the general underestimation of flesh dry mass that was modeled in gambier for several months e g from february to may fig 6 a a more likely explanation could be a lack of accuracy regarding the description of the amount of energy available in the field by using total chlorophyll a as proxy for food this last hypothesis is reinforced by the need to keep the half saturation coefficient xk as a free fitting parameter as alunno bruscia et al 2011 has previously described for c gigas xk integrates all variations related to the trophic environment this includes food sources variations of food nutritive quality different selection of the filtered particles and variability in assimilation efficiency according to the particles actually ingested as such the presence of a food source that is poorly or not captured by the chlorophyll a might explain the disagreement between observations and simulations of weight picoche et al 2014 it is known for other bivalves sauriau and kang 2000 that filtration selection and ingestion capacities depend on life stage or on prey sizes overall high values correspond to poor trophic quality or low appetence for the available food from there the model suggests that cultivated micro algae are less appropriate to feed pearl oysters than in situ species validation dataset 1 and in situ phytoplankton is more palatable for growing oysters validation dataset 2 these results remain consistent with the fact that p margaritifera also feed in situ on achlorophyllous organisms following the work of fournier 2011 and picoche et al 2014 further work on pearl oyster trophic regime planktonic communities and their nutritional value would be warranted jointly with weight measurement 4 2 sensitivity analysis to environmental conditions the constant behavior of temperature and food availability conditions in simulation 1 did not correspond to a real environment however as mean annual temperature is function of the latitude and mean chl a concentration function of the lagoon water residence time andréfouët et al 2001 delesalle and sournia 1992 fixing in such a way the mean annual values created a partition between lagoons with different potentials and modes for oyster production lagoons from the northern tuamotu archipelago experience higher mean annual temperature than those experienced by the gambier islands and first appear to be more suitable for oysters growth fig 9 however due to different food qualities suggested by different values of xk and based on the standard mean annual value of 0 2 µgchl a l 1 the performances are better in gambier than northern tuamotu thus far pld data are unavailable for gambier this prevents the appropriate adjustment of xk and the assessment of model predictions but for growth until commercial sizes are reached the simulations agreed with pouvreau and prasil 2001 observations with 24 and 25 months respectively in the gambier and northern tuamotu to reach 10 cm these results highlight the need to take into account food quality jointly with temperature to explain past pearl farming performances and in anticipation of environmental changes for planning future farming high seasonal temperature fluctuation had for general impact to decrease growth and reproductive effort modulo the mean annual value fig 10 from simulation 2 performances decreased jointly with rising seasonal variations but this sensitivity to seasonal fluctuation declined when the mean temperature dropped in french polynesia small seasonal variations are associated with high mean annual temperatures and vice versa according to energetic dynamics increasing temperatures accelerate energetic flux until an optimum thus high temperature variations introduce a seasonality in reproduction with increased spawning during the warm season the role of seasonal temperature variations and phytoplankton blooms on bivalve reproduction and synchronicity has been demonstrated for species in temperate environments e g philippart et al 2012 ruiz et al 1992 to assess the influence of the environment on the p margaritifera reproduction opportunistic strategy described by fournier et al 2012b it could be useful to sample gamsi along a gradient of atolls that experiment various temperature seasonal differences this way it would be also easier to further assess the influence of various endogenous or exogenous factors in spawning synchronicity simulation 3 suggested contrasted responses of the black lipped pearl oyster to phytoplankton biomass fluctuations energetic dynamics implies that oysters accessing similar amount of food cumulative but with different variations of concentrations across time will react differently in particular the duration of extreme condition periods implies different recovery needs after starvation and the consequences are expressed in the life history traits for instance gametogenesis duration has to be taken into consideration to explain the patchy results in simulation 3 above the reference food concentration the proximity between gametogenesis completion time and oscillation period prevented the reproduction buffer from filling up completely during the plenty period the oyster became unable to reproduce while in the same time the cumulative amount of food available in the environment is supposed to allow 5 spawns within a year fig 9 b in agreement with fournier et al 2012b and pouvreau et al 2000c who linked food concentration with reproductive effort and synchronicity simulation 3 confirms that food availability is the main driver of reproduction the results from the three theoretical scenarios highlight the importance of environmental variations rather than mean annual conditions to model and infer physiological traits food and temperature variations have significant impact on energy dynamics since temperature drives the speed of exchanges between compartments and food controls the amount of energy in circulation simulating a constant environment cannot reproduce the low physiological performances induced by environmental fluctuations such as the compensation during starvation periods by reserves or the differences of energetic flux kinetics following temperature variation practically the absence of a regular predictable time interval between plenty and starvation periods makes difficult to infer the best possible locations for pearl farming the range of conditions represented by the various simulations had no impact on larval development this is due to the time scale which are significantly different between pelagic larval duration and environmental changes in our simulations at small time scale pld ranging from 10 to 70 days the maximal theoretical values from our simulations are simulated depending on the season and or the trajectory up or down taken by the food availability variation simulations 1 3 the 70 day extreme pld has never been observed and will probably seldom occur in realistic environment with all mortality causes present disease predation significant variations of temperature and food concentration are reported at short space and time intervals within a given lagoon thomas et al 2010 thus mortality rate environmental heterogeneity and larval behavior partly explain the 15 to 35 days pld reported in the literature sangare et al 2019 thomas et al 2014 here the results indirectly confirm that a spatial environmental heterogeneity plays a significant role in recruitment by influencing growth rate and indirectly mortality and dispersion time high frequency monitoring of the environment in space and time emerge as a critical bottleneck for realistic modeling of larvae development and dispersal 4 3 perspectives according to this study most of the existing data on in situ growth and reproduction for p margaritifera agree with the results of the deb model when considering adequate food and temperature variations thus adequately considering future environmental conditions may provide insights in the future trends of p margaritifera life history traits expression in the next few decades changes in ocean currents and temperature are projected to alter the surface and productivity of ecological areas near the south pacific subtropical gyre leading to reduced phytoplankton biomass and average size in the ocean which may also impact lagoons bell et al 2013 adult p margaritifera feed preferentially on planktonic organism larger than 2 µm fournier et al 2012a loret et al 2000 and according to our model simulations such changes could affect pearl oyster reproduction and growth and eventually pearl farming yields it would be interesting in the future to monitor the environmental changes and track the trajectories followed by each lagoon ecosystem within our simulation space and infer possible problems obviously simulations remain coarse simplification of the real environment and various other factors might temperate the results this could include fast environmental variations as well as physiological or genetical adaptations few studies have looked at the role of genetics in shaping pearl oyster life traits and thus on the potential of adaptation to changing conditions joubert et al 2014 investigated the environmental control underlying the molecular mechanisms of shell growth and ky and le moullac 2017 highlighted the non negligible part of genetics on growth variability we suggest that further work on these aspects is warranted at the intra lagoon scale phytoplankton abundance is highly dependent on water exchange from the ocean through the atoll rim but the influence of pearl farming activity itself on plankton concentration should not be overlooked lefebvre et al 2012 pagano et al 2017 and hulot et al 2018 suggested significant depletion of planktonic organism concentration in aquaculture areas which can be induced by tidal flushing and by the grazing pressure of the filter feeder communities long periods of low phytoplankton biomass followed by intense sporadic blooms have been reported in french polynesian atolls lagoons sakka et al 1999 but lack of high frequency data on phytoplankton communities and biomass makes difficult to accurately characterize the magnitudes and periods of these events and the role of pearl farming itself on these mechanisms finally to scale up the limit of the black lipped pearl oyster response to the environment conditions a suggested approach would be i the integration of the deb model into an individual based model for the population level bacher and gangnery 2006 thomas et al 2016b sangare et al in prep ii coupling this population model with a biogeochemical and an environmental model able to provide food temperature and the conditions of larval transport such design would expand the work of thomas et al 2016a on p margaritifera who characterized larval growth and dispersal in a dynamic environment by coupling the deb model for larvae with a hydrodynamic model 5 conclusion by its ability to accurately describe a wide range of p margaritifera physiological traits in contrasted environment the calibrated full life cycle deb model provides new opportunities to address questions spanning from physiological limits and adaptations to pearl farming sustainability from the tested environmental scenarios the simulations shed light on the influence of variations of temperature food availability and quality on p margaritifera life history traits expression from both the environmental and physiological point of view more observations are required for a better assessment of reproduction potential adequately considering future environmental conditions and testing them within this new calibrated deb model may provide a powerful tool

24878,in recent years researchers from interdisciplinary teams involving ecologists economists and operations researchers collaborated to provide decision support tools to address the challenges of preserving biodiversity by optimizing the design of reserves the goal of this paper is to further advance this area of research and provide new solutions to solve complex spatial conservation planning scp problems under uncertainty that consider risk preferences of decision makers our approach employs modern portfolio theory to address uncertainties in scp problems and involves two conflicting objectives maximizing return and minimizing risk we apply concepts from game theory such as the nash bargaining solution to directly compute a desirable pareto optimal solution for the proposed bi objective optimization formulation in natural resource management problems we demonstrate with numerical examples that by directly computing a nash bargaining solution a binary quadratically constrained quadratic program bqcqp can be solved we show that our approach implementable with commercial solvers such as cplex can effectively solve the proposed bqcqp for much larger problems than previous approaches published in the ecological literature optimal solutions for problems with less than 400 parcels can be computed within a minute near optimal solutions within at most 0 2 gap from an optimal solution for high dimensional problems involving up to 800 parcels can be computed within 8 h on a standard computer we have presented a new approach to solve scp optimization problems while considering uncertainty and risk tolerance of decision makers our new approach expands considerably the applicability of such scp optimization methods to address real conservation problems keywords spatial conservation planning modern portfolio theory nash bargaining solution optimization reserve design 1 introduction impacts to biodiversity are occurring as a result of habitat loss fragmentation species invasions and other threats these losses are likely to be exacerbated by climate change and the failure of long term conservation planning to consider risk i e the potential for consequences where something of societal value is at stake and where there is uncertainty e g environmental and structural uncertainty about the outcome dale et al 2013 eaton et al 2019 ludwig et al 2018 pressey et al 1993 reside et al 2018 despite an increase in attention to conservation issues both domestically and internationally further scientific developments are necessary to support decision making related to the conservation of species and their habitats boyd et al 2015 kingsland 2002 the design of effective protected areas from an ecological and economical point of view is important due to observed declines in biodiversity worldwide wang and önal 2016 the development of strategies used in the design of nature reserves is often referred to as spatial conservation planning scp pressey et al 1993 scp can be defined as the process by which conservation programs identify where and how to implement conservation actions e g which unprotected land parcels should be added to a protected reserve based on specific quantifiable criterion to evaluate the value return of the parcel as a function of the management objectives beyer et al 2016 schwartz et al 2018 some of the challenges associated with scp include the difficulty of incorporating both our scientific understanding of natural systems and also the values of stakeholders in the decision making process in a way that can be communicated to the non expert community to alleviate this problem scp has been explored jointly by interdisciplinary teams that involved biologists economists and operations researchers to achieve practical outcomes in the design of nature reserves kingsland 2002 mathematical models that have been applied to address the scp problems include network theory zamborain mason et al 2017 simulation ramage et al 2013 markov decision processes costello and polasky 2004 dujardin and chadès 2018 schapaugh and tyre 2012 and spatial optimization algorithms such as integer linear programming and simulated annealing ball et al 2009 önal and wang 2008 spatial optimization for scp uses a mathematical representation of a set of parcels from which the creation of a reserve is desired and maximizes or minimizes one or more objectives each represented by an equation when an optimization problem includes multiple conflicting objectives computing the trade offs between them can be helpful for identifying sub optimal alternatives with respect to each objective and focusing the trade off negotiation among the set of optimal design solutions the trade off between objectives is often represented in the so called pareto optimal frontier i e a collection of points each point representing a solution where improving one of the objectives implies the deterioration of at least one other objective solving a multi objective optimization problem is computationally much more time consuming than solving single objective optimization problems consequently most scp studies have considered only one objective function with some constraints often by using weights to combine multiple objectives into a single function for example a typical objective is to minimize the total reserve cost subject to one or more conservation goals see for instance levin et al 2013 wang et al 2018 wang and önal 2016 williams et al 2004 runting et al 2017 alagador et al 2016 crossman and bryan 2006 and chernomor et al 2015 some other studies used the return on investment or profit as the objective function and employed some budget constraints armsworth et al 2012 carvajal et al 2013 withey et al 2012 finally some other authors have used objective functions that consider coverage connectivity or distance between parcels as additional evaluation criteria dissanayake and önal 2011 dissanayake et al 2012 rayfield et al 2016 scp problems are often modeled as integer programs because the decision of whether a parcel must be added to the reserve requires a binary decision variable such optimization problems are often challenging to solve beyer et al 2016 because integer programming is generally np hard i e currently there exists no algorithm that can solve any integer programming problem in polynomial time garey and johnson 2002 despite this limitation researchers prefer to develop linear integer programs for scp problems because of the existence of powerful commercial solvers such as ibm ilog cplex gurobi and fico xpress as well as recent advances in the development of exact and heuristic metaheuristic algorithms for example the most widely used software for scp problems is marxan based on a metaheuristic algorithm known as simulated annealing watts et al 2009 marxan uses a standard objective function that aims to minimize the sum of the site specific and connectivity costs of the selected parcels while reaching objective specific targets e g habitat area targets in the reserve one issue that is often ignored when implementing scp is the existence of uncertainty in the parameters of the optimization model a typical approach when uncertainty is modeled is to replace unknown parameters with probabilistic estimates for instance the approach described by tulloch et al 2015 is to determine the number of species protected under different risk tolerance scenarios by defining survival probabilities for the species udell et al 2018 used a similar approach for considering collision risk between watercraft and marine wildlife but they defined scenarios with different species survival probabilities using a bayesian belief network in a recent study haider et al 2018 advised that applying deterministic or stochastic approaches to model scp problems may either ignore or inaccurately describe uncertainty when the data are not reliable the authors therefore proposed a robust optimization approach for solving scp problems to address the issue of uncertainty an alternative approach for considering uncertainty in scp problems is based on modern portfolio theory mpt used to assess the trade off between correlated risk variance and expected return markowitz 1952 1959 in mpt the risk function is the variance of the expected value for the return so it captures the uncertainty inherent in the data functionally mpt is a bi objective optimization approach in which the first objective is to maximize the return and the second one is to minimize risk however there are two challenges when applying mpt analyzing the trade off is computationally expensive for scp problems involving many parcels eaton et al 2019 found it computationally impractical to compute the entire pareto optimal frontier for scps with more than 50 parcels even after determining the pareto optimal frontier it is not clear how one should select a desirable solution based on the trade off some of the early applications of mpt for formulating scp problems were implemented by crowe and parker 2008 and halpern et al 2011 to address the challenges mentioned above crowe and parker 2008 transformed the original formulation to a single objective formulation that minimizes the risk function such that the return function is equal to a desired expected return the main problem with this formulation is that it cannot guarantee that the optimal solution will be a pareto optimal solution on the other hand halpern et al 2011 simply combined both objectives into a single objective using a weighted sum function λ 1 f 1 λ 2 f 2 where f 1 and f 2 are the two objective functions and λ 1 and λ 2 are some positive scalars weights solving the single objective weighted sum problem is convenient because it returns a point on the pareto optimal frontier of the two objective functions as long as the weights are positive aneja and nair 1979 however aggregating objective functions is known to have two significant downsides 1 it is not obvious how λ 1 and λ 2 should be determined and 2 the weighted sum approach cannot guarantee finding all the points of the pareto optimal frontier i e there are many solutions located on the pareto optimal frontier that cannot be obtained by any combination of values for λ 1 and λ 2 boland et al 2015 to illustrate this observe in fig 1 a pareto optimal frontier of two functions f 1 and f 2 with three points p 1 p 2 and p 3 without loss of generality we assume that f 1 and f 2 are two minimization functions imaginary lines l 1 and l 2 make reference to the linear function λ 1 f 1 λ 2 f 2 for two different combinations of weights λ 1 and λ 2 note that for both l 1 and l 2 the values of λ 1 and λ 2 are positive in the case of l 1 λ 1 λ 2 and for l 2 λ 2 λ 1 the arrows perpendicular to the imaginary lines indicate the direction in which l 1 and l 2 are minimized clearly when l 1 is minimized p 1 is obtained similarly when l 2 is minimized p 3 is obtained however it is impossible to obtain p 2 from the weighted sum of any combination of positive values for λ 1 and λ 2 recently mallory and ando 2014 and alvarez et al 2017 proposed to minimize only the risk function and include the return function in the set of constraints by imposing some acceptable bounds for it while promising this approach has similar weaknesses 1 it is not obvious how the bounds should be defined and 2 this approach may return an inferior i e not pareto optimal solution boland et al 2015 more recently eaton et al 2019 proposed to first compute the entire trade off i e the exact pareto optimal frontier and then utilized the concept of cooperative game theory to apply a nash bargaining solution nash 1950 for selecting a desirable solution from the pareto optimal frontier a bargaining problem is a cooperative game in which all players agree to create a grand coalition rather than competing to realize a higher collective payoff saghand et al 2019 to create this grand coalition an agreement among all players is necessary therefore a critical question to be answered is what should the payoff of each player be in a grand coalition one of the solutions to this question was proposed by nash now known as the nash bargaining solution eaton et al 2019 proposed to create a game with two imaginary players in which one of the players wants to minimize the risk and the other one wants to maximize the return then they proposed to create a coalition between these two imaginary players by using the concept of nash bargaining solution the approach proposed by eaton et al 2019 resolves the second challenge mentioned above regarding mpt but not the first the primary limitation of their approach is that the pareto optimal frontier needs to be computed first before the nash bargaining solution can be applied here we extend the work proposed by eaton et al 2019 and show that the nash bargaining solution can be computed directly without computing the entire pareto optimal frontier first we anticipate that by not having to compute the entire pareto optimal frontier we can obtain an improvement in computational performance specifically we formulate the problem of selecting a nash bargaining solution in mpt as a binary quadratically constrained quadratic program bqcqp i e a formulation where the decision variables are binary the objective function is linear and at least one of the constraints is quadratic here we do not attempt to linearize our proposed bqcqp algorithm as has been common in previous scp studies we will show that when linearizing the proposed formulation a significant number of new constraints and decision variables need to be introduced commercial linear integer programming solvers may struggle to solve problems formulated with such constraints because our proposed approach is a mathematical programming formulation we can determine the relative distance between the best solution obtained from the solver algorithm and a possible optimal solution the ability to report an optimality gap represents a further benefit of our method over that proposed by eaton et al 2019 a graphical framework of our approach can be observed in fig 2 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the mathematical formulation of scp when employing mpt henceforth referred to as mpt scp in section 3 we detail our proposed bqcqp for solving the mpt scp problem using the nash bargaining solution approach and demonstrate its use with a numerical example in section 4 we conduct an extensive computational study by generating and analyzing some simulated data in the last section we provide some conclusions and perspectives 2 mathematical formulation of an mpt scp problem 2 1 the return and risk functions the challenge under consideration is a generic scp problem that we approach using the principles of mpt markowitz 1952 1959 which attempts to maximize the expected return of investment in a conservation design while minimizing the risk the scp problem is derived from the so called reserve selection problem beyer et al 2016 bolton and specht 1983 specially the problem assumes that there are two sets of parcels that define the initial state of the system one is denoted by s and represents the parcels that are already under protection in the reserve network the other set is denoted by b and represents the parcels that are not already under protection and being considered for inclusion in the network for each protected parcel j s the decision is whether it should be selected for sell or divestment thus removing it from the set of protected parcels for each unprotected parcel j b the decision is whether the parcel should be selected for purchase or investment or to be added to the set of protected parcels note that several authors have justified the use of both divestment and investment of parcels for studying scp problems see for instance fuller et al 2010 and alagador et al 2014 mpt seeks to identify decisions by maximizing the total return for a given level of risk and simultaneously minimize the risk for a desired level of return however the return for each parcel is assumed to be uncertain due to changing conditions an incomplete understanding of the dynamics of the system being conserved or for other reasons therefore an uncertain return includes some risk that any decision regarding a reserve design will not achieve its intended outcome economic theory suggests that downside risk increases positively with expected value thus representing competing objectives and an important trade off for decision makers to consider eaton et al 2019 mpt recognizes this trade off and seeks to maximize overall expected return while minimizing the total risk calculated as the total variance at the same time moreover it is sensitive to the correlation between the return obtained from all protected parcels and the risk incurred in their protection the total expected return of a particular reserve design is computed by adding the expected return of each parcel under protection we denote the expected return of parcel j by μj to compute the total risk we account for the variance of each parcel being considered for protection denoted by σ j 2 and also consider the correlation between all candidate pairs of parcels covariance denoted by ρji the total expected return and risk can be stated by the following functions 1 z 1 x y j b x j μ j j s 1 y j μ j 2 z 2 x y j b x j σ j 2 j s 1 y j σ j 2 j b i b i j 2 x j x i σ j σ i ρ j i j s i s i j 2 1 y j 1 y i σ j σ i ρ j i j b i s 2 x j 1 y i σ j σ i ρ j i where xj 0 1 for each j b is a binary decision variable that indicates if a parcel j from the set b is selected for investment x j 1 or not x j 0 similarly yj 0 1 for all j s is a binary decision variable that indicates if a parcel j from the set s is selected for divestment y j 1 or not y j 0 the divestment option can be removed by setting y j 0 in eqs 1 and 2 for all j s values z 1 x y and z 2 x y represent the total expected return function and the total risk function respectively for z 1 x y we observe that for any j b μj will be added to the total expected return only if x j 1 however for any j s μj will be added to the total expected return only if y j 0 this is because y j 0 implies that parcel j s will remain protected for z 2 x y we observe that the risk function has five parts the first two parts capture the variance of unprotected and protected parcels the remaining three parts capture the covariance of each pair i j of parcels where both parcels can be unprotected protected or one of them is protected and the other is unprotected additionally the covariance implies that i j we provide an example of the mpt scp problem in fig 3 fig 3a shows the initial system state current reserve design a total of 6 parcels exists in this example and only 2 of them are already under protection the expected return for each parcel is shown in the top right corner of each parcel and it is assumed that the variance of the return for each parcel is a positive value therefore the current total expected return of the predefined parcels is 4 1 3 and the total risk is some positive number first suppose that one is interested in optimizing only the return function and ignoring the risk in this case those unprotected parcels with positive return must be added for protection and the parcels with negative return must be divested from protection as shown in fig 3b hence the expected maximum total return of the predefined parcels is 1 4 2 5 12 additionally from fig 3b we observe that the parcel with the expected return equal to 0 is not added to the final solution portfolio this is because by assumption each parcel has a positive risk and thus adding this parcel does not improve the total expected return but by definition adds to the risk now suppose that one is interested in optimizing only the risk function and ignoring the excepted return completely in this case again because we assumed that the risk of each parcel is positive the optimal decision is to divest all already protected parcels because the risk will become zero in that case and the total return will be zero too this solution is shown in fig 3c 2 2 a bi objective optimization formulation using the proposed total return and risk functions the bi objective optimization formulation corresponding to the mpt scp can be stated as follows 3 max z 1 x y min z 2 x y subject to x y f where f 0 1 b s is the so called feasible set of the problem i e the set of all possible feasible choices for x y to define the feasible set some constraints need to be introduced unless f 0 1 b s a finite budget is a common example of a constraint and one that we will use for this study a budget constraint can be defined in several ways for example a monetary budget can be imposed to define a bound on the amount of money available to buy unprotected parcels similarly one can define the maximum number of transactions to bound the number of unprotected parcels that can be bought in both cases the funds available and the number of transactions for parcel acquisition can be increased when a currently protected parcel is sold a generic mathematical representation of a budget constraint can be stated as follows 4 j b α j x j j s β j y j γ where γ is a non negative parameter defining the available budget αj for j b is a parameter that penalizes the budget when an unprotected parcel j is acquired i e cost of acquiring an unprotected parcel j finally βj for j s is a parameter that increments the budget when a protected parcel j is sold i e sell price of a protected parcel j for practical purposes αj βj and γ must be computed in similar units for example if α j 1 for all j b and β j 1 for all j s then the budget γ is controlled by the number of transactions buying selling events in addition to budget constraints there are several other types of constraints that can appear when dealing with scp problems in particular beyer et al 2016 formulated constraints to consider the role of adjacent and neighboring parcels a common concern for the reserve selection problem when considering connectivity within a protected area a compendium of such constraints is provided in appendix a and interested readers are encouraged to refer to beyer et al 2016 for further details we note that there are other challenges when developing an mpt scp based formulation model for ecological applications for example quantifying the value of parameters driving environmental systems or the objectives themselves and understanding how such quantities and subjective values will change over time are not trivial tasks interested readers may refer to appendix b to see an example on how the values of the parameters in the objective functions i e return and risk can be determined overall how to develop an mpt scp based model for a particular ecological application is beyond the scope of this paper because it highly depends on the application consequently in the remainder of this paper the focus will be on how to solve such a model assuming that the resource management values have been elicited quantified and specified appropriately in an objective function note that there often exists no feasible solution that can optimize across competing objectives simultaneously as in problem 3 hence as mentioned earlier a practical approach is to first compute the so called pareto optimal frontier i e the set of feasible points in the objectives space that are not dominated by any other feasible point next decision makers select their desired pareto optimal point and implement its corresponding reserve portfolio an illustration of the pareto optimal frontier for a mpt scp problem is indicated in fig 4 each point asterisk in this figure represents a feasible solution in the objectives space however asterisks are dominated by at least one of the solid points i e the objective values of at least one of the solid points are better for the same amount of risk a better return can be achieved or for the same amount of benefit a lower risk solution is possible the pareto optimal frontier defines the region in which improvement in one component of objectives cannot occur without a loss to another 2 3 issues related to the bi objective formulation although computing the entire pareto optimal frontier seems to be a plausible option there are many barriers and considerations when doing so for scps of practical size the primary impediment is related to the nonlinearity of the risk function in problem 3 a common practice for managing nonlinear objectives is linearization see for instance eaton et al 2019 since all decision variables of problem 3 are binary standard linearization techniques can be applied easily for example we can replace any instance of xjxi with a new binary variable denoted by bji and add the following three constraints b j i x j b j i x i b j i x j x i 1 observe from these inequalities that because bji is a binary variable it will take the value of zero if x j 0 or x i 0 otherwise bji will take the value of one a similar approach can be used to linearize any other nonlinear term in the risk function however the issue is that for every pair of parcels to consider there is a nonlinear term in the risk function which greatly increases the computational demand because a new binary decision variable and three constraints must be defined for each this immediately implies that the size of problem 3 after linearization will be large enough to generate computational memory issues for a large number of parcels e g 500 parcels in this case it can be expected that even finding a small number of pareto optimal points may not be computationally possible here we propose to estimate and apply the nonlinear risk function directly rather than linearize the objective functions generally commercial linear integer programming solvers are significantly more mature and faster than commercial nonlinear integer programming solvers however a desirable feature of the risk function is that it is a quadratic function and commercial nonlinear integer programming solvers have good techniques to deal with such functions from experience with the current technology and algorithms it appears to be impractical to compute the pareto optimal frontier of problem 3 if b s 50 as a result the size of the problems that have been solved to date is small e g up to 50 parcels for larger problems one can divide the total number of parcels into groups each with a smaller number of parcels and compute the pareto optimal frontier for each of these groups independently eaton et al 2019 however it is clear in that case that the obtained frontiers will be sub optimal with respect to the full problem another major issue of computing the entire pareto optimal frontier is that it is likely to generate a very large number of viable alternative portfolio options which can be overwhelming for decision makers in other words providing many pareto optimal points to decision makers may be of limited assistance to guide real decision making jorge 2009 one alternative approach is to directly compute a desirable pareto optimal point which is known as the problem of optimization over the pareto optimal set in the multi objective optimization literature benson 1984 the underlying idea of optimization over the pareto optimal set is to compute a solution that can balance the conflicting objectives and satisfy the decision makers or at least be a good starting point with this in mind eaton et al 2019 proposed to use the nash bargaining procedure as the method of optimization over the pareto optimal set for selecting a desirable solution nash 1950 they demonstrated that their approach may offer a reasonable starting place for negotiations among decision makers by identifying a portfolio that balances risk and return however the main limitation of their approach is that it relies on computing the entire pareto optimal frontier in advance which is not computationally tractable for large problems in this study we propose a technique that can find the nash bargaining solution directly without having first to define the entire pareto frontier 3 the proposed approach we begin by explaining the geometric interpretation of the nash bargaining solution for a mpt scp problem using an illustrative example fig 5 the nash solution attempts to find a pareto optimal point denoted by z 1 z 2 such that the area of the rectangle delimited by this point and any user defined reference point is maximized the reference point is sometimes referred to as the disagreement point and represents the status quo of the game in game theory a natural choice for the reference point is the so called nadir point denoted by z 1 n z 2 n which is a point in the criterion space defining the worst value of each objective function in the pareto optimal frontier this point can be computed for cases with two objectives such as mpt scp problems by simply finding the endpoints of the pareto optimal frontier let z 1 b z 2 b and z 1 t z 2 t be the bottom and top endpoints of the pareto optimal frontier the nadir point is then z 1 n z 2 n z 1 b z 2 t the nash bargaining solution is interesting since it intuitively attempts to not only maximize the benefits of cooperation but also equally distribute it between players in mpt scp one can consider two imaginary players the first player attempts to maximize the return and the second player attempts to minimize the risk observe that z 1 z 1 n is the benefit of cooperation for the first player and z 2 n z 2 is the benefit of cooperation for the second player the nash bargaining solution attempts to maximize the area of the rectangle i e z 1 z 1 n z 2 n z 2 such that the solution represents an improvement over the largest number of dominated alternatives i e solutions other than those found on the pareto optimal frontier this implies that it geometrically attempts to maximize the area of a square in the criterion space i e z 1 z 1 n z 2 n z 2 the nash bargaining solution of problem 3 has several desirable characteristics including that it represents a pareto optimal solution and that this solution exists if problem 3 is feasible in light of these characteristics our proposed approach for computing the nash bargaining solution can be summarized by three steps the first two steps are for calculating the reference nadir point the first step is to compute the top endpoint of the pareto optimal frontier by solving the following optimization problem 5 z 1 t max x y f z 1 x y and then solving the following optimization problem 6 z 2 t min x y f z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 t the second step is to compute the bottom endpoint by first solving the following optimization problem 7 z 2 b min x y f z 2 x y and then solving the following optimization problem 8 z 1 b max x y f z 1 x y z 2 x y z 2 b note that the computations of z 2 t and z 1 b depend on the values of z 1 t and z 2 b respectively therefore the order of the processing of problems 5 and 6 and of problems 7 and 8 cannot be reversed after computing the endpoints the nadir point is obtained i e z 1 n z 2 n z 1 b z 2 t so in the third step we can compute the nash bargaining solution by solving the following optimization problem 9 max x y f z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 n z 2 x y subject to z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n the constraints of problem 9 ensure that the nash bargaining solution will fall on the pareto optimal frontier i e it will dominate the reference point all five optimization problems defined by our proposed approach i e problems 5 9 can be solved using commercial solvers some implementation issues should be considered however 3 1 implementation issues problem 5 is a binary linear program which can be solved by commercial solvers however problem 6 is a binary quadratic program since its objective function is a risk function see problem 2 in order to use commercial solvers to solve problem 6 one can use the following equivalent formulation 10 z 2 t min r 0 x y f r r z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 t where r is a dummy non negative variable for capturing the value of the risk in an optimal solution we recognize that the inequality r z 2 x y is a quadratic constraint making problem 10 a binary quadratically constrained linear program bqclp that can be solved using second order cone programming solvers included in commercial solvers such as cplex gurobi and xpress because an optimal solution of 5 is feasible for problem 6 we can provide it to the commercial solvers as a warm start i e initial solution to possibly reduce the computational time for the bottom endpoint we propose as a reasonable solution to disregard both problems 7 and 8 completely this is because the bottom endpoint identifies the point representing minimum total risk the minimum possible value for the risk that can be obtained by divesting all parcels that are already under protection is zero in this case the total return will be also zero hence we can set z 1 b z 2 b 0 0 if the divestment option is not available then z 1 b z 2 b would correspond to the status quo scenario for the reserve design finally we observe that the objective function of problem 9 is a multiplication between a linear function and a quadratic function to solve this problem using commercial solvers we transform problem 9 to a binary quadratically constrained quadratic program bqcqp to do so we first observe that problem 9 is equivalent to the following problem max ω 0 x y f ω subject to ω z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 n z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n where ω is a dummy non negative variable capturing the value of the square root of the objective function of problem 9 in an optimal solution this formulation is equivalent to the following max ω 0 r 0 x y f ω subject to ω z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 n r r z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n the latter transformation is similar to that defined in problem 10 in other words r is a dummy non negative variable for capturing the value of the risk in an optimal solution finally we observe that this is also equivalent to the following formulation 11 max ω 0 ω 1 0 ω 2 0 r 0 x y f ω subject to ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 r z 2 x y ω 1 z 1 x y z 1 n ω 2 z 2 n r z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n where ω1 and ω2 are dummy non negative variables to capture the value of z 1 x y z 1 n and z 2 n r respectively all constraints in problem 11 are either linear or quadratic and therefore this formulation is a bqcqp and can be solved using commercial solvers finally the main motivations for developing our proposed algorithm also discussed in section 2 3 was to find an acceptable solution for problems with many parcels i e high dimensionality problems indeed computing the exact pareto optimal frontier of the mpt scp may not be practical because of the curse of dimensionality and computational limitations for management problems with large number of parcels a possible alternative to our method is to use an iterative and interactive process that would also avoid computing the entire pareto optimal frontier this would imply that we compute a pareto optimal solution i e a single point and then ask decision makers to identify whether they are satisfied with the solution if they are not satisfied then we would compute a second pareto optimal solution by adjusting our search and then ask decision makers for their opinions again this process can be repeated until we end up identifying a desirable pareto optimal solution while this alternative approach may be possible in some cases it may still be impractical for mpt scp problems with many parcels because even computing a single pareto optimal solution may be computationally infeasible with current computer technology dujardin and chadès 2018 in other words after adjusting the search with this interactive process we may fail to find another pareto optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time the main advantage of our approach is that it attempts to find a near pareto optimal solution directly by borrowing ideas from the field of game theory although our approach does not require an iterative feedback from decision makers it can be adapted to be more interactive approach if desired this can be done by changing the reference point in our study we have set the reference to the nadir point because that seems to be a natural choice however users can adjust the search by choosing a different reference point in consultation with decision makers and that can result in finding a different pareto optimal solution the second advantage of our approach is that it is not as time consuming for managers natural resource managers are often too busy to be deeply involved with complex elicitation and analyses therefore implementing an approach that is less demanding may be appealing in many cases 3 2 numerical example we now present a simplified numerical example to demonstrate the functioning and performance of the nash bargaining solution for a predefined set of land parcels in this example there exists a total of 50 parcels of which only 15 are currently under protection i e s 15 and the remaining ones can be considered for investment i e b 35 we associated a randomly generated return variance and size area to each parcel additionally we generated a correlation matrix for the parcel set randomly attributing a correlation value between 1 and 1 for the return and variance of each parcel pair interested readers may refer to appendix c to see the data simulated for this numerical example including correlation between pairs of parcels return and variance of each parcel the initial state of each parcel and the size of each parcel for this example the initial status of the protected area produces a total return of 16 81 and a total risk of 0 04 fig 6 we consider two scenarios to illustrate the performance of our proposed approach the first scenario imposes no constraint on the feasible set i e f 0 1 50 while the second scenario limits the feasible set by imposing a budget constraint of the form in eq 4 we will use the size of parcels to define the budget constraint in the second scenario specifically in eq 4 αj and βj represent the ratio of the size of parcel j to the total size of unprotected land at the initial state for example because the total size of unprotected land at the initial state is 2547 79 and the size of parcel 1 unprotected is 453 63 based on appendix c we have that α 1 0 178 similarly because the size of parcel 10 protected is 58 99 we have that β 10 0 023 finally for defining the constraint we also set the available budget to 0 1 i e γ 0 1 in this example we first implement the proposed nash bargaining solution approach for the first scenario unconstrained budget in which the identified solution provides the total return of 26 44 while the total risk is reduced to 0 002 fig 7 in this scenario a ratio of 0 839 indicates the total amount of land added to the reserve as a proportion of the area of unprotected land at the initial state intuitively one can think of this ratio as the value of the mathematical expression on the left hand side of eq 4 the ratio is 0 839 for the nash bargaining solution of the first scenario this implies that although parcel 10 is divested in the solution the total size of land added to the reserve is 83 9 of the total area of unprotected land at the initial state quantifying the magnitude of improvement by comparing the nash bargaining solution with the initial conservation state we observe that the nash bargaining solution significantly outperforms the initial state with a 57 9 increase in return and a 95 reduction in associated risk fig 8 results from the second scenario i e the budget constrained scenario demonstrate a nash bargaining solution with the total return of 26 55 and the total risk of 0 003 fig 9 the ratio of newly protected to available land is 0 0996 for this solution which conforms to our constraint of γ 0 1 this implies that the total size of land added to the reserve is 9 96 of the total size of the unprotected land at the initial state an interesting behavior noted in this numerical example is that the nash bargaining solution generated by the budget constrained scenario produced a larger return than the unconstrained model this is possible because the disagreement point for each model might be unique and because the risk generated by the constrained solution is larger than in the unconstrained scenario 4 computational study in this section we conduct a comprehensive computational study to show the performance of our proposed nash bargaining solution approach for mpt scp problems we use the c programming language to implement the proposed approach and employ three different solvers including cplex 12 7 gurobi 8 1 and fico xpress 8 5 to solve the optimization problems all computational experiments are carried out on a dell poweredge r630 with two intel xeon e5 2650 2 2 ghz 12 core processors 30mb 128gb ram and the redhat enterprise linux 7 0 operating system we allow optimization solvers to use up to 10 threads when solving each optimization problem also we impose a time limit of 8 h for each experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we randomly generate five classes of instances that are different only in terms of the number of parcels under consideration specifically our instances have 50 or 100 or 200 or 400 or 800 parcels for each class we randomly generate 5 instances so in total we have 25 instances we run each instance under 5 different scenarios the scenarios are generated using the procedure explained in section 3 2 specifically the first scenario is unconstrained and scenarios 2 5 include a budget constraint based on the size of parcels the difference between scenarios 2 5 is only on the value of γ see eq 4 specifically γ is set to 0 1 0 2 0 35 and 0 5 for scenarios 2 5 respectively our instances are randomly generated based on the volcano data set which is an elevation model in r programming language that consists of the topographic information for the volcano maunga whau mt eden in new zealand available at https www rdocumentation org packages datasets versions 3 6 1 topics volcano rather than assume a species follows a uniform distribution completely we simulate a spatially heterogeneous species distribution that mimics a population responding to natural variation in nature e g elevation the return is computed by using the parcel sizes from the data extracted using the volcano function and using monte carlo simulations to generate scenarios for species distribution the risk is computed using the variance and correlation of the data the details of the r code used to generate the random instances are available in appendix d in order to explore the overall performance of our approach we report the following pieces of information obj value ratio the ratio of the objective value of the solution obtained by each commercial optimization solver for problem 11 to the objective value of the best solution obtained among the solvers i e cplex gurobi and xpress hence larger values are better and ideally should be equal to one optimality gap since we impose a time limit for our experiments it is possible that optimization solvers do not find an optimal solution within the time limit however they can determine how far is the obtained solution and a possible optimal solution in terms of the objective value such distance is called the optimality gap and ideally it should be zero for example an optimality gap of 10 for a given solver shows that the objective value of problem 11 for the solution obtained by the solver is guaranteed not to be 10 smaller worse than its optimal objective value time seconds this is the actual solution time in seconds for an optimization solver to solve an instance note that although we are imposing a time limit of 8 h 28 800 some instances can be solved in a shorter period of time the results for the performance of our approach over the smallest class of instances i e instances with a landscape of 50 parcels are shown in table 1 the numbers are averages over five instances in all the tables in this section the best values are highlighted in bold in the tables whenever appropriate we observe from table 1 that cplex outperforms the other solvers all instances with 50 parcels are solved to optimality in approximately one second by cplex both gurobi and xpress performed poorly and could not solve many of the instances to optimality within the time limit this is highlighted by the fact that the average optimality gap of gurobi and xpress are 1 53 and 0 04 respectively moreover there is an increasing tendency in the solution time of gurobi and xpress as the budget available i e λ increases unfortunately for classes of instances with more than 50 parcels we were unable to obtain any solution using xpress because of the way that the solver handles the computer memory we observed a similar issue when using gurobi but only for classes of instances with more than 100 parcels thus for the second classes of instances 100 parcels we only report the results of cplex and gurobi table 2 again we observe that cplex was able to solve all instances to optimality in less than 10 s gurobi was not able to solve many instances to optimality and determined an average optimality gap of 15 76 finally our results for the remaining classes of instances can be found in table 3 as mentioned earlier both gurobi and xpress were not able to solve such instances and hence their results are not reported we again observe that cplex performed very well for class of instances with 200 parcels the solver was able to find optimal solutions within a few seconds for classes of instances with 400 and 800 parcels it was not able to solve many instances to optimality but for even such large instances the solution was near optimal with an optimality gap of less than 0 2 5 discussion our study focused on the application of mathematical optimization to address risk management for scp problems involving various forms of uncertainty typically mathematical optimization involves two challenging phases the first being model development and the second a solution method the first phase specifying the mathematical optimization model consists of several steps such as defining constraints objective functions and relevant parameters the second phase involves solving the proposed model and deriving a desirable and feasible solution that can be implemented in practice for the first phase we formulated the scp problem as an mpt scp problem as proposed by eaton et al 2019 which addressed conflicting objective functions of maximizing return and minimizing risk we introduced the generic mathematical model of an mpt scp problem and some typical constraints faced by decision makers that should be customized for any particular application e g modelers would elicit from decision makers objective functions and constraints to be included in the model following model development we proposed a novel exact solution method which is the main contribution of this paper an mpt scp problem is a bi objective optimization problem for which there are two common solution approaches 1 generating the entire pareto optimal frontier first and presenting the solution set to the decision makers for finding a desirable solution or 2 generating the pareto optimal solutions one by one iteratively obtaining feedback from the decision makers on each solution and adjusting the search accordingly until reaching a desirable solution while both of these methods are reasonable none of them can be applied to solve large mpt scp problems that is because computing even a single exact pareto optimal solution for problems with large number of parcels may not be computationally feasible therefore we proposed an alternative solution method for high dimensional problems whereby we directly compute a benchmark pareto optimal solution that can be used to impartially balance between conflicting objectives such a solution minimizes the choices presented to decision makers thus reducing problem complexity or represents a useful starting point for decision makers to begin negotiations our approach is based on the concept of nash bargaining solution first presented by eaton et al 2019 for scp problems and expands on this original study in several important ways first it greatly reduces computational time by overcoming the need to compute the entire pareto optimal frontier second it can solve large optimization problems by simply implementing three smaller optimization problems that are either binary linear programs or bqcqps third we have defined the problem in such a way that it can be solved using existing commercial solvers which should make the implementation of these algorithms more accessible to users who are not experienced in developing optimization algorithms through an extensive computational study we show that our approach implemented using cplex gurobi and xpress commercial solvers can solve problems of up to 800 parcels to approximate optimality in a reasonable time 8 h surpassing the study size constraints demonstrated in previous studies eaton et al 2019 thus our extension should considerably increase the applicability of spatial optimization algorithms that consider multi objective problems specifically we showed that among the commercial solvers cplex aligns significantly better with our approach the numerical results showed that cplex can solve instances with 200 parcels to optimality in a few seconds and can find almost optimal solutions for instances with as many as 800 parcels within 8 h this is a considerable improvement over the approach used in eaton et al 2019 which was limited to 50 parcels under similar computing conditions this advancement can considerably expand our ability to analyze large problems for conservation and resource management applications our approach has the potential to account for important sources of uncertainty such as structural or environmental for example it is possible to account for the uncertainty associated with alternative climate change projections e g uncertain sea level rise scenarios as described in eaton et al 2019 but also alternative underlying models describing the relationship between species abundance and environmental covariates e g elevation precipitation using the nash bargaining solution implicitly addresses the tradeoff between risk and return although some managers may appreciate the opportunity to visualize and evaluate alternatives by inspecting several options along the pareto optimal boundary this process can be time consuming or cognitively difficult in many instances natural resource managers have very limited time to examine and evaluate alternative solutions in such cases the nash bargaining solution may be particularly appealing given that it provides a reasonable tradeoff between risk and return nevertheless our approach can be adapted to more explicitly account for the risk attitude of decision makers this would involve a more interactive approach in which multiple pareto optimal solutions would be evaluated another benefit of the nash bargaining solution is that it alleviates the need for assigning weights to competing objectives assigning weights to competing objectives for multi objective optimization can lead to sub optimal results with respect to fairness an issue that has not been fully addressed in the scp literature for example this shortcoming has been overlooked with regards to one of the most widely used software applications for scp the integer linear programming formulations of the objective function in marxan e g beyer et al 2016 which combines multiple habitat objectives with a reserve connectivity objective in a single weighted objective function yet as showed in boland et al 2015 this approach can lead to spurious results we have demonstrated the approach that we have proposed eliminates this issue at least for two competing objectives we formulate the nash bargaining solution to avoid the need to select fair weights for the objective functions an additional feature of the current approach that was not considered by eaton et al 2019 is the ability to compute an optimality gap to evaluate the quality of the proposed solution because we used a mathematical programming formulation we can quantify a metric of under performance relative to a possible optimal solution here we have primarily focused on examples related to the scp and site selection problems we can extend the current framework to one that considers other spatial considerations such as reserve connectivity see appendix a nevertheless the approach that we have developed is applicable to many other ecological problems we could for instance apply it to the case of treatment of invasive species choosing treatment options at each site monitoring rare or endangered species where to sample protection decisions establishment of speed zones allocation of law enforcement activities to reduce poaching or optimal allocation of wind farms other allocation problems may not necessarily involve a spatial component the allocation problem may be to allocate budgets to competing packages of actions portfolio of actions or even a mix of actions that involve spatial and non spatial decisions competing objectives uncertainty and correlated risks and returns are common in conservation planning problems and this framework provides an integrated approach to addressing these issues and solving these problems credit authorship contribution statement alvaro sierra altamiranda

a neighboring constraints for each parcel j let xj be a binary decision variable indicating whether a parcel should be selected x j 1 or not x j 0 based on this definition a common constraint when formulating scp problems is that a given parcel i can be selected only if parcel j is selected to enforce this one can implement the following constraint 12 x i x j 0 in contrast if the desired result is to protect at most one of the parcels i and j then the following constraint must be added 13 x i x j 1 let c be the set of parcels neighboring a given parcel j then one can define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if at least one of its neighbors is also selected 14 i c x i x j 0 one can also define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if all of its neighbors are also selected 15 i c x i c x j 0 now let n c be an integer number then one can define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if at least n neighbors are also selected 16 i c x i n x j 0 one can also define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if at most n neighbors are also selected 17 i c x i c n x j c finally one can define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if none of its neighbors is selected 18 i c x i c x j c appendix b risk and return example in this appendix we summarize the procedure described in eaton et al 2019 to compute risk and return functions for a scp problem under uncertainty assume that each parcel in and out of the reserve is described by different characteristics such as habitat type under different sea level rise scenarios the steps for obtaining the return and risk functions are as follows 1 collect data from the potential reserve the data must indicate each parcel and its habitat composition types habitat conditions are described as a function of climate change and sea level rise projections 2 extract from the data collected the basic unit of data dhjk that represents the area ha of habitat type h in parcel j under sea level rise scenario k all the values of dhjk are normalized per parcel j using feature scaling obtaining nhjk 3 compute mjk a weighted sum per habitat type using habitat objective criteria weights wh defined by the decision maker i e m j k h w h n h j k 4 define an urbanization development probability per parcel uj augment mjk proportionally to the development probability to obtain ljk i e l j k m j k 1 u j 5 scale the value of ljk by the cost cj of each parcel to obtain the expected return rjk of parcel j under sea level rise scenario k i e r j k l j k c j 6 use the sea level rise probabilities pk to estimate the expected return μj of parcel j i e μ j k p k r j k 7 the return function is the sum of all μj of the parcels that are in the reserve 8 the variance for each parcel and the correlation coefficient between each pair of parcels is computed using rjk and pk 9 the risk function then is the portfolio return variance our new approach allows us to tackle scp problems with many more parcels than eaton et al 2019 appendix c data for the example in this appendix

24878,in recent years researchers from interdisciplinary teams involving ecologists economists and operations researchers collaborated to provide decision support tools to address the challenges of preserving biodiversity by optimizing the design of reserves the goal of this paper is to further advance this area of research and provide new solutions to solve complex spatial conservation planning scp problems under uncertainty that consider risk preferences of decision makers our approach employs modern portfolio theory to address uncertainties in scp problems and involves two conflicting objectives maximizing return and minimizing risk we apply concepts from game theory such as the nash bargaining solution to directly compute a desirable pareto optimal solution for the proposed bi objective optimization formulation in natural resource management problems we demonstrate with numerical examples that by directly computing a nash bargaining solution a binary quadratically constrained quadratic program bqcqp can be solved we show that our approach implementable with commercial solvers such as cplex can effectively solve the proposed bqcqp for much larger problems than previous approaches published in the ecological literature optimal solutions for problems with less than 400 parcels can be computed within a minute near optimal solutions within at most 0 2 gap from an optimal solution for high dimensional problems involving up to 800 parcels can be computed within 8 h on a standard computer we have presented a new approach to solve scp optimization problems while considering uncertainty and risk tolerance of decision makers our new approach expands considerably the applicability of such scp optimization methods to address real conservation problems keywords spatial conservation planning modern portfolio theory nash bargaining solution optimization reserve design 1 introduction impacts to biodiversity are occurring as a result of habitat loss fragmentation species invasions and other threats these losses are likely to be exacerbated by climate change and the failure of long term conservation planning to consider risk i e the potential for consequences where something of societal value is at stake and where there is uncertainty e g environmental and structural uncertainty about the outcome dale et al 2013 eaton et al 2019 ludwig et al 2018 pressey et al 1993 reside et al 2018 despite an increase in attention to conservation issues both domestically and internationally further scientific developments are necessary to support decision making related to the conservation of species and their habitats boyd et al 2015 kingsland 2002 the design of effective protected areas from an ecological and economical point of view is important due to observed declines in biodiversity worldwide wang and önal 2016 the development of strategies used in the design of nature reserves is often referred to as spatial conservation planning scp pressey et al 1993 scp can be defined as the process by which conservation programs identify where and how to implement conservation actions e g which unprotected land parcels should be added to a protected reserve based on specific quantifiable criterion to evaluate the value return of the parcel as a function of the management objectives beyer et al 2016 schwartz et al 2018 some of the challenges associated with scp include the difficulty of incorporating both our scientific understanding of natural systems and also the values of stakeholders in the decision making process in a way that can be communicated to the non expert community to alleviate this problem scp has been explored jointly by interdisciplinary teams that involved biologists economists and operations researchers to achieve practical outcomes in the design of nature reserves kingsland 2002 mathematical models that have been applied to address the scp problems include network theory zamborain mason et al 2017 simulation ramage et al 2013 markov decision processes costello and polasky 2004 dujardin and chadès 2018 schapaugh and tyre 2012 and spatial optimization algorithms such as integer linear programming and simulated annealing ball et al 2009 önal and wang 2008 spatial optimization for scp uses a mathematical representation of a set of parcels from which the creation of a reserve is desired and maximizes or minimizes one or more objectives each represented by an equation when an optimization problem includes multiple conflicting objectives computing the trade offs between them can be helpful for identifying sub optimal alternatives with respect to each objective and focusing the trade off negotiation among the set of optimal design solutions the trade off between objectives is often represented in the so called pareto optimal frontier i e a collection of points each point representing a solution where improving one of the objectives implies the deterioration of at least one other objective solving a multi objective optimization problem is computationally much more time consuming than solving single objective optimization problems consequently most scp studies have considered only one objective function with some constraints often by using weights to combine multiple objectives into a single function for example a typical objective is to minimize the total reserve cost subject to one or more conservation goals see for instance levin et al 2013 wang et al 2018 wang and önal 2016 williams et al 2004 runting et al 2017 alagador et al 2016 crossman and bryan 2006 and chernomor et al 2015 some other studies used the return on investment or profit as the objective function and employed some budget constraints armsworth et al 2012 carvajal et al 2013 withey et al 2012 finally some other authors have used objective functions that consider coverage connectivity or distance between parcels as additional evaluation criteria dissanayake and önal 2011 dissanayake et al 2012 rayfield et al 2016 scp problems are often modeled as integer programs because the decision of whether a parcel must be added to the reserve requires a binary decision variable such optimization problems are often challenging to solve beyer et al 2016 because integer programming is generally np hard i e currently there exists no algorithm that can solve any integer programming problem in polynomial time garey and johnson 2002 despite this limitation researchers prefer to develop linear integer programs for scp problems because of the existence of powerful commercial solvers such as ibm ilog cplex gurobi and fico xpress as well as recent advances in the development of exact and heuristic metaheuristic algorithms for example the most widely used software for scp problems is marxan based on a metaheuristic algorithm known as simulated annealing watts et al 2009 marxan uses a standard objective function that aims to minimize the sum of the site specific and connectivity costs of the selected parcels while reaching objective specific targets e g habitat area targets in the reserve one issue that is often ignored when implementing scp is the existence of uncertainty in the parameters of the optimization model a typical approach when uncertainty is modeled is to replace unknown parameters with probabilistic estimates for instance the approach described by tulloch et al 2015 is to determine the number of species protected under different risk tolerance scenarios by defining survival probabilities for the species udell et al 2018 used a similar approach for considering collision risk between watercraft and marine wildlife but they defined scenarios with different species survival probabilities using a bayesian belief network in a recent study haider et al 2018 advised that applying deterministic or stochastic approaches to model scp problems may either ignore or inaccurately describe uncertainty when the data are not reliable the authors therefore proposed a robust optimization approach for solving scp problems to address the issue of uncertainty an alternative approach for considering uncertainty in scp problems is based on modern portfolio theory mpt used to assess the trade off between correlated risk variance and expected return markowitz 1952 1959 in mpt the risk function is the variance of the expected value for the return so it captures the uncertainty inherent in the data functionally mpt is a bi objective optimization approach in which the first objective is to maximize the return and the second one is to minimize risk however there are two challenges when applying mpt analyzing the trade off is computationally expensive for scp problems involving many parcels eaton et al 2019 found it computationally impractical to compute the entire pareto optimal frontier for scps with more than 50 parcels even after determining the pareto optimal frontier it is not clear how one should select a desirable solution based on the trade off some of the early applications of mpt for formulating scp problems were implemented by crowe and parker 2008 and halpern et al 2011 to address the challenges mentioned above crowe and parker 2008 transformed the original formulation to a single objective formulation that minimizes the risk function such that the return function is equal to a desired expected return the main problem with this formulation is that it cannot guarantee that the optimal solution will be a pareto optimal solution on the other hand halpern et al 2011 simply combined both objectives into a single objective using a weighted sum function λ 1 f 1 λ 2 f 2 where f 1 and f 2 are the two objective functions and λ 1 and λ 2 are some positive scalars weights solving the single objective weighted sum problem is convenient because it returns a point on the pareto optimal frontier of the two objective functions as long as the weights are positive aneja and nair 1979 however aggregating objective functions is known to have two significant downsides 1 it is not obvious how λ 1 and λ 2 should be determined and 2 the weighted sum approach cannot guarantee finding all the points of the pareto optimal frontier i e there are many solutions located on the pareto optimal frontier that cannot be obtained by any combination of values for λ 1 and λ 2 boland et al 2015 to illustrate this observe in fig 1 a pareto optimal frontier of two functions f 1 and f 2 with three points p 1 p 2 and p 3 without loss of generality we assume that f 1 and f 2 are two minimization functions imaginary lines l 1 and l 2 make reference to the linear function λ 1 f 1 λ 2 f 2 for two different combinations of weights λ 1 and λ 2 note that for both l 1 and l 2 the values of λ 1 and λ 2 are positive in the case of l 1 λ 1 λ 2 and for l 2 λ 2 λ 1 the arrows perpendicular to the imaginary lines indicate the direction in which l 1 and l 2 are minimized clearly when l 1 is minimized p 1 is obtained similarly when l 2 is minimized p 3 is obtained however it is impossible to obtain p 2 from the weighted sum of any combination of positive values for λ 1 and λ 2 recently mallory and ando 2014 and alvarez et al 2017 proposed to minimize only the risk function and include the return function in the set of constraints by imposing some acceptable bounds for it while promising this approach has similar weaknesses 1 it is not obvious how the bounds should be defined and 2 this approach may return an inferior i e not pareto optimal solution boland et al 2015 more recently eaton et al 2019 proposed to first compute the entire trade off i e the exact pareto optimal frontier and then utilized the concept of cooperative game theory to apply a nash bargaining solution nash 1950 for selecting a desirable solution from the pareto optimal frontier a bargaining problem is a cooperative game in which all players agree to create a grand coalition rather than competing to realize a higher collective payoff saghand et al 2019 to create this grand coalition an agreement among all players is necessary therefore a critical question to be answered is what should the payoff of each player be in a grand coalition one of the solutions to this question was proposed by nash now known as the nash bargaining solution eaton et al 2019 proposed to create a game with two imaginary players in which one of the players wants to minimize the risk and the other one wants to maximize the return then they proposed to create a coalition between these two imaginary players by using the concept of nash bargaining solution the approach proposed by eaton et al 2019 resolves the second challenge mentioned above regarding mpt but not the first the primary limitation of their approach is that the pareto optimal frontier needs to be computed first before the nash bargaining solution can be applied here we extend the work proposed by eaton et al 2019 and show that the nash bargaining solution can be computed directly without computing the entire pareto optimal frontier first we anticipate that by not having to compute the entire pareto optimal frontier we can obtain an improvement in computational performance specifically we formulate the problem of selecting a nash bargaining solution in mpt as a binary quadratically constrained quadratic program bqcqp i e a formulation where the decision variables are binary the objective function is linear and at least one of the constraints is quadratic here we do not attempt to linearize our proposed bqcqp algorithm as has been common in previous scp studies we will show that when linearizing the proposed formulation a significant number of new constraints and decision variables need to be introduced commercial linear integer programming solvers may struggle to solve problems formulated with such constraints because our proposed approach is a mathematical programming formulation we can determine the relative distance between the best solution obtained from the solver algorithm and a possible optimal solution the ability to report an optimality gap represents a further benefit of our method over that proposed by eaton et al 2019 a graphical framework of our approach can be observed in fig 2 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the mathematical formulation of scp when employing mpt henceforth referred to as mpt scp in section 3 we detail our proposed bqcqp for solving the mpt scp problem using the nash bargaining solution approach and demonstrate its use with a numerical example in section 4 we conduct an extensive computational study by generating and analyzing some simulated data in the last section we provide some conclusions and perspectives 2 mathematical formulation of an mpt scp problem 2 1 the return and risk functions the challenge under consideration is a generic scp problem that we approach using the principles of mpt markowitz 1952 1959 which attempts to maximize the expected return of investment in a conservation design while minimizing the risk the scp problem is derived from the so called reserve selection problem beyer et al 2016 bolton and specht 1983 specially the problem assumes that there are two sets of parcels that define the initial state of the system one is denoted by s and represents the parcels that are already under protection in the reserve network the other set is denoted by b and represents the parcels that are not already under protection and being considered for inclusion in the network for each protected parcel j s the decision is whether it should be selected for sell or divestment thus removing it from the set of protected parcels for each unprotected parcel j b the decision is whether the parcel should be selected for purchase or investment or to be added to the set of protected parcels note that several authors have justified the use of both divestment and investment of parcels for studying scp problems see for instance fuller et al 2010 and alagador et al 2014 mpt seeks to identify decisions by maximizing the total return for a given level of risk and simultaneously minimize the risk for a desired level of return however the return for each parcel is assumed to be uncertain due to changing conditions an incomplete understanding of the dynamics of the system being conserved or for other reasons therefore an uncertain return includes some risk that any decision regarding a reserve design will not achieve its intended outcome economic theory suggests that downside risk increases positively with expected value thus representing competing objectives and an important trade off for decision makers to consider eaton et al 2019 mpt recognizes this trade off and seeks to maximize overall expected return while minimizing the total risk calculated as the total variance at the same time moreover it is sensitive to the correlation between the return obtained from all protected parcels and the risk incurred in their protection the total expected return of a particular reserve design is computed by adding the expected return of each parcel under protection we denote the expected return of parcel j by μj to compute the total risk we account for the variance of each parcel being considered for protection denoted by σ j 2 and also consider the correlation between all candidate pairs of parcels covariance denoted by ρji the total expected return and risk can be stated by the following functions 1 z 1 x y j b x j μ j j s 1 y j μ j 2 z 2 x y j b x j σ j 2 j s 1 y j σ j 2 j b i b i j 2 x j x i σ j σ i ρ j i j s i s i j 2 1 y j 1 y i σ j σ i ρ j i j b i s 2 x j 1 y i σ j σ i ρ j i where xj 0 1 for each j b is a binary decision variable that indicates if a parcel j from the set b is selected for investment x j 1 or not x j 0 similarly yj 0 1 for all j s is a binary decision variable that indicates if a parcel j from the set s is selected for divestment y j 1 or not y j 0 the divestment option can be removed by setting y j 0 in eqs 1 and 2 for all j s values z 1 x y and z 2 x y represent the total expected return function and the total risk function respectively for z 1 x y we observe that for any j b μj will be added to the total expected return only if x j 1 however for any j s μj will be added to the total expected return only if y j 0 this is because y j 0 implies that parcel j s will remain protected for z 2 x y we observe that the risk function has five parts the first two parts capture the variance of unprotected and protected parcels the remaining three parts capture the covariance of each pair i j of parcels where both parcels can be unprotected protected or one of them is protected and the other is unprotected additionally the covariance implies that i j we provide an example of the mpt scp problem in fig 3 fig 3a shows the initial system state current reserve design a total of 6 parcels exists in this example and only 2 of them are already under protection the expected return for each parcel is shown in the top right corner of each parcel and it is assumed that the variance of the return for each parcel is a positive value therefore the current total expected return of the predefined parcels is 4 1 3 and the total risk is some positive number first suppose that one is interested in optimizing only the return function and ignoring the risk in this case those unprotected parcels with positive return must be added for protection and the parcels with negative return must be divested from protection as shown in fig 3b hence the expected maximum total return of the predefined parcels is 1 4 2 5 12 additionally from fig 3b we observe that the parcel with the expected return equal to 0 is not added to the final solution portfolio this is because by assumption each parcel has a positive risk and thus adding this parcel does not improve the total expected return but by definition adds to the risk now suppose that one is interested in optimizing only the risk function and ignoring the excepted return completely in this case again because we assumed that the risk of each parcel is positive the optimal decision is to divest all already protected parcels because the risk will become zero in that case and the total return will be zero too this solution is shown in fig 3c 2 2 a bi objective optimization formulation using the proposed total return and risk functions the bi objective optimization formulation corresponding to the mpt scp can be stated as follows 3 max z 1 x y min z 2 x y subject to x y f where f 0 1 b s is the so called feasible set of the problem i e the set of all possible feasible choices for x y to define the feasible set some constraints need to be introduced unless f 0 1 b s a finite budget is a common example of a constraint and one that we will use for this study a budget constraint can be defined in several ways for example a monetary budget can be imposed to define a bound on the amount of money available to buy unprotected parcels similarly one can define the maximum number of transactions to bound the number of unprotected parcels that can be bought in both cases the funds available and the number of transactions for parcel acquisition can be increased when a currently protected parcel is sold a generic mathematical representation of a budget constraint can be stated as follows 4 j b α j x j j s β j y j γ where γ is a non negative parameter defining the available budget αj for j b is a parameter that penalizes the budget when an unprotected parcel j is acquired i e cost of acquiring an unprotected parcel j finally βj for j s is a parameter that increments the budget when a protected parcel j is sold i e sell price of a protected parcel j for practical purposes αj βj and γ must be computed in similar units for example if α j 1 for all j b and β j 1 for all j s then the budget γ is controlled by the number of transactions buying selling events in addition to budget constraints there are several other types of constraints that can appear when dealing with scp problems in particular beyer et al 2016 formulated constraints to consider the role of adjacent and neighboring parcels a common concern for the reserve selection problem when considering connectivity within a protected area a compendium of such constraints is provided in appendix a and interested readers are encouraged to refer to beyer et al 2016 for further details we note that there are other challenges when developing an mpt scp based formulation model for ecological applications for example quantifying the value of parameters driving environmental systems or the objectives themselves and understanding how such quantities and subjective values will change over time are not trivial tasks interested readers may refer to appendix b to see an example on how the values of the parameters in the objective functions i e return and risk can be determined overall how to develop an mpt scp based model for a particular ecological application is beyond the scope of this paper because it highly depends on the application consequently in the remainder of this paper the focus will be on how to solve such a model assuming that the resource management values have been elicited quantified and specified appropriately in an objective function note that there often exists no feasible solution that can optimize across competing objectives simultaneously as in problem 3 hence as mentioned earlier a practical approach is to first compute the so called pareto optimal frontier i e the set of feasible points in the objectives space that are not dominated by any other feasible point next decision makers select their desired pareto optimal point and implement its corresponding reserve portfolio an illustration of the pareto optimal frontier for a mpt scp problem is indicated in fig 4 each point asterisk in this figure represents a feasible solution in the objectives space however asterisks are dominated by at least one of the solid points i e the objective values of at least one of the solid points are better for the same amount of risk a better return can be achieved or for the same amount of benefit a lower risk solution is possible the pareto optimal frontier defines the region in which improvement in one component of objectives cannot occur without a loss to another 2 3 issues related to the bi objective formulation although computing the entire pareto optimal frontier seems to be a plausible option there are many barriers and considerations when doing so for scps of practical size the primary impediment is related to the nonlinearity of the risk function in problem 3 a common practice for managing nonlinear objectives is linearization see for instance eaton et al 2019 since all decision variables of problem 3 are binary standard linearization techniques can be applied easily for example we can replace any instance of xjxi with a new binary variable denoted by bji and add the following three constraints b j i x j b j i x i b j i x j x i 1 observe from these inequalities that because bji is a binary variable it will take the value of zero if x j 0 or x i 0 otherwise bji will take the value of one a similar approach can be used to linearize any other nonlinear term in the risk function however the issue is that for every pair of parcels to consider there is a nonlinear term in the risk function which greatly increases the computational demand because a new binary decision variable and three constraints must be defined for each this immediately implies that the size of problem 3 after linearization will be large enough to generate computational memory issues for a large number of parcels e g 500 parcels in this case it can be expected that even finding a small number of pareto optimal points may not be computationally possible here we propose to estimate and apply the nonlinear risk function directly rather than linearize the objective functions generally commercial linear integer programming solvers are significantly more mature and faster than commercial nonlinear integer programming solvers however a desirable feature of the risk function is that it is a quadratic function and commercial nonlinear integer programming solvers have good techniques to deal with such functions from experience with the current technology and algorithms it appears to be impractical to compute the pareto optimal frontier of problem 3 if b s 50 as a result the size of the problems that have been solved to date is small e g up to 50 parcels for larger problems one can divide the total number of parcels into groups each with a smaller number of parcels and compute the pareto optimal frontier for each of these groups independently eaton et al 2019 however it is clear in that case that the obtained frontiers will be sub optimal with respect to the full problem another major issue of computing the entire pareto optimal frontier is that it is likely to generate a very large number of viable alternative portfolio options which can be overwhelming for decision makers in other words providing many pareto optimal points to decision makers may be of limited assistance to guide real decision making jorge 2009 one alternative approach is to directly compute a desirable pareto optimal point which is known as the problem of optimization over the pareto optimal set in the multi objective optimization literature benson 1984 the underlying idea of optimization over the pareto optimal set is to compute a solution that can balance the conflicting objectives and satisfy the decision makers or at least be a good starting point with this in mind eaton et al 2019 proposed to use the nash bargaining procedure as the method of optimization over the pareto optimal set for selecting a desirable solution nash 1950 they demonstrated that their approach may offer a reasonable starting place for negotiations among decision makers by identifying a portfolio that balances risk and return however the main limitation of their approach is that it relies on computing the entire pareto optimal frontier in advance which is not computationally tractable for large problems in this study we propose a technique that can find the nash bargaining solution directly without having first to define the entire pareto frontier 3 the proposed approach we begin by explaining the geometric interpretation of the nash bargaining solution for a mpt scp problem using an illustrative example fig 5 the nash solution attempts to find a pareto optimal point denoted by z 1 z 2 such that the area of the rectangle delimited by this point and any user defined reference point is maximized the reference point is sometimes referred to as the disagreement point and represents the status quo of the game in game theory a natural choice for the reference point is the so called nadir point denoted by z 1 n z 2 n which is a point in the criterion space defining the worst value of each objective function in the pareto optimal frontier this point can be computed for cases with two objectives such as mpt scp problems by simply finding the endpoints of the pareto optimal frontier let z 1 b z 2 b and z 1 t z 2 t be the bottom and top endpoints of the pareto optimal frontier the nadir point is then z 1 n z 2 n z 1 b z 2 t the nash bargaining solution is interesting since it intuitively attempts to not only maximize the benefits of cooperation but also equally distribute it between players in mpt scp one can consider two imaginary players the first player attempts to maximize the return and the second player attempts to minimize the risk observe that z 1 z 1 n is the benefit of cooperation for the first player and z 2 n z 2 is the benefit of cooperation for the second player the nash bargaining solution attempts to maximize the area of the rectangle i e z 1 z 1 n z 2 n z 2 such that the solution represents an improvement over the largest number of dominated alternatives i e solutions other than those found on the pareto optimal frontier this implies that it geometrically attempts to maximize the area of a square in the criterion space i e z 1 z 1 n z 2 n z 2 the nash bargaining solution of problem 3 has several desirable characteristics including that it represents a pareto optimal solution and that this solution exists if problem 3 is feasible in light of these characteristics our proposed approach for computing the nash bargaining solution can be summarized by three steps the first two steps are for calculating the reference nadir point the first step is to compute the top endpoint of the pareto optimal frontier by solving the following optimization problem 5 z 1 t max x y f z 1 x y and then solving the following optimization problem 6 z 2 t min x y f z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 t the second step is to compute the bottom endpoint by first solving the following optimization problem 7 z 2 b min x y f z 2 x y and then solving the following optimization problem 8 z 1 b max x y f z 1 x y z 2 x y z 2 b note that the computations of z 2 t and z 1 b depend on the values of z 1 t and z 2 b respectively therefore the order of the processing of problems 5 and 6 and of problems 7 and 8 cannot be reversed after computing the endpoints the nadir point is obtained i e z 1 n z 2 n z 1 b z 2 t so in the third step we can compute the nash bargaining solution by solving the following optimization problem 9 max x y f z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 n z 2 x y subject to z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n the constraints of problem 9 ensure that the nash bargaining solution will fall on the pareto optimal frontier i e it will dominate the reference point all five optimization problems defined by our proposed approach i e problems 5 9 can be solved using commercial solvers some implementation issues should be considered however 3 1 implementation issues problem 5 is a binary linear program which can be solved by commercial solvers however problem 6 is a binary quadratic program since its objective function is a risk function see problem 2 in order to use commercial solvers to solve problem 6 one can use the following equivalent formulation 10 z 2 t min r 0 x y f r r z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 t where r is a dummy non negative variable for capturing the value of the risk in an optimal solution we recognize that the inequality r z 2 x y is a quadratic constraint making problem 10 a binary quadratically constrained linear program bqclp that can be solved using second order cone programming solvers included in commercial solvers such as cplex gurobi and xpress because an optimal solution of 5 is feasible for problem 6 we can provide it to the commercial solvers as a warm start i e initial solution to possibly reduce the computational time for the bottom endpoint we propose as a reasonable solution to disregard both problems 7 and 8 completely this is because the bottom endpoint identifies the point representing minimum total risk the minimum possible value for the risk that can be obtained by divesting all parcels that are already under protection is zero in this case the total return will be also zero hence we can set z 1 b z 2 b 0 0 if the divestment option is not available then z 1 b z 2 b would correspond to the status quo scenario for the reserve design finally we observe that the objective function of problem 9 is a multiplication between a linear function and a quadratic function to solve this problem using commercial solvers we transform problem 9 to a binary quadratically constrained quadratic program bqcqp to do so we first observe that problem 9 is equivalent to the following problem max ω 0 x y f ω subject to ω z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 n z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n where ω is a dummy non negative variable capturing the value of the square root of the objective function of problem 9 in an optimal solution this formulation is equivalent to the following max ω 0 r 0 x y f ω subject to ω z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 n r r z 2 x y z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n the latter transformation is similar to that defined in problem 10 in other words r is a dummy non negative variable for capturing the value of the risk in an optimal solution finally we observe that this is also equivalent to the following formulation 11 max ω 0 ω 1 0 ω 2 0 r 0 x y f ω subject to ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 r z 2 x y ω 1 z 1 x y z 1 n ω 2 z 2 n r z 1 x y z 1 n z 2 x y z 2 n where ω1 and ω2 are dummy non negative variables to capture the value of z 1 x y z 1 n and z 2 n r respectively all constraints in problem 11 are either linear or quadratic and therefore this formulation is a bqcqp and can be solved using commercial solvers finally the main motivations for developing our proposed algorithm also discussed in section 2 3 was to find an acceptable solution for problems with many parcels i e high dimensionality problems indeed computing the exact pareto optimal frontier of the mpt scp may not be practical because of the curse of dimensionality and computational limitations for management problems with large number of parcels a possible alternative to our method is to use an iterative and interactive process that would also avoid computing the entire pareto optimal frontier this would imply that we compute a pareto optimal solution i e a single point and then ask decision makers to identify whether they are satisfied with the solution if they are not satisfied then we would compute a second pareto optimal solution by adjusting our search and then ask decision makers for their opinions again this process can be repeated until we end up identifying a desirable pareto optimal solution while this alternative approach may be possible in some cases it may still be impractical for mpt scp problems with many parcels because even computing a single pareto optimal solution may be computationally infeasible with current computer technology dujardin and chadès 2018 in other words after adjusting the search with this interactive process we may fail to find another pareto optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time the main advantage of our approach is that it attempts to find a near pareto optimal solution directly by borrowing ideas from the field of game theory although our approach does not require an iterative feedback from decision makers it can be adapted to be more interactive approach if desired this can be done by changing the reference point in our study we have set the reference to the nadir point because that seems to be a natural choice however users can adjust the search by choosing a different reference point in consultation with decision makers and that can result in finding a different pareto optimal solution the second advantage of our approach is that it is not as time consuming for managers natural resource managers are often too busy to be deeply involved with complex elicitation and analyses therefore implementing an approach that is less demanding may be appealing in many cases 3 2 numerical example we now present a simplified numerical example to demonstrate the functioning and performance of the nash bargaining solution for a predefined set of land parcels in this example there exists a total of 50 parcels of which only 15 are currently under protection i e s 15 and the remaining ones can be considered for investment i e b 35 we associated a randomly generated return variance and size area to each parcel additionally we generated a correlation matrix for the parcel set randomly attributing a correlation value between 1 and 1 for the return and variance of each parcel pair interested readers may refer to appendix c to see the data simulated for this numerical example including correlation between pairs of parcels return and variance of each parcel the initial state of each parcel and the size of each parcel for this example the initial status of the protected area produces a total return of 16 81 and a total risk of 0 04 fig 6 we consider two scenarios to illustrate the performance of our proposed approach the first scenario imposes no constraint on the feasible set i e f 0 1 50 while the second scenario limits the feasible set by imposing a budget constraint of the form in eq 4 we will use the size of parcels to define the budget constraint in the second scenario specifically in eq 4 αj and βj represent the ratio of the size of parcel j to the total size of unprotected land at the initial state for example because the total size of unprotected land at the initial state is 2547 79 and the size of parcel 1 unprotected is 453 63 based on appendix c we have that α 1 0 178 similarly because the size of parcel 10 protected is 58 99 we have that β 10 0 023 finally for defining the constraint we also set the available budget to 0 1 i e γ 0 1 in this example we first implement the proposed nash bargaining solution approach for the first scenario unconstrained budget in which the identified solution provides the total return of 26 44 while the total risk is reduced to 0 002 fig 7 in this scenario a ratio of 0 839 indicates the total amount of land added to the reserve as a proportion of the area of unprotected land at the initial state intuitively one can think of this ratio as the value of the mathematical expression on the left hand side of eq 4 the ratio is 0 839 for the nash bargaining solution of the first scenario this implies that although parcel 10 is divested in the solution the total size of land added to the reserve is 83 9 of the total area of unprotected land at the initial state quantifying the magnitude of improvement by comparing the nash bargaining solution with the initial conservation state we observe that the nash bargaining solution significantly outperforms the initial state with a 57 9 increase in return and a 95 reduction in associated risk fig 8 results from the second scenario i e the budget constrained scenario demonstrate a nash bargaining solution with the total return of 26 55 and the total risk of 0 003 fig 9 the ratio of newly protected to available land is 0 0996 for this solution which conforms to our constraint of γ 0 1 this implies that the total size of land added to the reserve is 9 96 of the total size of the unprotected land at the initial state an interesting behavior noted in this numerical example is that the nash bargaining solution generated by the budget constrained scenario produced a larger return than the unconstrained model this is possible because the disagreement point for each model might be unique and because the risk generated by the constrained solution is larger than in the unconstrained scenario 4 computational study in this section we conduct a comprehensive computational study to show the performance of our proposed nash bargaining solution approach for mpt scp problems we use the c programming language to implement the proposed approach and employ three different solvers including cplex 12 7 gurobi 8 1 and fico xpress 8 5 to solve the optimization problems all computational experiments are carried out on a dell poweredge r630 with two intel xeon e5 2650 2 2 ghz 12 core processors 30mb 128gb ram and the redhat enterprise linux 7 0 operating system we allow optimization solvers to use up to 10 threads when solving each optimization problem also we impose a time limit of 8 h for each experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we randomly generate five classes of instances that are different only in terms of the number of parcels under consideration specifically our instances have 50 or 100 or 200 or 400 or 800 parcels for each class we randomly generate 5 instances so in total we have 25 instances we run each instance under 5 different scenarios the scenarios are generated using the procedure explained in section 3 2 specifically the first scenario is unconstrained and scenarios 2 5 include a budget constraint based on the size of parcels the difference between scenarios 2 5 is only on the value of γ see eq 4 specifically γ is set to 0 1 0 2 0 35 and 0 5 for scenarios 2 5 respectively our instances are randomly generated based on the volcano data set which is an elevation model in r programming language that consists of the topographic information for the volcano maunga whau mt eden in new zealand available at https www rdocumentation org packages datasets versions 3 6 1 topics volcano rather than assume a species follows a uniform distribution completely we simulate a spatially heterogeneous species distribution that mimics a population responding to natural variation in nature e g elevation the return is computed by using the parcel sizes from the data extracted using the volcano function and using monte carlo simulations to generate scenarios for species distribution the risk is computed using the variance and correlation of the data the details of the r code used to generate the random instances are available in appendix d in order to explore the overall performance of our approach we report the following pieces of information obj value ratio the ratio of the objective value of the solution obtained by each commercial optimization solver for problem 11 to the objective value of the best solution obtained among the solvers i e cplex gurobi and xpress hence larger values are better and ideally should be equal to one optimality gap since we impose a time limit for our experiments it is possible that optimization solvers do not find an optimal solution within the time limit however they can determine how far is the obtained solution and a possible optimal solution in terms of the objective value such distance is called the optimality gap and ideally it should be zero for example an optimality gap of 10 for a given solver shows that the objective value of problem 11 for the solution obtained by the solver is guaranteed not to be 10 smaller worse than its optimal objective value time seconds this is the actual solution time in seconds for an optimization solver to solve an instance note that although we are imposing a time limit of 8 h 28 800 some instances can be solved in a shorter period of time the results for the performance of our approach over the smallest class of instances i e instances with a landscape of 50 parcels are shown in table 1 the numbers are averages over five instances in all the tables in this section the best values are highlighted in bold in the tables whenever appropriate we observe from table 1 that cplex outperforms the other solvers all instances with 50 parcels are solved to optimality in approximately one second by cplex both gurobi and xpress performed poorly and could not solve many of the instances to optimality within the time limit this is highlighted by the fact that the average optimality gap of gurobi and xpress are 1 53 and 0 04 respectively moreover there is an increasing tendency in the solution time of gurobi and xpress as the budget available i e λ increases unfortunately for classes of instances with more than 50 parcels we were unable to obtain any solution using xpress because of the way that the solver handles the computer memory we observed a similar issue when using gurobi but only for classes of instances with more than 100 parcels thus for the second classes of instances 100 parcels we only report the results of cplex and gurobi table 2 again we observe that cplex was able to solve all instances to optimality in less than 10 s gurobi was not able to solve many instances to optimality and determined an average optimality gap of 15 76 finally our results for the remaining classes of instances can be found in table 3 as mentioned earlier both gurobi and xpress were not able to solve such instances and hence their results are not reported we again observe that cplex performed very well for class of instances with 200 parcels the solver was able to find optimal solutions within a few seconds for classes of instances with 400 and 800 parcels it was not able to solve many instances to optimality but for even such large instances the solution was near optimal with an optimality gap of less than 0 2 5 discussion our study focused on the application of mathematical optimization to address risk management for scp problems involving various forms of uncertainty typically mathematical optimization involves two challenging phases the first being model development and the second a solution method the first phase specifying the mathematical optimization model consists of several steps such as defining constraints objective functions and relevant parameters the second phase involves solving the proposed model and deriving a desirable and feasible solution that can be implemented in practice for the first phase we formulated the scp problem as an mpt scp problem as proposed by eaton et al 2019 which addressed conflicting objective functions of maximizing return and minimizing risk we introduced the generic mathematical model of an mpt scp problem and some typical constraints faced by decision makers that should be customized for any particular application e g modelers would elicit from decision makers objective functions and constraints to be included in the model following model development we proposed a novel exact solution method which is the main contribution of this paper an mpt scp problem is a bi objective optimization problem for which there are two common solution approaches 1 generating the entire pareto optimal frontier first and presenting the solution set to the decision makers for finding a desirable solution or 2 generating the pareto optimal solutions one by one iteratively obtaining feedback from the decision makers on each solution and adjusting the search accordingly until reaching a desirable solution while both of these methods are reasonable none of them can be applied to solve large mpt scp problems that is because computing even a single exact pareto optimal solution for problems with large number of parcels may not be computationally feasible therefore we proposed an alternative solution method for high dimensional problems whereby we directly compute a benchmark pareto optimal solution that can be used to impartially balance between conflicting objectives such a solution minimizes the choices presented to decision makers thus reducing problem complexity or represents a useful starting point for decision makers to begin negotiations our approach is based on the concept of nash bargaining solution first presented by eaton et al 2019 for scp problems and expands on this original study in several important ways first it greatly reduces computational time by overcoming the need to compute the entire pareto optimal frontier second it can solve large optimization problems by simply implementing three smaller optimization problems that are either binary linear programs or bqcqps third we have defined the problem in such a way that it can be solved using existing commercial solvers which should make the implementation of these algorithms more accessible to users who are not experienced in developing optimization algorithms through an extensive computational study we show that our approach implemented using cplex gurobi and xpress commercial solvers can solve problems of up to 800 parcels to approximate optimality in a reasonable time 8 h surpassing the study size constraints demonstrated in previous studies eaton et al 2019 thus our extension should considerably increase the applicability of spatial optimization algorithms that consider multi objective problems specifically we showed that among the commercial solvers cplex aligns significantly better with our approach the numerical results showed that cplex can solve instances with 200 parcels to optimality in a few seconds and can find almost optimal solutions for instances with as many as 800 parcels within 8 h this is a considerable improvement over the approach used in eaton et al 2019 which was limited to 50 parcels under similar computing conditions this advancement can considerably expand our ability to analyze large problems for conservation and resource management applications our approach has the potential to account for important sources of uncertainty such as structural or environmental for example it is possible to account for the uncertainty associated with alternative climate change projections e g uncertain sea level rise scenarios as described in eaton et al 2019 but also alternative underlying models describing the relationship between species abundance and environmental covariates e g elevation precipitation using the nash bargaining solution implicitly addresses the tradeoff between risk and return although some managers may appreciate the opportunity to visualize and evaluate alternatives by inspecting several options along the pareto optimal boundary this process can be time consuming or cognitively difficult in many instances natural resource managers have very limited time to examine and evaluate alternative solutions in such cases the nash bargaining solution may be particularly appealing given that it provides a reasonable tradeoff between risk and return nevertheless our approach can be adapted to more explicitly account for the risk attitude of decision makers this would involve a more interactive approach in which multiple pareto optimal solutions would be evaluated another benefit of the nash bargaining solution is that it alleviates the need for assigning weights to competing objectives assigning weights to competing objectives for multi objective optimization can lead to sub optimal results with respect to fairness an issue that has not been fully addressed in the scp literature for example this shortcoming has been overlooked with regards to one of the most widely used software applications for scp the integer linear programming formulations of the objective function in marxan e g beyer et al 2016 which combines multiple habitat objectives with a reserve connectivity objective in a single weighted objective function yet as showed in boland et al 2015 this approach can lead to spurious results we have demonstrated the approach that we have proposed eliminates this issue at least for two competing objectives we formulate the nash bargaining solution to avoid the need to select fair weights for the objective functions an additional feature of the current approach that was not considered by eaton et al 2019 is the ability to compute an optimality gap to evaluate the quality of the proposed solution because we used a mathematical programming formulation we can quantify a metric of under performance relative to a possible optimal solution here we have primarily focused on examples related to the scp and site selection problems we can extend the current framework to one that considers other spatial considerations such as reserve connectivity see appendix a nevertheless the approach that we have developed is applicable to many other ecological problems we could for instance apply it to the case of treatment of invasive species choosing treatment options at each site monitoring rare or endangered species where to sample protection decisions establishment of speed zones allocation of law enforcement activities to reduce poaching or optimal allocation of wind farms other allocation problems may not necessarily involve a spatial component the allocation problem may be to allocate budgets to competing packages of actions portfolio of actions or even a mix of actions that involve spatial and non spatial decisions competing objectives uncertainty and correlated risks and returns are common in conservation planning problems and this framework provides an integrated approach to addressing these issues and solving these problems credit authorship contribution statement alvaro sierra altamiranda

a neighboring constraints for each parcel j let xj be a binary decision variable indicating whether a parcel should be selected x j 1 or not x j 0 based on this definition a common constraint when formulating scp problems is that a given parcel i can be selected only if parcel j is selected to enforce this one can implement the following constraint 12 x i x j 0 in contrast if the desired result is to protect at most one of the parcels i and j then the following constraint must be added 13 x i x j 1 let c be the set of parcels neighboring a given parcel j then one can define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if at least one of its neighbors is also selected 14 i c x i x j 0 one can also define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if all of its neighbors are also selected 15 i c x i c x j 0 now let n c be an integer number then one can define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if at least n neighbors are also selected 16 i c x i n x j 0 one can also define the following constraint to ensure that parcel j can be selected only if at most n neighbors are also selected 17 i c x i

this appendix we summarize the procedure described in eaton et al 2019 to compute risk and return functions for a scp problem under uncertainty assume that each parcel in and out of the reserve is described by different characteristics such as habitat type under different sea level rise scenarios the steps for obtaining the return and risk functions are as follows 1 collect data from the potential reserve the data must indicate each parcel and its habitat composition types habitat conditions are described as a function of climate change and sea level rise projections 2 extract from the data collected the basic unit of data dhjk that represents the area ha of habitat type h in parcel j under sea level rise scenario k all the values of dhjk are normalized per parcel j using feature scaling obtaining nhjk 3 compute mjk a weighted sum per habitat type using habitat objective criteria weights wh defined by the decision maker i e m j k h w h n h j k 4 define an urbanization development probability per parcel uj augment mjk proportionally to the development probability to obtain ljk i e l j k m j k 1 u j 5 scale the value of ljk by the cost cj of each parcel to obtain the expected return rjk of parcel j under sea level rise scenario k i e r j k l j k c j 6 use the sea level rise probabilities pk to estimate the expected return μj of parcel j i e μ j k p k r j k 7 the return function is the sum of all μj of the parcels that are in the reserve 8 the variance for each parcel and the correlation coefficient between each pair of parcels is computed using rjk and pk 9 the risk function then is the portfolio return variance our new approach allows us to tackle scp problems with many more parcels than eaton et al 2019 appendix c data for the example in this appendix

24879,the standard dynamic energy budget deb model is widely used to describe the physiology of individual animals here we parametrized the deb model for the lesser black backed gull larus fuscus mainly on the basis of literature data next we performed an inverse modeling approach to predict the food intake rate of gull chicks model input on the basis of their growth trajectory from hatching to fledging model output food intake rate and growth were also measured for this period in an aviary experiment where three different diet treatments resulted in a large range in overall intake rate these measured food intake rate data were not used in the parameter estimation procedure but rather to validate model results model predictions of food intake rate were systematically only about 10 below the observations but predictions and observations correlated strongly the deb model might be used to predict food provisioning rates in the field which are difficult to obtain on the basis of growth data which are much easier to get keywords dynamic energy budget deb theory fledgling food demands nutritional stress larus fuscus 1 introduction in vertebrate species with parental food provisioning post natal growth of the young strongly depends upon the amount of food that the parents are able to deliver if food availability or parental effort is insufficient the newborns may show reduced growth rates and even starve to death with negative effects on the population renewal rate for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of such populations in relation to the abundance of their prey one therefore needs to know both the link between food availability and provisioning rate and the link between food intake rate and growth rate of the young measuring the provisioning or intake rate in the field is however a laborious and costly exercise here we examine whether the dynamic energy budget deb model is capable of predicting the food intake rate of the young on the basis of their growth trajectory one might call this an inverse modeling exercise as the model input food intake rate is predicted from the model output growth rate the dynamic energy budget deb theory developed by kooijman 2010 is the most comprehensive theory that links the food environment to the major physiological processes of individual organisms such as feeding growth and reproduction the inclusion of reserves acting as metabolic memory the full life cycle of individuals embryo juvenile adult and the explicit use of conservation laws energy chemical elements and isotopes sets the deb theory apart from other approaches the standard deb model can already be parametrized for a particular species on the basis of a very restricted data set a set of data that contains only eight so called zero variate data and one so called uni variate data set already suffices for estimating the 8 most important deb parameters lika et al 2014 a feasible zero variate data set might include for example age at birth age at first reproduction lifespan weight at birth weight at first reproduction maximum weight maximum length and maximum reproduction rate weight at age data is an example of a useful univariate data set over the last few years a wealth of published see for example marques et al 2018 van der meer et al 2014 and references therein and unpublished compiled at https www bio vu nl thb deb parameter estimations of the deb model were done for a rapidly growing number of species this collection of species which comes under the name of the add my pet collection has presently about 2500 entries including over 400 different bird species deb theory provides an integrated look at whole organism energetics and it is therefore possible to predict specific process rates without ever having measured these rates this sets this mechanistic and theory based modeling approach apart from a statistical approach e g by fitting allometric relationships which is still prevalent in most ecological research one previous example of the strength of the deb approach is the case of the atlantic hagfish myxine glutinosa a species that has no otoliths which makes aging them impossible it furthermore tends to behave abnormally in captivity as it for example refuses to eat and growth and reproduction rates can not be obtained in the laboratory either data on oxygen consumption versus weight were however available and this allowed the estimation of growth rates and age at maturity by using deb modeling van der meer and kooijman 2014 a major though inevitable shortcoming of the exercise was that the predictions could not be tested as true data on hagfish growth rates were not available other examples of deb predictions are food intake reconstructions on the basis of growth trajectories for emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri kooijman 1993 and for various bivalve and fish species cardoso et al 2006 freitas et al 2009 jusup et al 2014 kooijman 1993 lavaud et al 2019 pecquerie et al 2012 troost et al 2010 most of these studies suffered from the same shortcoming that food intake predictions could not be tested with the exception of jusup et al 2014 who were able to correlate predicted and measured annual food intake for captive bluefin tuna here we present another food intake reconstruction study in which deb predictions are tested for this we use data of an aviary experiment where food intake rate of lesser black backed gull larus fuscus chicks was manipulated and precisely measured for almost the entire growth period of the chicks additionally the growth response was measured we first estimate the parameters of the standard deb model for the lesser black backed gull using a limited data set mainly gathered from the open literature next we apply an inverse modeling approach to predict the food intake rate over the entire growth period for all experimental chicks on the basis of their observed growth patterns mass versus age hence we do not use any feeding data in fitting the deb model parameters finally we compare model predictions to true measurements of food intake as measuring growth of bird chicks in the field is much easier than measuring food intake rate during the entire growth period the inverse modeling approach as applied here is of practical use for field ornithologists to predict the required overall food intake for obtaining a specific fledging weight 2 deb modelling below we will give a very short introduction to the standard deb model for the individual organism a more extensive introduction is given in the appendix but we refer the reader also to kooijman 2010 for a detailed description of underlying deb assumptions and derivations or to van der meer 2006 2016 2019 who provides easier accessible introductions the model organism has three succeeding life stages the embryo which neither feeds nor reproduces the juvenile which feeds but does not reproduce and the adult which feeds and reproduces the organism is described by three state variables 1 structural body volume 2 reserve density which is the amount of reserves per unit of structural body volume and 3 maturity which is the cumulative energy allocated to development embryos and juveniles develop i e build up maturity transitions between embryo and juvenile and between juvenile and adult occur at fixed levels of maturity once the animal has become adult it has reached its maximum maturity and starts to reproduce the present application focuses on changes in the structural body volume and reserve density of the juvenile stage the standard deb model can be entirely re written in a dimensionless form meaning that all state variables and time are scaled by some quantity that has the same physical dimension as the original variable for example structural body length the cubic root of structural body volume is scaled by maximum body length such scaling has the advantage that the equations look much simpler and the dynamical behavior of the system of coupled differential equations can be more easily studied without any loss of generality the dynamics of the scaled reserve density e in scaled time τ are given by 1 d e d τ f e l where f is the so called scaled functional response that relates the assimilation rate to the food density and takes a value between zero no food and one ad libitum note that food density is the only environmental variable the variable l stands for scaled length growth is given by the differential equation for scaled length 2 d l d τ 1 e g e l 3 where the compound parameter g is called the energy investment ratio it stands for the energetic costs of new structural volume relative to the maximum energy within the reserves that is available for growth and maintenance see the appendix for further details about the scaling procedure 3 parameter estimation the deb parameter estimation procedure starts with 8 so called zero variate data points and 6 pseudo data points table 1 these pseudo data are in fact standard values for a selection of deb parameters and these values are taken from kooijman 2010 table 8 1 there are theoretical reasons to expect that the values of these parameters are invariant among species kooijman 2010 the pseudo data are used in the fitting procedure to avoid non convergence problems and resemble the use of priors in bayesian analysis the procedure further uses one so called univariate data set i e body weight obtained at a various ages zero variate data on length and mass at birth and at first reproduction on maximum reproductive rate and on maximum length and mass are all taken from published or unpublished work by camphuysen see table 2 for references the assumed maximum age of 34 years and 10 months is based on the euring list of longevity records for european birds fransson et al 2017 maximum age only affects the estimate for the weibull aging acceleration parameter h a whose value is irrelevant for the present exercise hence the precise maximum age value does not matter here the univariate data on wet weight versus age are the only data that were taken from the aviary experiment see below for each day the maximum observed wet weight was taken the standard deb model provides predictions for all data we do not repeat the relevant equations that have been used to provide these predictions but refer the reader to kooijman 2010 detailed references to the equations are given in table 1 for completeness several conversion coefficients should be mentioned here wet mass volume 1 g per cm3 dry mass volume 0 28 g per cm3 energy per c mole in the reserves 550 kj per c mole kooijman 2010 and dry mass 23 9 g per c mole kooijman 2010 combined these coefficients reveal an energy content within the reserves of 3 9 kj per gram wet mass deb model parameters are estimated according to a procedure described by lika et al 2011 and marques et al 2018 not all parameters were estimable and we have chosen to set the estimates for a few parameters at predefined values table 3 taken from table 8 1 from kooijman 2010 the goodness of fit function that is minimized in the procedure by lika et al 2011 is a weighted sum of squares apart from the symmetric mean squared error smse the mean relative error mre is also reported see lika et al 2011 and marques et al 2018 for details we have chosen to put more emphasis on the univariate data and on data on maximum weight and maximum feeding rate the deb model routines and the parameter estimation routine are part of the software packages debtool and add my pet and can be downloaded from the theoretical biology website of the vu university amsterdam https www bio vu nl thb deb 4 aviary experiment data from a previously published aviary experiment are used gupta et al 2016 forty eggs of lesser black backed gull were collected from the wild in 2015 and taken to the wildlife rescue centre in oostende belgium the eggs were incubated and after hatching randomly assigned to one of four diet treatment groups here we use data from three treatments the first is called terrestrial and contains 80 terrestrial food plus 20 marine food it was called s1 in gupta et al 2016 the second is called marine previously named s2 and contains 20 terrestrial plus 80 marine food the last one is called mixed and contains 50 of both types of food this treatment was not discussed in gupta et al 2016 all marine consisting of cod gadus morhua mackerel scomber scombrus and whiting merlangius merlangus and terrestrial food items mealworm larva tenebrio molitor potato crisp and broiler chicken gallus gallus domesticus were homogenised mixed and embedded in gelatine to avoid selective feeding gelatine contributed 20 of total pellet dry weight food pellets were offered in an unrestricted amount and food taken was measured on a daily basis the total time until fledging was split up in periods of 3 5 days length and weight measurements were done at the end of each period for further details we refer to gupta et al 2016 5 inverse modeling the standard deb model was simulated for each bird separately the initial value of scaled structural length for the first observational period was derived from the observed physical length initial scaled reserve density for this first period was set to 1 which means that unscaled reserved density is equal to the maximum reserve density i e to the ratio p a m v the model was subsequently run for a series of scaled functional response f values the f value that exactly predicted the observed physical length at the end of each observation period was selected a quadratic function between f and physical length was used for interpolation the predicted physical length and reserve density at the end of the period were used as initial values for the next observation period this way the length predictions exactly followed the observations 6 results the aviary experiment showed that food intake rates in terms of energy per time were highest for those birds feeding on terrestrial food and lowest for those that were restricted to marine food fig 1 a similar difference was observed in the growth trajectories fig 2 the mixed diet took an intermediate position in both food intake and growth rates parameter estimation resulted in a fit with a symmetric mean squared error smse of 0 141 and a mean relative error mre of 0 066 compared to other species these goodness of fit measures pointed to a good fit see the add my pet website https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet about html for an overview all predictions for zero variate data were close to observations except for time since birth at first brood table 2 observed time at first brood is three years 1095 days but the prediction equaled only 562 days this discrepancy is usually observed for birds where the actual age of first breeding seems to be merely determined by behavioral constraints and not so much by physiological ones the fitted growth trajectory making the assumption that the scaled functional response equaled 1 for the entire growth period initially overestimated the mass of the birds fig 2 this observation is also in line with that for other bird species the parameter estimates table 3 also agree with those for other bird species teixeira 2016 the inverse modeling also pointed to a lower intake rate during the first few periods than the maximum achievable even for the terrestrial treatment after these initial periods the scaled functional response varied around 1 for the terrestrial treatment slightly lower for the mixed and around 0 7 for the marine treatment fig 3 fig 4 shows as an example the results of the inverse modeling for one haphazardly chosen bird that obtained a mixed diet the growth curve fits of course exactly through the data as the scaled functional response f is fitted for each period separately fig 4 upper panel the predicted daily food intake followed the observations remarkably well fig 4 middle panel the scaled reserve density follows the scaled functional response with some delay fig 4 lower panel plots for other birds are not shown but revealed similar goodness of fits overall the measured food intake was about 10 higher than the predicted intake fig 5 7 discussion a major goal in ecology is to understand how fitness related performance of organisms responds to the environment the availability of food is without doubt one of the most crucial environmental variables it is therefore not surprising that numerous studies have been performed though mainly in the laboratory to determine the functional response that relates food availability to food intake rate and to estimate the parameters of the appropriate type of functional response model jeschke et al 2002 much less attention has however been paid to study the next step that is the relation between food intake rate and fitness related characteristics such as growth rate reproduction rate and survival a likely reason for this discrepancy in research attention is that functional response experiments can be performed over relatively short time periods i e for most species trials of minutes to hours will suffice whereas studies of the link between food intake rate and growth or reproduction ideally last for the entire growth or reproductive period which may take weeks to years measuring food intake is as already said a laborious and costly exercise particularly in the field it is therefore encouraging that the modeling approach based on deb theory as presented here enables a rather accurate prediction of food intake rate of the chicks on the basis of their growth trajectory or simply on basis of their mass 30 days after hatching fig 6 this enables ornithologists to study the functional response i e the link between food availability and food gathering rate in the field in probably the most important period of the year that is in the chick raising period provisioning rate or at least intake rate of the chicks can now directly be derived from the growth trajectory of the chicks which is much easier to obtain of course feeding rate of the adults themselves has to be added to obtain the total food gathering rate adult feeding rate can be obtained in a similar fashion if changes in adult weight are available these weights will probably only vary to a minor extent implying that adult feeding rate is more or less constant in our experiment differences in food intake rate and thus in scaled functional response were not directly related to differences in density of the same type of food but to differences in food quality one might question why those birds fed with a marine diet that apparently has low energy density simply do not eat more it could be that they are already at the limit of total mass intake rate van gils et al 2005 apart from predicting the intake rate required for obtaining a specific fledging weight the deb model keeps track of all energy fluxes the huge difference in weight increase as a result of a much smaller difference in food availability f 1 versus f 0 7 is not just the result of the difference in structural size but also to a great extent of the difference in reserves table 4 note that the build up of the reserves is given by the integrated assimilation minus the integrated mobilization and thus equals 1801 kj and 431 kj for the two example feeding levels this difference is relatively larger than that in structural growth 2329 kj versus 817 kj our food intake predictions were systematically about 10 below the observations we refrained from using these food intake data in the parameter estimation procedure but when we would have done that it would have resulted in an almost perfect fit lowering the assimilation efficiency which was set at 80 would as well have yielded such perfection a slightly lower efficiency of 75 has indeed been observed in birds castro et al 1989 the slow initial growth observed might also be related to a low initial assimilation rate similar to a lowered digestive performance after diet switching hilton et al 2000 it may be that the newly hatched chick needs a few days to get adapted to feeding itself chicks are initially poorly able to keep themselves warm which may have added thermoregulation costs but probably this played no role as the chicks were under a heat lamp during the first three days generally speaking the problem of overfitting too many parameters too few data types is always a serious one particularly in such complex parameter estimation procedures as the add my pet procedure for deb models testing the predictions of a parametrized model on an independent data set as was done here is therefore of utmost importance in modeling we strongly encourage such tests for deb models as a next step it might be rewarding to repeat our exercise for a variety of bird species for which data on intake rate during the chick raising phase are

marine institute vliz provided the infrastructure for the aviary experiment appendix a this appendix provides further details and derivations for the standard deb model the model has three state variables structural body volume v reserve density e e v which is the amount of reserves per unit of structural body volume and maturity eh which is the cumulative energy allocated to development the most important environmental variable is the food density x table 5 a list of assumptions give rise to a set of coupled ordinary differential equation for the three state variables assumptions for the standard deb model are among other things that 1 assimilation rate is proportional to the surface area of the structural body p a p a m f v 2 3 2 all assimilated energy enters the reserves and is then mobilized from the reserves the rate of changes of the reserves is thus the difference between the assimilation rate and the mobilization rate 3 a fixed fraction κ of the mobilization rate is spent on maintenance which is assumed proportional to structural body volume and on growth assuming fixed costs for growth per unit volume 4 the rate of change of maturity equals 1 κ times the mobilization rate minus the maturity maintenance costs which are proportional to maturity the ordinary differential equation for reserve density is 3 d e d t v 1 3 p a m f v e the area specific assimilation rate p a m and the energy conductance v are so called primary parameters of the standard deb model they are explained together with quite a few others such as f m and κx in table 6 f is the so called scaled functional response that relates the assimilation rate to the food density and is given by f x p a m f m μ x κ x x and μx is the chemical potential of the food the growth equation is given by 4 d v d

so called κ rule and the product rule for differentiation eq 5 can be re written as v d e d t e d v d t p a m f v 2 3 1 κ p m v 1 κ e g d v d t combining with eq 3 and some re arranging yields the

the system of differential equations for reserve density eq 3 structural volume eq 4 and maturity eq 6 describe the standard deb model the standard deb model can be entirely re written in a dimensionless form in order to arrive at a dimensionless model one has to re scale all dimensions that is energy length or volume and time the choice of scaling coefficients is rather arbitrary as we will see yet for energy an obvious choice is the maximum amount of energy in reserve em and for volume it is the maximum volume of the structural body v m κ p a m p m 3 the maximum amount of energy in reserve equals the product of the maximum reserve density and the maximum volume e m e m v m where e m p a m v as follows from eqn 3 with f 1 these choices ensure that the new dimensionless state variables which are scaled reserve density e e em and scaled length l v vm 1 3 are easy to interpret and to remember the same holds for scaled maturity eh eh em the choice of a scaling coefficient for time is less obvious but it helps to first look at power which is given in energy per time one option is to scale power by the maximum assimilation rate which equals p a m p a m v m 2 3 this choice implies that time is scaled to κ times the ratio of the maximum reserve density and the volume specific maintenance rate resulting in τ t p m κ e m not just the state variables but all parameters table 7 and model equations can now be re scaled eq 3 which describes the dynamics of the reserve density turns into 7 d e d τ d e d t 1 e m κ e m p m f e l similarly the growth eq 4 becomes 8 d l 3 d

to fledging model output food intake rate and growth were also measured for this period in an aviary experiment where three different diet treatments resulted in a large range in overall intake rate these measured food intake rate data were not used in the parameter estimation procedure but rather to validate model results model predictions of food intake rate were systematically only about 10 below the observations but predictions and observations correlated strongly the deb model might be used to predict food provisioning rates in the field which are difficult to obtain on the basis of growth data which are much easier to get keywords dynamic energy budget deb theory fledgling food demands nutritional stress larus fuscus 1 introduction in vertebrate species with parental food provisioning post natal growth of the young strongly depends upon the amount of food that the parents are able to deliver if food availability or parental effort is insufficient the newborns may show reduced growth rates and even starve to death with negative effects on the population renewal rate for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of such populations in relation to the abundance of their prey one therefore needs to know both the link between food availability and provisioning rate and the link between food intake rate and growth rate of the young measuring the provisioning or intake rate in the field is however a laborious and costly exercise here we examine whether the dynamic energy budget deb model is capable of predicting the food intake rate of the young on the basis of their growth trajectory one might call this an inverse modeling exercise as the model input food intake rate is predicted from the model output growth rate the dynamic energy budget deb theory developed by kooijman 2010 is the most comprehensive theory that links the food environment to the major physiological processes of individual organisms such as feeding growth and reproduction the inclusion of reserves acting as metabolic memory the full life cycle of individuals embryo juvenile adult and the explicit use of conservation laws energy chemical elements and isotopes sets the deb theory apart from other approaches the standard deb model can already be parametrized for a particular species on the basis of a very restricted data set a set of data that contains only eight so called zero variate data and one so called uni variate data set already suffices for estimating the 8 most important deb parameters lika et al 2014 a feasible zero variate data set might include for example age at birth age at first reproduction lifespan weight at birth weight at first reproduction maximum weight maximum length and maximum reproduction rate weight at age data is an example of a useful univariate data set over the last few years a wealth of published see for example marques et al 2018 van der meer et al 2014 and references therein and unpublished compiled at https www bio vu nl thb deb parameter estimations of the deb model were done for a rapidly growing number of species this collection of species which comes under the name of the add my pet collection has presently about 2500 entries including over 400 different bird species deb theory provides an integrated look at whole organism energetics and it is therefore possible to predict specific process rates without ever having measured these rates this sets this mechanistic and theory based modeling approach apart from a statistical approach e g by fitting allometric relationships which is still prevalent in most ecological research one previous example of the strength of the deb approach is the case of the atlantic hagfish myxine glutinosa a species that has no otoliths which makes aging them impossible it furthermore tends to behave abnormally in captivity as it for example refuses to eat and growth and reproduction rates can not be obtained in the laboratory either data on oxygen consumption versus weight were however available and this allowed the estimation of growth rates and age at maturity by using deb modeling van der meer and kooijman 2014 a major though inevitable shortcoming of the exercise was that the predictions could not be tested as true data on hagfish growth rates were not available other examples of deb predictions are food intake reconstructions on the basis of growth trajectories for emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri kooijman 1993 and for various bivalve and fish species cardoso et al 2006 freitas et al 2009 jusup et al 2014 kooijman 1993 lavaud et al 2019 pecquerie et al 2012 troost et al 2010 most of these studies suffered from the same shortcoming that food intake predictions could not be tested with the exception of jusup et al 2014 who were able to correlate predicted and measured annual food intake for captive bluefin tuna here we present another food intake reconstruction study in which deb predictions are tested for this we use data of an aviary experiment where food intake rate of lesser black backed gull larus fuscus chicks was manipulated and precisely measured for almost the entire growth period of the chicks additionally the growth response was measured we first estimate the parameters of the standard deb model for the lesser black backed gull using a limited data set mainly gathered from the open literature next we apply an inverse modeling approach to predict the food intake rate over the entire growth period for all experimental chicks on the basis of their observed growth patterns mass versus age hence we do not use any feeding data in fitting the deb model parameters finally we compare model predictions to true measurements of food intake as measuring growth of bird chicks in the field is much easier than measuring food intake rate during the entire growth period the inverse modeling approach as applied here is of practical use for field ornithologists to predict the required overall food intake for obtaining a specific fledging weight 2 deb modelling below we will give a very short introduction to the standard deb model for the individual organism a more extensive introduction is given in the appendix but we refer the reader also to kooijman 2010 for a detailed description of underlying deb assumptions and derivations or to van der meer 2006 2016 2019 who provides easier accessible introductions the model organism has three succeeding life stages the embryo which neither feeds nor reproduces the juvenile which feeds but does not reproduce and the adult which feeds and reproduces the organism is described by three state variables 1 structural body volume 2 reserve density which is the amount of reserves per unit of structural body volume and 3 maturity which is the cumulative energy allocated to development embryos and juveniles develop i e build up maturity transitions between embryo and juvenile and between juvenile and adult occur at fixed levels of maturity once the animal has become adult it has reached its maximum maturity and starts to reproduce the present application focuses on changes in the structural body volume and reserve density of the juvenile stage the standard deb model can be entirely re written in a dimensionless form meaning that all state variables and time are scaled by some quantity that has the same physical dimension as the original variable for example structural body length the cubic root of structural body volume is scaled by maximum body length such scaling has the advantage that the equations look much simpler and the dynamical behavior of the system of coupled differential equations can be more easily studied without any loss of generality the dynamics of the scaled reserve density e in scaled time τ are given by 1 d e d τ f e l where f is the so called scaled functional response that relates the assimilation rate to the food density and takes a value between zero no food and one ad libitum note that food density is the only environmental variable the variable l stands for scaled length growth is given by the differential equation for scaled length 2 d l d τ 1 e g e l 3 where the compound parameter g is called the energy investment ratio it stands for the energetic costs of new structural volume relative to the maximum energy within the reserves that is available for growth and maintenance see the appendix for further details about the scaling procedure 3 parameter estimation the deb parameter estimation procedure starts with 8 so called zero variate data points and 6 pseudo data points table 1 these pseudo data are in fact standard values for a selection of deb parameters and these values are taken from kooijman 2010 table 8 1 there are theoretical reasons to expect that the values of these parameters are invariant among species kooijman 2010 the pseudo data are used in the fitting procedure to avoid non convergence problems and resemble the use of priors in bayesian analysis the procedure further uses one so called univariate data set i e body weight obtained at a various ages zero variate data on length and mass at birth and at first reproduction on maximum reproductive rate and on maximum length and mass are all taken from published or unpublished work by camphuysen see table 2 for references the assumed maximum age of 34 years and 10 months is based on the euring list of longevity records for european birds fransson et al 2017 maximum age only affects the estimate for the weibull aging acceleration parameter h a whose value is irrelevant for the present exercise hence the precise maximum age value does not matter here the univariate data on wet weight versus age are the only data that were taken from the aviary experiment see below for each day the maximum observed wet weight was taken the standard deb model provides predictions for all data we do not repeat the relevant equations that have been used to provide these predictions but refer the reader to kooijman 2010 detailed references to the equations are given in table 1 for completeness several conversion coefficients should be mentioned here wet mass volume 1 g per cm3 dry mass volume 0 28 g per cm3 energy per c mole in the reserves 550 kj per c mole kooijman 2010 and dry mass 23 9 g per c mole kooijman 2010 combined these coefficients reveal an energy content within the reserves of 3 9 kj per gram wet mass deb model parameters are estimated according to a procedure described by lika et al 2011 and marques et al 2018 not all parameters were estimable and we have chosen to set the estimates for a few parameters at predefined values table 3 taken from table 8 1 from kooijman 2010 the goodness of fit function that is minimized in the procedure by lika et al 2011 is a weighted sum of squares apart from the symmetric mean squared error smse the mean relative error mre is also reported see lika et al 2011 and marques et al 2018 for details we have chosen to put more emphasis on the univariate data and on data on maximum weight and maximum feeding rate the deb model routines and the parameter estimation routine are part of the software packages debtool and add my pet and can be downloaded from the theoretical biology website of the vu university amsterdam https www bio vu nl thb deb 4 aviary experiment data from a previously published aviary experiment are used gupta et al 2016 forty eggs of lesser black backed gull were collected from the wild in 2015 and taken to the wildlife rescue centre in oostende belgium the eggs were incubated and after hatching randomly assigned to one of four diet treatment groups here we use data from three treatments the first is called terrestrial and contains 80 terrestrial food plus 20 marine food it was called s1 in gupta et al 2016 the second is called marine previously named s2 and contains 20 terrestrial plus 80 marine food the last one is called mixed and contains 50 of both types of food this treatment was not discussed in gupta et al 2016 all marine consisting of cod gadus morhua mackerel scomber scombrus and whiting merlangius merlangus and terrestrial food items mealworm larva tenebrio molitor potato crisp and broiler chicken gallus gallus domesticus were homogenised mixed and embedded in gelatine to avoid selective feeding gelatine contributed 20 of total pellet dry weight food pellets were offered in an unrestricted amount and food taken was measured on a daily basis the total time until fledging was split up in periods of 3 5 days length and weight measurements were done at the end of each period for further details we refer to gupta et al 2016 5 inverse modeling the standard deb model was simulated for each bird separately the initial value of scaled structural length for the first observational period was derived from the observed physical length initial scaled reserve density for this first period was set to 1 which means that unscaled reserved density is equal to the maximum reserve density i e to the ratio p a m v the model was subsequently run for a series of scaled functional response f values the f value that exactly predicted the observed physical length at the end of each observation period was selected a quadratic function between f and physical length was used for interpolation the predicted physical length and reserve density at the end of the period were used as initial values for the next observation period this way the length predictions exactly followed the observations 6 results the aviary experiment showed that food intake rates in terms of energy per time were highest for those birds feeding on terrestrial food and lowest for those that were restricted to marine food fig 1 a similar difference was observed in the growth trajectories fig 2 the mixed diet took an intermediate position in both food intake and growth rates parameter estimation resulted in a fit with a symmetric mean squared error smse of 0 141 and a mean relative error mre of 0 066 compared to other species these goodness of fit measures pointed to a good fit see the add my pet website https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet about html for an overview all predictions for zero variate data were close to observations except for time since birth at first brood table 2 observed time at first brood is three years 1095 days but the prediction equaled only 562 days this discrepancy is usually observed for birds where the actual age of first breeding seems to be merely determined by behavioral constraints and not so much by physiological ones the fitted growth trajectory making the assumption that the scaled functional response equaled 1 for the entire growth period initially overestimated the mass of the birds fig 2 this observation is also in line with that for other bird species the parameter estimates table 3 also agree with those for other bird species teixeira 2016 the inverse modeling also pointed to a lower intake rate during the first few periods than the maximum achievable even for the terrestrial treatment after these initial periods the scaled functional response varied around 1 for the terrestrial treatment slightly lower for the mixed and around 0 7 for the marine treatment fig 3 fig 4 shows as an example the results of the inverse modeling for one haphazardly chosen bird that obtained a mixed diet the growth curve fits of course exactly through the data as the scaled functional response f is fitted for each period separately fig 4 upper panel the predicted daily food intake followed the observations remarkably well fig 4 middle panel the scaled reserve density follows the scaled functional response with some delay fig 4 lower panel plots for other birds are not shown but revealed similar goodness of fits overall the measured food intake was about 10 higher than the predicted intake fig 5 7 discussion a major goal in ecology is to understand how fitness related performance of organisms responds to the environment the availability of food is without doubt one of the most crucial environmental variables it is therefore not surprising that numerous studies have been performed though mainly in the laboratory to determine the functional response that relates food availability to food intake rate and to estimate the parameters of the appropriate type of functional response model jeschke et al 2002 much less attention has however been paid to study the next step that is the relation between food intake rate and fitness related characteristics such as growth rate reproduction rate and survival a likely reason for this discrepancy in research attention is that functional response experiments can be performed over relatively short time periods i e for most species trials of minutes to hours will suffice whereas studies of the link between food intake rate and growth or reproduction ideally last for the entire growth or reproductive period which may take weeks to years measuring food intake is as already said a laborious and costly exercise particularly in the field it is therefore encouraging that the modeling approach based on deb theory as presented here enables a rather accurate prediction of food intake rate of the chicks on the basis of their growth trajectory or simply on basis of their mass 30 days after hatching fig 6 this enables ornithologists to study the functional response i e the link between food availability and food gathering rate in the field in probably the most important period of the year that is in the chick raising period provisioning rate or at least intake rate of the chicks can now directly be derived from the growth trajectory of the chicks which is much easier to obtain of course feeding rate of the adults themselves has to be added to obtain the total food gathering rate adult feeding rate can be obtained in a similar fashion if changes in adult weight are available these weights will probably only vary to a minor extent implying that adult feeding rate is more or less constant in our experiment differences in food intake rate and thus in scaled functional response were not directly related to differences in density of the same type of food but to differences in food quality one might question why those birds fed with a marine diet that apparently has low energy density simply do not eat more it could be that they are already at the limit of total mass intake rate van gils et al 2005 apart from predicting the intake rate required for obtaining a specific fledging weight the deb model keeps track of all energy fluxes the huge difference in weight increase as a result of a much smaller difference in food availability f 1 versus f 0 7 is not just the result of the difference in structural size but also to a great extent of the difference in reserves table 4 note that the build up of the reserves is given by the integrated assimilation minus the integrated mobilization and thus equals 1801 kj and 431 kj for the two example feeding levels this difference is relatively larger than that in structural growth 2329 kj versus 817 kj our food intake predictions were systematically about 10 below the observations we refrained from using these food intake data in the parameter estimation procedure but when we would have done that it would have resulted in an almost perfect fit lowering the assimilation efficiency which was set at 80 would as well have yielded such perfection a slightly lower efficiency of 75 has indeed been observed in birds castro et al 1989 the slow initial growth observed might also be related to a low initial assimilation rate similar to a lowered digestive performance after diet switching hilton et al 2000 it may be that the newly hatched chick needs a few days to get adapted to feeding itself chicks are initially poorly able to keep themselves warm which may have added thermoregulation costs but probably this played no role as the chicks were under a heat lamp during the first three days generally speaking the problem of overfitting too many parameters too few data types is always a serious one particularly in such complex parameter estimation procedures as the add my pet procedure for deb models testing the predictions of a parametrized model on an independent data set as was done here is therefore of utmost importance in modeling we strongly encourage such tests for deb models as a next step it might be rewarding to repeat our exercise for a variety of bird species for which data on intake rate during the chick raising phase are

marine institute vliz provided the infrastructure for the aviary experiment appendix a this appendix provides further details and derivations for the standard deb model the model has three state variables structural body volume v reserve density e e v which is the amount of reserves per unit of structural body volume and maturity eh which is the cumulative energy allocated to development the most important environmental variable is the food density x table 5 a list of assumptions give rise to a set of coupled ordinary differential equation for the three state variables assumptions for the standard deb model are among other things that 1 assimilation rate is proportional to the surface area of the structural body p a p a m f v 2 3 2 all assimilated energy enters the reserves and is then mobilized from the reserves the rate of changes of the reserves is thus the difference between the assimilation rate and the mobilization rate 3 a fixed fraction κ of the mobilization rate is spent on maintenance which is assumed proportional to structural body volume and on growth assuming fixed costs for growth per unit volume 4 the rate of change of maturity equals 1 κ times the mobilization rate minus the maturity maintenance costs which are proportional to maturity the ordinary differential equation for reserve density is 3 d e d t v 1 3 p a m f v e the area specific assimilation rate p a m and the energy conductance v are so called primary parameters of the standard deb model they are explained together with quite a few others such as f m and κx in table 6 f is the so called scaled functional response that relates the assimilation rate to the food density and is given by f x p a m f m μ x κ x x and μx is the chemical potential of the food the growth equation is given by 4 d v d

so called κ rule and the product rule for differentiation eq 5 can be re written as v d e d t e d v d t p a m f v 2 3 1 κ p m v 1 κ e g d v d t combining with eq 3 and some re arranging yields the

the system of differential equations for reserve density eq 3 structural volume eq 4 and maturity eq 6 describe the standard deb model the standard deb model can be entirely re written in a dimensionless form in order to arrive at a dimensionless model one has to re scale all dimensions that is energy length or volume and time the choice of scaling coefficients is rather arbitrary as we will see yet for energy an obvious choice is the maximum amount of energy in reserve em and for volume it is the maximum volume of the structural body v m κ p a m p m 3 the maximum amount of energy in reserve equals the product of the maximum reserve density and the maximum volume e m e m v m where e m p a m v as follows from eqn 3 with f 1 these choices ensure that the new dimensionless state variables which are scaled reserve density e e em and scaled length l v vm 1 3 are easy to interpret and to remember the same holds for scaled maturity eh eh em the choice of a scaling coefficient for time is less obvious but it helps to first look at power which is given in energy per time one option is to scale power by the maximum assimilation rate which equals p a m p a m v m 2 3 this choice implies that time is scaled to κ times the ratio of the maximum reserve density and the volume specific maintenance rate resulting in τ t p m κ e m not just the state variables but all parameters table 7 and model equations can now be re scaled eq 3 which describes the dynamics of the reserve density turns into 7 d e d τ d e d t 1 e m κ e m p m f e l similarly the growth eq 4 becomes 8 d l 3 d

of the most important compound parameters in deb theory and is called the energy investment ratio it stands for the energetic costs of new structural volume eg relative to the maximum available energy
