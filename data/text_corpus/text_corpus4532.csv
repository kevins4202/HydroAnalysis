22660,vertically loaded anchors offer an attractive alternative for mooring system because of their relatively high efficiency and low costs predicting the ultimate embedment depth ued of anchor is important as it essentially determines the holding capacity by analyzing the shank s mechanism an analytical method is established to determine the ultimate state of the reconfigurable bridle shank thus based on this method a new form of analytical solution for the ultimate embedment depth of a vertically loaded anchor is proposed using the plasticity approach parametric studies on the effects of shank dimensions yield surface and chain parameters are also conducted a series of criteria are proposed to optimize the bridle ratio a proper range for the bridle ratio is presented keywords vertically loaded anchor ultimate embedment depth holding capacity analytical solution plasticity approach 1 introduction with the depletion of oil and gas in shallow water the offshore engineering has moved extensively into deep and ultra deep water this recent trend led to the introduction of taut mooring system tms that requires the anchor could withstand significant uplift loading the vertically loaded anchors vlas are an attractive choice aubeny and chi 2014 zimmerman et al 2009 for this demand because of their high capacity and low costs while some other types of anchors such as suction anchors monajemi and abdul razak 2009 suction embedded plate anchors seplas cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 tian et al 2013 2014a wei et al 2015 and dynamically installed anchors o loughlin et al 2013 are also capable of resisting uplift loading there are mainly two types of vertically loaded anchors in practice the dennla vlas ehlers et al 2004 with a rigid bar shank and the stevmanta vlas anchors 2015 with a bridle shank as shown in fig 1 they can be dragged into the soil in much the same way as the traditional drag embedded anchors deas o neil et al 2003 stewart 1992 aubeny and chi 2010 however the shank of vlas can reconfigure to form different pull angles for installation process and subsequent loading process respectively the existing of the shank can obviously increase the final embedment depth and holding capacity while decrease the requirement of the installation loading therefore the reconfigurable shank of vlas has a decisive influence on the performance the shank release process and subsequent deployment stage of vlas with a rigid bar were studied by aubeny and chi 2014 with a focus on the load capacity and ductility characteristics of the anchor cong et al 2017 proposed an analytical method to determine the configuration of the bridle shank at any given drag angle by implementing plasticity analyses with that analytical method the trajectory and loading of a vla during installation and loading processes can be derived by continuously solving the equations in the dragging in process deas would eventually reach an ultimate equilibrium state in which they move horizontally without diving further murff et al 2005 tian et al 2015a neubecker and randolph 1995 according to the study of cong et al 2017 the bridle shank would finally reach a steady state in which it does not reconfigure any further and the anchor behaves the same as a dea therefore it can be inferred that the vlas with a bridle shank would also reach an ultimate equilibrium state in the end the final equilibrium depth will be termed as ultimate embedment depth ued in the following it is important to quantify the ued in anchor design as it essentially determines the holding capacity the ued of vlas or seplas can be determined by the anchor trajectory which can be predicted by simulating the entire embedment process using analytical aubeny and chi 2010 2014 cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 cong et al 2017 paul aubeny et al 2008 liu et al 2012 2013 or numerical tian et al 2014a 2014b 2015b wang et al 2010 song et al 2009 zhao and liu 2015 methods on the other hand the analytical solution can be used to directly predict the ued without carrying complex and time consuming simulation of the whole embedment process the first analytical solution on ued was reported by liu et al 2010 in which formulas for clay and sand were proposed by analyzing and describing equilibrium forces acting on the anchor and embedded drag line tian et al 2015a also proposed an analytical method based on plasticity approach to predict the ultimate embedment depth and potential holding capacity of plate anchors with fixed shank the work of liu et al 2010 and tian et al 2015a are meaningful as they marked a significant shift from complex simulation method to concise analytical solution the method of liu et al shows evident advantages in simplicity and efficiency as it can be solved directly without solving the non linear equation system while the method of tian et al can consider more details in anchor soil interaction by selecting proper yield surface parameters for various cases in this paper attempts are paid to propose a similar analytical solution to directly predict the ultimate embedment depth focusing on vlas with a bridle shank firstly an analytical method to determine the configuration of bridle shank at ultimate equilibrium state is proposed based on mechanism analyses then a new analytical solution with less simultaneous equations to directly predict the ultimate embedment depth is established based on plasticity approach the ultimate embedment depth given by the new analytical solution agrees well with that given by continuously simulation of the anchor installation process based on the analytical solution the parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of the following factors shank dimensions yield surface and chain parameters 2 plasticity approach in the plasticity approach the entire anchor and surrounding soil are considered as a macroelement force resultant model within classical plasticity theory then the kinematics of the anchor can be determined solely using pre calculated yield surface and a flow rule the plasticity approach allows a simple design calculation and sensitivity study to be efficiently performed so it is increasing being used to predict the load displacement behavior of offshore infrastructure such as spudcan foundations martin and houlsby 2001 drag embedment anchors o neil et al 2003 aubeny and chi 2010 elkhatib et al 2005 suction embedded plate anchors cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 wei et al 2015 vertically loaded anchors aubeny and chi 2014 cong et al 2017 pipelines hodder and cassidy 2010 tian and cassidy 2010 and caissons cassidy et al 2006 fig 2 illustrates the idealized anchor system applied in this paper in which the fluke is simplified as a rectangle the details of the anchor dimensions are shown in fig 3 and table 1 as the shank is much smaller to the fluke it would be acceptable to neglect the soil resistance and the weight acting on the shank as shown in fig 4 the following double line installation method anchors 2015 is considered a installation process the front anchor line installation line is tensioned so that the anchor will be embedded into the seabed b loading process the rear anchor line mooring line is tensioned so that the shank will be reconfigured to increase the pull out capacity both the ultimate equilibrium states of installation process and loading process are studied in this paper 2 1 yield surface the plastic yield surface of a particular 2d foundation expresses the allowable combination of normal tangential and rotational loads v h m that results in the failure of the given foundation the surface can be expressed as a mathematical function of v h m 1 f v h m 0 a form of the yield surface proposed by o neil et al o neil et al 2003 that was subsequently adopted by many investigators cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 wei et al 2015 cong et al 2017 tian et al 2015a is used in this study it expresses the yield surface of a rectangular anchor as 2 f v v m a x q 1 m m m a x m h h m a x n 1 p 0 where v m a x h m a x and m m a x define the normal tangential and rotational capacities of the anchor under pure loading and the exponents m n p and q define the shape of the three dimensional yield surface in v h m space the yield surfaces of anchors with various shapes under different loading conditions can be computed by finite element method such as 2d plate anchor under in plane loading cassidy et al 2012 wei et al 2015 o neil et al 2003 elkhatib et al 2005 2d wedge anchor under in plane loading o neil et al 2003 3d square anchor under in plane loading wei et al 2015 elkhatib 2006 and 3d square anchor under out of plane loading nouri et al 2017 wu et al 2017 typical values of these parameters avaiable in literature are summarized in table 2 and the yield loci in v h plane from different sources are given in fig 5 and fig 6 v h m relate to the anchor line tension at shackle t s as 3 v t s sin θ f s w sin θ f h t s cos θ f s w cos θ f m t s e v cos θ f s e h sin θ f s where θ f s is the angle between the fluke and anchor line at shackle θ f is the vertical inclination of fluke w is the submerged weight of fluke and e v e h is the eccentricity of the shackle from fluke centroid see fig 3 as the yield surface parameters for the stevmanta vlas with complex geometry are not available for now an immediate issue that arises in applying plasticity approach to vlas is how to choose reasonable yield surface parameters as the moment acting on the fluke is zero at ultimate equilibrium state only the following yield surface parameters are needed for the analysis of ued i e v m a x l b s u h m a x l b s u n p and q the original intention of introducing the stevmanta fluke with complex geometry is to make a wedge like fluke with low material cost and self weight as illustrated by o neill et al o neil et al 2003 see table 2 the wedge like fluke has a smaller h m a x but similar v m a x compared with the rectangle fluke moreover it can be observed from figs 5 and 6 although the values of n p and q vary among different sources they have much less influence on the yield loci shape compared to h m a x for the above reasons it is acceptable to use the parameters v m a x n p and q from rectangular fluke for vlas however there are still uncertainties to determine an exact value for h m a x therefore the results for different h m a x will be calculated and discussed in detail in section 5 3 2 2 associated flow rule to determine the relative magnitudes of the translational and rotational motions the associated flow rule is assumed the localized displacement of the fluke can then be found from the normal of the yield surface 4 δ v δ h δ θ f λ f v f h f m where δ v δ h and δ θ f are the vertical horizontal and rotational displacements of the fluke at the local coordinate system see fig 2 respectively λ is the plastic multiplier and the vector f v f h f m t is the normal of the yield surface 5 f v q v v m a x q 1 1 v m a x f h sign h n p m m m a x m h h m a x n 1 p 1 h h m a x n 1 1 h m a x f m sign m m p m m m a x m m m m a x n 1 p 1 m m m a x m 1 1 m m a x 2 3 anchor line solution neubecker and randolph 1995 developed a closed form solution for an anchor line in the soil the solution relates the anchor line tension end angles and soil resistance as 6 cos θ m μ sin θ m e μ θ s θ m cos θ s μ sin θ s e n d b a r n c s u m y s k y s 2 2 1 μ 2 t s where θ m and θ s are the anchor line angles at the mudline and shackle respectively see fig 2 d b a r is the diameter of the anchor line e n is a multiplier giving the effective line width in the direction normal to the anchor line n c is the bearing capacity factor for the anchor line y s is the current vertical depth of the shackle s u m and k are the undrained shear strength of the soil at the mudline and the gradient respectively and μ is the friction coefficient of the anchor line moreover the solution gives the relationship between the anchor line tensions at mudline t m and shackle t s 7 t m t s e μ θ s θ m 3 analytical solution for the ultimate embedment depth 3 1 eccentricity of shackle at the ultimate equilibrium state in order to solve the ultimate embedment depth the configuration of shank should be determined firstly theoretically the reconfiguration of shank is the same as changing the shackle eccentricity accordingly the shackle eccentricity at the ultimate equilibrium state will be derived in this section the following derivation is based on the installation process see fig 4 i e the anchor line tension acts on the front shackle of the angle adjuster the logic of derivation for the loading process is the same in the derivation the symbols i j i j k l i j and t i j are used to denote vector angle length and tension respectively the local coordinate system is used where the x axis is parallel to the fluke as the moment on the fluke is zero in the ultimate equilibrium state cong et al 2017 both the front and rear bridles should be tensioned then the following vectors in the anchor system can be calculated easily based on geometry 8 a b l a b 0 t 9 b c l b c 0 t 10 a c l a c 0 t 11 a d l a d cos φ r sin φ r t 12 b c l b c cos φ f s i n φ f t 13 c d b c a b a d l b c cos φ f l a b l a d cos φ r l b c sin φ f l a d sin φ r t where φ f and φ r see fig 3 denote the angles of front and rear bridles relative to the fluke respectively moreover the vector c e can be derived by rotating and zooming the vector c d in eq 13 14 c e l c e l c d cos β sin β sin β cos β c d where β is the angle between lines c d and c e in angle adjuster see fig 3 then the vector d e can be calculated by 15 d e c e c d it can be seen that the vectors in eqs 8 10 are constant and the vectors in eqs 11 15 are determined by the bridle angles φ f and φ r furthermore the front bridle angle φ f can be determined by 16 φ f π a b d c b d where 17 a b d arccos l a b 2 l b d 2 l a d 2 2 l a b l b d c b d arccos l b c 2 l b d 2 l c d 2 2 l b c l b d the unknown length l b d in this equation is determined by the rear bridle angle φ r 18 l b d l a b 2 l a d 2 2 l a b l a d cos φ r it can be seen from eqs 16 18 that the front bridle angle φ f is a function of the rear bridle angle φ r therefore the vectors in eqs 11 15 can actually be calculated only using φ r neglecting the soil resistance and self weight acting on the thin shank the moment equilibrium equation of the angle adjuster is 19 t a d a d l a d d e t b c b c l b c c e 0 which can be rewritten to the following form 20 t a d l b c t b c l a d b c c e a d d e as mentioned before the moment acting on the fluke is zero at the ultimate equilibrium state then 21 t a d a d l a d a c t b c b c l b c b c 0 this equation can be rewritten in the following form 22 t a d l b c t b c l a d b c b c a d a c the left hand sides of eqs 20 and 22 are identical then these two equations may be combined to give 23 b c b c a d a c b c c e a d d e substituting the vectors in eqs 9 12 14 and 15 into above equation leads to 24 l a d l c e sin β φ r φ f l a b l c e sin φ f β l b c l c e sin β l b c l c e sin β φ r φ f l a b l c e sin β φ r l b c l c d sin φ r φ f l a b l c d sin φ r l a d l c e sin β l b c sin φ f l a c sin φ r 0 where 25 φ f π arccos l a b 2 l a d 2 l b c 2 l c d 2 2 l a b l a d cos φ r 2 l b c l a b 2 l a d 2 2 l a b l a d cos φ r arccos l a b l a d φ r l a b 2 l a d 2 2 l a b l a d cos φ r the only unknown variable φ r in eq 24 can be solved by iteration method e g the bisection method used in this study then the variable vectors in eqs 11 15 is determined and the eccentricity of shackle can be calculated using the vectors 26 e h e v t r e b c b c c e the angle between fluke and anchor line tension at shackle θ f s can be calculated by 27 θ f s arctan e v e h as mentioned by cong et al 2017 the bridle shank of vlas would eventually reach a steady state in which it does not reconfigure any further and the vlas behave the same as deas therefore when the shackle eccentricity is known the ultimate embedment depth of vlas can be determined by the analytical solution for deas such as the solution proposed by tian et al 2015a instead this paper proposed a new form of analytical solution with less simultaneous equations thus the iterative solution for it is simpler the derivation of this new analytical solution will be presented in the following 3 2 yield surface at the ultimate equilibrium state when the anchor reaches the ultimate equilibrium state the moment m acting on the fluke is zero then the yield surface eq 2 may be written as 28 f v v m a x q 1 h h m a x n p 0 the normal and tangential capacities under pure loading v m a x and h m a x increase with the undrained shear strength of soil s u 29 v m a x v s a f s u v s a f s u m k y c h m a x h s a f s u h s a f s u m k y c where v s v m a x a f s u and h m a x a f s u are the capacities that normalized by the fluke area a f and strength s u substituting eq 29 the yield surface eq 28 turns into 30 f t s sin θ f s w sin θ f v s a f s u m k y c q t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u m k y c n p 1 0 3 3 anchor line solution at the ultimate equilibrium state based on geometry it is obvious that the difference between the depths of shackle y s and fluke centroid y c is 31 δ y y c y s e v sin θ f e h cos θ f moreover the anchor line angle at shackle θ s relates to the fluke inclination θ f and the angle between the fluke and anchor line at shackle θ f s as 32 θ s π 2 θ f s θ f substituting eqs 31 and 32 the anchor line solution eq 6 can be rewritten as follows 33 cos θ m μ sin θ m e μ π 2 θ f s θ f θ m cos π 2 θ f s θ f μ sin π 2 θ f s θ f e n d b a r n c s u m y c e h cos θ f e v sin θ f k y c e h cos θ f e v sin θ f 2 2 1 μ 2 t s 3 4 movement of anchor at the ultimate equilibrium state eqs 3 and 29 can be substituted into eq 4 again discarding the zero moment m to give the displacements of fluke in the local coordinate system as follows 34 δ v λ q 1 v s a f s u m k y c t s sin θ f s w sin θ f v s a f s u m k y c q 1 δ h λ sign t s cos θ f s w cos θ f n p 1 h s a f s u m k y c t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u m k y c n p 1 the vertical displacement of fluke δ y in the global coordinate system can be evaluated as 35 δ y sin θ f δ v cos θ f δ h as δ y is zero at ultimate equilibrium state this equation can be written as 36 δ h δ v tan θ f substituting eq 34 into the left hand side of this equation it can be derived that 37 sign h n p q v s h s t s sin θ f s w sin θ f v s a f s u m k y c 1 q t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u m k y c n p 1 tan θ f 3 5 equation system at the ultimate equilibrium state it can be seen that eqs 30 33 and 37 constitute three simultaneous equations f f 1 f 2 f 3 with three unknowns r y c θ f t s written in full as 38 f r f 1 t s sin θ f s w sin θ f v s a f s u m k y c q t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u

sign h n p q v s h s t s sin θ f s w sin θ f v s a f s u m k y c 1 q t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u m k y c n p 1 tan θ f 0 the fluke depth y c fluke inclination θ f and the anchor line tension at shackle t s can be determined by solving this non linear equation system using newton raphson method the details of the n r iteration algorithm are given in appendix a as will be demonstrated in section 5 2 the effects of submerged weight of fluke w on ued can be neglected in some cases if w 0 the f 1 and f 3 in eq 38 can be rewritten to the following forms 39 η 1 sin θ f s v s a f q η 1 cos θ f s h s a f n p 1 0 40 θ f arctan sign h n p q v s h s η 1 sin θ f s v s a f 1 q η 1 cos θ f s h s a f n p 1 where 41 η 1 t s s u m k y c in eq 39 and the right hand side of eq 40 there is only one unknown variable η 1 the variable η 1 can be determined by solving eq 39 then the fluke angle θ f can be calculated by eq 40 finally substituting the obtained η 1 and θ f the f 2 in eq 38 can be rewritten as a quadratic equation of fluke depth y c as follows 42 a y c 2 b y c c 0 where the coefficients are 43 a k e n d b a r n c 1 μ 2 b 2 e n d b a r n c 1 μ 2 s u m k e h cos θ f e v sin θ f η

2 θ f s θ f θ m cos π 2 θ f s θ f μ sin π 2 θ f s θ f then the ultimate embedment depth y c can be solved directly by 44 y c b b 2 4 a c 2 a 4 comparative study the advantages of the newly proposed analytical method include i it can determine the ultimate state of a reconfigurable shank ii it can directly predict the ued of a drag anchor with a reconfigurable or fixed shank iii it has less simultaneous equations thus the iterative solution may be simpler as mentioned in the introduction analytical solutions for ued were proposed by tian et al 2015a and liu et al 2010 respectively their methods only focus on the anchor with a fixed shackle eccentricity to the authors knowledge the only study on the reconfiguration of the bridle shank was conducted in the authors previous work cong et al 2017 in which the whole diving process can be simulated in this section the present new method is firstly compared with the analytical methods from tian et al and liu et al in predicting the ued of a drag anchor with a fixed shank and then compared with the simulation method of cong et al 2017 in predicting the ued of a vla with a bridle shank 4 1 comparison with other analytical solution based on plasticity approach as mentioned before tian et al 2015a proposed an analytical solution which is also based on the plasticity approach to validate the new form equation system proposed in section 3 5 the variation of ued with respect to the eccentric ratio e h e v is calculated and compared with the results from tian et al 2015a as shown in fig 7 the parameters used for the computation are listed in table 1 it can be seen from fig 7 that the same results can be obtained by a more concise solution with less effort in implementing the iteration algorithm it can also be observed that the shank dimension has significant effects on the ued this will be discussed in detail in section 5 2 with focus on the bridle length of vlas 4 2 comparison with the analytical formula based on force equilibrium analysis besides the analytical solutions based on plasticity approach liu et al 2010 reported an analytical formula based on the equilibrium forces acting on the anchor and embedded drag line to predict the ued of drag anchor in both clay and sand based on that formula liu et al studied the effects of the angle between fluke and tension θ f s the anchor line diameter d b a r and the soil strength gradient k the same parametric studies are also conducted here using the present analytical solution and the results are compared as listed in table 3 the detailed parameters are listed in table 1 the data in table 3 demonstrates that the results of the present solution show similar trends with the results from liu et al however the present solution generally predicts larger ued than lius results this may be because that the fluke weight is considered in this study as will be shown in section 5 2 the neglect of fluke weight could result in obvious decrease in ued 4 3 comparison with the simulation method based on plasticity approach the simulation method from cong et al 2017 is summarized by the algorithm shown in fig 8 in this section the full trajectory are simulated by the algorithm thus the ued can be obtained fig 9 shows the predictive trajectories from simulations with the length of front bridle varying from 0 468 m to 2 34 m i e the ratio between the lengths of front and rear bridles l b c l a d termed as bridle ratio in the following varying from 0 2 to 1 0 the other parameters used in the simulation are given in table 1 the predictive trajectories confirmed that the vlas would eventually reach to an ultimate embedment depth like deas as inferred in the introduction the ultimate embedment depth and eccentricity obtained from the trajectories and the present analytical solution are compared in table 4 it can be seen that the results especially the eccentricity from analytical solution are very close to the simulation results which means the analytical solution is rational 5 behaviors of the stevmanta vlas at the ultimate equilibrium state it is easy to deduce that the behaviors of the stevmanta vlas at the ultimate equilibrium state are determined by the shank dimensions chain parameters and the yield surface parameters of the fluke ideally a vla at the ultimate state would stop diving and keep translating horizontally in practical engineering vlas need to be well designed to have deeper embedment larger bearing capacity under loading and be easier to be installed from the perspective of mechanics these preferred criteria are i larger y c ii larger t m or t s in loading mode iii smaller t m or t s in installation mode iv limited embedment loss from installation mode to loading mode in order to optimize the anchor design a series of parametric study are carried out to investigate the effects of the shank dimensions and yield surface parameters furthermore the effects of the chain parameters are also discussed since the chain parameters in the literature are in a relatively large range the benchmark values and sensitivity study ranges of those parameters are listed in table 5 5 1 mathematical analysis on the solution of equation system before discussing the sensitivity of t s and y c on the parameters in table 5 effort has been paid to discover the relationship between each parameter and t s y c by mathematical derivation it may be helpful to understand the phenomenon in sections 5 2 5 4 to achieve meaningful conclusions by mathematical derivation simplicity must be done by neglecting the fluke weight it will be demonstrated in section 5 2 that the fluke weight can be neglected in some cases the assumption of zero fluke weight may not has obvious effects on qualitatively predicting the effects of each parameter on t s y c as derived before if w 0 the f 1 in the equation system eq 38 can be rewritten to the following form 45 η 1 sin θ f s v s a f q η 1 cos θ f s h s a f n p 1 0 where 46 η 1 t s s u m k y c the above equation can be rewritten to 47 t s η 1 s u m k y c this expression represents a straight line in the t s y c plane as shown in fig 10 the t s intercept and line slope increase with the increase of η 1 it can be observed from eq 45 and eq 46 that η 1 a f is actually the capacity coefficient of fluke so η 1 should increase with the increase of the angle between the fluke and drag force θ f s moreover if w 0 the f 2 in the equation system eq 38 can be rewritten to the following form 48 t s η 2 k y c 2 2 s u m k δ y y c k δ y 2 s u m δ y where 49 η 2 e n d b a r n c 1 μ 2 μ sin θ m cos θ m e μ θ s θ m μ sin θ s cos θ s 50 δ y e v sin θ f e h cos θ f eq 48 represents a parabola in t s y c plane as shown in fig 10 the curve gradient increases with the increase of η 2 the intersection of this parabola and the straight line represented by eq 47 is the solution for the ultimate embedment depth and drag force y c t s it can be observed from eq 49 that the coefficient η 2 of parabola depends on the following parameters the lumped multiplier e n d b a r n c the friction coefficient μ the anchor line angle at mudline θ m and the anchor line angle at shackle θ s it is obvious that η 2 increases with the increase of e n d b a r n c moreover it can be demonstrated that η 2 also changes monotonously with μ θ m and θ s the details of the demonstration are given in appendix b the parameters e n d b a r n c μ and θ m only affect the coefficient η 2 of parabola but they have no effect on the straight line therefore their influences on the solution y c t s can be determined by analyzing the effects of η 2 it can be seen from fig 10 that y c t s decreases with the increase of η 2 then the effects of the parameters on the solution can be determined as listed in table 6 when the depth y c is relatively large the low order terms in eq 47 an y c η 1 η 2 d eq 48 can be neglected then it can be deduced that 51 y c η 1 η 2 it can be observed from eqs 46 49 and 51 the parameters η 1 and k have no effect on the solution when the ultimate embedment depth is relatively large the effects of the parameters discussed above on the η 2 y c t s and θ f s are summarized in table 6 it should be noted that the parameters θ s and θ f s correlate with each other as they both depend on the yield surface and anchor dimensions their combined effects on solution cannot be determined directly the effects of θ s and e n d b a r n c listed in table 6 are derived without considering the correlation between them 5 2 effects of the shank dimensions with a 2d assumption the shank dimensions include the relative positions of points a b c d e and f in fig 3 in the present analytical solution the effects of the shank dimensions embody in changing the eccentricity ie e v and e h and the eccentricity is mainly determined by the ratio of the front bridle length to the rear bridle length which is termed as bridle ratio in this study figs 11 14 show the results from the analytical solution with the bridle ratio l b c l a d varying from 0 2 to 1 2 the parameters taken in the parametric study are listed in tables 1 and 5 it easy to infer that the vertical eccentricity e h and drag angle θ f s will increase with the increase of bridle ratio while the horizontal eccentricity e h will decrease the curves shown in figs 11 and 12 are consistent with this if the anchor transforms from installation mode to loading mode i e the mooring point moves from shackle e to f see fig 3 the general dimension before the shackle will increase and the dimension behind will decrease then similar to the situation that the bridle ratio increases the θ f s will increase therefore the θ f s in loading mode is larger around 12 in this case than that in installation mode this means a greater capacity coefficient in loading mode moreover the fluke moving direction will develop from tangential to normal direction of fluke as θ f s increases from zero to 90 in addition the fluke should move horizontally in ultimate equilibrium state then the vertical inclination of fluke θ f should decrease with the increase of bridle ratio as shown in fig 12 unlike θ f s and θ f that change monotonously with bridle ratio the anchor line angel θ s increases firstly and then decreases the ultimate embedment depth calculated by eqs 42 44 without considering the fluke weight are shown in fig 14 along with the results from equation system eq 38 that considering the fluke weight it can be seen that the results regardless of weight are smaller because the weight is beneficial for a deeper depth the fluke is prone to penetrate into the soil when the force acts on the direction parallel to fluke therefore as the angle between weight and fluke θ f increases with bridle ratio see fig 12 the effects of weight also increase with bridle ratio as shown in fig 14 and the weight can be neglected when the bridle ratio is relatively low although the weight can not be neglected in the whole range of bridle ratio from the view point of quantitative analysis the results obtained in section 5 1 can be used here to reveal the variation mechanism of ultimate embedment depth and capacity as demonstrated in section 5 1 the coefficient η 1 see fig 10 increases with the increase of θ f s and η 2 decreases with the increase of θ s in addition the angle θ f s increases with the increase of bridle ratio while the angle θ s increases firstly and then decreases therefore the coefficient η 1 increases with the increase of bridle ratio and η 2 decreases firstly and then increases from fig 10 it can be seen that pure increasing in η 1 will increase the solution y c t s and pure increasing in η 2 will decrease the solution eventually due to the combined effects of η 1 and η 2 the solution y c t s should increase firstly and then decrease as shown in figs 13 and 14 in addition owing to the influence of θ f s the bridle ratio when y c t s reaches peak should be larger than that when θ s reaches peak in order to guide the optimization design in practice some key values are also discussed here from the perspective of criteria ii and iii a proper bridle ratio would give a larger t in loading mode and smaller t in installation mode a capacity performance ratio is defined as the ratio between t m in loading mode and that in installation mode it can be seen from fig 13 that an optimal range of the bridle ratio is from 0 6 to 0 72 for extreme small or large values of bridle ratio the ultimate embedment depth and holding capacity are nearly zero as shown in figs 14 and 13 so those values of bridle ratio are invalid in practice according to the results of the installation mode the optimal bridle ratio would be l b c l a d 0 85 at which the anchor is at the deepest embedment however the anchor may experience an extreme loading and further moving in loading mode for the case of l b c l a d 0 85 the anchor may be pulled out from a depth of 110m y c in installation mode to 10m y c in loading mode under an extreme loading the potential embedment loss may lead to a great loss in bearing capacity therefore a depth performance ratio is defined as the ratio between y c in loading mode and that in installation mode from the perspective of criterion iv an optimal range of the bridle ratio is also from 0 6 to 0 72 5 3 effects of the yield surface parameters as stated in section 2 1 among the yield surface parameters v m a x is less affected by the fluke shape and the parameters n p and q have much less influences on the yield loci shape compared to h m a x moreover the fluke shape has significant influences on the horizontal capacity h m a x therefore h m a x should be studies in detail to guide the optimization design of the anchor the horizontal capacity h m a x listed in table 2 varies from 1 95 to 4 65 and the ratio h m a x v m a x varies from 0 17 to 0 29 thus a sensitivity study is carried out by varying the ratio h m a x v m a x from 0 15 to 0 35 while keeping the other yield surface parameters constant the ultimate embedment depth and tension forces are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 it can be seen that both the ultimate depth y c and anchor line tension at mudline t m decrease with the increase of the ratio h m a x v m a x therefore a minimal horizontal resistance h m a x is preferred in practice in order to minimizing h m a x a sharp edged or wedge shaped fluke and a shank with small profile e g bridle shank can be considered in design to have a clearer view focusing on the above mentioned criteria i iv the capacity performance ratio and the depth performance ratio are plotted in figs 17 and 18 respectively it can be seen that the increase of h m a x v m a x leads to obvious decrease of the proper range ratio 1 0 of the bridle ratio from the perspective of criterion iv a maximum bridle ratio can be define using depth performance ratio equals 1 0 no embedment loss or 0 8 20 embedment loss as shown in fig 19 combining criterion ii the lower limit of the bridle ratio can be defined with certain bearing capacity 50 t m p e a k or 80 t m p e a k according to the results in fig 13 the lower limits for l b c l a d are also plotted in fig 19 thus a proper value of l b c l a d for a vla can be selected 5 4 effects of the chain parameters 5 4 1 anchor line friction coefficient μ it is recommended by dnv veritas 2000 that the value of anchor line friction coefficient μ should be in the range of 0 1 0 3 and 0 6 0 8 for chain and wire in clay respectively moreover neubecker and randolph 1995 suggested μ should be in the range of 0 4 0 6 for chain while zhang et al 2014 suggested the range should be 0 1 0 6 therefore to study the effects of μ values of μ varying from 0 1 to 0 7 were considered in this section with results shown in figs 20 24 it can be seen that both the ultimate embedment depth y c and anchor line tensions t s and t m increase with the increase of μ as shown in figs 20 22 this is consistent with the results obtained in section 5 1 on the other hand the capacity performance ratio and the valid range of bridle ratio for capacity performance ratio decrease within limited range with the increase of μ see fig 23 while the depth performance ratio is nearly not affected by μ see fig 24 moreover the influences of μ on anchor line tension at mudline t m are more obvious than that at shackle t s the reason for this is that the soil friction along the embedded anchor line makes a direct contribution to t m as noted by eq 7 5 4 2 anchor line bearing parameters e n d b a r and n c the multiplier of effective width e n nominal anchor line diameter d b a r and bearing capacity factor n c appear together as lumped multiplier in the anchor line solution eq 6 so they are combined together in this parametric study as the anchor line of vlas is usually a wire e n is taken 1 0 in this study liu et al 2010 summarized the suggested value of n c for the embedded wire and chain from different researchers the value of n c varies in the range 7 6 14 therefore a parametric study of e n d b a r n c b 0 3 0 9 is conducted with results shown in figs 25 28 it is observed that both the ultimate depth y c and anchor line tension at mudline t m decrease with the increase of e n d b a r n c see figs 25 and 26 this is consistent with the results obtained in section 5 1 on the other hand e n d b a r n c almost has no influence on the capacity and depth performance ratios see figs 27 and 28 5 4 3 anchor line angle at mudline θ m a parametric study of θ m varying from 0 to 50 was conducted covering the practical range of anchor line angle for catenary and taut moorings in loading mode with results shown in figs 29 32 it is found that both the ultimate depth y c and the anchor line tension at mudline t m decrease with the increase of θ m as shown in figs 29 and 30 this is consistent with the results obtained in section 5 1 unlike the other two chain parameters i e μ and e n d b a r n c θ m also has a significant influence on the capacity and depth performance ratios see figs 31 and 32 both the capacity and depth performance ratios and the valid range of bridle ratio for the performance ratios decrease with the increase of θ m for the case of θ m 50 the capacity and depth performance ratios are less than 1 0 for all bridle ratio so embedment loss under extreme loading cannot be avoided by adjusting the bridle ratio 6 discussions and conclusions this paper has proposed an analytical solution to predict the ultimate embedment depth ued and holding capacity of vertically loaded anchors vlas with a reconfigurable bridle shank compared to the methods that predict the ued by simulating the entire embedment process the present method is easy to implement and time saving comparative studies are performed to test the present solution the results agree well with the results from tian el al 2015 and cong et al 2017 the formula from liu et al 2010 generally underestimate the ued than the present solution this is because that the fluke weight is not considered in the formula neglecting the fluke weight it can be demonstrated by mathematical derivation that the ued i decreases with the increase of e n d b a r n c θ f s and θ m ii increases with the increase of μ and θ s iii is not affected by k and s u m when the ued is relatively deep parametric studies are also conducted to investigate the behaviors of vlas with consideration of the fluke weight the studies indicate that the shank dimensions yield surface parameters and chain properties have significant effects on the ued from the viewpoint of maximizing the ued the following principle may be followed in design i the optimal value of bridle length should be determined by a compromise between performances in installation and loading modes ii sharp edged or wedge shaped fluke and thin shank is preferred iii fine and rough anchor line is beneficial iv low anchor line angle at mudline is better although this study brings to light several significant aspects on the ued of vlas there are some deficiencies for example i there are uncertainties in selecting the yield surface parameters from the results of simplified fluke it is anticipated that the yield surface of the real anchor with complex shape could be adopted in future studies ii in practice the vlas are subjected to 3d loading from anchor handling vessels or floating structures the method proposed in this paper could be expanded to 3d condition by introducing a 3d form yield surface and a method to determining the 3d configuration of shank acknowledgments this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china grant no 51639002 41772296 51679038 appendix a newton raphson iteration algorithm of

22660,vertically loaded anchors offer an attractive alternative for mooring system because of their relatively high efficiency and low costs predicting the ultimate embedment depth ued of anchor is important as it essentially determines the holding capacity by analyzing the shank s mechanism an analytical method is established to determine the ultimate state of the reconfigurable bridle shank thus based on this method a new form of analytical solution for the ultimate embedment depth of a vertically loaded anchor is proposed using the plasticity approach parametric studies on the effects of shank dimensions yield surface and chain parameters are also conducted a series of criteria are proposed to optimize the bridle ratio a proper range for the bridle ratio is presented keywords vertically loaded anchor ultimate embedment depth holding capacity analytical solution plasticity approach 1 introduction with the depletion of oil and gas in shallow water the offshore engineering has moved extensively into deep and ultra deep water this recent trend led to the introduction of taut mooring system tms that requires the anchor could withstand significant uplift loading the vertically loaded anchors vlas are an attractive choice aubeny and chi 2014 zimmerman et al 2009 for this demand because of their high capacity and low costs while some other types of anchors such as suction anchors monajemi and abdul razak 2009 suction embedded plate anchors seplas cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 tian et al 2013 2014a wei et al 2015 and dynamically installed anchors o loughlin et al 2013 are also capable of resisting uplift loading there are mainly two types of vertically loaded anchors in practice the dennla vlas ehlers et al 2004 with a rigid bar shank and the stevmanta vlas anchors 2015 with a bridle shank as shown in fig 1 they can be dragged into the soil in much the same way as the traditional drag embedded anchors deas o neil et al 2003 stewart 1992 aubeny and chi 2010 however the shank of vlas can reconfigure to form different pull angles for installation process and subsequent loading process respectively the existing of the shank can obviously increase the final embedment depth and holding capacity while decrease the requirement of the installation loading therefore the reconfigurable shank of vlas has a decisive influence on the performance the shank release process and subsequent deployment stage of vlas with a rigid bar were studied by aubeny and chi 2014 with a focus on the load capacity and ductility characteristics of the anchor cong et al 2017 proposed an analytical method to determine the configuration of the bridle shank at any given drag angle by implementing plasticity analyses with that analytical method the trajectory and loading of a vla during installation and loading processes can be derived by continuously solving the equations in the dragging in process deas would eventually reach an ultimate equilibrium state in which they move horizontally without diving further murff et al 2005 tian et al 2015a neubecker and randolph 1995 according to the study of cong et al 2017 the bridle shank would finally reach a steady state in which it does not reconfigure any further and the anchor behaves the same as a dea therefore it can be inferred that the vlas with a bridle shank would also reach an ultimate equilibrium state in the end the final equilibrium depth will be termed as ultimate embedment depth ued in the following it is important to quantify the ued in anchor design as it essentially determines the holding capacity the ued of vlas or seplas can be determined by the anchor trajectory which can be predicted by simulating the entire embedment process using analytical aubeny and chi 2010 2014 cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 cong et al 2017 paul aubeny et al 2008 liu et al 2012 2013 or numerical tian et al 2014a 2014b 2015b wang et al 2010 song et al 2009 zhao and liu 2015 methods on the other hand the analytical solution can be used to directly predict the ued without carrying complex and time consuming simulation of the whole embedment process the first analytical solution on ued was reported by liu et al 2010 in which formulas for clay and sand were proposed by analyzing and describing equilibrium forces acting on the anchor and embedded drag line tian et al 2015a also proposed an analytical method based on plasticity approach to predict the ultimate embedment depth and potential holding capacity of plate anchors with fixed shank the work of liu et al 2010 and tian et al 2015a are meaningful as they marked a significant shift from complex simulation method to concise analytical solution the method of liu et al shows evident advantages in simplicity and efficiency as it can be solved directly without solving the non linear equation system while the method of tian et al can consider more details in anchor soil interaction by selecting proper yield surface parameters for various cases in this paper attempts are paid to propose a similar analytical solution to directly predict the ultimate embedment depth focusing on vlas with a bridle shank firstly an analytical method to determine the configuration of bridle shank at ultimate equilibrium state is proposed based on mechanism analyses then a new analytical solution with less simultaneous equations to directly predict the ultimate embedment depth is established based on plasticity approach the ultimate embedment depth given by the new analytical solution agrees well with that given by continuously simulation of the anchor installation process based on the analytical solution the parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of the following factors shank dimensions yield surface and chain parameters 2 plasticity approach in the plasticity approach the entire anchor and surrounding soil are considered as a macroelement force resultant model within classical plasticity theory then the kinematics of the anchor can be determined solely using pre calculated yield surface and a flow rule the plasticity approach allows a simple design calculation and sensitivity study to be efficiently performed so it is increasing being used to predict the load displacement behavior of offshore infrastructure such as spudcan foundations martin and houlsby 2001 drag embedment anchors o neil et al 2003 aubeny and chi 2010 elkhatib et al 2005 suction embedded plate anchors cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 wei et al 2015 vertically loaded anchors aubeny and chi 2014 cong et al 2017 pipelines hodder and cassidy 2010 tian and cassidy 2010 and caissons cassidy et al 2006 fig 2 illustrates the idealized anchor system applied in this paper in which the fluke is simplified as a rectangle the details of the anchor dimensions are shown in fig 3 and table 1 as the shank is much smaller to the fluke it would be acceptable to neglect the soil resistance and the weight acting on the shank as shown in fig 4 the following double line installation method anchors 2015 is considered a installation process the front anchor line installation line is tensioned so that the anchor will be embedded into the seabed b loading process the rear anchor line mooring line is tensioned so that the shank will be reconfigured to increase the pull out capacity both the ultimate equilibrium states of installation process and loading process are studied in this paper 2 1 yield surface the plastic yield surface of a particular 2d foundation expresses the allowable combination of normal tangential and rotational loads v h m that results in the failure of the given foundation the surface can be expressed as a mathematical function of v h m 1 f v h m 0 a form of the yield surface proposed by o neil et al o neil et al 2003 that was subsequently adopted by many investigators cassidy et al 2012 yang et al 2012 wei et al 2015 cong et al 2017 tian et al 2015a is used in this study it expresses the yield surface of a rectangular anchor as 2 f v v m a x q 1 m m m a x m h h m a x n 1 p 0 where v m a x h m a x and m m a x define the normal tangential and rotational capacities of the anchor under pure loading and the exponents m n p and q define the shape of the three dimensional yield surface in v h m space the yield surfaces of anchors with various shapes under different loading conditions can be computed by finite element method such as 2d plate anchor under in plane loading cassidy et al 2012 wei et al 2015 o neil et al 2003 elkhatib et al 2005 2d wedge anchor under in plane loading o neil et al 2003 3d square anchor under in plane loading wei et al 2015 elkhatib 2006 and 3d square anchor under out of plane loading nouri et al 2017 wu et al 2017 typical values of these parameters avaiable in literature are summarized in table 2 and the yield loci in v h plane from different sources are given in fig 5 and fig 6 v h m relate to the anchor line tension at shackle t s as 3 v t s sin θ f s w sin θ f h t s cos θ f s w cos θ f m t s e v cos θ f s e h sin θ f s where θ f s is the angle between the fluke and anchor line at shackle θ f is the vertical inclination of fluke w is the submerged weight of fluke and e v e h is the eccentricity of the shackle from fluke centroid see fig 3 as the yield surface parameters for the stevmanta vlas with complex geometry are not available for now an immediate issue that arises in applying plasticity approach to vlas is how to choose reasonable yield surface parameters as the moment acting on the fluke is zero at ultimate equilibrium state only the following yield surface parameters are needed for the analysis of ued i e v m a x l b s u h m a x l b s u n p and q the original intention of introducing the stevmanta fluke with complex geometry is to make a wedge like fluke with low material cost and self weight as illustrated by o neill et al o neil et al 2003 see table 2 the wedge like fluke has a smaller h m a x but similar v m a x compared with the rectangle fluke moreover it can be observed from figs 5 and 6 although the values of n p and q vary among different sources they have much less influence on the yield loci shape compared to h m a x for the above reasons it is acceptable to use the parameters v m a x n p and q from rectangular fluke for vlas however there are still uncertainties to determine an exact value for h m a x therefore the results for different h m a x will be calculated and discussed in detail in section 5 3 2 2 associated flow rule to determine the relative magnitudes of the translational and rotational motions the associated flow rule is assumed the localized displacement of the fluke can then be found from the normal of the yield surface 4 δ v δ h δ θ f λ f v f h f m where δ v δ h and δ θ f are the vertical horizontal and rotational displacements of the fluke at the local coordinate system see fig 2 respectively λ is the plastic multiplier and the vector f v f h f m t is the normal of the yield surface 5 f v q v v m a x q 1 1 v m a x f h sign h n p m m m a x m h h m a x n 1 p 1 h h m a x n 1 1 h m a x f m sign m m p m m m a x m m m m a x n 1 p 1 m m m a x m 1 1 m m a x 2 3 anchor line solution neubecker and randolph 1995 developed a closed form solution for an anchor line in the soil the solution relates the anchor line tension end angles and soil resistance as 6 cos θ m μ sin θ m e μ θ s θ m cos θ s μ sin θ s e n d b a r n c s u m y s k y s 2 2 1 μ 2 t s where θ m and θ s are the anchor line angles at the mudline and shackle respectively see fig 2 d b a r is the diameter of the anchor line e n is a multiplier giving the effective line width in the direction normal to the anchor line n c is the bearing capacity factor for the anchor line y s is the current vertical depth of the shackle s u m and k are the undrained shear strength of the soil at the mudline and the gradient respectively and μ is the friction coefficient of the anchor line moreover the solution gives the relationship between the anchor line tensions at mudline t m and shackle t s 7 t m t s e μ θ s θ m 3 analytical solution for the ultimate embedment depth 3 1 eccentricity of shackle at the ultimate equilibrium state in order to solve the ultimate embedment depth the configuration of shank should be determined firstly theoretically the reconfiguration of shank is the same as changing the shackle eccentricity accordingly the shackle eccentricity at the ultimate equilibrium state will be derived in this section the following derivation is based on the installation process see fig 4 i e the anchor line tension acts on the front shackle of the angle adjuster the logic of derivation for the loading process is the same in the derivation the symbols i j i j k l i j and t i j are used to denote vector angle length and tension respectively the local coordinate system is used where the x axis is parallel to the fluke as the moment on the fluke is zero in the ultimate equilibrium state cong et al 2017 both the front and rear bridles should be tensioned then the following vectors in the anchor system can be calculated easily based on geometry 8 a b l a b 0 t 9 b c l b c 0 t 10 a c l a c 0 t 11 a d l a d cos φ r sin φ r t 12 b c l b c cos φ f s i n φ f t 13 c d b c a b a d l b c cos φ f l a b l a d cos φ r l b c sin φ f l a d sin φ r t where φ f and φ r see fig 3 denote the angles of front and rear bridles relative to the fluke respectively moreover the vector c e can be derived by rotating and zooming the vector c d in eq 13 14 c e l c e l c d cos β sin β sin β cos β c d where β is the angle between lines c d and c e in angle adjuster see fig 3 then the vector d e can be calculated by 15 d e c e c d it can be seen that the vectors in eqs 8 10 are constant and the vectors in eqs 11 15 are determined by the bridle angles φ f and φ r furthermore the front bridle angle φ f can be determined by 16 φ f π a b d c b d where 17 a b d arccos l a b 2 l b d 2 l a d 2 2 l a b l b d c b d arccos l b c 2 l b d 2 l c d 2 2 l b c l b d the unknown length l b d in this equation is determined by the rear bridle angle φ r 18 l b d l a b 2 l a d 2 2 l a b l a d cos φ r it can be seen from eqs 16 18 that the front bridle angle φ f is a function of the rear bridle angle φ r therefore the vectors in eqs 11 15 can actually be calculated only using φ r neglecting the soil resistance and self weight acting on the thin shank the moment equilibrium equation of the angle adjuster is 19 t a d a d l a d d e t b c b c l b c c e 0 which can be rewritten to the following form 20 t a d l b c t b c l a d b c c e a d d e as mentioned before the moment acting on the fluke is zero at the ultimate equilibrium state then 21 t a d a d l a d a c t b c b c l b c b c 0 this equation can be rewritten in the following form 22 t a d l b c t b c l a d b c b c a d a c the left hand sides of eqs 20 and 22 are identical then these two

iteration method e g the bisection method used in this study then the variable vectors in eqs 11 15 is determined and the eccentricity of shackle can be calculated using the vectors 26 e h e v t r e b c b c c e the angle between fluke and anchor line tension at shackle θ f s can be calculated by 27 θ f s arctan e v e h as mentioned by cong et al 2017 the bridle shank of vlas would eventually reach a steady state in which it does not reconfigure any further and the vlas behave the same as deas therefore when the shackle eccentricity is known the ultimate embedment depth of vlas can be determined by the analytical solution for deas such as the solution proposed by tian et al 2015a instead this paper proposed a new form of analytical solution with less simultaneous equations thus the iterative solution for it is simpler the derivation of this new analytical solution will be presented in the following 3 2 yield surface at the ultimate equilibrium state when the anchor reaches the ultimate equilibrium state the moment m acting on the fluke is zero then the yield surface eq 2 may be written as 28 f v v m a x q 1 h h m a x n p 0 the normal and tangential capacities under pure loading v m a x and h m a x increase with the undrained shear strength of soil s u 29 v m a x v s a f s u v s a f s u m k y c h m a x h s a f s u h s a f s u m k y c where v s v m a x a f s u and h m a x a f s u are the capacities that normalized by the fluke area a f and strength s u substituting eq 29 the yield surface eq 28 turns into 30 f t s sin θ f s w sin θ f v s a f s u m k y c q t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u m k y c n p 1 0 3 3 anchor line solution at the ultimate equilibrium state based on geometry it is obvious that the difference between the depths of shackle y s and fluke centroid y c is 31 δ y y c y s e v sin θ f e h cos θ f moreover the anchor line angle at shackle θ s relates to the fluke inclination θ f and the angle between the fluke and anchor line at shackle θ f s as 32 θ s π 2 θ f s θ f substituting eqs 31 and 32 the anchor line solution eq 6 can be rewritten as follows 33 cos θ m μ sin θ m e μ π 2 θ f s θ f θ m cos π 2 θ f s θ f μ sin π 2 θ f s θ f e n d b a r n c s u m y

f n p 1 h s a f s u m k y c t s cos θ f s w cos θ f h s a f s u m k y c n p 1 the vertical displacement of fluke δ y in the global coordinate system can be evaluated as 35 δ y sin θ f δ v cos θ f δ h as δ y is zero at ultimate equilibrium state this equation can be written as 36 δ h δ v tan θ f substituting eq 34 into the left hand side of this equation it can be derived that 37 sign h n p q v s h

at shackle t s can be determined by solving this non linear equation system using newton raphson method the details of the n r iteration algorithm are given in appendix a as will be demonstrated in section 5 2 the effects of submerged weight of fluke w on ued can be neglected in some cases if w 0 the f 1 and f 3 in eq 38 can be rewritten to the following forms 39 η 1 sin θ f s v s a f q η 1 cos θ f s h s a f n p 1 0 40 θ f arctan sign h n p q v s h s η 1 sin θ f s v s a f 1 q η 1 cos θ f s h s a f n p 1 where 41 η 1 t s s u m k y c in eq 39 and the right hand side of eq 40 there is only one unknown variable η 1 the variable η 1 can be determined by solving eq 39 then the fluke angle θ f can be calculated by eq 40 finally substituting the obtained η 1 and θ f the f 2 in eq 38 can be rewritten as a quadratic equation of fluke depth y c as follows 42 a y c 2 b y c c 0 where the coefficients are 43 a k e n d b a r n c 1 μ 2 b 2 e n d b a r n c 1 μ 2 s u m k e h cos θ f e v sin θ f η

analytical method include i it can determine the ultimate state of a reconfigurable shank ii it can directly predict the ued of a drag anchor with a reconfigurable or fixed shank iii it has less simultaneous equations thus the iterative solution may be simpler as mentioned in the introduction analytical solutions for ued were proposed by tian et al 2015a and liu et al 2010 respectively their methods only focus on the anchor with a fixed shackle eccentricity to the authors knowledge the only study on the reconfiguration of the bridle shank was conducted in the authors previous work cong et al 2017 in which the whole diving process can be simulated in this section the present new method is firstly compared with the analytical methods from tian et al and liu et al in predicting the ued of a drag anchor with a fixed shank and then compared with the simulation method of cong et al 2017 in predicting the ued of a vla with a bridle shank 4 1 comparison with other analytical solution based on plasticity approach as mentioned before tian et al 2015a proposed an analytical solution which is also based on the plasticity approach to validate the new form equation system proposed in section 3 5 the variation of ued with respect to the eccentric ratio e h e v is calculated and compared with the results from tian et al 2015a as shown in fig 7 the parameters used for the computation are listed in table 1 it can be seen from fig 7 that the same results can be obtained by a more concise solution with less effort in implementing the iteration algorithm it can also be observed that the shank dimension has significant effects on the ued this will be discussed in detail in section 5 2 with focus on the bridle length of vlas 4 2 comparison with the analytical formula based on force equilibrium analysis besides the analytical solutions based on plasticity approach liu et al 2010 reported an analytical formula based on the equilibrium forces acting on the anchor and embedded drag line to predict the ued of drag anchor in both clay and sand based on that formula liu et al studied the effects of the angle between fluke and tension θ f s the anchor line diameter d b a r and the soil strength gradient k the same parametric studies are also conducted here using the present analytical solution and the results are compared as listed in table 3 the detailed parameters are listed in table 1 the data in table 3 demonstrates that the results of the present solution show similar trends with the results from liu et al however the present solution generally predicts larger ued than lius results this may be because that the fluke weight is considered in this study as will be shown in section 5 2 the neglect of fluke weight could result in obvious decrease in ued 4 3 comparison with the simulation method based on plasticity approach the simulation method from cong et al 2017 is summarized by the algorithm shown in fig 8 in this section the full trajectory are simulated by the algorithm thus the ued can be obtained fig 9 shows the predictive trajectories from simulations with the length of front bridle varying from 0 468 m to 2 34 m i e the ratio between the lengths of front and rear bridles l b c l a d termed as bridle ratio in the following varying from 0 2 to 1 0 the other parameters used in the simulation are given in table 1 the predictive trajectories confirmed that the vlas would eventually reach to an ultimate embedment depth like deas as inferred in the introduction the ultimate embedment depth and eccentricity obtained from the trajectories and the present analytical solution are compared in table 4 it can be seen that the results especially the eccentricity from analytical solution are very close to the simulation results which means the analytical solution is rational 5 behaviors of the stevmanta vlas at the ultimate equilibrium state it is easy to deduce that the behaviors of the stevmanta vlas at the ultimate equilibrium state are determined by the shank dimensions chain parameters and the yield surface parameters of the fluke ideally a vla at the ultimate state would stop diving and keep translating horizontally in practical engineering vlas need to be well designed to have deeper embedment larger bearing capacity under loading and be easier to be installed from the perspective of mechanics these preferred criteria are i larger y c ii larger t m or t s in loading mode iii smaller t m or t s in installation mode iv limited embedment loss from installation mode to loading mode in order to optimize the anchor design a series of parametric study are carried out to investigate the effects of the shank dimensions and yield surface parameters furthermore the effects of the chain parameters are also discussed since the chain parameters in the literature are in a relatively large range the benchmark values and sensitivity study ranges of those parameters are listed in table 5 5 1 mathematical analysis on the solution of equation system before discussing the sensitivity of t s and y c on the parameters in table 5 effort has been paid to discover the relationship between each parameter and t s y c by mathematical derivation it may be helpful to understand the phenomenon in sections 5 2 5 4 to achieve meaningful conclusions by mathematical derivation simplicity must be done by neglecting the fluke weight it will be demonstrated in section 5 2 that the fluke weight can be neglected in some cases the assumption of zero fluke weight may not has obvious effects on qualitatively predicting the effects of each parameter on t s y c as derived before if w 0 the f 1 in the equation system eq 38 can be rewritten to the following form 45 η 1 sin θ f s v s a f q η 1 cos θ f s h s a f n p 1 0 where 46 η 1 t s s u m k y c the above equation can be rewritten to 47 t s η 1 s u m k y c this expression represents a straight line in the t s y c plane as shown in fig 10 the t s intercept and line slope increase with the increase of η 1 it can be observed from eq 45 and eq 46 that η 1 a f is actually the capacity coefficient of fluke so η 1 should increase with the increase of the angle between the fluke and drag force θ f s moreover if w 0 the f 2 in the equation system eq 38 can be rewritten to the following form 48 t s η 2 k y c 2 2 s u m k δ y y c k δ y 2 s u m δ y where 49 η 2 e n d b a r n c 1 μ 2 μ sin θ m cos θ m e μ θ s θ m μ sin θ s cos θ s 50 δ y e v sin θ f e h cos θ f eq 48 represents a parabola in t s y c plane as shown in fig 10 the curve gradient increases with the increase of η 2 the intersection of this parabola and the straight line represented by eq 47 is the solution for the ultimate embedment depth and drag force y c t s it can be observed from eq 49 that the coefficient η 2 of parabola depends on the following parameters the lumped multiplier e n d b a r n c the friction coefficient μ the anchor line angle at mudline θ m and the anchor line angle at shackle θ s it is obvious that η 2 increases with the increase of e n d b a r n c moreover it can be demonstrated that η 2 also changes monotonously with μ θ m and θ s the details of the demonstration are given in appendix b the parameters e n d b a r n c μ and θ m only affect the coefficient η 2 of parabola but they have no effect on the straight line therefore their influences on the solution y c t s can be determined by analyzing the effects of η 2 it can be seen from fig 10 that y c t s decreases with the increase of η 2 then the effects of the parameters on the solution can be determined as listed in table 6 when the depth y c is relatively large the low order terms in eq 47 an y c η 1 η 2 d eq 48 can be neglected then it can be deduced that 51 y c η 1 η 2 it can be observed from eqs 46 49 and 51 the parameters η 1 and k have no effect on the solution when the ultimate embedment depth is relatively large the effects of the parameters discussed above on the η 2 y c t s and θ f s are summarized in table 6 it should be noted that the parameters θ s and θ f s correlate with each other as they both depend on the yield surface and anchor dimensions their combined effects on solution cannot be determined directly the effects of θ s and e n d b a r n c listed in table 6 are derived without considering the correlation between them 5 2 effects of the shank dimensions with a 2d assumption the shank dimensions include the relative positions of points a b c d e and f in fig 3 in the present analytical solution the effects of the shank dimensions embody in changing the eccentricity ie e v and e h and the eccentricity is mainly determined by the ratio of the front bridle length to the rear bridle length which is termed as bridle ratio in this study figs 11 14 show the results from the analytical solution with the bridle ratio l b c l a d varying from 0 2 to 1 2 the parameters taken in the parametric study are listed in tables 1 and 5 it easy to infer that the vertical eccentricity e h and drag angle θ f s will increase with the increase of bridle ratio while the horizontal eccentricity e h will decrease the curves shown in figs 11 and 12 are consistent with this if the anchor transforms from installation mode to loading mode i e the mooring point moves from shackle e to f see fig 3 the general dimension before the shackle will increase and the dimension behind will decrease then similar to the situation that the bridle ratio increases the θ f s will increase therefore the θ f s in loading mode is larger around 12 in this case than that in installation mode this means a greater capacity coefficient in loading mode moreover the fluke moving direction will develop from tangential to normal direction of fluke as θ f s increases from zero to 90 in addition the fluke should move horizontally in ultimate equilibrium state then the vertical inclination of fluke θ f should decrease with the increase of bridle ratio as shown in fig 12 unlike θ f s and θ f that change monotonously with bridle ratio the anchor line angel θ s increases firstly and then decreases the ultimate embedment depth calculated by eqs 42 44 without considering the fluke weight are shown in fig 14 along with the results from equation system eq 38 that considering the fluke weight it can be seen that the results regardless of weight are smaller because the weight is beneficial for a deeper depth the fluke is prone to penetrate into the soil when the force acts on the direction parallel to fluke therefore as the angle between weight and fluke θ f increases with bridle ratio see fig 12 the effects of weight also increase with bridle ratio as shown in fig 14 and the weight can be neglected when the bridle ratio is relatively low although the weight can not be neglected in the whole range of bridle ratio from the view point of quantitative analysis the results obtained in section 5 1 can be used here to reveal the variation mechanism of ultimate embedment depth and capacity as demonstrated in section 5 1 the coefficient η 1 see fig 10 increases with the increase of θ f s and η 2 decreases with the increase of θ s in addition the angle θ f s increases with the increase of bridle ratio while the angle θ s increases firstly and then decreases therefore the coefficient η 1 increases with the increase of bridle ratio and η 2 decreases firstly and then increases from fig 10 it can be seen that pure increasing in η 1 will increase the solution y c t s and pure increasing in η 2 will decrease the solution eventually due to the combined effects of η 1 and η 2 the solution y c t s should increase firstly and then decrease as shown in figs 13 and 14 in addition owing to the influence of θ f s the bridle ratio when y c t s reaches peak should be larger than that when θ s reaches peak in order to guide the optimization design in practice some key values are also discussed here from the perspective of criteria ii and iii a proper bridle ratio would give a larger t in loading mode and smaller t in installation mode a capacity performance ratio is defined as the ratio between t m in loading mode and that in installation mode it can be seen from fig 13 that an optimal range of the bridle ratio is from 0 6 to 0 72 for extreme small or large values of bridle ratio the ultimate embedment depth and holding capacity are nearly zero as shown in figs 14 and 13 so those values of bridle ratio are invalid in practice according to the results of the installation mode the optimal bridle ratio would be l b c l a d 0 85 at which the anchor is at the deepest embedment however the anchor may experience an extreme loading and further moving in loading mode for the case of l b c l a d 0 85 the anchor may be pulled out from a depth of 110m y c in installation mode to 10m y c in loading mode under an extreme loading the potential embedment loss may lead to a great loss in bearing capacity therefore a depth performance ratio is defined as the ratio between y c in loading mode and that in installation mode from the perspective of criterion iv an optimal range of the bridle ratio is also from 0 6 to 0 72 5 3 effects of the yield surface parameters as stated in section 2 1 among the yield surface parameters v m a x is less affected by the fluke shape and the parameters n p and q have much less influences on the yield loci shape compared to h m a x moreover the fluke shape has significant influences on the horizontal capacity h m a x therefore h m a x should be studies in detail to guide the optimization design of the anchor the horizontal capacity h m a x listed in table 2 varies from 1 95 to 4 65 and the ratio h m a x v m a x varies from 0 17 to 0 29 thus a sensitivity study is carried out by varying the ratio h m a x v m a x from 0 15 to 0 35 while keeping the other yield surface parameters constant the ultimate embedment depth and tension forces are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 it can be seen that both the ultimate depth y c and anchor line tension at mudline t m decrease with the increase of the ratio h m a x v m a x therefore a minimal horizontal resistance h m a x is preferred in practice in order to minimizing h m a x a sharp edged or wedge shaped fluke and a shank with small profile e g bridle shank can be considered in design to have a clearer view focusing on the above mentioned criteria i iv the capacity performance ratio and the depth performance ratio are plotted in figs 17 and 18 respectively it can be seen that the increase of h m a x v m a x leads to obvious decrease of the proper range ratio 1 0 of the bridle ratio from the perspective of criterion iv a maximum bridle ratio can be define using depth performance ratio equals 1 0 no embedment loss or 0 8 20 embedment loss as shown in fig 19 combining criterion ii the lower limit of the bridle ratio can be defined with certain bearing capacity 50 t m p e a k or 80 t m p e a k according to the results in fig 13 the lower limits for l b c l a d are also plotted in fig 19 thus a proper value of l b c l a d for a vla can be selected 5 4 effects of the chain parameters 5 4 1 anchor line friction coefficient μ it is recommended by dnv veritas 2000 that the value of anchor line friction coefficient μ should be in the range of 0 1 0 3 and 0 6 0 8 for chain and wire in clay respectively moreover neubecker and randolph 1995 suggested μ should be in the range of 0 4 0 6 for chain while zhang et al 2014 suggested the range should be 0 1 0 6 therefore to study the effects of μ values of μ varying from 0 1 to 0 7 were considered in this section with results shown in figs 20 24 it can be seen that both the ultimate embedment depth y c and anchor line tensions t s and t m increase with the increase of μ as shown in figs 20 22 this is consistent with the results obtained in section 5 1 on the other hand the capacity performance ratio and the valid range of bridle ratio for capacity performance ratio decrease within limited range with the increase of μ see fig 23 while the depth performance ratio is nearly not affected by μ see fig 24 moreover the influences of μ on anchor line tension at mudline t m are more obvious than that at shackle t s the reason for this is that the soil friction along the embedded anchor line makes a direct contribution to t m as noted by eq 7 5 4 2 anchor line bearing parameters e n d b a r and n c the multiplier of effective width e n nominal anchor line diameter d b a r and bearing capacity factor n c appear together as lumped multiplier in the anchor line solution eq 6 so they are combined together in this parametric study as the anchor line of vlas is usually a wire e n is taken 1 0 in this study liu et al 2010 summarized the suggested value of n c for the embedded wire and chain from different researchers the value of n c varies in the range 7 6 14 therefore a parametric study of e n d b a r n c b 0 3 0 9 is conducted with results shown in figs 25 28 it is observed that both the ultimate depth y c and anchor line tension at mudline t m decrease with the increase of e n d b a r n c see figs 25 and 26 this is consistent with the results obtained in section 5 1 on the other hand e n d b a r n c almost has no influence on the capacity and depth performance ratios see figs 27 and 28 5 4 3 anchor line angle at mudline θ m a parametric study of θ m varying from 0 to 50 was conducted covering the practical range of anchor line angle for catenary and taut moorings in loading mode with results shown in figs 29 32 it is found that both the ultimate depth y c and the anchor line tension at mudline t m decrease with the increase of θ m as shown in figs 29 and 30 this is consistent with the results obtained in section 5 1 unlike the other two chain parameters i e μ and e n d b a r n c θ m also has a significant influence on the capacity and depth performance ratios see figs 31 and 32 both the capacity and depth performance ratios and the valid range of bridle ratio for the performance ratios decrease with the increase of θ m for the case of θ m 50 the capacity and depth performance ratios are less than 1 0 for all bridle ratio so embedment loss under extreme loading cannot be avoided by adjusting the bridle ratio 6 discussions and conclusions this paper has proposed an analytical solution to predict the ultimate embedment depth ued and holding capacity of vertically loaded anchors vlas with a reconfigurable bridle shank compared to the methods that predict the ued by simulating the entire embedment process the present method is easy to implement and time saving comparative studies are performed to test the present solution the results agree well with the results from tian el al 2015 and cong et al 2017 the formula from liu et al 2010 generally underestimate the ued than the present solution this is because that the fluke weight is not considered in the formula neglecting the fluke weight it can be demonstrated by mathematical derivation that the ued i decreases with the increase of e n d b a r n c θ f s and θ m ii increases with the increase of μ and θ s iii is not affected by k and s u m when the ued is relatively deep parametric studies are also conducted to investigate the behaviors of vlas with consideration of the fluke weight the studies indicate that the shank dimensions yield surface parameters and chain properties have significant effects on the ued from the viewpoint of maximizing the ued the following principle may be followed in design i the optimal value of bridle length should be determined by a compromise between performances in installation and loading modes ii sharp edged or wedge shaped fluke and thin shank is preferred iii fine and rough anchor line is beneficial iv low anchor line angle at mudline is better although this study brings to light several significant aspects on the ued of vlas there are some deficiencies for example i there are uncertainties in selecting the yield surface parameters from the results of simplified fluke it is anticipated that the yield surface of the real anchor with complex shape could be adopted in future studies ii in practice the vlas are subjected to 3d loading from anchor handling vessels or floating structures the method proposed in this paper could be expanded to 3d condition by introducing a 3d form yield surface and a method to determining the 3d configuration of shank acknowledgments this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china grant no 51639002 41772296 51679038 appendix a newton raphson iteration algorithm of

go to step 2 b demonstration of the monotonicity of η 2 for simplicity eq 49 can be written to the following form b 1 η 2 m 1 m 2 m 3 where b 2 m 1 e n d b a r n c m 2 1 μ 2 m 3 μ sin θ m cos θ m e μ θ s θ m μ sin θ s cos θ s it is obvious that b 3 m 1 0 b 4 m 2 0 from the anchor line solution eq 6 it can be deduced that b 5 θ m 0 π 2 θ s 0 π 2 θ s θ m m 3 0 b 1 monotonicity of η 2 on μ it can be seen from eq b 1 and eq b 2 that m 1 has no effect on the monotonicity of η 2 upon μ so it is discarded in the following derivation then the first derivation of η 2 with respect to μ can be derived

22661,ship impact force is usually taken as an equivalent static force in current bridge design which is however limited on effectively capturing the dynamic amplification effects to this end this work proposes a simplified analytical model for predicting the time history of ship impact loading on bridges to validate the fe modeling techniques used in capturing the impact loading drop hammer impact tests are carried out using scaled steel boxes then fe models of 5 typical ships are developed and numerical simulations are conducted to generate the 45 benchmark impact force time history curves which are used to determine the parameters introduced in the proposed simplified analytical model the efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated by a case study involving two bridge models as presented in this paper it is shown that the proposed simplified analytical model is capable of predicting the time history of impact loading with sufficient accuracy for ship bridge collision events when the basic structural frequency of the bridge pier is within 3 hz keywords ship bridge collision dynamic amplification effects simplified analytical model impact test numerical simulation 1 introduction bridge collapse incidents caused by vessel collisions had resulted in great casualties and economic losses in the past decades larsen 1993 which have drawn a lot of concern on the safety of bridge subjected to vessel collisions in order to design bridge piers which can resist such impact the impact loads need to be accurately defined the equivalent static load formulas provided by aashto guide specification aashto 1991 are widely used for estimating the impact force however the equivalent static analysis method is not able to account for the dynamic amplification effects during an impact event the high resolution finite element fe simulation technique has been proved reliable sha and hao 2013 kantrales et al 2015 wang et al 2018 and thus extensively used in the ship bridge collision analysis consolazio et al 2008 wang et al 2011 sha and hao 2014 however the high resolution fe simulation is time consuming for both modelling and analysis therefore several different types of efficient analytical models consolazio et al 2008 were proposed previously to predict the dynamic impact load on bridges mainly including the impact response spectrum analysis model irsa the coupled vessel impact analysis model cvia and the applied vessel impact load time history model avil for the irsa to determine the total maximum responses the corresponding modal combination rules were investigated consolazio et al 2008 fan and yuan 2012 cowan et al 2015 fan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in addition the linear impact response spectrum is further extended to account for the system nonlinearity by the linearization process consolazio et al 2008 cowan et al 2015 however the time history curves of responses which is important in tracking the damage evolution of structural members cannot be obtained by irsa in the cvia model the impacting barge is idealized as a single degree of freedom system consisting of a concentrated mass equal to the mass of the vessel and a nonlinear spring representing the crushing barge bow the validity of the cvia technique has been substantiated using experimental results consolazio et al 2006 consolazio et al 2008 and fe simulation results fan et al 2010 fan and yuan 2014a 2014b wang and morgenthal 2017 2018 a key point of the cvia model is to determine the bow force deformation relationship a lot of research have focus on this topic in literature pedersen et al 1993 cowan 2007 fan and yuan 2014a 2014b wang and morgenthal 2017 2018 nevertheless the bow force deformation relationships in these studies were obtained limited on the single vessel from the practical design point of view a more generic empirical model is desired to determine the simplified bow force deformation relationship for the given ship parameters therefore further investigations are required to accumulate adequate experimental or fe simulation data for the avil as an alternative to the cvia model the impact load time history is externally applied to the bridge structure and the traditional dynamic analysis is performed to determine the dynamic responses simplified impact load time history models for inland and seagoing vessels were introduced to the eurocode provisions en 1991 these models however are highly schematic due to the lacking of effective values for model parameters the analytical procedure to determine the impact load time history for the single barge consolazio et al 2008 and for the multi barge flotilla yuan and harik 2008 yuan et al 2008 were both proposed moreover the analytical procedure was also proposed to determine the simplified impact force time history for ships fan and yuan 2014a 2014b fan et al 2016 however the above avil technique involves pre computing the impact force time history based on the simplified barge bow force deformation relationships obviously in this case the avil technique proposed by consolazio and fan is less convenient than the cvia to overcome the limitation an empirical barge impact force time history model which is independent of the barge bow force deformation relationship and can be determined directly by the barge mass impact velocity and the pier shape was proposed sha and hao 2012 2013 2014 nevertheless further investigations are required to establish such empirical impact load models for ship bridge collision analysis in this paper an empirical impact load time history model accounting for ship size and impact velocity is established to substitute the complex finite element models for ship bridge collision analysis the drop hammer impact test using two scaled steel boxes is conducted to evaluate the validity of the numerical simulation techniques then the numerical models of 5 typical ships are developed and 45 impact force time history curves are obtained using the numerical simulations a modified half sine wave function is proposed to simplify the impact force time history and the corresponding model parameters are determined based on the 45 benchmark impact force time history curves at last based on two bridge cases the responses predicted by the simplified analytical model are compared with the results predicted by the full ship impact analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction 2 numerical modeling of ship collision 2 1 experimental impact tests the drop hammer impact tests are performed using two identical steel boxes labelled 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 the prototype of the steel box is the crashworthy device against vessel collisions of the zhongxian yangtze river bridge in china and the scale is 1 4 determined by the installing space of the drop hammer impact machine the cross sectional configurations and dimensions of the scaled steel boxes are shown in fig 2 the overall dimensions of the scaled steel box are 1400 mm in length 1000 mm in width and 500 mm in height the scaled steel box is comprised of welded steel plates of 4 62 mm in thickness the impact tests are conducted on a drop hammer impact machine which is comprised of the drop hammer and the striking head attached to the bottom of the drop hammer as shown in fig 3 the weight of the hammer is 9 77 tons the configuration of the striking head is shown in fig 4 the hammer would be raised to the specified height of 1 8 m and 4 1 m respectively and the corresponding impact velocity is 5 94 m s and 8 97 m s for each box respectively as shown in fig 3 during the impact test the time history of acceleration of the drop hammer is measured by the accelerometer located at the center of the top plate of the drop hammer as shown in fig 5 since the stiffness of the drop hammer is strong enough compared with the scaled steel boxes the drop hammer can be treated as a rigid body thus the impact force time history during the impact test can be determined by the mass and the acceleration of the drop hammer based on the second newton s law the displacements of the steel boxes after impact are measured by hand as shown in fig 6 the deformation of the two boxes after impact is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that fracture occurs on the top plate at the junction between the top plate and the transverse plate of the scaled steel boxes concaves with around 15 cm and 26 cm in depth appear at the top steel plate of 1 and 2 scaled steel box after impact respectively the accelerations of the impactor recorded during the tests are plotted in fig 8 where g is the gravity acceleration 2 2 validation the finite element models of the scaled steel box and the drop hammer are developed based on their true configurations as shown in fig 9 the scaled steel box is modelled using four node shell elements with a mesh size of 5 mm the drop hammer is modelled with hexahedron solid elements the drop hammer is modelled here using rigid material model mat rigid in ls dyna as the deformation is negligible during impact the density of 7850 kg m3 young s modulus of 2 105 mpa and the poisson s ratio of 0 3 are used respectively the initial velocities of 5 94 m s and 8 97 m s are defined for the drop hammer respectively and gravitational effects during the impact are taken into account contact between the drop hammer and the box contact automatic surface to surface and the contact among members inside the box contact automatic single surface are both defined the value of the friction coefficient for steel steel is 0 15 knott et al 2009 the scaled steel box is modelled using the elastic plastic constitutive model with an arbitrary stress versus strain curve mat piecewise linear plasticity hallquist 2007 and the true stress strain relationship of the steel obtained from the un axial tension experiment is plotted in fig 10 the strain rate effect on the material property is considered using the cowper symonds equation as follows hallquist 2007 1 σ y 1 ε c 1 q σ y 0 e p ε e f f p where ε is the strain rate σ y0 is the initial yield strength ε e f f p is the effective plastic strain e p is the plastic hardening modulus c and q are the parameters of the cowper symonds equation the values 40 4 and 5 0 for c and q are suggested to account for the strain rate effect for mild steel in this paper cowper and symonds 1957 jones 2011 to investigate the strain rate effect upon the responses of the steel boxes fe simulations with and without strain rate effect are both performed the time histories of acceleration of the drop hammer for each case predicted by numerical simulations are plotted in fig 8 overall the acceleration predicted by fe simulation with considering the strain rate effect are in good agreement with the experimental results however without considering the strain rate effect the acceleration magnitude is underestimated by fe simulation hence the strain rate effect on material property should be incorporated into the fe simulation which is modelled by using the cowper symonds equation and the suggested values of c and q for the mild steel are 40 4 and 5 0 respectively in addition obvious initial oscillations are observed in the time histories of accelerations of the experimental results it may be caused by the initial lateral vibration of the drop hammer which is induced by the interaction between the hammer and the guiding track device of the machine since the guiding track device are not modelled in the fe simulation such phenomenon has not been captured by fe simulations the cross sectional deformation profiles at section d d of the scaled steel boxes obtained from the numerical simulation are depicted together with the experimental results in fig 11 it can be seen that the deformation profiles of the steel boxes generated by fe simulations are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental test results the maximum indentations from the impact tests for the two cases are 168 mm and 258 mm respectively and the corresponding results from the numerical simulations are 155 mm and 260 mm respectively with the relative errors of 7 and 1 respectively the overall deformations of the scaled steel boxes after impact predicted by fe simulation are illustrated together with the experimental results as shown in fig 12 according to figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that the deformation of the scaled steel boxes can be reasonably predicted by the numerical simulations developed in this paper on the basis of the above discussion the finite element modeling techniques discussed above are used for the ship bridge collision analysis in the following sections 2 3 description of ships according to the present situation of the waterway shipping in china 5 typical ships between 500 dead weight tons dwt and 5000 dwt are selected and the feature parameters are listed in table 1 the bow structure of each ship is shown in fig 13 the ship bridge collision process is extremely complex and the determination of the impact load depends on many factors such as structural type shape of the ship s bow the stiffness of the bridge pier knott et al 2009 the absorbed energy by the ship or bridge structure increases with the impact angle and the friction coefficient saul and svensson 1982 however in order to simplify the study the ship rigid wall head on collision model is adopted in this manuscript as shown in fig 14 in which the rigid wall has six degrees of freedom on its mass center and are all fixed the reasons for using the ship rigid wall head on collision model in the study are as follows first the crushing load of a ship s bow is an upper limit for the collision force on the bridge larsen 1993 moreover the upper limit of the impact load can be obtained by assuming the bridge as a rigid structure vrouwenvelder 1997 according to the eurocode provision en 1991 impact by ships against solid structures should normally be considered as hard impact and the kinetic energy is dissipated by the elastic or plastic deformation of the ship itself in addition the head on collision condition impact angle is 90 results in the maximum energy to be absorbed by the ship saul and svensson 1982 which would lead to a maximum deformation of the ship and an upper limit of the collision force therefore the ship rigid wall head on collision model will generate a larger impact load which is in line with the safe principle of engineering design to adopt conservative loads however developing the impact load model accounting for oblique collisions as well as the effects of the bridge stiffness is also necessary and will be dealt with in the future work 2 4 finite element models the finite element models of 5 typical ships are developed based on the true configurations as shown in fig 15 for the ship rigid wall head on collision the bow structure undergoes direct contact with the rigid wall and thus is expected to have dramatic deformations therefore the bow part is modeled using a fine mesh and the ship body is modeled relatively coarser as shown in fig 15 the thicknesses of hull plates are between 10 mm and 16 mm the ship is modelled using four node shell elements and the rigid wall is modelled using hexahedron solid elements the bow part is modelled using the elastic plastic constitutive model mat plastic kinematic in ls dyna and the ship body is modelled using the rigid material model mat rigid the corresponding parameters of the material models for the ship are available in ref wang et al 2011 as tabulated in table 2 and the cowper symonds constants with c 40 4 s 1 and q 5 0 are used cowper and symonds 1957 jones 2011 to consider the strain rate effect the rigid wall is here modelled using the rigid material model mat rigid and the corresponding parameters of the rigid wall are determined by the chinese standard jtgd60 2015 according to the c40 concrete as tabulated in table 2 where e is the young s modulus and ν is the poisson s ratio contact between the ship and the rigid wall and the contact among the members inside the ship are both defined according to the german standard english 1982 the minimum and the maximum values of the friction coefficient for steel concrete are 0 3 and 0 4 according to the aashto guide specification knott et al 2009 the recommended values of the friction coefficient for steel concrete and steel steel are 0 35 and 0 15 respectively therefore the values of friction coefficient of 0 30 and 0 15 for steel concrete and steel steel are used in this paper based on the ship rigid wall head on collision model and the finite element models of 5 ships in this paper 9 impact velocities ranging from 1 m s to 5 m s with increment of 0 5 m s are defined for each ship and 45 ship impact force time history curves in total are obtained by numerical simulations typical curves of the numerical impact force time history and the deformation time history of the ship are plotted in fig 16 it can be seen that the impact force time history could be divided into 3 periods the initial stage during which the impact force increases rapidly the middle stage during which the impact force fluctuates and the final stage during which the impact force decreases rapidly after the ship separates from the rigid wall the crushing of the 5000 dwt ship after impact with an impact velocity of 3 m s is shown in fig 17 the initial kinematic energy of the ship is fully absorbed by the ship bow and the maximum crush depth is 1 42 m at 0 8 s in order to observe the characteristics of the numerical impact force time history f t the dimensionless time τ is defined as 2 τ t t define the average impact force over the impact duration t as f mean 3 f m e a n i 0 t and define the non dimensional impact force time history as β τ 4 β τ f τ t f m e a n in eq 3 i 0 is the impulse of the impact force time history 5 i 0 0 t f t d t 3 analytical modeling of ship collision 3 1 analytical method according to eq 4 and 45 curves of β τ corresponding to 45 impact force time history curves are obtained as shown in fig 18 it can be seen that most curves of the impact force time history are flat in the middle phase and the peak value usually occurs in the front or rear part of the time history curve therefore to establish a simplified impact load model a half sine wave function modified with a parabolic expression is proposed to capture the above features of the impact force time history the function has the following form 6 f s t c 1 α 1 t t α 2 t t 2 sin π t t 0 t t where f s t is the simplified analytical impact load model c α 1 and α 2 are constants needing to be quantified 3 2 model parameters in previous studies consolazio et al 2008 fan et al 2010 fan and yuan 2014a 2014b parameters of the impact force time history model are generally determined according to the physical conditions i e the principles of energy conservation and linear momentum however such procedures are developed based on the cvia model and in this case cvia can be used directly in bridge design as an alternative approach the equivalent moment method is used in the paper to determine the values of model parameters of simplified analytical model several assumptions are adopted here to determine the parameters c α 1 and α 2 1 the simplified analytical model shares the same impulse with the numerical impact force time history 2 the simplified analytical model shares the same centroid position of vertical axis with the numerical impact force time history 3 the numerical impact force time history and the simplified analytical model share a same rotary radius these three assumptions are used to make the amplitude distribution of the simplified analytical impact load model similar to the numerical impact force time history in the time domain the mathematical expressions of the three principles are as follows 7a 0 t f s t d t 0 t f t d t i 0 7b 0 t t f s t d t 0 t t f t d t i 1 i 0 t c 7c 0 t t t c 2 f s t d t 0 t t t c 2 f t d t i 2 where t c is the centroid position of the numerical impact force time history i 1 is the 1st order moment about force axis of the numerical impact force time history and i 2 is the 2nd order moment about centroid axis of the numerical impact force time history the expressions of c α 1 and α 2 are derived from eq 7 as shown in eq 8 8a c i 0 π 2 t 1 1 1 2 α 1 1 2 1 4 π 2 α 2 8b α 1 2 24 π 2 a a 2 τ c τ c η a 2 b a b 12 π 2 a 1 a b 12 π 2 a 1 τ c τ c η b a 2 a 12 π 2 a 2 b 2 8c α 2 a 2 b τ c τ c η 2 a 1 b a 2 a b 12 π 2 a 1 τ c τ c η b a 2 a 12 π 2 a 2 b 2 where a 1 4 π 2 b 1 6 π 2 τ c t c t and η i 2 t i 1 τ c hence eq 6 could be rewritten as 9a f s t f m e a n π 2 α 1 1 4 π 2 α 2 1 α 1 t t α 2 t t 2 sin π t t 0 t t 9b t i 0 f m e a n where values of i 0 f mean τ c and η are required to be determined for the simplified analytical load model according to the above procedures based on the impact force time history curves obtained by numerical simulations and the above procedures the typical curves of the simplified analytical model are plotted together with the numerical impact force time history curves as illustrated in fig 19 3 2 1 empirical formulas of model parameters for discrete dwt of ships the ratio about the impulse of the impact force time history and the initial momentum of the ship is defined as 10 α 3 i 0 m v 0 where i 0 is in mn s m is the mass of the ship in ton and v 0 is the impact velocity in m s the values of α 3 corresponding to the 45 impact force time history curves are drawn in fig 20 it can be seen that values of α 3 are in the range between 1 04 and 1 12 and the value of α 3 tends to decrease as the impact velocity increases the reason is that when the impact velocity increases the ratio of the elastic energy to the plastic energy absorbed by the ship s bow decreases overall the value of α 3 has a minor dispersion and the maximum relative error is 4 when the mean value of 1 07 is used as shown in fig 20 the values of f mean corresponding to the 45 impact force time histories are listed in table 3 it can be seen that f mean increases with the increase of ship mass and impact velocity the relationship between f mean and v 0 for each ship is regressed by a power function as expressed in eq 11 11 f m e a n α 4 v 0 0 661 where the unit of f mean is mn the unit of v 0 is m s α 4 is the statistical parameter and its value for each ship is tabulated in table 3 for each ship the goodness of the fitting curve for f mean is depicted in fig 21 then according to eq 10 and eq 11 the impact duration can be determined by eq 9b the samples of τ c and η corresponding to the 45 impact force time history curves are listed in table 4 fig 22 shows the statistical variation of τ c and η corresponding to the 45 impact force time history curves note that the shape of the proposed impact load time history model is determined by the values of τ c and η the relationship of τ c and η with respect to ship mass and impact velocity however is not clear because shape of the impact load time history is influenced by the crushing and failure of the structural members inside the bow which is rather complex hence τ c and η are treated as random variables on the ground of the uncertainty of the bow structures in this study after conducting the hypothesis test both τ c and η follow to a normal distribution as shown in fig 22 according to the 45 pairs of samples of τ c and η the values of η τ c are in the range of 0 106 0 150 in addition τ c is in the range of 0 427 0 590 and η is in the range of 0 561 0 696 as shown in fig 22 hence based on the probability density functions of τ c andη the generated random samples should meet the above two requirements to avoid abnormal cases based on the single degree of freedom sdof system the influence of statistical variation of τ c and η upon the dynamic responses can be evaluated by comparing the responses corresponding to different combinations of values for τ c and η as shown in fig 23 f t τ c η represents the proposed simplified impact force time history determined by using sample values of τ c and η while f t τ c m η m represents the simplified impact force time history determined by the average values of τ c and η i e τ c m 0 509 and η m 0 638 a statistical variation index of response sv is defined to evaluate the influence of the statistical variation of τ c and η on structural responses 12 s v r max τ c η r max τ c m η m where r max τ c η and r max τ c m η m are the maximum dynamic responses produced by f t τ c η and f t τ c m η m respectively the analysis frequency of the sdof system is in the range of 0 1 hz 10 hz which covers the property of regular structures and the damping ratio is set as 5 by solving eqs 12 and 45 curves of sv with respect to different structural frequencies are obtained as shown in fig 24 it indicates that sv nearly equals to 1 0 when f n is below 0 6 hz whilst it fluctuates from 0 75 to 1 35 when the frequency is higher than 0 6 hz compared with the response produced by f t τ c m η m it indicates that the relative error of response introduced by the variation of τ c and η is within 35 in section 4 3 it will be further discussed through two bridge case studies 3 2 2 empirical formulas of model parameters for continuous dwt of ships even though the model parameters for the five ships selected in the study are determined however for other ships outside the five ships the impact force model established for the discrete dwt of ships could not be used therefore for the purpose to facilitate engineering design it is necessary to establish a generic impact force time history model which can account for the main ship parameters including vessel size and impact velocity based on the 45 samples of f mean as listed in table 3 the proposed expression of f mean corresponding to different values of m and v 0 has the following form 13 f m e a n α 5 m γ v 0 λ where α 5 9 45 10 4 γ 1 05 λ 0 62 the values of f mean corresponding to 45 impact force time history curves and the corresponding fitting surface are drawn in fig 25 the same formula established in section 3 2 1 for estimating the impact impulse i 0 is used as shown in eq 10 then based on eq 10 and eq 13 the impact duration t can be estimated by eq 9b 4 analysis of ship collision in bridges a continuous girder bridge and a cable stayed bridge are selected herein to assess the prediction quality of the proposed impact force time history model note that the fe simulations using the full ship impact model fsim are defined as the benchmark simulation 4 1 finite element model and parameters a continuous girder bridge and a cable stayed bridge which have high probability of the collision against ship are chosen as two typical examples to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed simplified impact load model bridge a is totally 440 m long the main span and the side span are 140 m and 80 m respectively each pier is composed of two separated columns with a rectangular cross section the main span of bridge b is 730 m and both the two towers are reverse y type the overall elevations and the configurations of bridge a and bridge b are shown in fig 26 and fig 27 the finite element models of the two bridges are developed as shown in fig 28 the bridge structure is mainly modelled using beam elements including the pier the girder and the pile the pile cap is modelled with hexahedron solid elements to simulate contact interaction between the ship and pile cap for simplification the linear elastic material model mat elastic is used for the concrete and the steel of the bridge structure and the corresponding parameters are tabulated in table 5 the soil is simulated with spring elements and the spring stiffness for the clay layer is determined by the m method which is provided by the chinese standard d63 2007 2007 the stiffness of the horizontal soil spring k mn m is formulated as d63 2007 2007 14 k λ λ f d 1 h m z where d is the diameter of the pile m h is the thickness of the soil layer governed by the spring m m is coefficient of horizontal resistance coefficient for non rock foundation mn m4 z is the soil depth m λ is the interaction coefficient of the soil between the piles and equals to 0 94 and 0 91 for bridge a and bridge b respectively λ f is the pile shape coefficient and equals to 0 9 for circular piles d63 2007 2007 the soil condition and the suggested values d63 2007 2007 b02 01 2008 2008 of m for the two bridges are tabulated in table 6 all of the five ships selected in this study are considered herein to evaluate the validity of the proposed simplified model benchmark simulations using the fsim are required beforehand to obtain the bridge responses as shown in fig 28 and table 7 in order to investigate the influence of the simplifications adopted in developing the simplified analytical model four kinds of impact force time

1991 which is labeled as en in table 7 with the simplified analytical model developed in this paper the impact force time history model provided by the eurocode provision en 1991 for sea going ships was proposed by pedersen pedersen et al 1993 according to the eurocode provision en 1991 the maximum bow collision force f bow is computed as 15a f b o w f 0 l e i m p 5 0 l l 0 6 0 5 f o r e i m p l

are obtained and the impact load corresponding to 5000 dwt of ship impacting at 3 m s is plotted in fig 29 4 2 comparison between numerical and simplified analytical modeling according to table 7 the results corresponding to the impact scenario of 5000 dwt of ship are shown in fig 29 the meanings of symbols involved are explained as follows the displacement of the collided pile cap is denoted as dp and the moment at the pile top is denoted as mpile to assess the prediction accuracy of these impact loads listed in table 7 the relative error of the peak response ε r is defined below 18 ε r r t

the cases listed in table 7 the average values of ε r are listed in table 9 from fig 29 and table 9 some key information could be found 1 the average error of responses predicted srwm is below 4 for the cases of ba 5000 and bb 5000 as shown in fig 29 the impact force time history obtained from srwm is in close agreement with that of fsim especially for the case of bb 5000 the maximum displacement of the pile cap for ba 5000 and bb 5000 is 37 mm and 3 5 mm respectively which is far less than the deformation of the ship 1420 mm fig 17 it indicates that the initial kinematic energy in the two impact cases is mainly dissipated by the ship and thus the rigid bridge assumption can be adopted to determine the impact force on the bridge subjected to ship impact 2 the sms achieves the best prediction accuracy among sms smd and smc with the relative errors below 8 smd also achieves a good prediction accuracy and the maximum relative error is 14 however with incorporating more variables in the empirical expressions for f mean the prediction accuracy of smc is somewhat lower than that of smd with relative errors within 40 therefore the smd model is much preferred to use when the dwt of the ship equals to one of five ships selected in this study 3 it is found that the eurocode s predictions are much higher than the benchmark responses predicted by fsim and are also higher than the responses predicted by smd and smc 4 3 influence of the statistical variation of τ c and η upon structural responses according to fig 24 it can be found that for the structural frequency between 0 6 hz and 2 0 hz which is important to structural responses sv is mainly influenced by τ c and it increases as τ c decreases as shown in fig 24 to evaluate the statistical variation of τ c upon the prediction quality of the impact load of smd a fractile τ c0 for the given cut off probability p 0 is introduced as expressed as follows 19 p 0 τ c 0 f τ c d τ c where f τ c is the probability function of τ c as shown in fig 22 according to table 4 and eq 19 the sample values of 0 508 0 466 and 0 427 for τ c corresponding to 0 98 0 85 and 0 50 of p 0 respectively are selected and the corresponding sample values of 0 638 0 604 and 0 561 for η are determined according to table 4 as shown in table 10 based on the two bridge cases and the benchmark responses predicted by fsim the influence of the statistical variation of τ c and η upon the prediction accuracy of smd is evaluated as tabulated in table 10 comparing fig 24 and table 10 it can be seen that the results based on the case study involving two bridge models are consistent with the results obtained based on the sdof system i e responses predicted by the smd increase as τ c decreases it can be found that the smd corresponding to p 0 0 98 highly overestimated the impact force and thus highly overestimated the bridge structural responses on the other hand the smd corresponding to p 0 0 50 underestimated the impact load to a certain extent the results predicted by smd corresponding to p 0 0 85 are slightly higher than the results of fsim therefore from the perspective of conservative design the values of τ c 0 466 and η 0 604 are recommended for smd 4 4 limitations of the simplified analytical impact load model in order to investigate the conditions in which the proposed simplified analytical impact load model could predict reasonable responses of bridge subjected to ship impact the following analysis are conducted the dynamic equation of the bridge structure under the impact of ships can be expressed as follows chopra 2012 20 m u c u k u s f t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrix respectively u is the vector of the displacement of the bridge s 0 1 0 t is the space distribution vector produced by the impact force f t takes the meaning as before taking a linear transformation u φ q the equation of motion can be transformed to a set of uncoupled equations with modal coordinates q j by multiplying φ j t on both sides of eq 20 21 q j 2 ξ j ω j q j ω j 2 q j γ j f t where φ φ 1 φ 2 φ n is the normalized modal matrix in which φ j t is the mode vector j 1 2 n n is the total number of modes q j is the modal coordinate ξ j γ j and ω j are the modal damping ratio the modal participation factor and the modal circle frequency respectively by means of modal analysis the modal participation factors of bridge a and bridge b are obtained as shown in fig 30 marking q j t γ j δ j t then eq 21 could be rewritten as 22 δ j 2 ξ j ω j δ j ω j 2 δ j f t since the analysis of using the numerical impact force time history of srwm can accurately predict the dynamic response of the bridge subjected to ship impact the results of srwm are defined as the benchmark solution in this section the peak value of δ j t is denoted as δ j max and the peak response ratio r is used to estimate the precision of the simplified analytical model which is expressed as 23 r q j s m d max q j s r w m max γ j δ j s m d max γ j δ j s r w m max δ j s m d max δ j s r w m max where q j s m d max and δ j s m d max are the peak values corresponding to q j t and δ j t by using the impact loads predicted by smd q j s r w m max and δ j s r w m max are the peak values corresponding to q j t and δ j t by using the impact loads estimated by srwm note that the impact loads using the values of τ c and η corresponding to a cut off probability of 0 85 are generated herein as the smd can achieve a higher prediction accuracy in this condition based on the 45 impact force time history curves estimated by srwm and smd the corresponding spectrums of the peak response ratio are obtained by solving eq 22 and eq 23 as plotted in fig 31 the spectrum of r for each ship is the average value of 9 spectrum curves corresponding to 9 impact velocities from fig 31 it can be found that 1 for f n 0 5 hz the value of r is stable and is around 1 0 indicating that the modal responses obtained from the use of the benchmark impact force time history and the simplified analytical impact force time history are almost same 2 for 0 5 hz f n 3 0 hz the value of r is between about 0 8 and 1 5 indicating that the calculation error by smd is within the range from 20 to 50 3 for f n 3 0 hz the calculation error from the use of smd exceeds the value of 20 and increases with the modal frequency to be noticed the above findings are observed based on the sdof system and may not be completely applicable to the multi degree of freedom mdof system it can be known from fig 30 that the important modes with the greatest contribution to the structural response are between 1 0 and 2 5 hz for bridge a and are between 1 5 and 2 0 hz for bridge b according to table 10 the maximum relative error of smd is 23 corresponding to the ship of 3000 2 dwt which is less than 50 and thus confirms these findings obtained from the sdof system as shown in fig 31 therefore it may be concluded based on the two demonstration bridge cases that the simplified analytical model can reasonably predict the response of bridge pier subjected to ship impact when its natural frequency is below 3 hz however the conclusion needs to be further assessed using more bridge models in the future work 5 conclusions this study aims to develop a simplified analytical impact load model for predicting the dynamic responses of the bridge subjected to ship impact the first step in this study is to decouple the interaction between the ship and bridge using the rigid bridge assumption and then the numerical impact force time histories of 5 ships are obtained based on the ship rigid wall collision model next the simplified analytical model and the method to determine its parameters are proposed the prediction quality of the analytical model is well assessed using two bridge models and the conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 1 the fe modeling techniques to capture the impact loads used in this study are validated against experimental impact tests and thus the fe models of 5 ships by employing the discussed fe modeling techniques can reasonably predict the impact loads of ships 2 the ship rigid wall collision model adopted in this study can reasonably predict the ship impact loading on the bridge as the ship bridge collision can generally be regarded as hard impact based on the case studies in this paper using two bridge models 3 the impact force time history obtained from ship rigid wall collision model can be used to substitute the fe models of ship bridge collision events to efficiently predict the bridge responses and the average error of responses is below 4 based on the two demonstration cases 4 the simplified analytical impact load model developed in this paper is capable of reasonably predicting the dynamic responses of the bridge subjected to ship impact the values of τ c 0 466 and η 0 604 for the simplified model are recommended based on the two demonstration cases acknowledgement the research is supported by the national science foundation of china grant number 51438010 51778498 the research program of shanghai science and technology

22661,ship impact force is usually taken as an equivalent static force in current bridge design which is however limited on effectively capturing the dynamic amplification effects to this end this work proposes a simplified analytical model for predicting the time history of ship impact loading on bridges to validate the fe modeling techniques used in capturing the impact loading drop hammer impact tests are carried out using scaled steel boxes then fe models of 5 typical ships are developed and numerical simulations are conducted to generate the 45 benchmark impact force time history curves which are used to determine the parameters introduced in the proposed simplified analytical model the efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated by a case study involving two bridge models as presented in this paper it is shown that the proposed simplified analytical model is capable of predicting the time history of impact loading with sufficient accuracy for ship bridge collision events when the basic structural frequency of the bridge pier is within 3 hz keywords ship bridge collision dynamic amplification effects simplified analytical model impact test numerical simulation 1 introduction bridge collapse incidents caused by vessel collisions had resulted in great casualties and economic losses in the past decades larsen 1993 which have drawn a lot of concern on the safety of bridge subjected to vessel collisions in order to design bridge piers which can resist such impact the impact loads need to be accurately defined the equivalent static load formulas provided by aashto guide specification aashto 1991 are widely used for estimating the impact force however the equivalent static analysis method is not able to account for the dynamic amplification effects during an impact event the high resolution finite element fe simulation technique has been proved reliable sha and hao 2013 kantrales et al 2015 wang et al 2018 and thus extensively used in the ship bridge collision analysis consolazio et al 2008 wang et al 2011 sha and hao 2014 however the high resolution fe simulation is time consuming for both modelling and analysis therefore several different types of efficient analytical models consolazio et al 2008 were proposed previously to predict the dynamic impact load on bridges mainly including the impact response spectrum analysis model irsa the coupled vessel impact analysis model cvia and the applied vessel impact load time history model avil for the irsa to determine the total maximum responses the corresponding modal combination rules were investigated consolazio et al 2008 fan and yuan 2012 cowan et al 2015 fan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in addition the linear impact response spectrum is further extended to account for the system nonlinearity by the linearization process consolazio et al 2008 cowan et al 2015 however the time history curves of responses which is important in tracking the damage evolution of structural members cannot be obtained by irsa in the cvia model the impacting barge is idealized as a single degree of freedom system consisting of a concentrated mass equal to the mass of the vessel and a nonlinear spring representing the crushing barge bow the validity of the cvia technique has been substantiated using experimental results consolazio et al 2006 consolazio et al 2008 and fe simulation results fan et al 2010 fan and yuan 2014a 2014b wang and morgenthal 2017 2018 a key point of the cvia model is to determine the bow force deformation relationship a lot of research have focus on this topic in literature pedersen et al 1993 cowan 2007 fan and yuan 2014a 2014b wang and morgenthal 2017 2018 nevertheless the bow force deformation relationships in these studies were obtained limited on the single vessel from the practical design point of view a more generic empirical model is desired to determine the simplified bow force deformation relationship for the given ship parameters therefore further investigations are required to accumulate adequate experimental or fe simulation data for the avil as an alternative to the cvia model the impact load time history is externally applied to the bridge structure and the traditional dynamic analysis is performed to determine the dynamic responses simplified impact load time history models for inland and seagoing vessels were introduced to the eurocode provisions en 1991 these models however are highly schematic due to the lacking of effective values for model parameters the analytical procedure to determine the impact load time history for the single barge consolazio et al 2008 and for the multi barge flotilla yuan and harik 2008 yuan et al 2008 were both proposed moreover the analytical procedure was also proposed to determine the simplified impact force time history for ships fan and yuan 2014a 2014b fan et al 2016 however the above avil technique involves pre computing the impact force time history based on the simplified barge bow force deformation relationships obviously in this case the avil technique proposed by consolazio and fan is less convenient than the cvia to overcome the limitation an empirical barge impact force time history model which is independent of the barge bow force deformation relationship and can be determined directly by the barge mass impact velocity and the pier shape was proposed sha and hao 2012 2013 2014 nevertheless further investigations are required to establish such empirical impact load models for ship bridge collision analysis in this paper an empirical impact load time history model accounting for ship size and impact velocity is established to substitute the complex finite element models for ship bridge collision analysis the drop hammer impact test using two scaled steel boxes is conducted to evaluate the validity of the numerical simulation techniques then the numerical models of 5 typical ships are developed and 45 impact force time history curves are obtained using the numerical simulations a modified half sine wave function is proposed to simplify the impact force time history and the corresponding model parameters are determined based on the 45 benchmark impact force time history curves at last based on two bridge cases the responses predicted by the simplified analytical model are compared with the results predicted by the full ship impact analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction 2 numerical modeling of ship collision 2 1 experimental impact tests the drop hammer impact tests are performed using two identical steel boxes labelled 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 the prototype of the steel box is the crashworthy device against vessel collisions of the zhongxian yangtze river bridge in china and the scale is 1 4 determined by the installing space of the drop hammer impact machine the cross sectional configurations and dimensions of the scaled steel boxes are shown in fig 2 the overall dimensions of the scaled steel box are 1400 mm in length 1000 mm in width and 500 mm in height the scaled steel box is comprised of welded steel plates of 4 62 mm in thickness the impact tests are conducted on a drop hammer impact machine which is comprised of the drop hammer and the striking head attached to the bottom of the drop hammer as shown in fig 3 the weight of the hammer is 9 77 tons the configuration of the striking head is shown in fig 4 the hammer would be raised to the specified height of 1 8 m and 4 1 m respectively and the corresponding impact velocity is 5 94 m s and 8 97 m s for each box respectively as shown in fig 3 during the impact test the time history of acceleration of the drop hammer is measured by the accelerometer located at the center of the top plate of the drop hammer as shown in fig 5 since the stiffness of the drop hammer is strong enough compared with the scaled steel boxes the drop hammer can be treated as a rigid body thus the impact force time history during the impact test can be determined by the mass and the acceleration of the drop hammer based on the second newton s law the displacements of the steel boxes after impact are measured by hand as shown in fig 6 the deformation of the two boxes after impact is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that fracture occurs on the top plate at the junction between the top plate and the transverse plate of the scaled steel boxes concaves with around 15 cm and 26 cm in depth appear at the top steel plate of 1 and 2 scaled steel box after impact respectively the accelerations of the impactor recorded during the tests are plotted in fig 8 where g is the gravity acceleration 2 2 validation the finite element models of the scaled steel box and the drop hammer are developed based on their true configurations as shown in fig 9 the scaled steel box is modelled using four node shell elements with a mesh size of 5 mm the drop hammer is modelled with hexahedron solid elements the drop hammer is modelled here using rigid material model mat rigid in ls dyna as the deformation is negligible during impact the density of 7850 kg m3 young s modulus of 2 105 mpa and the poisson s ratio of 0 3 are used respectively the initial velocities of 5 94 m s and 8 97 m s are defined for the drop hammer respectively and gravitational effects during the impact are taken into account contact between the drop hammer and the box contact automatic surface to surface and the contact among members inside the box contact automatic single surface are both defined the value of the friction coefficient for steel steel is 0 15 knott et al 2009 the scaled steel box is modelled using the elastic plastic constitutive model with an arbitrary stress versus strain curve mat piecewise linear plasticity hallquist 2007 and the true stress strain relationship of the steel obtained from the un axial tension experiment is plotted in fig 10 the strain rate effect on the material property is considered using the cowper symonds equation as follows hallquist 2007 1 σ y 1 ε c 1 q σ y 0 e p ε e f f p where ε is the strain rate σ y0 is the initial yield strength ε e f f p is the effective plastic strain e p is the plastic hardening modulus c and q are the parameters of the cowper symonds equation the values 40 4 and 5 0 for c and q are suggested to account for the strain rate effect for mild steel in this paper cowper and symonds 1957 jones 2011 to investigate the strain rate effect upon the responses of the steel boxes fe simulations with and without strain rate effect are both performed the time histories of acceleration of the drop hammer for each case predicted by numerical simulations are plotted in fig 8 overall the acceleration predicted by fe simulation with considering the strain rate effect are in good agreement with the experimental results however without considering the strain rate effect the acceleration magnitude is underestimated by fe simulation hence the strain rate effect on material property should be incorporated into the fe simulation which is modelled by using the cowper symonds equation and the suggested values of c and q for the mild steel are 40 4 and 5 0 respectively in addition obvious initial oscillations are observed in the time histories of accelerations of the experimental results it may be caused by the initial lateral vibration of the drop hammer which is induced by the interaction between the hammer and the guiding track device of the machine since the guiding track device are not modelled in the fe simulation such phenomenon has not been captured by fe simulations the cross sectional deformation profiles at section d d of the scaled steel boxes obtained from the numerical simulation are depicted together with the experimental results in fig 11 it can be seen that the deformation profiles of the steel boxes generated by fe simulations are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental test results the maximum indentations from the impact tests for the two cases are 168 mm and 258 mm respectively and the corresponding results from the numerical simulations are 155 mm and 260 mm respectively with the relative errors of 7 and 1 respectively the overall deformations of the scaled steel boxes after impact predicted by fe simulation are illustrated together with the experimental results as shown in fig 12 according to figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that the deformation of the scaled steel boxes can be reasonably predicted by the numerical simulations developed in this paper on the basis of the above discussion the finite element modeling techniques discussed above are used for the ship bridge collision analysis in the following sections 2 3 description of ships according to the present situation of the waterway shipping in china 5 typical ships between 500 dead weight tons dwt and 5000 dwt are selected and the feature parameters are listed in table 1 the bow structure of each ship is shown in fig 13 the ship bridge collision process is extremely complex and the determination of the impact load depends on many factors such as structural type shape of the ship s bow the stiffness of the bridge pier knott et al 2009 the absorbed energy by the ship or bridge structure increases with the impact angle and the friction coefficient saul and svensson 1982 however in order to simplify the study the ship rigid wall head on collision model is adopted in this manuscript as shown in fig 14 in which the rigid wall has six degrees of freedom on its mass center and are all fixed the reasons for using the ship rigid wall head on collision model in the study are as follows first the crushing load of a ship s bow is an upper limit for the collision force on the bridge larsen 1993 moreover the upper limit of the impact load can be obtained by assuming the bridge as a rigid structure vrouwenvelder 1997 according to the eurocode provision en 1991 impact by ships against solid structures should normally be considered as hard impact and the kinetic energy is dissipated by the elastic or plastic deformation of the ship itself in addition the head on collision condition impact angle is 90 results in the maximum energy to be absorbed by the ship saul and svensson 1982 which would lead to a maximum deformation of the ship and an upper limit of the collision force therefore the ship rigid wall head on collision model will generate a larger impact load which is in line with the safe principle of engineering design to adopt conservative loads however developing the impact load model accounting for oblique collisions as well as the effects of the bridge stiffness is also necessary and will be dealt with in the future work 2 4 finite element models the finite element models of 5 typical ships are developed based on the true configurations as shown in fig 15 for the ship rigid wall head on collision the bow structure undergoes direct contact with the rigid wall and thus is expected to have dramatic deformations therefore the bow part is modeled using a fine mesh and the ship body is modeled relatively coarser as shown in fig 15 the thicknesses of hull plates are between 10 mm and 16 mm the ship is modelled using four node shell elements and the rigid wall is modelled using hexahedron solid elements the bow part is modelled using the elastic plastic constitutive model mat plastic kinematic in ls dyna and the ship body is modelled using the rigid material model mat rigid the corresponding parameters of the material models for the ship are available in ref wang et al 2011 as tabulated in table 2 and the cowper symonds constants with c 40 4 s 1 and q 5 0 are used cowper and symonds 1957 jones 2011 to consider the strain rate effect the rigid wall is here modelled using the rigid material model mat rigid and the corresponding parameters of the rigid wall are determined by the chinese standard jtgd60 2015 according to the c40 concrete as tabulated in table 2 where e is the young s modulus and ν is the poisson s ratio contact between the ship and the rigid wall and the contact among the members inside the ship are both defined according to the german standard english 1982 the minimum and the maximum values of the friction coefficient for steel concrete are 0 3 and 0 4 according to the aashto guide specification knott et al 2009 the recommended values of the friction coefficient for steel concrete and steel steel are 0 35 and 0 15 respectively therefore the values of friction coefficient of 0 30 and 0 15 for steel concrete and steel steel are used in this paper based on the ship rigid wall head on collision model and the finite element models of 5 ships in this paper 9 impact velocities ranging from 1 m s to 5 m s with increment of 0 5 m s are defined for each ship and 45 ship impact force time history curves in total are obtained by numerical simulations typical curves of the numerical impact force time history and the deformation time history of the ship are plotted in fig 16 it can be seen that the impact force time history could be divided into 3 periods the initial stage during which the impact force increases rapidly the middle stage during which the impact force fluctuates and the final stage during which the impact force decreases rapidly after the ship separates from the rigid wall the crushing of the 5000 dwt ship after impact with an impact velocity of 3 m s is shown in fig 17 the initial kinematic energy of the ship is fully absorbed by the ship bow and the maximum crush depth is 1 42 m at 0 8 s in order to observe the characteristics of the numerical impact force time history f t the dimensionless time τ is defined as 2 τ t t define the average impact force over the impact duration t as f mean 3 f m e a n i 0 t and define the non dimensional impact force time history as β τ 4 β τ f τ t f m e a n in eq 3 i 0 is the impulse of the impact force time history 5 i 0 0 t f t d t 3 analytical modeling of ship collision 3 1 analytical method according to eq 4 and 45 curves of β τ corresponding to 45 impact force time history curves are obtained as shown in fig 18 it can be seen that most curves of the impact force time history are flat in the middle phase and the peak value usually occurs in the front or rear part of the time history curve therefore to establish a simplified impact load model a half sine wave function modified with a parabolic expression is proposed to capture the above features of the impact force time history the function has the following form 6 f s t c 1 α 1 t t α 2 t t 2 sin π t t 0 t t where f s t is the simplified analytical impact load model c α 1 and α 2 are constants needing to be quantified 3 2 model parameters in previous studies consolazio et al 2008 fan et al 2010 fan and yuan 2014a 2014b parameters of the impact force time history model are generally determined according to the physical conditions i e the principles of energy conservation and linear momentum however such procedures are developed based on the cvia model and in this case cvia can be used directly in bridge design as an alternative approach the equivalent moment method is used in the paper to determine the values of model parameters of simplified analytical model several assumptions are adopted here to determine the parameters c α 1 and α 2 1 the simplified analytical model shares the same impulse with the numerical impact force time history 2 the simplified analytical model shares the same centroid position of vertical axis with the numerical impact force time history 3 the numerical impact force time history and the simplified analytical model share a same rotary radius these three assumptions are used to make the amplitude distribution of the simplified analytical impact load model similar to the numerical impact force time history in the time domain the mathematical expressions of the three principles are as follows 7a 0 t f s t d t 0 t f t d t i 0 7b 0 t t f s t d t 0 t t f t d t i 1 i 0 t c 7c 0 t t t c 2 f s t d t 0 t t t c 2 f t d t i 2 where t c is the centroid position of the numerical impact force time history i 1 is the 1st order moment about force axis of the numerical impact force time history and i 2 is the 2nd order moment about centroid axis of the numerical impact force time history the expressions of c α 1 and α 2 are derived from eq 7 as shown in eq 8 8a c i 0 π 2 t 1 1 1 2 α 1 1 2 1 4 π 2 α 2 8b α 1 2 24 π 2 a a 2 τ c τ c η a 2 b a b 12 π 2 a 1 a b 12 π 2 a 1 τ c τ c η b a 2 a 12 π 2 a 2 b 2 8c α 2 a 2 b τ c τ c η 2 a 1 b a 2 a b 12 π 2 a 1 τ c τ c η b a 2 a 12 π 2 a 2 b 2 where a 1 4 π 2 b 1 6 π 2 τ c t c t and η i 2 t i 1 τ c hence eq 6 could be rewritten as 9a f s t f m e a n π 2 α 1 1 4 π 2 α 2 1 α 1 t t α 2 t t 2 sin π t t 0 t t 9b t i 0 f m e a n where values of i 0 f mean τ c and η are required to be determined for the simplified analytical load model according to the above procedures based on the impact force time history curves obtained by numerical simulations and the above procedures the typical curves of the simplified analytical model are plotted together with the numerical impact force time history curves as illustrated in fig 19 3 2 1 empirical formulas of model parameters for discrete dwt of ships the ratio about the impulse of the impact force time history and the initial momentum of the ship is defined as 10 α 3 i 0 m v 0 where i 0 is in mn s m is the mass of the ship in ton and v 0 is the impact velocity in m s the values of α 3 corresponding to the 45 impact force time history curves are drawn in fig 20 it can be seen that values of α 3 are in the range between 1 04 and 1 12 and the value of α 3 tends to decrease as the impact velocity increases the reason is that when the impact velocity increases the ratio of the elastic energy to the plastic energy absorbed by the ship s bow decreases overall the value of α 3 has a minor dispersion and the maximum relative error is 4 when the mean value of 1 07 is used as shown in fig 20 the values of f mean corresponding to the 45 impact force time histories are listed in table 3 it can be seen that f mean increases with the increase of ship mass and impact velocity the relationship between f mean and v 0 for each ship is regressed by a power function as expressed in eq 11 11 f m e a n α 4 v 0 0 661 where the unit of f mean is mn the unit of v 0 is m s α 4 is the statistical parameter and its value for each ship is tabulated in table 3 for each ship the goodness of the fitting curve for f mean is depicted in fig 21 then according to eq 10 and eq 11 the impact duration can be determined by eq 9b the samples of τ c and η corresponding to the 45 impact force time history curves are listed in table 4 fig 22 shows the statistical variation of τ c and η corresponding to the 45 impact force time history curves note that the shape of the proposed impact load time history model is determined by the values of τ c and η the relationship of τ c and η with respect to ship mass and impact velocity however is not clear because shape of the impact load time history is influenced by the crushing and failure of the structural members inside the bow which is rather complex hence τ c and η are treated as random variables on the ground of the uncertainty of the bow structures in this study after conducting the hypothesis test both τ c and η follow to a normal distribution as shown in fig 22 according to the 45 pairs of samples of τ c and η the values of η τ c are in the range of 0 106 0 150 in addition τ c is in the range of 0 427 0 590 and η is in the range of 0 561 0 696 as shown in fig 22 hence based on the probability density functions of τ c andη the generated random samples should meet the above two requirements to avoid abnormal cases based on the single degree of freedom sdof system the influence of statistical variation of τ c and η upon the dynamic responses can be evaluated by comparing the responses corresponding to different combinations of values for τ c and η as shown in fig 23 f t τ c η represents the proposed simplified impact force time history determined by using sample values of τ c and η while f t τ c m η m represents the simplified impact force time history determined by the average values of τ c and η i e τ c m 0 509 and η m 0 638 a statistical variation index of response sv is defined to evaluate the influence of the statistical variation of τ c and η on structural responses 12 s v r max τ c η r max τ c m η m where r max τ c η and r max τ c m η m are the maximum dynamic responses produced by f t τ c η and f t τ c m η m respectively the analysis frequency of the sdof system is in the range of 0 1 hz 10 hz which covers the property of regular structures and the damping ratio is set as 5 by solving eqs 12 and 45 curves of sv with respect to different structural frequencies are obtained as shown in fig 24 it indicates that sv nearly equals to 1 0 when f n is below 0 6 hz whilst it fluctuates from 0 75 to 1 35 when the frequency is higher than 0 6 hz compared with the response produced by f t τ c m η m it indicates that the relative error of response introduced by the variation of τ c and η is within 35 in section 4 3 it will be further discussed through two bridge case studies 3 2 2 empirical formulas of model parameters for continuous dwt of ships even though the model parameters for the five ships selected in the study are determined however for other ships outside the five ships the impact force model established for the discrete dwt of ships could not be used therefore for the purpose to facilitate engineering design it is necessary to establish a generic impact force time history model which can account for the main ship parameters including vessel size and impact velocity based on the 45 samples of f mean as listed in table 3 the proposed expression of f mean corresponding to different values of m and v 0 has the following form 13 f m e a n α 5 m γ v 0 λ where α 5 9 45 10 4 γ 1 05 λ 0 62 the values of f mean corresponding to 45 impact force time history curves and the corresponding fitting surface are drawn in fig 25 the same formula established in section 3 2 1 for estimating the impact impulse i 0 is used as shown in eq 10 then based on eq 10 and eq 13 the impact duration t can be estimated by eq 9b 4 analysis of ship collision in bridges a continuous girder bridge and a cable stayed bridge are selected herein to assess the prediction quality of the proposed impact force time history model note that the fe simulations using the full ship impact model fsim are defined as the benchmark simulation 4 1 finite element model and parameters a continuous girder bridge and a cable stayed bridge which have high probability of the collision against ship are chosen as two typical examples to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed simplified impact load model bridge a is totally 440 m long the main span and the side span are 140 m and 80 m respectively each pier is composed of two separated columns with a rectangular cross section the main span of bridge b is 730 m and both the two towers are reverse y type the overall elevations and the configurations of bridge a and bridge b are shown in fig 26 and fig 27 the finite element models of the two bridges are developed as shown in fig 28 the bridge structure is mainly modelled using beam elements including the pier the girder and the pile the pile cap is modelled with hexahedron solid elements to simulate contact interaction between the ship and pile cap for simplification the linear elastic material model mat elastic is used for the concrete and the steel of the bridge structure and the corresponding parameters are tabulated in table 5 the soil is simulated with spring elements and the spring stiffness for the clay layer is determined by the m method which is provided by the chinese standard d63 2007 2007 the stiffness of the horizontal soil spring k mn m is formulated as d63 2007 2007 14 k λ λ f d 1 h m z where d is the diameter of the pile m h is the thickness of the soil layer governed by the spring m m is coefficient of horizontal resistance coefficient for non rock foundation mn m4 z is the soil depth m λ is the interaction coefficient of the soil between the piles and equals to 0 94 and 0 91 for bridge a and bridge b respectively λ f is the pile shape coefficient and equals to 0 9 for circular piles d63 2007 2007 the soil condition and the suggested values d63 2007 2007 b02 01 2008 2008 of m for the two bridges are tabulated in table 6 all of the five ships selected in this study are considered herein to evaluate the validity of the proposed simplified model benchmark simulations using the fsim are required beforehand to obtain the bridge responses as shown in fig 28 and table 7 in order to investigate the influence of the simplifications adopted in developing the simplified analytical model four kinds of impact force time history curves i e generated from the ship rigid wall model srwm the simplified model using sample values of model parameters sms the simplified model established for discrete dwt of ships using mean values of τ c and η smd and the simplified model established for continuous dwt of ships using mean values of τ c and η smc are employed for each case as tabulated in table 7 the meanings of sms smd and smc and their differences are further described in table 8 for further validation of interest it is meaningful to compare the impact force time history model proposed by the eurocode provision en 1991 which is labeled as en in table 7 with the simplified analytical model developed in this paper the impact force time history model provided by the eurocode provision en 1991 for sea going ships was proposed by pedersen pedersen et al 1993 according to the eurocode provision en 1991 the maximum bow collision force f bow is computed as 15a f b o w f 0 l e i m p 5 0 l l 0 6 0 5 f o r e i m p l 2 6 2 24 f 0 e i m p l 0 5 f o r e i m p l 2 6 15b l l p p 275 m e i m p e i m p 1425 m n m e i m p m x v 0 2 2 where l pp the length of vessel in m m x the mass plus added mass 10 with respect to longitudinal motion in 106 kg v 0 the impact velocity of the vessel in m s f 0 the reference collision force at 210 mn the maximum indentation s max and the impact duration t 0 corresponding to the constant load of f bow are computed as 16 s max π 2 e i m p f b o w 17 t 0 1 67 s max v 0 according to eq 15 eq 16 and eq 17 the impact load time history curve of the eurocode model for the five ships are obtained and the impact load corresponding to 5000 dwt of ship impacting at 3 m s is plotted in fig 29 4 2 comparison between numerical and simplified analytical modeling according to table 7 the results corresponding to the impact scenario of 5000 dwt of ship are shown in fig 29 the meanings of symbols involved are explained as follows the displacement of the collided pile cap is denoted as dp and the moment at the pile top is denoted as mpile to assess the prediction accuracy of these impact loads listed in table 7 the relative error of the peak response ε r is defined below 18 ε r r t h r f s i m 1 where r th is the peak response predicted from each of the use of srwm sms smd smc and en r fsim is the peak response predicted by fsim which is considered as the benchmark solution for the cases listed in table 7 the average values of ε r are listed in table 9 from fig 29 and table 9 some key information could be found 1 the average error of responses predicted srwm is below 4 for the cases of ba 5000 and bb 5000 as shown in fig 29 the impact force time history obtained from srwm is in close agreement with that of fsim especially for the case of bb 5000 the maximum displacement of the pile cap for ba 5000 and bb 5000 is 37 mm and 3 5 mm respectively which is far less than the deformation of the ship 1420 mm fig 17 it indicates that the initial kinematic energy in the two impact cases is mainly dissipated by the ship and thus the rigid bridge assumption can be adopted to determine the impact force on the bridge subjected to ship impact 2 the sms achieves the best prediction accuracy among sms smd and smc with the relative errors below 8 smd also achieves a good prediction accuracy and the maximum relative error is 14 however with incorporating more variables in the empirical expressions for f mean the prediction accuracy of smc is somewhat lower than that of smd with relative errors within 40 therefore the smd model is much preferred to use when the dwt of the ship equals to one of five ships selected in this study 3 it is found that the eurocode s predictions are much higher than the benchmark responses predicted by fsim and are also higher than the responses predicted by smd and smc 4 3 influence of the statistical variation of τ c and η upon structural responses according to fig 24 it can be found that for the structural frequency between 0 6 hz and 2 0 hz which is important to structural responses sv is mainly influenced by τ c and it increases as τ c decreases as shown in fig 24 to evaluate the statistical variation of τ c upon the prediction quality of the impact load of smd a fractile τ c0 for the given cut off probability p 0 is introduced as expressed as follows 19 p 0 τ c 0 f τ c d τ c where f τ c is the probability function of τ c as shown in fig 22 according to table 4 and eq 19 the sample values of 0 508 0 466 and 0 427 for τ c corresponding to 0 98 0 85 and 0 50 of p 0 respectively are selected and the corresponding sample values of 0 638 0 604 and 0 561 for η are determined according to table 4 as shown in table 10 based on the two bridge cases and the benchmark responses predicted by fsim the influence of the statistical variation of τ c and η upon the prediction accuracy of smd is evaluated as tabulated in table 10 comparing fig 24 and table 10 it can be seen that the results based on the case study involving two bridge models are consistent with the results obtained based on the sdof system i e responses predicted by the smd increase as τ c decreases it can be found that the smd corresponding to p 0 0 98 highly overestimated the impact force and thus highly overestimated the bridge structural responses on the other hand the smd corresponding to p 0 0 50 underestimated the impact load to a certain extent the results predicted by smd corresponding to p 0 0 85 are slightly higher than the results of fsim therefore from the perspective of conservative design the values of τ c 0 466 and η 0 604 are recommended for smd 4 4 limitations of the simplified analytical impact load model in order to investigate the conditions in which the proposed simplified analytical impact load model could predict reasonable responses of bridge subjected to ship impact the following analysis are conducted the dynamic equation of the bridge structure under the impact of ships can be expressed as follows chopra 2012 20 m u c u k u s f t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrix respectively u is the vector of the displacement of the bridge s 0 1 0 t is the space distribution vector produced by the impact force f t takes the meaning as before taking a linear transformation u φ q the equation of motion can be transformed to a set of uncoupled equations with modal coordinates q j by multiplying φ j t on both sides of eq 20 21 q j 2 ξ j ω j q j ω j 2 q j γ j f t where φ φ 1 φ 2 φ n is the normalized modal matrix in which φ j t is the mode vector j 1 2 n n is the total number of modes q j is the modal coordinate ξ j γ j and ω j are the modal damping ratio the modal participation factor and the modal circle frequency respectively by means of modal analysis the modal participation factors of bridge a and bridge b are obtained as shown in fig 30 marking q j t γ j δ j t then eq 21 could be rewritten as 22 δ j 2 ξ j ω j δ j ω j 2 δ j f t since the analysis of using the numerical impact force time history of srwm can accurately predict the dynamic response of the bridge subjected to ship impact the results of srwm are defined as the benchmark solution in this section the peak value of δ j t is denoted as δ j max and the peak response ratio r is used to estimate the precision of the simplified analytical model which is expressed as 23 r q j s m d max q j s r w m max γ j δ j s m d max γ j δ j s r w m max δ j s m d max δ j s r w m max where q j s m d max and δ j s m d max are the peak values corresponding to q j t and δ j t by using the impact loads predicted by smd q j s r w m max and δ j s r w m max are the peak values corresponding to q j t and δ j t by using the impact loads estimated by srwm note that the impact loads using the values of τ c and η corresponding to a cut off probability of 0 85 are generated herein as the smd can achieve a higher prediction accuracy in this condition based on the 45 impact force time history curves estimated by srwm and smd the corresponding spectrums of the peak response ratio are obtained by solving eq 22 and eq 23 as plotted in fig 31 the spectrum of r for each ship is the average value of 9 spectrum curves corresponding to 9 impact velocities from fig 31 it can be found that 1 for f n 0 5 hz the value of r is stable and is around 1 0 indicating that the modal responses obtained from the use of the benchmark impact force time history and the simplified analytical impact force time history are almost same 2 for 0 5 hz f n 3 0 hz the value of r is between about 0 8 and 1 5 indicating that the calculation error by smd is within the range from 20 to 50 3 for f n 3 0 hz the calculation error from the use of smd exceeds the value of 20 and increases with the modal frequency to be noticed the above findings are observed based on the sdof system and may not be completely applicable to the multi degree of freedom mdof system it can be known from fig 30 that the important modes with the greatest contribution to the structural response are between 1 0 and 2 5 hz for bridge a and are between 1 5 and 2 0 hz for bridge b according to table 10 the maximum relative error of smd is 23 corresponding to the ship of 3000 2 dwt which is less than 50 and thus confirms these findings obtained from the sdof system as shown in fig 31 therefore it may be concluded based on the two demonstration bridge cases that the simplified analytical model can reasonably predict the response of bridge pier subjected to ship impact when its natural frequency is below 3 hz however the conclusion needs to be further assessed using more bridge models in the future work 5 conclusions this study aims to develop a simplified analytical impact load model for predicting the dynamic responses of the bridge subjected to ship impact the first step in this study is to decouple the interaction between the ship and bridge using the rigid bridge assumption and then the numerical impact force time histories of 5 ships are obtained based on the ship rigid wall collision model next the simplified analytical model and the method to determine its parameters are proposed the prediction quality of the analytical model is well assessed using two bridge models and the conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 1 the fe modeling techniques to capture the impact loads used in this study are validated against experimental impact tests and thus the fe models of 5 ships by employing the discussed fe modeling techniques can reasonably predict the impact loads of ships 2 the ship rigid wall collision model adopted in this study can reasonably predict the ship impact loading on the bridge as the ship bridge collision can generally be regarded as hard impact based on the case studies in this paper using two bridge models 3 the impact force time history obtained from ship rigid wall collision model can be used to substitute the fe models of ship bridge collision events to efficiently predict the bridge responses and the average error of responses is below 4 based on the two demonstration cases 4 the simplified analytical impact load model developed in this paper is capable of reasonably predicting the dynamic responses of the bridge subjected to ship impact the values of τ c 0 466 and η 0 604 for the simplified model are recommended based on the two demonstration cases acknowledgement the research is supported by the national science foundation of china grant number 51438010 51778498 the research program of shanghai science and technology

22662,in the present case study the hydrodynamic aspects of a planing hull were investigated using rans method and compared with the well known savitsky s technique the total resistance and the trim angle computed by rans simulation and savitsky s method were investigated at different volumetric froude numbers and eventually compared with experimental results the results show that the presented rans simulation has an acceptable agreement with the experimental results and the computed total resistance and trim angles are approximately equal to the measured values of the previous reference the simulation errors are less than the previously published references the mean error percentage for resistance trim and sinkage are 2 77 9 17 and 12 01 respectively finally the results of the wetted lengths computed by savitsky s method are not as accurate as of the rans method a comparison between the rans method and savitsky s method showed that the numerical approach is more accurate and reliable than the semi empirical method it should be noted that each of these methods has its own strengths that is the savitsky s method computes the results in a short computational time while the rans method requires more computational time and can represent the fluid flow characteristics with more details keywords planing hull rans method hydrodynamics numerical simulation savitsky s method

the accuracy of the cfd method which is deemed to be useful in the design stage of planing hulls the experimental test process is quite expensive and it is necessary to have an additional tool to use at this step of the design further an accurate predictive tool could be beneficial such that it can estimate the hull power the volume of fluid vof method is such tool which will be used for this simulation the initial attempts to simulate the complicated free surface motions of fluid flows was based on marker and cell mac method which was presented by harlow and welch 1965 in this case mac has adopted a distribution of marker particles to mark the free surface after which the free surface pressures were applied at the centroid of the cells later the mac method has improved and finally the vof method was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 in 1981 the vof method consists of a simple and efficient methodology on the basis of a fractional volume of fluid concept which is deemed to be more accurate than the previously implemented methods such as harlow and welch 1965 over time the vof method has found considerable acceptance by naval architects and scientists in the design process due to its power and accuracy therefore the vof has become more popular in viscous marine simulations leroyer et al 2011 also this method has found significant development through time however providing new filtering techniques e g smoothing techniques and high resolution interface capturing scheme vof solver has been able to improve the capture of the free surface waves significantly mancini et al 2017 claimed that the numerical simulation of a planing hull is complex in comparison with a displacement vessel accordingly the necessity of the experimental tests was indicated by them their case study was a mono hull from the naples systematic series nss their cfd study in contrast to the experimental approach showed that the cfd results need to be validated by the experimental data such that their reliability can be scrutinized brizzolara and villa 2010 studied a two degree of freedom simulation of a planing hull using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the authors also monitored the dynamic sinkage trim and total drag during the simulation and finally compared them with the experimental measurements the obtained results showed that the simulation and experimental measurements show good agreement also in brizzolara and villa 2010 the savitsky s method coupled with the rans method have been utilized to compute the resultant total drag sinkage and trim their code named dinav was based on an external java c routine which was linked to star ccm solver to iteratively change the equilibrium position as well as the attitude of the hull the principles of their approach are presented in brizzolara and villa 2010 in detail fu et al 2014 performed laboratory measurements on a deep v planing craft model in order to perform a validation study on their cfd codes applied for high speed crafts they showed that the simulated wake pattern the captured water iso surface can affect the simulation results and the presented trim sinkage and resistance force for both measurements and cfd simulations de marco et al de marco et al 2017 studied both cfd and experimental methods to evaluate the performance of a stepped planing hull focusing mostly on two methods of morphing mesh and over set mesh their results showed that there is a large range of uncertainty in the case of using morphing or overset mesh lotfi et al 2015 have presented a contradiction in hydrodynamic parameters of the fluid flow around a stepped planing hull using different approaches including ansys cfx commercial solver and svahn s technique svahn 2009 however lotfi s simulations are not as accurate as of the experimental results for example there are 5 and 31 errors on average in their resistance and trim results respectively in the present study in order to minimize this error certain methods were used that had 2 77 error in the resistance computation and 9 17 in the trim angle on average the presented trends of lotfi et al 2015 for trim angle are under question it is obvious that using an appropriate mesh topology could minimize the error percentage in a numerical simulation as can be seen in lotfi et al 2015 the trigonometric mesher without prism layers cannot be the best topology to solve rans equations around a free hull taunton et al 2010 have tested several planing hulls called southampton series the effect of design key parameters including length displacement ratio longitudinal center of mass and gyration radius on the total resistance and seakeeping of the boats were investigated their study was mainly focused on four different bodies a b c and d which are normal mono hulls and stepped planing hulls c1 and c2 the velocity range for the experimental tests were 4 05 u m 13 09 the rans method used in this paper carried out using star ccm version 12 02 and has been compared with the experimental results of taunton et al 2010 since an uncertainty analysis of the results is provided in addition code for savitsky s method was implemented which is useful for further numerical simulations such that it can reduce the need for experiments having displacement beam deadrise angle and center of gravity position of the hull it is possible to calculate the total resistance trim and sinkage directly from the savitsky s theorem in this paper we used the c model from taunton et al 2010 to study and validate with their experimental results the main purpose of the present study is to show the accuracy of the cfd method in case of a well refined mesh and its similarities with experimental fluid dynamics also the trim results of savitsky s method can be applied as the initial conditions in the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model in order to reduce the computational time for this purpose one can consider savitsky s modified values as the initial trim so that the final height of the free surface refinement can be minimized and the vessel can be released in an approximation to its steady state condition the main challenge in the aforesaid approach is the error of savitsky s method which is the case study in the current paper there is a moderate difference in trim results of savitsky s method in comparison with both experimental and numerical approach the trim results of savitsky s method are greater in value than the measured ones hence a correction factor should be considered for this purpose 2 numerical simulation 2 1 hull geometry the c hull has an overall length of 2 m and a beam of 0 46 m with the hydrostatic draft of 0 09 m the weight of the craft is 243 40 n the dead rise angle for the hull is 22 5 which is the same as that of the other hull types a b and d in taunton et al 2010 the three dimensional cad of the hull has been drawn using the body plan presented in taunton et al 2010 the body plan view of the drafted hull for this study has also been presented in fig 1 2 2 volume of fluid vof method the volume of fluid vof solver has been chosen to capture the water iso surface around the planing hull such that the domain could be refined well in every direction this method was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 vof model assumes that all phases of a segregated multi phase flow are in a certain control volume which shares velocity pressure and other field functions thereby the basic governing equations of momentum mass and energy transport in each single phase are solved separately the general equations of density and kinematic viscosity are in the form below 1 ρ ρ i α i and 2 ν ν i α i where α i v i v effective density and effective viscosity can be computed by the formulas below 3 ρ e ρ w a t e r α w a t e r ρ a i r 1 α w a t e r 4 ν e ν w a t e r α w a t e r ν a i r 1 α w a t e r in which ρ e and ν e are effective density and effective kinematic viscosity respectively in eqs 3 and 4 α w a t e r has a value between 0 α water 1 and represents the volumetric ratio of fluids α w a t e r 1 for every cell shows that the cell is occupied with the water phase and α w a t e r 0 shows the air phase accordingly the other values of α w a t e r represent the mixture zone of vof solver therefore the vof scalar view has been monitored during the simulation to ensure that vof solver behaves accurately the transverse sections of the vof scalar view for f r 2 39 has been presented in fig 2 also the vof scalar views of the hull in two froude numbers are shown in fig 3 the numerical ventilation exists however the amount of ventilation is not able to affect the results 2 3 numerical approach the performance of the c hull from southampton series has been investigated in the present study by the rans and savitsky s method the key parameters such as total resistance total lift force trim and sinkage were computed by solving the rans equations around the hull with two degrees of freedom the hull was free to trim and heave during simulations after the release time 0 5s the computational domain dimensions are presented in fig 4 and is compared with the dimensions of the towing tank used in the experiments taunton et al 2010 as well as the cfd domain of lotfi et al 2015 in table 1 the generated hexahedral mesh has been shown in fig 5 in which five volumetric controls were created to refine the whole mesh in all directions in this case three blocks were used to simulate the free surface propagation in the whole computational domain also two additional volumetric controls were refined to simulate the wake pattern behind the transom the generated mesh grids has been involved the kelvin wave in the downstream of the computational domain and the chosen cusp angle for wake refinement volumetric controls is θ k e l v i n a r c s i n 1 3 19 47 which is the maximum angle of kelvin wave the cusp angle of wake refinements has been shown in fig 6 such simulations are performed in parallel mode on the system with 3 1 ghz intel core i5 processor with 4 gb of ram on average 3000 time steps were required to complete each simulation approximately 9 h have been spent on convergence for almost the minimum mesh number 675k elements it took about 12 h to complete the convergence for the largest number of elements 950k elements symmetry planes were used as boundary conditions for both sides of the computational domain velocity inlets were chosen for inlet top and bottom surfaces of the tank and finally the outlet boundary condition is actually pressure outlet no slip wall boundary condition was selected for the hull surfaces the implicit unsteady solver was selected due to the large range of courant friedrichs lewy cfl number supported by this solver this capability allows us to use different cell sizes at the computational domain the fluid flow assumed as turbulent and realizable k ε turbulence model with wall function was adopted to take viscous turbulence layer effects into account which is similar to that of eslamdoost et al 2018 there were no turbulent stimulation used in the present simulations however only the lowest running speed was below the critical reynolds number taunton et al 2010 all y wall treatment has been selected for the simulations prism layer mesher were used for boundary layer and the total thickness of the prism layers was calculated by the flat plate boundary layer thickness equation the length of the flat plate assumed to be equal to the overall length of the hull in these simulations as shown in fig 7 40 prism layers were used and the thickness of the first cell of the prism layer mesh from the wall was 5 e 5 meters in these simulations the timestep has been chosen as 0 01 s the maximum five inner iterations were considered at each timestep due to the limitations of the computational resources the resistance error in the three grid resolutions has been computed in order to choose the most suitable mesh these results are shown in table 2 for the fine mesh the y was in the range of 20 40 along the wetted area of the hull for the f n 2 39 the range of y below 30 shows that the wall is in the buffer zone but the all y wall treatment gives reasonable values also in this range in addition the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme is used to discretize the convective terms of vof transport equation presented in muzaferija 1998 which can track a sharp interface and resolves the free surface with one cell eslamdoost et al 2018 as the variation of resistance force is computed over three mesh conditions at f n 7 73 the uncertainty of the simulation over this speed is evaluated by the method which is presented by wilson et al 2001 however ittc procedures ittc 2008 explain that the numerical simulation uncertainty u s n is formed of iterative u i grid u g and time step u t s uncertainty as follows 5 u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t s 2 but according to wilson et al 2001 and de marco et al de marco et al 2017 the most important source of uncertainty of the numerical results is the grid uncertainty thus the uncertainty of the numerical simulations at the f n 7 73 is computed for coarse medium and fine cases using grid convergence index gci and by using safety factor f s 1 25 which is recommended by roache 1998 2002 the mesh study shows that the convergence ratio r k ε 21 k ε 32 k is in the following range 0 r k 1 which shows that monotonic convergence is satisfied for the computation of the observed order of accuracy p k the following equation is used 6 p k l n ε 32 k ε 21 k l n r k in which r r is constant refinement ratio then the uncertainty of results is as below 7 u k f s ε 21 k r k p k 1 the grid uncertainty analysis for resistance n at fn 7 73 is given in table 3 3 savitsky s method in 1964 savitsky 1964 proposed a semi empirical technique to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls which is simple and fast the results of savitsky and brown 1976 showed that his presented equation for resistance prediction is very accurate in comparison with experimental tests at higher froude numbers f r l 1 it was also shown in savitsky and brown 1976 that this semi empirical method is possible to implement for different prismatic hulls and has an acceptable accuracy in comparison with measurements generally the equations of savitsky s method were presented for prismatic hulls in a more realistic view a planing hull has a variable deadrise angle along its length therefore the simple assumption of prismatic hull form is not applicable to warped planing hulls according to savitsky et al 2007 and begovic and bertorello 2012 the effect of variable deadrise could be implemented on the savitsky 1964 equations by taking effective deadrise and beam at lcg section also the whisker spray equation from savitsky et al 2007 were added to compute more realistic resistance force and trim angle for the c hull the flowchart of the implemented savitsky s method is presented in fig 8 hence the savitsky s method was applied to this float and the computed results have been compared with the rans method and experiments conducted by taunton et al 2010 4 results and discussion in the present numerical simulations the water iso surface was captured by iso value 0 5 which could affect the computed wetted area of the hull see fig 9 hence the selected iso value was the standard one and for all of froude numbers was constant it must be noted that the velocity u is non dimensionalized by displaced volume therefore f r u g 1 3 fig 10 determines that the present cfd study shows satisfactory results in accordance with experimental tests of taunton et al 2010 in the case of total resistance force as shown in fig 9 the grid resolution was at such a proper size to capture the flow pattern fig 12 shows the trend of computed trim follows the experimental values 4 1 satisfaction of lift force equilibrium in this study the lift force is compared with the displacement weight force which is presented as non dimensional l t δ ratio in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the computed lift force satisfactory results in accordance to the index line by observing fig 12 there is a slight difference in sinkage magnitudes in contrast with experimental results hence the force balance in the z direction of the float is accurate the higher lift force in lotfi et al 2015 is because of the numerical error therefore mesh continuum should be refined well to resolve the aforesaid error 4 2 sinkage results as it is shown in fig 5 the mesh should be refined well in the x y z directions and as a result the trend of the sinkage is similar to the experimental measurements than results of lotfi et al 2015 fig 12 illustrates the results of the dynamic sinkage for different methods used in the current study with respect to the experimental magnitudes of taunton et al 2010 the mean error of the sinkage for the cfd is 12 01 and for savitsky s method is 34 81 both methods had an acceptable trend but the cfd method is closer to the experimental results the error of savitsky s method in sinkage results is relevant to the error of computed wetted length and trim of the hull 4 3 computed trim angle computed trim angle by rans simulation has been presented in fig 13 as shown in this figure the trim angle has an acceptable accuracy with the experimental results and the trend of the proposed cfd simulations is following savitsky s applied method the average errors in computed trim angles of cfd and savitsky s method are respectively 9 17 and 37 9 versus experimental results in fig 13 there is an error in the numerical results in the range of 6 58 f r 7 73 this difference could be caused by the numerical error and our focus will be on this range of volumetric froude numbers in future works 4 4 computed resistance force presented numerically computed resistance force see fig 14 shows that its pattern mostly coincides with the experimental data the average error for the numerical results in resistance is approximately 2 77 in comparison with experimental results which is less than lotfi et al numerical model in the case of lotfi et al 2015 was 5 the accuracy of the presented numerical approach is due to the generated mesh around the hull and the prism layer mesher which have been used to create the computational domain also the other important factor in resolving the generated wave is the capturing scheme which is introduced in the volume of fluid section of the current paper the accuracy of the simulated wave pattern is of great importance to achieve that accuracy the hric scheme has been activated for each simulation thus the lower current number limit in the hric convection discretization scheme is set to 800 and the upper one is set to 850 these assumptions lead to a high reading results and a sharp interface between simulated air and water flows in addition to the cfd results the results of savitsky s method for resistance are shown in fig 14 the average resistance error for the savitsky s method is 6 99 compared to the experimental results whisker spray and deadrise angle corrections had significant effects on the resultant magnitudes of the savitsky s resistance force it can be said that both cfd and savitsky s method has an acceptable trend and accuracy on the resistance force in comparison with experimental results 4 5 wetted lengths one of the most important parameters to evaluate the running attitude of a planing hull is the computed wetted lengths thus the keel wetted length l k and chine wetted length l c were investigated at different volumetric froude numbers in table 4 the values of keel and chine wetted lengths are presented results of the present rans method and savitsky s method are presented simultaneously in comparison with the experimental results of taunton et al 2010 the maximum error percentage for the rans approach is 3 08 which is occurred in f r 3 01 and f r 5 97 while the minimum error is 0 77 which occurred in f r 4 81 the savitsky s method shows the average 28 42 error on l k and 32 13 for l c the aforesaid errors are too much and expected however the resistance magnitudes are more accurate than other parameters as shown in table 5 but the dynamic attitude of savitsky s method have errors up to 37 90 on trim angle and 34 82 on dynamic sinkage see table 5 4 6 streamline study a study on the flow pattern has been performed and streamline of the air and water phases have been represented to track the flow pattern around the hull as shown in figs 15 and 16 the streamlines are computed using backward integration mode general hydrodynamic principles state that the velocity vectors are tangent to each streamline fig 15 show three dimensional views of the computed streamlines at f r 7 73 and fig 16 shows the streamlines at f r 2 39 it is observed that by decreasing velocity the wake angle is increased the complexity of the flow at the spray zone is obvious as it is mentioned in mancini et al 2017 as well as comparing figs 16 and 15 the air streamlines are twisting when detached from the hull especially at the deck comparing figs 15 and 16 reveal the difference in the wake angle entirely by increasing the speed the effect of velocity on the wake angle is tangible by evaluating figs 15 and 16 fig 17 shows different phases of the fluid flow around the hull this method studies the flow lines locally and does not express the fluid flow in the whole computational domain therefore the fluid flow at the far field cannot be judged strictly by the investigations which have been done in this case study the observations show that the local flow pattern can be divided into three portions 1 water flow under the hull 2 the air streams above the deck surface 3 the passing air streamlines above the free surface which is classified as 3 1 those separate from the bow above the chine which is continued from the front to the transom in a twisting form 3 2 the group of air streamlines which are passing the side of the hull above the chine and leave the hull at the transom 3 3 the air streams which separate from the hull near the spray zone besides that it has shown the wetted length and the wetted area also the intensity of ventilation at transom could be investigated by streamlines as shown in fig 18 as it is seen in figs 18 and 19 the transom ventilation is caused by air stream on the top surface of the hull and those from water spray zone the effect of air streams of the top surface of the hull is shown in fig 18 the results show that there is a relation between the aerodynamics of the hull and the hydrodynamic aspects of the generated wave it is not strict that which one is the cause of another one but the importance of the planing hull aerodynamic evaluation is not diminished fig 19 shows the streamlines from the side view in three different froude numbers a f n 2 39 b f n 5 44 and c f n 7 73 as shown in fig 19 by increasing the speed the air streamlines will become more compact conclusions and future work the methods described in this article are techniques that can significantly reduce the design costs and the need for laboratory tests it should be noted that each of these methods has its own strengths that is the savitsky s method computes the results in a short computational time while the rans method requires more computational time and can represent the fluid flow characteristics with more details on the other hand the disadvantage of savitsky s method is the low accurate results caused by oversimplification having evaluated the results it can be concluded that the rans method has the capability to predict the hydrodynamic design parameters accurately the two phase flow around a hard chine planing hull is investigated to predict the hydrodynamic attitude of the hull the simulations were transient and after the attitude of the hull was stabilized the results has been presented the mean error of the resistance results was 2 77 for the rans method in comparison to experimental data in addition the dynamic attitude of the hull was computed reasonably with the mean error of 9 17 on trim and 12 01 on sinkage results although the savitsky s method could not determine the dynamic attitude as well as the rans method it shows 7 error in the resistance magnitude the wetted area of the hull is also monitored using both methods the errors of the l k and l c are 2 03 and 2 64 respectively finally the results of the wetted lengths computed by savitsky s method are not accurate as the rans method a comparison between the rans method and savitsky s method showed that the numerical approach is more accurate and reliable than the empirical method finally the rans approach is a reliable tool among the experimental tests which could help to find the optimum attitude of a

22662,in the present case study the hydrodynamic aspects of a planing hull were investigated using rans method and compared with the well known savitsky s technique the total resistance and the trim angle computed by rans simulation and savitsky s method were investigated at different volumetric froude numbers and eventually compared with experimental results the results show that the presented rans simulation has an acceptable agreement with the experimental results and the computed total resistance and trim angles are approximately equal to the measured values of the previous reference the simulation errors are less than the previously published references the mean error percentage for resistance trim and sinkage are 2 77 9 17 and 12 01 respectively finally the results of the wetted lengths computed by savitsky s method are not as accurate as of the rans method a comparison between the rans method and savitsky s method showed that the numerical approach is more accurate and reliable than the semi empirical method it should be noted that each of these methods has its own strengths that is the savitsky s method computes the results in a short computational time while the

the accuracy of the cfd method which is deemed to be useful in the design stage of planing hulls the experimental test process is quite expensive and it is necessary to have an additional tool to use at this step of the design further an accurate predictive tool could be beneficial such that it can estimate the hull power the volume of fluid vof method is such tool which will be used for this simulation the initial attempts to simulate the complicated free surface motions of fluid flows was based on marker and cell mac method which was presented by harlow and welch 1965 in this case mac has adopted a distribution of marker particles to mark the free surface after which the free surface pressures were applied at the centroid of the cells later the mac method has improved and finally the vof method was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 in 1981 the vof method consists of a simple and efficient methodology on the basis of a fractional volume of fluid concept which is deemed to be more accurate than the previously implemented methods such as harlow and welch 1965 over time the vof method has found considerable acceptance by naval architects and scientists in the design process due to its power and accuracy therefore the vof has become more popular in viscous marine simulations leroyer et al 2011 also this method has found significant development through time however providing new filtering techniques e g smoothing techniques and high resolution interface capturing scheme vof solver has been able to improve the capture of the free surface waves significantly mancini et al 2017 claimed that the numerical simulation of a planing hull is complex in comparison with a displacement vessel accordingly the necessity of the experimental tests was indicated by them their case study was a mono hull from the naples systematic series nss their cfd study in contrast to the experimental approach showed that the cfd results need to be validated by the experimental data such that their reliability can be scrutinized brizzolara and villa 2010 studied a two degree of freedom simulation of a planing hull using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the authors also monitored the dynamic sinkage trim and total drag during the simulation and finally compared them with the experimental measurements the obtained results showed that the simulation and experimental measurements show good agreement also in brizzolara and villa 2010 the savitsky s method coupled with the rans method have been utilized to compute the resultant total drag sinkage and trim their code named dinav was based on an external java c routine which was linked to star ccm solver to iteratively change the equilibrium position as well as the attitude of the hull the principles of their approach are presented in brizzolara and villa 2010 in detail fu et al 2014 performed laboratory measurements on a deep v planing craft model in order to perform a validation study on their cfd codes applied for high speed crafts they showed that the simulated wake pattern the captured water iso surface can affect the simulation results and the presented trim sinkage and resistance force for both measurements and cfd simulations de marco et al de marco et al 2017 studied both cfd and experimental methods to evaluate the performance of a stepped planing hull focusing mostly on two methods of morphing mesh and over set mesh their results showed that there is a large range of uncertainty in the case of using morphing or overset mesh lotfi et al 2015 have presented a contradiction in hydrodynamic parameters of the fluid flow around a stepped planing hull using different approaches including ansys cfx commercial solver and svahn s technique svahn 2009 however lotfi s simulations are not as accurate as of the experimental results for example there are 5 and 31 errors on average in their resistance and trim results respectively in the present study in order to minimize this error certain methods were used that had 2 77 error in the resistance computation and 9 17 in the trim angle on average the presented trends of lotfi et al 2015 for trim angle are under question it is obvious that using an appropriate mesh topology could minimize the error percentage in a numerical simulation as can be seen in lotfi et al 2015 the trigonometric mesher without prism layers cannot be the best topology to solve rans equations around a free hull taunton et al 2010 have tested several planing hulls called southampton series the effect of design key parameters including length displacement ratio longitudinal center of mass and gyration radius on the total resistance and seakeeping of the boats were investigated their study was mainly focused on four different bodies a b c and d which are normal mono hulls and stepped planing hulls c1 and c2 the velocity range for the experimental tests were 4 05 u m 13 09 the rans method used in this paper carried out using star ccm version 12 02 and has been compared with the experimental results of taunton et al 2010 since an uncertainty analysis of the results is provided in addition code for savitsky s method was implemented which is useful for further numerical simulations such that it can reduce the need for experiments having displacement beam deadrise angle and center of gravity position of the hull it is possible to calculate the total resistance trim and sinkage directly from the savitsky s theorem in this paper we used the c model from taunton et al 2010 to study and validate with their experimental results the main purpose of the present study is to show the accuracy of the cfd method in case of a well refined mesh and its similarities with experimental fluid dynamics also the trim results of savitsky s method can be applied as the initial conditions in the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model in order to reduce the computational time for this purpose one can consider savitsky s modified values as the initial trim so that the final height of the free surface refinement can be minimized and the vessel can be released in an approximation to its steady state condition the main challenge in the aforesaid approach is the error of savitsky s method which is the case study in the current paper there is a moderate difference in trim results of savitsky s method in comparison with both experimental and numerical approach the trim results of savitsky s method are greater in value than the measured ones hence a correction factor should be considered for this purpose 2 numerical simulation 2 1 hull geometry the c hull has an overall length of 2 m and a beam of 0 46 m with the hydrostatic draft of 0 09 m the weight of the craft is 243 40 n the dead rise angle for the hull is 22 5 which is the same as that of the other hull types a b and d in taunton et al 2010 the three dimensional cad of the hull has been drawn using the body plan presented in taunton et al 2010 the body plan view of the drafted hull for this study has also been presented in fig 1 2 2 volume of fluid vof method the volume of fluid vof solver has been chosen to capture the water iso surface around the planing hull such that the domain could be refined well in every direction this method was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 vof model assumes that all phases of a segregated multi phase flow are in a certain control volume which shares velocity pressure and other field functions thereby the basic governing equations of momentum mass and energy transport in each single phase are solved separately the general equations of density and kinematic viscosity are in the form below 1 ρ ρ i α i and 2 ν ν i α i where α i v i v effective density and effective viscosity can be computed by the formulas below 3 ρ e ρ w a t e r α w a t e r ρ a i r 1 α w a t e r 4 ν e ν w a t e r α w a t e r ν a i r 1 α w a t e r in which ρ e and ν e are effective density and effective kinematic viscosity respectively in eqs 3 and 4 α w a t e r has a value between 0 α water 1 and represents the volumetric ratio of fluids α w a t e r 1 for every cell shows that the cell is occupied with the water phase and α w a t e r 0 shows the air phase accordingly the other values of α w a t e r represent the mixture zone of vof solver therefore the vof scalar view has been monitored during the simulation to ensure that vof solver behaves accurately the transverse sections of the vof scalar view for f r 2 39 has been presented in fig 2 also the vof scalar views of the hull in two froude numbers are shown in fig 3 the numerical ventilation exists however the amount of ventilation is not able to affect the results 2 3 numerical approach the performance of the c hull from southampton series has been investigated in the present study by the rans and savitsky s method the key parameters such as total resistance total lift force trim and sinkage were computed by solving the rans equations around the hull with two degrees of freedom the hull was free to trim and heave during simulations after the release time 0 5s the computational domain dimensions are presented in fig 4 and is compared with the dimensions of the towing tank used in the experiments taunton et al 2010 as well as the cfd domain of lotfi et al 2015 in table 1 the generated hexahedral mesh has been shown in fig 5 in which five volumetric controls were created to refine the whole mesh in all directions in this case three blocks were used to simulate the free surface propagation in the whole computational domain also two additional volumetric controls were refined to simulate the wake pattern behind the transom the generated mesh grids has been involved the kelvin wave in the downstream of the computational domain and the chosen cusp angle for wake refinement volumetric controls is θ k e l v i n a r c s i n 1 3 19 47 which is the maximum angle of kelvin wave the cusp angle of wake refinements has been shown in fig 6 such simulations are performed in parallel mode on the system with 3 1 ghz intel core i5 processor with 4 gb of ram on average 3000 time steps were required to complete each simulation approximately 9 h have been spent on convergence for almost the minimum mesh number 675k elements it took about 12 h to complete the convergence for the largest number of elements 950k elements symmetry planes were used as boundary conditions for both sides of the computational domain velocity inlets were chosen for inlet top and bottom surfaces of the tank and finally the outlet boundary condition is actually pressure outlet no slip wall boundary condition was selected for the hull surfaces the implicit unsteady solver was selected due to the large range of courant friedrichs lewy cfl number supported by this solver this capability allows us to use different cell sizes at the computational domain the fluid flow assumed as turbulent and realizable k ε turbulence model with wall function was adopted to take viscous turbulence layer effects into account which is similar to that of eslamdoost et al 2018 there were no turbulent stimulation used in the present simulations however only the lowest running speed was below the critical reynolds number taunton et al 2010 all y wall treatment has been selected for the simulations prism layer mesher were used for boundary layer and the total thickness of the prism layers was calculated by the flat plate boundary layer thickness equation the length of the flat plate assumed to be equal to the overall length of the hull in these simulations as shown in fig 7 40 prism layers were used and the thickness of the first cell of the prism layer mesh from the wall was 5 e 5 meters in these simulations the timestep has been chosen as 0 01 s the maximum five inner iterations were considered at each timestep due to the limitations of the computational resources the resistance error in the three grid resolutions has been computed in order to choose the most suitable mesh these results are shown in table 2 for the fine mesh the y was in the range of 20 40 along the wetted area of the hull for the f n 2 39 the range of y below 30 shows that the wall is in the buffer zone but the all y wall treatment gives reasonable values also in this range in addition the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme is used to discretize the convective terms of vof transport equation presented in muzaferija 1998 which can track a sharp interface and resolves the free surface with one cell eslamdoost et al 2018 as the variation of resistance force is computed over three mesh conditions at f n 7 73 the uncertainty of the simulation over this speed is evaluated by the method which is presented by wilson et al 2001 however ittc procedures ittc 2008 explain that the numerical simulation uncertainty u s n is formed of iterative u i grid u g and time step u t s uncertainty as follows 5 u s n 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t s 2 but according to wilson et al 2001 and de marco et al de marco et al 2017 the most important source of uncertainty of the numerical results is the grid uncertainty thus the uncertainty of the numerical simulations at the f n 7 73 is computed for coarse medium and fine cases using grid convergence index gci and by using safety factor f s 1 25 which is recommended by roache 1998 2002 the mesh study shows that the convergence ratio r k ε 21 k ε 32 k is in the following range 0 r k 1 which shows that monotonic convergence is satisfied for the computation of the observed order of accuracy p k the following equation is used 6 p k l n ε 32 k ε 21 k l n r k in which r r is constant refinement ratio then the uncertainty of results is as below 7 u k f s ε 21 k r k p k 1 the grid uncertainty analysis for resistance n at fn 7 73 is given in table 3 3 savitsky s method in 1964 savitsky 1964 proposed a semi empirical technique to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls which is simple and fast the results of savitsky and brown 1976 showed that his presented equation for resistance prediction is very accurate in comparison with experimental tests at higher froude numbers f r l 1 it was also shown in savitsky and brown 1976 that this semi empirical method is possible to implement for different prismatic hulls and has an acceptable accuracy in comparison with measurements generally the equations of savitsky s method were presented for prismatic hulls in a more realistic view a planing hull has a variable deadrise angle along its length therefore the simple assumption of prismatic hull form is not applicable to warped planing hulls according to savitsky et al 2007 and begovic and bertorello 2012 the effect of variable deadrise could be implemented on the savitsky 1964 equations by taking effective deadrise and beam at lcg section also the whisker spray equation from savitsky et al 2007 were added to compute more realistic resistance force and trim angle for the c hull the flowchart of the implemented savitsky s method is presented in fig 8 hence the savitsky s method was applied to this float and the computed results have been compared with the rans method and experiments conducted by taunton et al 2010 4 results and discussion in the present numerical simulations the water iso surface was captured by iso value 0 5 which could affect the computed wetted area of the hull see fig 9 hence the selected iso value was the standard one and for all of froude numbers was constant it must be noted that the velocity u is non dimensionalized by displaced volume therefore f r u g 1 3 fig 10 determines that the present cfd study shows satisfactory results in accordance with experimental tests of taunton et al 2010 in the case of total resistance force as shown in fig 9 the grid resolution was at such a proper size to capture the flow pattern fig 12 shows the trend of computed trim follows the experimental values 4 1 satisfaction of lift force equilibrium in this study the lift force is compared with the displacement weight force which is presented as non dimensional l t δ ratio in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the computed lift force satisfactory results in accordance to the index line by observing fig 12 there is a slight difference in sinkage magnitudes in contrast with experimental results hence the force balance in the z direction of the float is accurate the higher lift force in lotfi et al 2015 is because of the numerical error therefore mesh continuum should be refined well to resolve the aforesaid error 4 2 sinkage results as it is shown in fig 5 the mesh should be refined well in the x y z directions and as a result the trend of the sinkage is similar to the experimental measurements than results of lotfi et al 2015 fig 12 illustrates the results of the dynamic sinkage for different methods used in the current study with respect to the experimental magnitudes of taunton et al 2010 the mean error of the sinkage for the cfd is 12 01 and for savitsky s method is 34 81 both methods had an acceptable trend but the cfd method is closer to the experimental results the error of savitsky s method in sinkage results is relevant to the error of computed wetted length and trim of the hull 4 3 computed trim angle computed trim angle by rans simulation has been presented in fig 13 as shown in this figure the trim angle has an acceptable accuracy with the experimental results and the trend of the proposed cfd simulations is following savitsky s applied method the average errors in computed trim angles of cfd and savitsky s method are respectively 9 17 and 37 9 versus experimental results in fig 13 there is an error in the numerical results in the range of 6 58 f r 7 73 this difference could be caused by the numerical error and our focus will be on this range of volumetric froude numbers in future works 4 4 computed resistance force presented numerically computed resistance force see fig 14 shows that its pattern mostly coincides with the experimental data the average error for the numerical results in resistance is approximately 2 77 in comparison with experimental results which is less than lotfi et al numerical model in the case of lotfi et al 2015 was 5 the accuracy of the presented numerical approach is due to the generated mesh around the hull and the prism layer mesher which have been used to create the computational domain also the other important factor in resolving the generated wave is the capturing scheme which is introduced in the volume of fluid section of the current paper the accuracy of the simulated wave pattern is of great importance to achieve that accuracy the hric scheme has been activated for each simulation thus the lower current number limit in the hric convection discretization scheme is set to 800 and the upper one is set to 850 these assumptions lead to a high reading results and a sharp interface between simulated air and water flows in addition to the cfd results the results of savitsky s method for resistance are shown in fig 14 the average resistance error for the savitsky s method is 6 99 compared to the experimental results whisker spray and deadrise angle corrections had significant effects on the resultant magnitudes of the savitsky s resistance force it can be said that both cfd and savitsky s method has an acceptable trend and accuracy on the resistance force in comparison with experimental results 4 5 wetted lengths one of the most important parameters to evaluate the running attitude of a planing hull is the computed wetted lengths thus the keel wetted length l k and chine wetted length l c were investigated at different volumetric froude numbers in table 4 the values of keel and chine wetted lengths are presented results of the present rans method and savitsky s method are presented simultaneously in comparison with the experimental results of taunton et al 2010 the maximum error percentage for the rans approach is 3 08 which is occurred in f r 3 01 and f r 5 97 while the minimum error is 0 77 which occurred in f r 4 81 the savitsky s method shows the average 28 42 error on l k and 32 13 for l c the aforesaid errors are too much and expected however the resistance magnitudes are more accurate than other parameters as shown in table 5 but the dynamic attitude of savitsky s method have errors up to 37 90 on trim angle and 34 82 on dynamic sinkage see table 5 4 6 streamline study a study on the flow pattern has been performed and streamline of the air and water phases have been represented to track the flow pattern around the hull as shown in figs 15 and 16 the streamlines are computed using backward integration mode general hydrodynamic principles state that the velocity vectors are tangent to each streamline fig 15 show three dimensional views of the computed streamlines at f r 7 73 and fig 16 shows the streamlines at f r 2 39 it is observed that by decreasing velocity the wake angle is increased the complexity of the flow at the spray zone is obvious as it is mentioned in mancini et al 2017 as well as comparing figs 16 and 15 the air streamlines are twisting when detached from the hull especially at the deck comparing figs 15 and 16 reveal the difference in the wake angle entirely by increasing the speed the effect of velocity on the wake angle is tangible by evaluating figs 15 and 16 fig 17 shows different phases of the fluid flow around the hull this method studies the flow lines locally and does not express the fluid flow

22663,in offshore platforms effective gas detection system is an essential layer of protection for preventing potential gas release accident from turning to fire and explosion disasters however according to statistics the actual efficiency of gas detection systems is still unsatisfactory in this work a stochastic programming sp approach is proposed to arrange gas detectors in optimal places combined with meteorological data and the hydrocarbon releases hcr database the equipment leakage scenarios are envisaged the computational fluid dynamics cfd commercial code ansys fluent is used to simulate selected scenarios and predict the consequences with the objective of minimizing the cumulative risk of gas leakage scenarios a stochastic mixed integer linear programming formulation based on p median value theorem is proposed then particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is used to solve the optimization model the gas detector placement optimization on an oil drilling production platform dpp is also carried out as a case example this methodology can be used in the design phase of offshore platform and can hopefully enhance the performance of the gas detection system keywords offshore platform leakage scenarios gas detector placement computational fluid dynamics cfd stochastic programming sp particle swarm optimization pso algorithm 1 introduction statistics show that in marine facilities more than 70 of the accidents stemming from hydrocarbon explosions and fires are associated with accidental releases of flammable gases hse 2007 broadly speaking a gas detection system can mitigate the risk of gas leakage and avoid catastrophic accidents an effective gas detection system is important when considering the safety function of addressing leakage by providing reliable and rapid detection before the hazardous situations become capable of causing subsequent damage to the facility or would prevent the safe escape of personnel however the actual performance of gas detection systems is still unsatisfactory for example statistics on offshore hydrocarbon release from the health and safety executive hse uk reported that gas leakage accidents with large rates

the paper with some conclusions and prospects 2 methodology for sensors allocation the flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 which will be described in detail in the following 2 1 establishing representative leakage scenario set 2 1 1 identification of leakage sources possible leakage sources can be identified by the combination of process hazard analysis and hse database which provides data on offshore hydrocarbon release incidents from 1992 to 2016 hse 2016 firstly potential leakage position of the dangerous gas can be identified through hazard and operability analysis hazop according to the real operation situation of offshore platform furthermore the hse database is used to acquire the leakage frequency and flow rate to strengthen the statistical based process analysis rather than relying solely on the experience of the analysis team to describe the possible leakage accident the leakage aperture divided into four categories is chosen as shown in table 1 api 2016 in this paper the equivalent hole diameter in the hse database is used to characterize the scenario and the calculation of the leakage probability is carried out on this basis taking the leakage accident of pig receiver as an example the relevant historical data can be accessed in the hse database according to the leak location described in the database the equivalent hole diameter is classified referring to typical leakage hole diameter range thereby identifying the leakage accidents under four kinds of aperture separately then count the number of accidents under each leak aperture of pig receiver to calculate the leakage probability corresponding of each leakage aperture the calculated number of accidents is divided by the total number of years and the total number of equipment the leakage sources can be described as eq 1 1 l l a b 0 a n 0 b 4 where l ab is the leakage source with the bth leakage hole size of the ath equipment and n is the total number of equipment that may leak and the probability p l ab can be calculated via using the methods proposed above 2 1 2 description of wind field the wind fields set of the offshore platform s position is quantitatively constructed by wind direction and wind velocity which exert an important influence on the gas leakage diffusion the whole wind direction is divided into eight orientations at intervals of 45 cma 2007 the wind velocity is divided into sections against the wind speed grade table nmc 2012 the original data collected from the meteorological bureau are processed by statistical method obtaining the frequency distribution of wind direction and wind speed finally the combination of two elements wind direction and wind velocity can be developed for describing the set of wind fields as shown in eq 2 2 w w θ v 0 θ 8 0 v m where w θν is the wind field whose direction is θ and speed is ν and m is the maximum wind speed based on meteorological data the joint distribution probability p w θν can be obtained by statistical method 2 1 3 leakage scenario set owing to the mutual independence between the set of leakage source and the wind field set a complete set of leakage scenarios is established by randomly combining the two parameters as shown in eq 3 3 s s θ v a b 0 θ 8 0 v m 0 a n 0 b 4 where s θνab is the scenario with the bth leakage hole size of the ath equipment in a wind field whose direction is θ and speed is ν the leakage probability of the scenario set s θνab namely p s θνab is described as shown in eq 4 4 p s θ v a b p l a b p w θ v 2 2 cfd simulations according to the detailed dimensions of the facility the overall geometric model of the simplified marine platform is established by the cfd preprocessor gambit then the three dimensional model is meshed in gambit and the hexahedral grid is applied after importing into fluent in the cfd model monitor points with a 5 m 5 m interval are set up to represent the potential candidate position of detectors ukooa 1995 the height of the detectors is decided according to the density of target gas in this study the target detection gas is ethane which is denser than the air so the height is set as 0 5 m above the floor or equipment mohurd 2009 during the cfd simulation gas concentrations on the monitor points can be recorded for further optimization analysis the simulation process is divided into two stages firstly steady state simulation is used to analyze the wind field constructing meteorological conditions then the unsteady solution to the concentration field of gas leakage and diffusion is adopted with a standard k e turbulence model 2 3 stochastic programming modeling and solution algorithm in kaplan et al kaplan and garrick 1981 the triplet definition of risk which answered the mean of risk is presented formulating a risk model on the basis of a structured set of scenarios as shown in eq 5 5 r s k p k r k k 1 2 k where k is the total number of scenarios s k is kth scenario identified p k is the occurrence probability of kth scenario r k is the consequence of kth scenario in part 2 1 the process of identifying the scenario and obtaining the corresponding occurrence probability has been precisely described with regard to the damage there are multiple ways to characterize consequences such as gas concentration time needed to reach alarm level or lethal percentage for toxic gases etc in this work the detection time is adopted to conduct quantitative assessment of the likely consequences which can be acquired by contrasting the real time gas concentration change obtaining from the cfd simulation and the preset alarm threshold in our case it is set that once the concentration of 25 lower explosive limit lel is reached at a monitor point we record it as a valid detection mohurd 2009 and the time needed for the monitor point to reach this concentration is recorded as the detection time the mixed integer linear programming formulation for gas detector placement optimization based on p median location selection problems is as follows 6 min i i z i j j d i j x i j 7 s t j j y j p 8 x i j y j i i j j 9 j j x i j 1 i i 10 y j 0 1 j j 11 x i j 0 1 i i j j where i is the set of leakage scenarios identified indexed by i j is the set of the monitoring points i e candidate detector locations indexed by j z i is the occurrence probability of a particular scenario d i j is the damage coefficient where the sensor at location j first detect the hazardous leakage scenarios i x i j is the indicator for location j that first detects leakage in scenarios i y j is the binary variable indicating whether or not arrange detector at monitoring point j p is the maximum number of gas sensors the objective function in eq 6 is expressed to minimize the risk of release scenarios considering both the consequences of each scenario and its actual occurrence probability in this work the detection time obtained from the cfd simulation is adopted as index to define the damage coefficient d i j if the detector location j is the first to detect scenario i the variable x i j will be 1 and 0 otherwise if the detector is arranged at monitoring point j y j 1 and 0 otherwise constraint 7 offers the ability to restrict the upper limit which is designed to guarantee the total number of detectors installed is no more than the maximum number p through constraint 8 the requirement that one monitoring point can detect the specific hazardous scenario i when there is a detector placed at location j can be ensured the constraint given by eq 9 represents the requirement that each scenario needs to be detected by at least one sensor that is to say a detector location which first detects the hazardous leakage scenario will be selected in solution scientifically two main algorithms can be applied to solve optimization problems named deterministic algorithm and stochastic optimization algorithm in this paper the discrete location problem is formulated where the deterministic algorithm solves this kind of optimization problem with low efficiency and poor quality while the stochastic algorithm can tackle such complex problem zhang et al 2017b the heuristic algorithm is the most effective way among stochastic optimization algorithm such as genetic algorithms ga simulated annealing sa and so on he et al 2009 among them pso has an increasingly wide and successfully utilization in diverse fields in solving practical engineering optimization problems das et al 2016 gandomi 2014 lalwani et al 2016 mendes et al 2016 mousa et al 2012 then the optimization problem defined in this work is solved by pso algorithm the location of the detectors is decided based on the iteration solution by the following steps step 1 input basic data including the iteration number t the population of particles m and the dimension of particles d step 2 initialize the iteration time t all particles position present and velocity v step 3 evaluate fitness of particles step 4 to search for the optimal solution the particle updates its velocity and position iteratively described as follows 12 v t 1 w v t c 1 r 1 p b e s t p r e s e n t t c 2 r 2 g b e s t p r e s e n t t 13 p r e s e n t t 1 p r e s e n t t v t 1 where v is the particles velocity w is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are the acceleration coefficient r 1 and r 2 are the random number uniformly distributed over 0 1 pbest is the personal best position of the particle historically present is the particles position gbest is the best position among all the particles which has been found so far step 5 update the pbest by comparing the position pbest with present pbest present if so and skip this step otherwise step 6 update the gbest by comparing the position gbest with present gbest present if so and skip this step otherwise step 7 when the convergence criteria of optimization algorithm is satisfied output the global best particle s position gbest based on the above programming formulation and solution algorithm a matlab program is applied to obtain the optimal results 3 case study in this work an optimization of flammable gas detectors placement in an oil drilling production platform dpp in south china sea is demonstrated as a case study this platform carries out the drilling and primary separation of oil from water then transports crude oil to the next unit i e fpso according to the characteristics of the process the flammable gas ethane is identified and chosen as the dangerous gas which has a potential possibility of releasing 3 1 representative leakage scenarios a total of 16 equipment with the possibility of gas leakage namely potential leakage sources are identified combined with hazop analysis and the statistical data of hse the leakage source set was reviewed again by referring the hse database for example since there was no record indicating that the pig receiver had a large hole leakage only three scales of leakage holes were considered reasonable for it therefore the leakage source set is established containing 33 conditions instead of 64 conditions in theory 16 leakage sources identified 4 leakage hole sizes based on the leakage sources and the wind field set a complete set of 1848 leakage scenarios 33 leakage source set 8 wind directions 7 wind velocities is established due to the high cost of cfd computation it is not cost effective to predict all the scenarios representative scenarios selection according to their occurrence probability is recommended table 2 shows the number and probability of scenarios under various selection criteria under the selection criteria of 10 5 per year 495 scenarios can be screened out from 1848 scenarios while the coverage ratio of the scenario probability reaches 98 5 in this way the efficiency of subsequent calculation is significantly improved and the computational cost of the prediction of scenario consequences can be effectively reduced 3 2 cfd simulations the ddp in our case composes four decks main deck cellar deck sub cellar deck and walkway deck the geometry dimensions of the platform are 41 m 65 m 56 6 m and the computational domain is set as 150 m 200 m 100 m the geometry and the mesh of the platform is generated by cfd preprocessor gambit presented in fig 2 the final mesh is shown in fig 3 the original cell number is 8 511 586 and the final cell number reduced to 2 139 375 after a hexahedral conversion the detector network is composed of 274 equidistant points spaced 5 m 5 m with a height of 0 5 m as shown in fig 4 potential detector placement locations are represented by symbol the simulations are performed on a server with an intel i7 4790 cpu 3 6 ghz and 32 gb ram for the transient simulations the time step is set as 0 5 s with a leak time of 300 s a total of 495 leakage scenario consequences have been simulated and predicted gas concentration contours which are similar to those presented in fig 5 can be given through the cfd simulation of gas dispersion by defining the concentration isosurface of 1 10 4 mol fraction the dispersion process of gas cloud is retrieved during the initial stage of dispersion the flammable gas cloud size increases with time until 60 s and gradually stabilizes afterwards a criterion of 25 lel is set to judge whether a monitor point can successfully detect a leakage scenario and the time needed to reach the alarm threshold will be recorded to provide the quantitative data for the next step for optimal detector placement 3 3 optimization results the detector layout is optimized for the whole platform there are two main problems to address the proper number of detectors and the optimal placement scheme under a certain number the objective function value ofv of the optimization function described in formula 6 is calculated ofv in this case is the product of the scenario occurrence probability and the detection time in units of 10 8 the ofv calculated estimates the performance of the layout scheme under all scenarios therefore fig 6 shows a pictorial description of the maximum foreseeable loss under different layout schemes with different detector numbers for mcdt the ofv decreases while the number of detectors increases which tends to be stable when the number of detectors reaches a certain value it can be seen that when the number of gas detectors arranged reaches 30 the expected risk will arrive at stabilization at this time increasing the number of gas detectors will only enhance the cost rather than effectively reduce risk this illustrates that no more detectors are required after that point thus it can be determined that the optimal number of gas detectors should be around 30 under mcdt scheme in this work the optimal placement scheme under 30 detectors is shown in fig 7 and symbol shows the optimal placement scheme 3 4 discussions the expected performance of original scheme has also been evaluated as shown in table 3 its ofv is 7 4362 10 8 if we define the enhancement rate ei as the ratio as formula 14 we can see the optimization effects more clearly it is noteworthy that f only serves as a quantitative indicator of the performance of the layout scheme in all scenarios and does not have the real meaning of the actual detection and alarm time 14 e i f o r i g n a l f o p t i m i z e d f o r i g n a l where f orignal is the performance of the original scheme f optimized is the performance of an optimized scheme the ei mcdt original comparing the risk control effect of original scheme and optimization scheme illustrations that the comprehensive performance of the placement scheme obtained from mcdt is much better than the original scheme selecting the sub cellar deck as an example the optimal placement scheme under 30 detectors and its comparison to the original scheme is shown in fig 8 the symbol represents the original scheme while the placement scheme placed by mcdt is marked with the symbol it can be seen that the original scheme is mainly arranged in the vicinity of the leakage source according to the standard which does not take into account the occurrence probability of leak source and the influence of weather factors on the basis of satisfying the standards the optimization model presented in this paper gives an efficient scheme which accords with the law of gas diffusion and makes up for the deficiency of the original scheme in risk control 4 conclusions and prospects in this paper we proposed a sp approach for optimal placement of gas detectors in offshore platforms to scientifically identify potential leakage scenarios and improve risk characterization an effective technique which combines the offshore hydrocarbon releases database is provided by comparing the pfd p ids and equipment type with the information of the hcr database the accuracy of leakage source identification is ensured the description of leakage probability aperture and leakage flow rate contained in the hcr database can provide data support for the similar equipment identified on offshore platforms applied as a reference for scenario set up particularly this method combining the database is valid to reflect the real risk of the scenario for risk assessment in addition the method of constructing the complete accident scenario set cass is presented that is to establish the set of leakage scenarios by considering the leakage sources and wind fields the leakage probability of the scenario set is composed of the leakage probability of the scenario set from the analysis of the database and the joint distribution probability of wind field obtained by the analysis of the historical data compared with the previous studies which only use the worst case scenario or considered the scenario set to have equal occurrence probability the cass approach is more realistic and can improve the performance of gas detector layout scheme the purpose of this study is to systematically quantify the risk in the region and put forward the method of constructing the systematic optimization model the methodology proposed can be served as an important reference for the detector layout in the design phase of offshore platform which gives the high efficiency detector allocation scheme on the basis of satisfying the standard and achieves optimal risk control effect of the gas detection system under the influence of uncertain factors since the gas dispersion simulation results have a significant impact on optimization the input variable in the simulation model i e the choice of scenarios such as leak location leak direction weather conditions and so on is essential for a successful study in future work research on further identifying the leakage sources will be pursued thereby increasing the diversity of potential leak locations besides different leak directions from a same leakage source will be investigated to test the reliability of layout schemes for flammable gas large leakage rates usually higher than 1 kg s are more likely to result in serious consequences however sometimes when toxic gas is involved in the problem the alarm concentration is much lower therefore for toxic gas even small leakage rate is worth noting in this paper a systematic method which can be applied to all dangerous gases is proposed although all potential leakage should be detected theoretically a small leakage rate would require a very dense array of detectors this unsatisfactory design of the detection system will lead to the unrealistic number of detectors which makes it economically infeasible for flammable gases these small leakage rates are usually not critical to detect for safety reasons a significant leakage rate will be required to have potential to generate any significant overpressures of concern so in the future we will make a deeper investigation of the large leakage rates that can reach the size of the dangerous cloud in this research the leakage source is more important than the wind condition since simulations are performed for various wind conditions there are some scenarios under the same leakage source with different wind speeds and directions future research in this context may focus on reducing the number of wind fields by choosing the dominant wind direction and speed thus to allocate more computation resources to simulate the scenarios made by different leakage sources one of the future efforts of this work can also be focused on the release scenario reduction and its impact on the placement scheme a hierarchical cluster analysis will be carried out to reduce the scenario number while remaining the integrity and diversity of release scenario we will evaluate the influence on the optimization schemes which may result from scenario reduction by comparing the optimal scheme acquired from the full original scenarios with the reduced scenarios obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis another future effort lies on the improvement of optimization models to make it more realistic to the industry practice on the one hand we need to consider implementing more effective quantitative risk assessment methods such as the individual risk additionally it is also necessary to take into account the unavailability and voting logic of detector network which might have the potential for failure of detecting a

marine facilities more than 70 of the accidents stemming from hydrocarbon explosions and fires are associated with accidental releases of flammable gases hse 2007 broadly speaking a gas detection system can mitigate the risk of gas leakage and avoid catastrophic accidents an effective gas detection system is important when considering the safety function of addressing leakage by providing reliable and rapid detection before the hazardous situations become capable of causing subsequent damage to the facility or would prevent the safe escape of personnel however the actual performance of gas detection systems is still unsatisfactory for example statistics on offshore hydrocarbon release from the health and safety executive hse uk reported that gas leakage accidents with large rates

to the detailed dimensions of the facility the overall geometric model of the simplified marine platform is established by the cfd preprocessor gambit then the three dimensional model is meshed in gambit and the hexahedral grid is applied after importing into fluent in the cfd model monitor points with a 5 m 5 m interval are set up to represent the potential candidate position of detectors ukooa 1995 the height of the detectors is decided according to the density of target gas in this study the target detection gas is ethane which is denser than the air so the height is set as 0 5 m above the floor or equipment mohurd 2009 during the cfd simulation gas concentrations on the monitor points can be recorded for further optimization analysis the simulation process is divided into two stages firstly steady state simulation is used to analyze the wind field constructing meteorological conditions then the unsteady solution to the concentration field of gas leakage and diffusion is adopted with a standard k e turbulence model 2 3 stochastic programming modeling and solution algorithm in kaplan et al kaplan and garrick 1981 the triplet definition of risk which answered the mean of risk is presented formulating a risk model on the basis of a structured set of scenarios as shown in eq 5 5 r s k p k r k k 1 2 k where k is the total number of scenarios s k is kth scenario identified p k is the occurrence probability of kth scenario r k is the consequence of kth scenario in part 2 1 the process of identifying the scenario and obtaining the corresponding occurrence probability has been precisely described with regard to the damage there are multiple ways to characterize consequences such as gas concentration time needed to reach alarm level or lethal percentage for toxic gases etc in this work the detection time is adopted to conduct quantitative assessment of the likely consequences which can be acquired by contrasting the real time gas concentration change obtaining from the cfd simulation and the preset alarm threshold in our case it is set that once the concentration of 25 lower explosive limit lel is reached at a monitor point we record it as a valid detection mohurd 2009 and the time needed for the monitor point to reach this concentration is recorded as the detection time the mixed integer linear programming formulation for gas detector placement optimization based on p median location selection problems is as follows 6 min i i z i j j d i j x i j 7 s t j j y j p 8 x i j y j i i j j 9 j j x i j 1 i i 10 y j 0 1 j j 11 x i j 0 1 i i j j where i is the set of leakage scenarios identified indexed by i j is the set of the monitoring points i e candidate detector locations indexed by j z i is the occurrence probability of a particular scenario d i j is the damage coefficient where the sensor at location j first detect the hazardous leakage scenarios i x i j is the indicator for location j that first detects leakage in scenarios i y j is the binary variable indicating whether or not arrange detector at monitoring point j p is the maximum number of gas sensors the objective function in eq 6 is expressed to minimize the risk of release scenarios considering both the consequences of each scenario and its actual occurrence probability in this work the detection time obtained from the cfd simulation is adopted as index to define the damage coefficient d i j if the detector location j is the first to detect scenario i the variable x i j will be 1 and 0 otherwise if the detector is arranged at monitoring point j y j 1 and 0 otherwise constraint 7 offers the ability to restrict the upper limit which is designed to guarantee the total number of detectors installed is no more than the maximum number p through constraint 8 the requirement that one monitoring point can detect the specific hazardous scenario i when there is a detector placed at location j can be ensured the constraint given by eq 9 represents the requirement that each scenario needs to be detected by at least one sensor that is to say a detector location which first detects the hazardous leakage scenario will be selected in solution scientifically two main algorithms can be applied to solve optimization problems named deterministic algorithm and stochastic optimization algorithm in this paper the discrete location problem is formulated where the deterministic algorithm solves this kind of optimization problem with low efficiency and poor quality while the stochastic algorithm can tackle such complex problem zhang et al 2017b the heuristic algorithm is the most effective way among stochastic optimization algorithm such as genetic algorithms ga simulated annealing sa and so on he et al 2009 among them pso has an increasingly wide and successfully utilization in diverse fields in solving practical engineering optimization problems das et al 2016 gandomi 2014 lalwani et al 2016 mendes et al 2016 mousa et al 2012 then the optimization problem defined in this work is solved by pso algorithm the location of the detectors is decided based on the iteration solution by the following steps step 1 input basic data including the iteration number t the population of particles m and the dimension of particles d step 2 initialize the iteration time t all particles position present and velocity v step 3 evaluate fitness of particles step 4 to search for the optimal solution the particle updates its velocity and position iteratively described as follows 12 v t 1 w v t c 1 r 1 p b e s t p r e s e n t t c 2 r 2 g b e s t p r e s e n t t 13 p r e s e n t t 1 p r e s e n t t v t 1 where v is the particles velocity w is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are the acceleration coefficient r 1 and r 2 are the random number uniformly distributed over 0 1 pbest is the personal best position of the particle historically present is the particles position gbest is the best position among all the particles which has been found so far step 5 update the pbest by comparing the position pbest with present pbest present if so and skip this step otherwise step 6 update the gbest by comparing the position gbest with present gbest present if so and skip this step otherwise step 7 when the convergence criteria of optimization algorithm is satisfied output the global best particle s position gbest based on the above programming formulation and solution algorithm a matlab program is applied to obtain the optimal results 3 case study in this work an optimization of flammable gas detectors placement in an oil drilling production platform dpp in south china sea is demonstrated as a case study this platform carries out the drilling and primary separation of oil from water then transports crude oil to the next unit i e fpso according to the characteristics of the process the flammable gas ethane is identified and chosen as the dangerous gas which has a potential possibility of releasing 3 1 representative leakage scenarios a total of 16 equipment with the possibility of gas leakage namely potential leakage sources are identified combined with hazop analysis and the statistical data of hse the leakage source set was reviewed again by referring the hse database for example since there was no record indicating that the pig receiver had a large hole leakage only three scales of leakage holes were considered reasonable for it therefore the leakage source set is established containing 33 conditions instead of 64 conditions in theory 16 leakage sources identified 4 leakage hole sizes based on the leakage sources and the wind field set a complete set of 1848 leakage scenarios 33 leakage source set 8 wind directions 7 wind velocities is established due to the high cost of cfd computation it is not cost effective to predict all the scenarios representative scenarios selection according to their occurrence probability is recommended table 2 shows the number and probability of scenarios under various selection criteria under the selection criteria of 10 5 per year 495 scenarios can be screened out from 1848 scenarios while the coverage ratio of the scenario probability reaches 98 5 in this way the efficiency of subsequent calculation is significantly improved and the computational cost of the prediction of scenario consequences can be effectively reduced 3 2 cfd simulations the ddp in our case composes four decks main deck cellar deck sub cellar deck and walkway deck the geometry dimensions of the platform are 41 m 65 m 56 6 m and the computational domain is set as 150 m 200 m 100 m the geometry and the mesh of the platform is generated by cfd preprocessor gambit presented in fig 2 the final mesh is shown in fig 3 the original cell number is 8 511 586 and the final cell number reduced to 2 139 375 after a hexahedral conversion the detector network is composed of 274 equidistant points spaced 5 m 5 m with a height of 0 5 m as shown in fig 4 potential detector placement locations are represented by symbol the simulations are performed on a server with an intel i7 4790 cpu 3 6 ghz and 32 gb ram for the transient simulations the time step is set as 0 5 s with a leak time of 300 s a total of 495 leakage scenario consequences have been simulated and predicted gas concentration contours which are similar to those presented in fig 5 can be given through the cfd simulation of gas dispersion by defining the concentration isosurface of 1 10 4 mol fraction the dispersion process of gas cloud is retrieved during the initial stage of dispersion the flammable gas cloud size increases with time until 60 s and gradually stabilizes afterwards a criterion of 25 lel is set to judge whether a monitor point can successfully detect a leakage scenario and the time needed to reach the alarm threshold will be recorded to provide the quantitative data for the next step for optimal detector placement 3 3 optimization results the detector layout is optimized for the whole platform there are two main problems to address the proper number of detectors and the optimal placement scheme under a certain number the objective function value ofv of the optimization function described in formula 6 is calculated ofv in this case is the product of the scenario occurrence probability and the detection time in units of 10 8 the ofv calculated estimates the performance of the layout scheme under all scenarios therefore fig 6 shows a pictorial description of the maximum foreseeable loss under different layout schemes with different detector numbers for mcdt the ofv decreases while the number of detectors increases which tends to be stable when the number of detectors reaches a certain value it can be seen that when the number of gas detectors arranged reaches 30 the expected risk will arrive at stabilization at this time increasing the number of gas detectors will only enhance the cost rather than effectively reduce risk this illustrates that no more detectors are required after that point thus it can be determined that the optimal number of gas detectors should be around 30 under mcdt scheme in this work the optimal placement scheme under 30 detectors is shown in fig 7 and symbol shows the optimal placement scheme 3 4 discussions the expected performance of original scheme has also been evaluated as shown in table 3 its ofv is 7 4362 10 8 if we define the enhancement rate ei as the ratio as formula 14 we can see the optimization effects more clearly it is noteworthy that f only serves as a quantitative indicator of the performance of the layout scheme in all scenarios and does not have the real meaning of the actual detection and alarm time 14 e i f o r i g n a l f o p t i m i z e d f o r i g n a l where f orignal is the performance of the original scheme f optimized is the performance of an optimized scheme the ei mcdt original comparing the risk control effect of original scheme and optimization scheme illustrations that the comprehensive performance of the placement scheme obtained from mcdt is much better than the original scheme selecting the sub cellar deck as an example the optimal placement scheme under 30 detectors and its comparison to the original scheme is shown in fig 8 the symbol represents the original scheme while the placement scheme placed by mcdt is marked with the symbol it can be seen that the original scheme is mainly arranged in the vicinity of the leakage source according to the standard which does not take into account the occurrence probability of leak source and the influence of weather factors on the basis of satisfying the standards the optimization model presented in this paper gives an efficient scheme which accords with the law of gas diffusion and makes up for the deficiency of the original scheme in risk control 4 conclusions and prospects in this paper we proposed a sp approach for optimal placement of gas detectors in offshore platforms to scientifically identify potential leakage scenarios and improve risk characterization an effective technique which combines the offshore hydrocarbon releases database is provided by comparing the pfd p ids and equipment type with the information of the hcr database the accuracy of leakage source identification is ensured the description of leakage probability aperture and leakage flow rate contained in the hcr database can provide data support for the similar equipment identified on offshore platforms applied as a reference for scenario set up particularly this method combining the database is valid to reflect the real risk of the scenario for risk assessment in addition the method of constructing the complete accident scenario set cass is presented that is to establish the set of leakage scenarios by considering the leakage sources and wind fields the leakage probability of the scenario set is composed of the leakage probability of the scenario set from the analysis of the database and the joint distribution probability of wind field obtained by the analysis of the historical data compared with the previous studies which only use the worst case scenario or considered the scenario set to have equal occurrence probability the cass approach is more realistic and can improve the performance of gas detector layout scheme the purpose of this study is to systematically quantify the risk in the region and put forward the method of constructing the systematic optimization model the methodology proposed can be served as an important reference for the detector layout in the design phase of offshore platform which gives the high efficiency detector allocation scheme on the basis of satisfying the standard and achieves optimal risk control effect of the gas detection system under the influence of uncertain factors since the gas dispersion simulation results have a significant impact on optimization the input variable in the simulation model i e the choice of scenarios such as leak location leak direction weather conditions and so on is essential for a successful study in future work research on further identifying the leakage sources will be pursued thereby increasing the diversity of potential leak locations besides different leak directions from a same leakage source will be investigated to test the reliability of layout schemes for flammable gas large leakage rates usually higher than 1 kg s are more likely to result in serious consequences however sometimes when toxic gas is involved in the problem the alarm concentration is much lower therefore for toxic gas even small leakage rate is worth noting in this paper a systematic method which can be applied to all dangerous gases is proposed although all potential leakage should be detected theoretically a small leakage rate would require a very dense array of detectors this unsatisfactory design of the detection system will lead to the unrealistic number of detectors which makes it economically infeasible for flammable gases these small leakage rates are usually not critical to detect for safety reasons a significant leakage rate will be required to have potential to generate any significant overpressures of concern so in the future we will make a deeper investigation of the large leakage rates that can reach the size of the dangerous cloud in this research the leakage source is more important than the wind condition since simulations are performed for various wind conditions there are some scenarios under the same leakage source with different wind speeds and directions future research in this context may focus on reducing the number of wind fields by choosing the dominant wind direction and speed thus to allocate more computation resources to simulate the scenarios made by different leakage sources one of the future efforts of this work can also be focused on the release scenario reduction and its impact on the placement scheme a hierarchical cluster analysis will be carried out to reduce the scenario number while remaining the integrity and diversity of release scenario we will evaluate the influence on the optimization schemes which may result from scenario reduction by comparing the optimal scheme acquired from the full original scenarios with the reduced scenarios obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis another future effort lies on the improvement of optimization models to make it more realistic to the industry practice on the one hand we need to consider implementing more effective quantitative risk assessment methods such as the individual risk additionally it is also necessary to take into account the unavailability and voting logic of detector network which might have the potential for failure of detecting a

22664,in the current study it has been analyzed the submarine take off and subsequent submarine flight of a novel unmanned vehicle has two operational modes on sea surface as usv1 vehicle and submarine mode as uuv2 in the submarine mode the vehicle operates with the wings in a horizontal position and a specific speed that is needed for the immersion the vehicle does not function as an underwater glider it functions closer to an underwater aircraft for that reason the performance must be evaluated as a function of the generated drag and lift due to the nature of its double purpose it is required to know the performances in two conditions fully submerged and on surface these two cases will be analyzed with different numerical models for both scenarios with free surface for usv mode and for the uuv mode these scenarios are set out with four different numerical models which are central body with central wing central wing central wing with flaps at 20 and wing on surface to measure the correlation between generated lift and speed a 1 2 scale model was used and tested in open waters the data gathered in those tests was used to validate the mentioned cfd simulations keywords hydrodynamic numerical simulation winged submarine lift drag 1 introduction this article addresses the research about the vehicle that aims to combine the functions of an unmanned underwater vehicle uuv and an unmanned surface vehicle usv the vehicle is capable of swinging its wings from horizontal position to vertical in that situation the vehicle becomes a catamaran this mode changing ability is which makes it so innovative for that reason the vehicle has two differentiated operational modes that allow configuring the vehicle for every mission through a specific mode change system within the submarine mode the vehicle can be categorized inside winged submarine as it has a configuration of central body with wings and other equipment on the top this other equipment gives the needed buoyancy to keep the vehicle on surface therefore the vehicle needs to reach a determined speed to submerge and compensate with hydrodynamic lift the maximum displacement fully submerged which is always higher than the maximum weight of the vehicle for that reason the lift generated by the wing has to be determined in order to know the immersion speed of the vehicle both being on surface as well as fully submerged due to its design the central wing is always submerged even at zero speed the purpose of those studies is to determine and to compare lift drag between different navigation situations on uuv mode and the influence of the main body of the vehicle with regard to the wing four alternative numerical models were developed that replicates the certain moments of the submarine flight and take off of the vehicle these models are summarized as follows 1 fully submerged with main body and wing 2 only the wing and same conditions of model 1 3 only the wing with the flaps at 20 4 wing on surface it is intended to compare for a significant and equal velocity in all models the lift as well as the drag generated in each case thereby the generated lift will compensate the vertical pushing force generated by a disw3 greater than the vehicle s weight and the drag will be compensated by the thrust of the propellers usually all numerical models have only one half sleeve to reduce computing times and keeping the same accuracy with the study we are able to characterize the behavior of the takeoff and underwater flight of the convertible vehicle in one of its modes of operation we can also correlate the numerical models used four different with the open water tests of the towed 1 2 model without propellers for this new type of vehicle this study can be very useful to researchers or engineers that want to determine the immersion speed in this kind of vehicle with modifications of the geometry scale or purposes 2 design 2 1 novel vehicle design the vehicle has three separate parts which are the central body and two wing floats the central body contains among other devices active sonar and electronics the wings themselves incorporate the mechanical system that allows the vehicle to change the relative position of the wing floats within the central body on the end of each wing float is located the subsea housing for the batteries and the compressed air system that drives the mode change mechanism allocated inside each wing the compressed air is stored in bottles which are placed on the end of each wing floats along with low density foam separating the bottles in each wing those elements give the vehicle the buoyancy needed to float on the surface hanging from the wings there are the propellers that drive the vehicle on the surface the vehicle can be in two positions one with the wing floats in vertical position similar to a usv catamaran the other with the wings in a horizontal position winged submarine which is the mode studied in this paper fig 1 see fig 2 in the same manner that an airplane compensates for its weight with the lift of the wings in order to get off the ground this vehicle in uuv mode is able to generate downforce in the wing that pushes against the displacement force that the fluid exerts when the vehicle is floating in the surface this force is vertical and upwards so the wing lift must be vertical and downwards like the wing of an airplane but placed in an inverse manner the vehicle takes off from the surface towards the bottom in a vertical descent unlike an airplane fig 2 the wing compensates for the weight of the volume of water displaced from the submersion of the entire body as it is greater than the vehicle s weight therefore when the vehicle is stopped and inactive it floats with only part of its body submerged 2 2 new vehicle vs gliders the vehicle is propelled with four or two thrusters depending of the version and there is no variation in the center of gravity or buoyancy unlike the gliders singh et al 2017 regarding this the dynamic of the submarine flight and the submarine take off is closer to a plane rather than a glider mahmoudian 2009 the scaled model used for the open water take off tests is towed by the same point as the propellers are placed in the production version but the vehicle itself it is not a towed fish linklater 2005 neither is intended to remain near the surface once the vehicle submerged since the geometry of the vehicle changes completely depending on whether the wings are in vertical or horizontal position we are forced to use other reference points to determine the immersion for example of the central wing fig 3 the wing immersion is a key parameter in the vehicle design as its ground effect affects the free surface as explained later the only waterproof elements of the vehicle s central body are the subsea electronics housing and the sonar the parts responsible for most water displacement are the floaters or skids they have compressed air and pneumatic equipment inside that makes switching between modes possible this ensures the vehicle will always have the center of buoyancy higher than the center of mass contributing to the vehicle s stability underwater when the vehicle decelerates the wing loses lift downforce and will ascend to the surface this guarantees the recovery of the vehicle in case of a loss of power or a failure in the propulsion systems the particular nature of the vehicle leaves some areas to be studied this would require new types of tests for these navigation features in particular in the underwater navigation mode wings in the horizontal position parallel to the water surface the vehicle should make an underwater take off immersion moving it away from the free surface it must be clear that the vehicle does not function as an underwater glider it functions closer to an underwater aircraft this way the take off is performed is the opposite of how a plane would do it the plane ascends while this vehicle descends submarine liftoff in this underwater lift off the vehicle s geometry and the wings position in respect to the free surface produce a ground effect which impacts the free surface this phenomenon modifies the wave pattern thus creating additional lift and drag in the study the lift generated is compared between 4 numerical models to contrast the body lift lift generated apart from the wings at different moments of the underwater flight particularly on take off in order to quantify the lift generated from the wing different configurations are simulated wing on the surface without flaps submerged wing without flaps submerged wing and central body without flaps and submerged wing with flaps each of those simulations has a different numerical model with adequate boundary conditions and mesh the meshes shown in the study are related to different numerical models not different alternatives of a single one 2 3 simulation and validation of the new vehicle to check and validate the numerical model suitability a simplified 1 2 model in the uuv mode coupled with an ins inertial navigation system was tested in open waters this ins has an imu inertial movement unit capable of recording the vehicle movement with its accelerometers the vehicle was towed by a surface boat pulled on the same points were the thrusters would be installed this way some stability measurements are recorded including phugoids or other parameters which are typical of aircraft design but not of conventional submarines to obtain the drag of ships scale models are usually applied not only in the towing tank models but also with the cfds this way the cfd does not reproduce the real model but a scaled one this is achieved by the model s mesh as it must reproduce the boundary layer around the body since the size of this layer is several orders of magnitude less than the size of the real ship the necessary computation power would escalate by the greater number of mesh elements grid spacing and y since the imu records the accelerations as time series integrating the values of both speed and distance can be calculated as well as the followed path will enable the determination of the depth of immersion and the speeds of the entire process among other parameters a ship of 40 m could be tested with a cfd at 1 20 scale and have good results a model of 2 m would need a mesh of about 3 106 elements wood et al 2007 otherwise the mesh for the real ship this would be larger by several orders of magnitude making it impractical the small dimensions fig 4 compared with large ships of the 1 2 model l 1 m and the real model l 2 m allows to be tested with non scaled cfds being able to replicate the boundary layer correctly without dramatically increasing the number of mesh elements the selected code for carrying out the numerical simulations is ansys cfx thus the vehicle has the following main dimensions table 1 according to the specified data lift must be at least 110 kgf 1078 n of the maximum displacement of the vehicle to be able to submerge it regarding the immersion of the ensemble at zero speed it is floating at half draft of the floats located in the edge of the outer floating bodies with the wing fully submerged the draft of the wing midline is called wing relative depth on table 1 3 numerical setup independent meshes were developed for each numerical model four different the meshes developed are of non structured type which have as common feature a near subdomain that allows introducing more details to reproduce geometry properly we have added local controls of side size as well as pinch tools in specific locations as curvature changes or complex junctions fig 5 the mesh setup is very similar in models 1 2 and 3 but different in model 4 due to the existence of a free surface this makes that in the fully submerged models figs 6 8 and in general fig 9 the mesh had two differentiated domains with a higher degree of detail in the case of the near field to the body under study as discussed before ruo si 2014 peng 2014 wood et al 2007 and zwart et al 2008 3 1 mesh generation for the treatment of the wall we begin with a y 2 as mesh objective according to the following general expression y ρ u τ y 1 μ δ y 1 y μ ρ u τ therefore δy will vary for each speed for that reason we have developed as many meshes as tested speeds to reproduce this cfx code is used with the inflation system for the boundary layer called first layer thickness with a maximum number of layers of 15 and a value of growth rate of 1 3 in the model 1 we have used a value of 1 5 for growth rate to obtain a mesh quality analogous to the other models hadipour 2015 in order to measure the mesh quality skewness and orthogonal quality were used for this purpose in the first case a value closer to one fig 10 was the objective and a value closer to zero in the second case fig 10 the order of magnitude of the boundary layer thickness at which numerical models were tested is δy k 10 5 m where k 1 10 for expected speeds in models in both figures the number of elements is shown regarding its metric the elements discussed in the figures are tetrahedron with 4 faces tet4 pyramid with 5 faces pyr5 and wedge with 6 faces wed6 for the specific case of the wing on free surface three differentiated domains were used this model shares a near domain of similar size although a specific inflation was used for the water dominion and another for the interface dominion in order to reproduce the wave on surface correctly and to reduce the iterations times regarding growth rate it was established in 1 3 the same as in models 2 and 3 in relation to the number of elements it can be outlined as follows table 2 3 2 boundary condition two families of boundary conditions were used one for fully submerged models i e for models 1 2 and 3 and another for the wing on surface model model 4 in the submerged models the domain is a half cylinder oriented in flow direction these boundary conditions are shown on fig 11 and can be summarized in a symmetry sim applied in the center plane and a free slip wall fsw in the external curved face regarding the inlet and outlet conditions the velocity in cartesian coordinates was introduced for both inlet and outlet with identical values in the submerged model the distance between the body and the inlet is 0 7 l and the distance between inlet and outlet is 3 5 l the minimum distance to fsw is 2 l in the case of the model with free surface model 4 parallelepiped with equal sides two by two fig 12 was made the distance from the body to inlet is 1 5 l and to outlet is 3 5 l the distance to bottom is 2 l and to open is 0 5 l and regarding to the fsw parallel to sim is 2 5 l in relation to the boundary conditions of the wing on surface model model 4 was needed to introduce an interface for that volume fraction of water applied to inlet flow was taken for the outlet flow the interface as a function of the hydrostatic pressure was defined which depends of the volume fraction for the upper face an opening with a relative pressure defined and a value of volume fraction of zero with regard to water was chosen the remaining conditions were free slip wall for the rest of walls except the center plane which is symmetry boundary conditions could be summarized as follows table 3 and table 4 3 3 governing equations the code selected is ansys cfx implementing shear stress transport sst menter et al 2003 for the turbulence model the two equation models are the most used to solve rans equations because they offer a good balance between the numerical effort and accuracy also they are more sophisticated models than zero equations the k ε model introduces new variables to the equations system thus the continuity equation is 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 the equation of the momentum is 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x i and finally the energy equation is 3 t ρ h t o t x j ρ h t o t u j p t x j u i τ i j λ t x j where τ i j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x j h t o t h 1 2 u i 2 however the k ε model is not able to reproduce the turbulent behavior in the closest layers to the wall on the other hand the k ω model is much more accurate in those regions but it fails in flows with induced pressure by separation that leads to sst model that allows the right elections of the model k ε or k ω through mixing functions we have used this model to carry out this study the formulation is as follows 4 ρ k t ρ u i k x i p k β ρ k ω x i μ σ k μ t k x i 5 ρ ω t u i ω x i α ρ s 2 β ρ ω 2 x i μ σ ω μ

10 10 y the distance to the nearest wall and v the kinematic viscosity f1 function will be zero far from surface k ε model and it will take a value higher than one inside the boundary layer k ω model the viscous turbulence could be formulated in a more realistic manner through 7 v t α 1 k max α 1 ω s f 2 where f2 is the second mixing function and is defined as f 2 t a n h m a x k β ω y 500 v y 2 ω

2003 and consist in the use of the deformation velocity s instead of vorticity in equation 7 and using a 10 factor instead 20 in equation 8 4 results in general the intention was to ensure that there was enough lift on the wing with a drag lower than the available thrust for that speed the higher drag will be found on surface because the edge of the wing is placed in the interface air water making the wave formation drag phenomenon to appear r w wave making resistance regarding the lift and prior to the calculations it cannot be assumed to be higher or lower since it is not known if the pressures field created by the body on surface and the proximity of the main wing will have a positive or negative effect regarding the lift compared with the fully submerged models the results of the four models are shown jointly and grouped in lift vs speed fig 13 and drag vs speed fig 14 in this way the results of the separate wings without the central body completely submerged cases 2 and 3 regarding to the results of the complete central body are compared in these studies not only the numerical results of lift and drag are checked but the work of the different elements of the wing and the fuselage is characterized by studies of current lines in these studies it is compared among others how the trajectory of these current lines is modified by the presence of high lift elements such as flaps and ailerons as well as the variation of the particle path of these by the presence of the central body being a high wing in which the high pressure zone is far from the central body fig 15 it has little influence regarding to the work of the wing where flow separation is seen it is at the aft part of the central body which creates a turbulence that modifies the current lines of the low pressure face of the wing astern and in the central area figs 16 and 17 it is verified that the upper zone of the wing which is of the high pressure fig 18 works uniformly where the presence of floats prevent the loss of circulation at the edges of the wing as in the case with conventional wings so the zones of high and low pressure zones are isolated from each other by the presence of this element this is verified in that the wing edge vortices are practically non existent with a distortion in the current lines only astern of said floats in the face closest to the wing fig 19 this effect can be

differentiated systems can be tested transversal and divergent the transverse system seems clearly influenced by the wing lift it appears as a disturbance of the free surface in the area between both floats where the central wing is located this can be attributed to the fact that the pressure field of the wing disturbs the free surface adding to the transverse system astern of the wing fig 23 in relation to the lift studies carried out four different curves can be seen that the lift with respect to the speed for a common aoa of 0 figs 13 and 24 is shown the lower curve refers to the submerged wing which is the one that will be taken as reference value immediately above it appears the curve relative to the central wing together with the central body where a certain positive effect can be seen in terms of lift immediately above these appear two different curves one of them is relative to the central wing with flaps at 20 and another of them refers to the body on the surface with regard to the body on the surface it can be seen that the lift grows dramatically from 1 m s exceeding the support of the central wing completely submerged with flaps at 20 from 1 5 m s establishing a comparison regarding to the fully submerged central wing some correction curves are presented in relation to this one which appear in fig 24 with respect to this the following formulation is proposed

v 0 0832 where v is in m s 1 as seen on figs 14 and 25 lift on surface over 1078 n 110 kgf is obtained as of 1 45 m s at this point drag in wing on surface should be checked if it is less than the lift available at that speed for that reason results on figs 14 and 24 are compared checking that the lift at that speed is more than twice the drag from that point the vehicle will submerge disappearing the term r w and therefore the curves of drag vs speed and lift vs speed change to as shown in fig 26 thus we expect that the maximum speed of the fully submerged vehicle will be at least 2 8 m s thrust vs speed curve obtained from thruster manufacturer data 5 validation to measure the correlation between generated lift and speed a 1 2 scale model was used and tested in open waters the

for this purpose a 1 2 scale model was used fig 27 this model is made from foam and grp glass reinforced plastic along an inner aluminum frame the model is simply towed from the tp towing points and it is not actuated mechanically in any way the model has a number of movable lifting surfaces which can be fixed on certain angles prior to each test consequently once the model is placed on the water it has no constraints but the tp with those dynamic towing tests the goal is to determine not only the immersion speed but to characterize the takeoff and subsequent submarine flight to properly characterize the movements for the non actuated model the inertia tensor needs to be modeled properly to address this a number of weights are added along the central body and wings as can be seen on fig 28 for the data gathering of those movements an imu inertial movement system placed in the ins inertial navigation system was used this device is placed bellow the model in a ssh sub sea housing

this several runs were made those runs include accelerating from 1 m s until the model fully submerges on every run the immersion speed is noted and the transition is the term used to refer to the process that goes from the acceleration until the model submerges fast transition means high acceleration and by contrast slow transition means slow acceleration the immersion sequence fig 30 starts

22664,in the current study it has been analyzed the submarine take off and subsequent submarine flight of a novel unmanned vehicle has two operational modes on sea surface as usv1 vehicle and submarine mode as uuv2 in the submarine mode the vehicle operates with the wings in a horizontal position and a specific speed that is needed for the immersion the vehicle does not function as an underwater glider it functions closer to an underwater aircraft for that reason the performance must be evaluated as a function of the generated drag and lift due to the nature of its double purpose it is required to know the performances in two conditions fully submerged and on surface these two cases will be analyzed with different numerical models for both scenarios with free surface for usv mode and for the uuv mode these scenarios are set out with four different numerical models which are central body with central wing central wing central wing with flaps at 20 and wing on surface to measure the correlation between generated lift and speed a 1 2 scale model was used and tested in open waters the data gathered in those tests was used to validate the mentioned cfd simulations keywords hydrodynamic numerical simulation winged submarine lift drag 1 introduction this article addresses the research about the vehicle that aims to combine the functions of an unmanned underwater vehicle uuv and an unmanned surface vehicle usv the vehicle is capable of swinging its wings from horizontal position to vertical in that situation the vehicle becomes a catamaran this mode changing ability is which makes it so innovative for that reason the vehicle has two differentiated operational modes that allow configuring the vehicle for every mission through a specific mode change system within the submarine mode the vehicle can be categorized inside winged submarine as it has a configuration of central body with wings and other equipment on the top this other equipment gives the needed buoyancy to keep the vehicle on surface therefore the vehicle needs to reach a determined speed to submerge and compensate with hydrodynamic lift the maximum displacement fully submerged which is always higher than the maximum weight of the vehicle for that reason the lift generated by the wing has to be determined in order to know the immersion speed of the vehicle both being on surface as well as fully submerged due to its design the central wing is always submerged even at zero speed the purpose of those studies is to determine and to compare lift drag between different navigation situations on uuv mode and the influence of the main body of the vehicle with regard to the wing four alternative numerical models were developed that replicates the certain moments of the submarine flight and take off of the vehicle these models are summarized as follows 1 fully submerged with main body and wing 2 only the wing and same conditions of model 1 3 only the wing with the flaps at 20 4 wing on surface it is intended to compare for a significant and equal velocity in all models the lift as well as the drag generated in each case thereby the generated lift will compensate the vertical pushing force generated by a disw3 greater than the vehicle s weight and the drag will be compensated by the thrust of the propellers usually all numerical models have only one half sleeve to reduce computing times and keeping the same accuracy with the study we are able to characterize the behavior of the takeoff and underwater flight of the convertible vehicle in one of its modes of operation we can also correlate the numerical models used four different with the open water tests of the towed 1 2 model without propellers for this new type of vehicle this study can be very useful to researchers or engineers that want to determine the immersion speed in this kind of vehicle with modifications of the geometry scale or purposes 2 design 2 1 novel vehicle design the vehicle has three separate parts which are the central body and two wing floats the central body contains among other devices active sonar and electronics the wings themselves incorporate the mechanical system that allows the vehicle to change the relative position of the wing floats within the central body on the end of each wing float is located the subsea housing for the batteries and the compressed air system that drives the mode change mechanism allocated inside each wing the compressed air is stored in bottles which are placed on the end of each wing floats along with low density foam separating the bottles in each wing those elements give the vehicle the buoyancy needed to float on the surface hanging from the wings there are the propellers that drive the vehicle on the surface the vehicle can be in two positions one with the wing floats in vertical position similar to a usv catamaran the other with the wings in a horizontal position winged submarine which is the mode studied in this paper fig 1 see fig 2 in the same manner that an airplane compensates for its weight with the lift of the wings in order to get off the ground this vehicle in uuv mode is able to generate downforce in the wing that pushes against the displacement force that the fluid exerts when the vehicle is floating in the surface this force is vertical and upwards so the wing lift must be vertical and downwards like the wing of an airplane but placed in an inverse manner the vehicle takes off from the surface towards the bottom in a vertical descent unlike an airplane fig 2 the wing compensates for the weight of the volume of water displaced from the submersion of the entire body as it is greater than the vehicle s weight therefore when the vehicle is stopped and inactive it floats with only part of its body submerged 2 2 new vehicle vs gliders the vehicle is propelled with four or two thrusters depending of the version and there is no variation in the center of gravity or buoyancy unlike the gliders singh et al 2017 regarding this the dynamic of the submarine flight and the submarine take off is closer to a plane rather than a glider mahmoudian 2009 the scaled model used for the open water take off tests is towed by the same point as the propellers are placed in the production version but the vehicle itself it is not a towed fish linklater 2005 neither is intended to remain near the surface once the vehicle submerged since the geometry of the vehicle changes completely depending on whether the wings are in vertical or horizontal position we are forced to use other reference points to determine the immersion for example of the central wing fig 3 the wing immersion is a key parameter in the vehicle design as its ground effect affects the free surface as explained later the only waterproof elements of the vehicle s central body are the subsea electronics housing and the sonar the parts responsible for most water displacement are the floaters or skids they have compressed air and pneumatic equipment inside that makes switching between modes possible this ensures the vehicle will always have the center of buoyancy higher than the center of mass contributing to the vehicle s stability underwater when the vehicle decelerates the wing loses lift downforce and will ascend to the surface this guarantees the recovery of the vehicle in case of a loss of power or a failure in the propulsion systems the particular nature of the vehicle leaves some areas to be studied this would require new types of tests for these navigation features in particular in the underwater navigation mode wings in the horizontal position parallel to the water surface the vehicle should make an underwater take off immersion moving it away from the free surface it must be clear that the vehicle does not function as an underwater glider it functions closer to an underwater aircraft this way the take off is performed is the opposite of how a plane would do it the plane ascends while this vehicle descends submarine liftoff in this underwater lift off the vehicle s geometry and the wings position in respect to the free surface produce a ground effect which impacts the free surface this phenomenon modifies the wave pattern thus creating additional lift and drag in the study the lift generated is compared between 4 numerical models to contrast the body lift lift generated apart from the wings at different moments of the underwater flight particularly on take off in order to quantify the lift generated from the wing different configurations are simulated wing on the surface without flaps submerged wing without flaps submerged wing and central body without flaps and submerged wing with flaps each of those simulations has a different numerical model with adequate boundary conditions and mesh the meshes shown in the study are related to different numerical models not different alternatives of a single one 2 3 simulation and validation of the new vehicle to check and validate the numerical model suitability a simplified 1 2 model in the uuv mode coupled with an ins inertial navigation system was tested in open waters this ins has an imu inertial movement unit capable of recording the vehicle movement with its accelerometers the vehicle was towed by a surface boat pulled on the same points were the thrusters would be installed this way some stability measurements are recorded including phugoids or other parameters which are typical of aircraft design but not of conventional submarines to obtain the drag of ships scale models are usually applied not only in the towing tank models but also with the cfds this way the cfd does not reproduce the real model but a scaled one this is achieved by the model s mesh as it must reproduce the boundary layer around the body since the size of this layer is several orders of magnitude less than the size of the real ship the necessary computation power would escalate by the greater number of mesh elements grid spacing and y since the imu records the accelerations as time series integrating the values of both speed and distance can be calculated as well as the followed path will enable the determination of the depth of immersion and the speeds of the entire process among other parameters a ship of 40 m could be tested with a cfd at 1 20 scale and have good results a model of 2 m would need a mesh of about 3 106 elements wood et al 2007 otherwise the mesh for the real ship this would be larger by several orders of magnitude making it impractical the small dimensions fig 4 compared with large ships of the 1 2 model l 1 m and the real model l 2 m allows to be tested with non scaled cfds being able to replicate the boundary layer correctly without dramatically increasing the number of mesh elements the selected code for carrying out the numerical simulations is ansys cfx thus the vehicle has the following main dimensions table 1 according to the specified data lift must be at least 110 kgf 1078 n of the maximum displacement of the vehicle to be able to submerge it regarding the immersion of the ensemble at zero speed it is floating at half draft of the floats located in the edge of the outer floating bodies with the wing fully submerged the draft of the wing midline is called wing relative depth on table 1 3 numerical setup independent meshes were developed for each numerical model four different the meshes developed are of non structured type which have as common feature a near subdomain that allows introducing more details to reproduce geometry properly we have added local controls of side size as well as pinch tools in specific locations as curvature changes or complex junctions fig 5 the mesh setup is very similar in models 1 2 and 3 but different in model 4 due to the existence of a free surface this makes that in the fully submerged models figs 6 8 and in general fig 9 the mesh had two differentiated domains with a higher degree of detail in the case of the near field to the body under study as discussed before ruo si 2014 peng 2014 wood et al 2007 and zwart et al 2008 3 1 mesh generation for the treatment of the wall we begin with a y 2 as mesh objective according to the following general expression y ρ u τ y 1 μ δ y 1 y μ ρ u τ therefore δy will vary for each speed for that reason we have developed as many meshes as tested speeds to reproduce this cfx code is used with the inflation system for the boundary layer called first layer thickness with a maximum number of layers of 15 and a value of growth rate of 1 3 in the model 1 we have used a value of 1 5 for growth rate to obtain a mesh quality analogous to the other models hadipour 2015 in order to measure the mesh quality skewness and orthogonal quality were used for this purpose in the first case a value closer to one fig 10 was the objective and a value closer to zero in the second case fig 10 the order of magnitude of the boundary layer thickness at which numerical models were tested is δy k 10 5 m where k 1 10 for expected speeds in models in both figures the number of elements is shown regarding its metric the elements discussed in the figures are tetrahedron with 4 faces tet4 pyramid with 5 faces pyr5 and wedge with 6 faces wed6 for the specific case of the wing on free surface three differentiated domains were used this model shares a near domain of similar size although a specific inflation was used for the water dominion and another for the interface dominion in order to reproduce the wave on surface correctly and to reduce the iterations times regarding growth rate it was established in 1 3 the same as in models 2 and 3 in relation to the number of elements it can be outlined as follows table 2 3 2 boundary condition two families of boundary conditions were used one for fully submerged models i e for models 1 2 and 3 and another for the wing on surface model model 4 in the submerged models the domain is a half cylinder oriented in flow direction these boundary conditions are shown on fig 11 and can be summarized in a symmetry sim applied in the center plane and a free slip wall fsw in the external curved face regarding the inlet and outlet conditions the velocity in cartesian coordinates was introduced for both inlet and outlet with identical values in the submerged model the distance between the body and the inlet is 0 7 l and the distance between inlet and outlet is 3 5 l the minimum distance to fsw is 2 l in the case of the model with free surface model 4 parallelepiped with equal sides two by two fig 12 was made the distance from the body to inlet is 1 5 l and to outlet is 3 5 l the distance to bottom is 2 l and to open is 0 5 l and regarding to the fsw parallel to sim is 2 5 l in relation to the boundary conditions of the wing on surface model model 4 was needed to introduce an interface for that volume fraction of water applied to inlet flow was taken for the outlet flow the interface as a function of the hydrostatic pressure was defined which depends of the volume fraction for the upper face an opening with a relative pressure defined and a value of volume fraction of zero with regard to water was chosen the remaining conditions were free slip wall for the rest of walls except the center plane which is symmetry boundary conditions could be summarized as follows table 3 and table 4 3 3 governing equations the code selected is ansys cfx implementing shear stress transport sst menter et al 2003 for the turbulence model the two equation models are the most used to solve rans equations because they offer a good balance between the numerical effort and accuracy also they are more sophisticated models than zero equations the k ε model introduces new variables to the equations system thus the continuity equation is 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 the equation of the momentum is 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x i and finally the energy equation is 3 t ρ h t o t x j ρ h t o t u j p t x j u i τ i j λ t x j where τ i j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x j h t o t h 1 2 u i 2 however the k ε model is not able to reproduce the turbulent behavior in the closest layers to the wall on the other hand the k ω model is much more accurate in those regions but it fails in flows with induced pressure by separation that leads to sst model that allows the right elections of the model k ε or k ω through mixing functions we have used this model to carry out this study the formulation is as follows 4 ρ k t ρ u i k x i p k β ρ k ω x i μ σ k μ t k x i 5 ρ ω t u i ω x i α ρ s 2 β ρ ω 2 x i μ σ ω μ t ω x i 2 1 f 1 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x i ω x i where the mixing function f1 is defined as 6 f 1 t a n h m i n m a x k β ω y 500 v y 2 ω 4 ρ σ ω 2 k c d k ω y 2 4 being c d k ω m a x 2 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x i ω x i 10 10 y the distance to the nearest wall and v the kinematic viscosity f1 function will be zero far from surface k ε model and it will take a value higher than one inside the boundary layer k ω model the viscous turbulence could be formulated in a more realistic manner through 7 v t α 1 k max α 1 ω s f 2 where f2 is the second mixing function and is defined as f 2 t a n h m a x k β ω y 500 v y 2 ω

k ω models β 0 09 α1 5 9 β1 3 40 σk1 0 85 σω1 0 5 α2 0 44 β2 0 0828 σk2 1 σω2 0 856 the modifications regarding the original formulation menter 1993 and menter 1994 are the proposals in menter et al 2003 and consist in the use of the deformation velocity s instead of vorticity in equation 7 and using a 10 factor instead 20 in equation 8 4 results in general the intention was to ensure that there was enough lift on the wing with a drag lower than the available thrust for that speed the higher drag will be found on surface because the edge of the wing is placed in the interface air water making the wave formation drag phenomenon to appear r w wave making resistance regarding the lift and prior to the calculations it cannot be assumed to be higher or lower since it is not known if the pressures field created by the body on surface and the proximity of the main wing will have a positive or negative effect regarding the lift compared with the fully submerged models the results of the four models are shown jointly and grouped in lift vs speed fig 13 and drag vs speed fig 14 in this way the results of the separate wings without the central body completely submerged cases 2 and 3 regarding to the results of the complete central body are compared in these studies not only the numerical results of lift and drag are checked but the work of the different elements of the wing and the fuselage is characterized by studies of current lines in these studies it is compared among others how the trajectory of these current lines is modified by the presence of high lift elements such as flaps and ailerons as well as the variation of the particle path of these by the presence of the central body being a high wing in which the high pressure zone is far from the central body fig 15 it has little influence regarding to the work of the wing where flow separation is seen it is at the aft part of the central body which creates a turbulence that modifies the current lines of the low pressure face of the wing astern and in the central area figs 16 and 17 it is verified that the upper zone of the wing which is of the high pressure fig 18 works uniformly where the presence of floats prevent the loss of circulation at the edges of the wing as in the case with conventional wings so the zones of high and low pressure zones are isolated from each other by the presence of this element this is verified in that the wing edge vortices are practically non existent with a distortion in the current lines only astern of said floats in the face closest to the wing fig 19 this effect can be observed in the upper face of the floats for all the submerged models 1 2 and 3 being less present in the lower face figs 20 22 regarding to the wing on surface model comparisons two clearly differentiated systems can be tested transversal and divergent the transverse system seems clearly influenced by the wing lift it appears as a disturbance of the free surface in the area between both floats where the central wing is located this can be attributed to the fact that the pressure field of the wing disturbs the free surface adding to the transverse system astern of the wing fig 23 in relation to the lift studies carried out four different curves can be seen that the lift with respect to the speed for a common aoa of 0 figs 13 and 24 is shown the lower curve refers to the submerged

that allows knowing the lift for each one of the situations starting from fully submerged wing from the curves we can represent the lift coefficients as follows fig 25 c l i f t l i f t 1 2 ρ v 2 a l i f t as expected for both wing submerged and wing with flaps at 20 the curves are parallel to each other and to the horizontal axis the curve related to full body is almost parallel so correction factors for the lifting calculation regarding to wing submerged are proposed in the case of wing on surface for c lift it is increasing with the following formulation fig 25 c l i f t 0 0835 v 2 0 084 v 0 0832 where v is in m s 1 as seen on figs 14 and 25 lift on surface over 1078 n 110 kgf is obtained as of 1 45 m s at this point drag in wing on surface should be checked if it is less than the lift available at that speed for that reason results on figs 14 and 24 are compared checking that the lift at that speed is more than twice the drag from that point the vehicle will submerge
