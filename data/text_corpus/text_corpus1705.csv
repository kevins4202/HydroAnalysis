8525,study region chorabari glacier in upper ganga basin garhwal himalaya study focus authors attempt to characterize the isotopic signatures in different components of the hydrological cycle and decipher the role of summer and winter precipitation on glacier melt using stable isotopes δd δ18o coupled with existing hydrometeorological observations during the glacier ablation season june september for the years 2011 2012 new hydrological insights the isotopic composition of various components of hydrological cycle i e precipitation rainfall and snowfall glacier surface ice and glacier melt have partly overlapping isotopic ranges δ18o δd and d excess compositon indicates that precipitation during pre monsoon may june and post monsoon september october season have mixing of local moisture with that from westerlies while during monsoon june september rainfall runoff contributes to the streamflow with snow and glacier melt the depletion pattern of snow covered area sca reflected by snow depletion curves sdc imply that most of the solid precipitation in the region results from westerlies while during summers the precipitation from the indian summer monsoon ism is in the form of rainfall over higher altitudes the isotopic depletion curve idc of meltwater follows the trend of sdc s the backward wind trajectories for the precipitation events also indicate that the source of winter precipitation is from westerlies while summer precipitation is from ism present day δ18o δd and d excess composition and their climatic interpretation are site and time specific keywords stable isotopes indian summer monsoon westerlies snow depletion curve isotopic depletion curve 1 introduction the application of isotopes in hydrology and climate sciences is based on the general concept of tracing in which either artificially introduced isotopes or naturally occurring environmental isotopes are employed which can be used for a wide range of applications owing to their abundances and natural fractionation phase change in nature these isotopes have been applied to understand the hydrological cycle behrens et al 1975 ramesh and sarin 1992 ladouche et al 2001 burns 2002 carey and quinton 2005 rai et al 2016 cable et al 2011 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 dahlke et al 2014 wang et al 2015 atmospheric processes schmidt et al 2005 tian et al 2007 risi et al 2008 vimeux et al 2011 gao et al 2011 and paleoclimate reconstruction based on proxy archives of ice cores tree rings lake sediments ocean cores speleotherms etc thompson 2000 kang et al 2002 gupta et al 2003 ramirez et al 2003 yao et al 2008 liang and eckstein 2009 cai et al 2010 jones et al 2016 dutt et al 2015 another important development is the use of δ17o and δ17o excess for paleoclimatic reconstructions and its association with relative humidity barkan and luz 2005 2007 landais et al 2008 risi et al 2010 winkler 2012 thus environmental isotopes are unique for regional studies of water resources to obtain time and space integrated characteristics generally isotope tracers are not used as independent tools but to supplement hydrometeorological geophysical and geochemical information and for a better understanding of the processes taking place in a hydrological system lambs 2000 in recent times the use of stable water isotopes has been ubiquitous in catchment hydrology that has led to major advancements in understanding the processes involved in the global hydrological cycle as well as the local hydrometeorological phenomenon gat 1996 diefendorf and patterson 2005 jonsson et al 2009 meredith et al 2009 henderson and shuman 2010 specifically isotopes can be used for tracing the source movement and pollution of ground and surface waters the distribution of δ18o and δd in modern precipitation has been documented under programmes of international atomic energy agency iaea world meteorological organisation wmo global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip global network of isotopes in rivers gnir moisture isotopes in the biosphere and atmosphere miba as well as independent programmes in several countries like national programme on isotopic fingerprinting of waters of india iwin china network of isotope in river and precipitation cnirp etc with the main focus on systematic collection of basic spatial data on the isotope content of precipitation across the globe to determine temporal and spatial variations of both environmental stable isotopes and tritium in precipitation jouzel et al 1997 rozanski et al 1993 yao et al 2013 it is well established that δ18o and δd in precipitation have a linear relationship dansgaard 1953 1954 1964 craig 1961 known as the meteoric water line which is useful in hydrometeorology indicating the source origin of the moisture craig 1961 proposed a global meteoric water line gmwl which was later modified by rozanski et al 1993 the equation δd 8 2 0 1 δ18o 11 3 0 6 for the gmwl on the basis of exhaustive isotope data collected through the iaea wmo worldwide network is given by rozanski et al 1993 the gmwl represents a global normal of numerous local meteoric water lines lmwl lmwl is controlled by the local climatic conditions and the source of the vapour mass particularly the slope of the line is influenced by the secondary evaporation the knowledge of lmwl is essential for regional or local hydrological studies δ18o and δd are well correlated with surface air temperature and precipitation amount at the precipitation site while d excess is correlated with the physical conditions humidity air temperature and sea surface temperature of the oceanic source area of precipitation merlivat and jouzel 1979 yu et al 2008 it also reveals the conditions existing during development and interaction or mixing of air masses during transportation to the precipitation site froehlich et al 2002 jouzel et al 1994 ciais et al 1995 hoffmann et al 2000 exhibits the utility of d excess for calibration of general circulation models gcm s in spite of the integrated efforts of iaea and wmo along with efforts from various countries to develop a global baseline data of isotopes in precipitation there still remains a large gap in the himalayan region the himalayan region is influenced by mid latitude western disturbance wd or westerlies as well as the indian summer monsoon ism that is sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic forcing thus the study of stable isotopes in the himalayan region is imperative for understanding the large scale atmospheric circulation and hydrological systems lyon et al 2009 sinclair and marshall 2009 dahlke and lyon 2013 though a large number of studies have been carried out on the northern slopes of the himalaya aizen et al 1996 kang et al 2002 aizen et al 2009 yu et al 2009 hren et al 2009 lyon et al 2009 yao et al 2009 liu et al 2010 yao et al 2013 yang et al 2011 wu et al 2015 he and richards 2015 only a handful of studies are available on the southern slope and that to in the lower reaches ramesh and sarin 1992 nijampurkar and rao 1992 1993 bartarya et al 1995 pande et al 2000 rai et al 2009 kumar et al 2010a b wen et al 2012 rai et al 2016 the high altitude regions above 3000m asl of the himalaya have a very sparse network of hydrometeorological stations and even fewer stations for collection of precipitation samples rain and snow for isotopic studies thus the isotopic signature of precipitation rain and snow ice proglacial streams at high altitude regions of the indian himalaya is not available furthermore the relationships of isotopic signature of precipitation with meteorological parameters is absent for correct interpretation of time series data generated from archives such as himalayan ice cores high altitude lake sediment cores tree rings etc in this paper we attempt to report the analysis of hydrometeorological data event based and monthly isotopic composition of precipitation rain and snow glacial ice and glacier melt from chorabari glacier monthly and seasonal local meteoric water lines have been developed moisture source has been identified using backward air mass trajectories and d excess an attempt to develop isotopic signature to categorize the hydrograph into its components i e rain snow glacier ice and runoff has been made the isotopic evolution of meltwater discharge in relation to depletion of snow covered area in the selected basin has also been investigated 2 study basin the present investigations were conducted over a medium sized chorabari glacier 30 46 20 58 n 79 2 59 381 e situated in the mandakini sub basin of the upper ganga basin uttarakhand india fig 1 the basin ranges between an elevation of 3800m a s l from the glacier terminus up to the glacier head at an elevation of 6420m a s l kumar et al 2016 proglacial stream emerging from chorabari glacier fig 2 e is the main source of mandakini river a tributary of alaknanda river geological survey of india gsi characterised chorabari glacier with an identification number in 5o132 02 003 according to the glacier inventory of india sangewar and shukla 2009 the glacier is compound valley type glacier oriented in a south facing direction with an accumulation area of 2 99km2 and ablation area of 3 67km2 fig 2c d the glacier length is 7 5km covering an area of 6 6km2 the discharge gauging site 3800m a s l was established 200m downstream of glacier termini kumar et al 2016 defining a catchment of 15 4km2 fig 1 3 study methods 3 1 hydrometeorological data collection and analysis meteorological variables play a dominant role in understanding the physical processes in melting of snow glacier at high altitudes therefore a permanent automatic weather station aws was installed at an elevation of 3800m a s l near the glacier termini fig 2b the aws is equipped with various sensors along with data acquisition system providing continous and reliable data sets kumar et al 2016 meteorological observations were made continuously during ablation season june to september for the years 2009 2012 using automated sensors for air temperature model hmp45c212 with accuracy of 0 1 c and data logger cr 1000 of campbell scientific while rainfall was observed using manual ordinary rain gauge org with daily data being recorded at 08 30 and 17 30h according to the procedures followed by india meteorological department imd velocity area method was employed to estimate discharge in the proglacial stream flow velocity was calculated using float method where the wooden floats are used at least three times and their mean values were used to minimize the error kumar et al 2014 mean flow velocity of the proglacial stream is calculated using a constant factor 0 85 estimated for the high altitude mountainous stream ostrem 1964 bhutiyani 2000 singh et al 2011 a manual staff gauge is used to record water levels installed neatly in a calm spot of the proglacial stream at daily scale 08 00 and 17 00h fig 2a the cross section of the proglacial stream was measured fortnightly in order to account for high fluctuations in discharge by glacier melting and rainfall during the monsoon season the stage data covers both high and low flow values and corresponding discharges were calculated which were used for stable stage discharge relationship or fitting curves for two ablation seasons 2011 2012 sefe 1996 guerrero et al 2012 li et al 2016 fig 4a b the fitting curve has an accuracy of 5 which is also estimated for other central himalayan glaciers singh et al 2006 kumar et al 2014 srivastava et al 2014a kumar et al 2016 3 2 collection of samples for isotopic analysis of precipitation rain and snow proglacial stream and glacier surface ice isotopic hydrochemical and hydroclimatic interpretations are space and time related therefore it is imperative to consider all the related aspects of water sampling procedures and governing hydroclimatic conditions in the study area sampling for isotopic studies at chorabari glacier began during the ablation season of 2011 samples from proglacial stream were collected daily at the gauging site in clean high density poly ethylene hdpe bottles 30ml pre cleaned during the years 2011 and 2012 sampling could not be continued for the year 2013 because of the catastrophic flood event in the region during 16th 17th june samples of precipitation rain and snow were collected at 08 30 and 17 30h on event basis for the year 2012 rain samples were collected from the manual rain gauge collector in high density poly ethylene hdpe bottles 8ml pre cleaned the region is inaccessible during winter period because of harsh weather conditions therefore samples of snow during the winter season could not be collected however we have collected snow samples from dokriani glacier during winters 2010 2014 at the same altitude 3800m a s l which is in close proximity to chorabari glacier hence receiving the same moisture source during the winters snow samples were collected in low density poly ethylene ldpe self sealing bags samples were kept in shade for melting and then transferred into hdpe bottles 8ml pre cleaned in order to avoid sublimation recrystallization redistribution melting and rainfall on snow which alter the isotopic composition of snow and ice the snow sampling was carried out shortly after every snowfall event few surface ice samples were also collected from different elevation zones 3900 5000m a s l of chorabari glacier along the central line fig 2f all samples were sealed with teflon tape to avoid leakage and evaporation 3 2 1 stable isotope analyses the isotopic analyses δ18o and δd were carried out by standard equilibration method in which water samples are equilibrated with co2 and h2 respectively the equilibrated co2 and h2 gases were then analyzed by delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms at wadia institute of himalayan geology dehra dun india before the stable isotope measurements δ18o and δd the reference gases co2 99 99 and h2 99 99 were calibrated against the international standards iaea gisp and vsmow respectively measured isotopic compositions are reported in terms of δ18o and δd against vsmow gonfiantini 1978 deshpande et al 2010 3 2 1 1 stable oxygen isotope δ18o measurement the δ18o measurements are expressed in per mill and given as following eq 1 1 δ 18 o 18 o 16 o s a m p l e 18 o 16 o s t a n d a r d 1 x 1000 all samples containing precipitation snow and rain ice melt and water from proglacial stream were homogenised and well shaken before analyses about 200μl of water was kept into the clean labco exetainer vial 12ml by using an adjustable pipette with disposable pipette tips screw capped vials were kept in a thermostatic sampling tray preset temperature to 32 c on gas bench peripheral head space of every vial was flushed through he co2 gas mixture he and 0 1 co2 for 12min to remove the atmospheric gases after the flushing process the samples were left for a minimum of 18h for equilibration at constant temperature of 32 c the equilibrated gas was sampled from the head space of every vial by introducing pure 99 99 helium he pressure 0 8bar with the help of automated analysis pure co2 sample gas was then introduced into thermo fisher delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer for measuring the isotope ratios 3 2 1 2 stable hydrogen isotope δd measurements the analytical procedure for measurements of δd is almost similar to the measurement of δ18o by using irms delta v plus except the equilibration method where a platinum stick is kept into the vial before flush filling the platinum acts as a catalyst reducing the time of equilibration to one hour in this procedure the mixture of he and 0 05 h2 was used for equilibration 3 2 1 3 calibration and repeatability during the course of this work irms was calibrated with primary standards of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow table 1 and greenland ice sheet precipitation gisp table 1 gisp stands for greenland ice sheet project craig 1961 also a laboratory standard milli q water was used during the analysis table 1 the primary standard vsmow 2 vienna standard mean ocean water 2 is an international standard for the measurement of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water this standard was prepared by water material at the iaea isotope hydrology laboratory in the year 2006 after replacing the exhausting vsmow standard vsmow 2 is a mixture of carefully calibrated distilled natural water samples in order to get a stable isotope composition as similar to vsmow gröning 2011 the reported value of vsmow 2 for δ18o is 0 0 02 and for δd is 0 0 3 given by iaea with standard materials the δ18o values of gisp are based on vsmow slap scale the reported value of gisp for δ18o is 24 76 0 09 and for δd is 189 5 1 2 given by iaea the reproducibility or accuracy of our measurement was smaller than 0 1 0 05 for δ18o and 1 0 6 for δd some of the samples leaked during transportation and have been omitted from the database for further detailed analysis the standard deviation sd of the instrument for analysing δ18o and δd were 0 09 1 3 for snowfall 0 06 0 8 for rainfall 0 05 0 6 for proglacial stream and 0 07 0 8 for ice respectively 3 3 estimation of snow covered area sca during the ablation season melting snowpack has significant contribution to the total stream flow in the himalayan region snowmelt is generated by means of energy exchange between atmosphere and ground affecting soil moisture soil temperature and runoff snow covered area sca can be mapped at different spatial scales throughout the year this consequently helps in monitoring the dynamic nature of the snow cover and its characteristics during melting season when it reaches the basin outlet or discharge measuring site misra et al 2015 the objective of assessment of sca in the present study is to understand its variability during summer months and to comprehend its dynamics through stable isotopes of δd and δ18o at daily time step in order to understand the general trend of snow cover depletion and inter annual variability landsat tm 5 images for the years 2009 2011 have been analysed using normalized difference snow index ndsi and band rationing methods to produce generate snow cover maps hall et al 1995 gupta et al 1982 hall and martinec 1986 salomonson and appel 2004 gupta and deshpande 2005 up to the discharge measuring site images for the year 2012 are unavailable as landsat 5 stopped working after 2011 and landsat 8 was launched in 2013 3 4 plotting of backward wind trajectories backward wind trajectories act as a valuable tool for inferring the source of moisture to a region helsen et al 2004 eames 2008 soderberg et al 2013 pérez et al 2015 the world meteorological organization wmo has designated modelling centres for generating real time seasonal forecasts based on coupled models european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf national centers for environmental prediction ncep natural environment research council nerc u k japan meteorological agency jma the meteorological data explorer metex developed at the centre for global environmental research cger includes programs for calculating air trajectory visualizing meteorological fields and tools for converting datasets from ecmwf ncep and jma the backward wind trajectories were plotted using the metex model at chorabari glacier at an elevation of 3800m a s l for a period of 5days 120h i e for 5days prior to the actual event zeng 2002 the backward wind trajectories were plotted for all the months of the year by selecting a random event for each month during the study period other similar models like hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit north atlantic marine boundary layer experiment namblex etc are being utilised by incorporating reanalysis data the detailed framework of the adopted methodology for the integrated study is given in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution and variability in hydrometeorological data integrated hydrometeorological studies over high altitude stations are almost negligible in spite of the fact that temperature is one of the most important meteorological variables required for estimation of melt rate of a glacier in the present study the mean minimum and maximum temperatures for the ablation period june september during the years 2011 2012 were recorded as 6 2 c and 12 2 c respectively fig 5 a b the ablation period of 2012 recorded the highest maximum 16 3 c and minimum 9 8 c temperatures in general temperature increases from june to august and starts decreasing in september the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures during the months of june september were 12 1 13 2 12 2 and 11 9 c and 5 5 7 2 7 4 and 4 7 c respectively fig 5c the observed maximum air temperature has less variability during the ablation season in comparison to minimum air temperature caused by the variability in seasonal snowfall and existing microclimatic conditions within the basin kumar et al 2016 the seasonal june september mean temperature for the study years 2011 2012 was 8 6 c the mean air temperature during june september was 8 2 9 7 9 4 and 7 4 c respectively the mean monthly maximum temperature was highest during july followed by august whereas mean monthly minimum temperature was observed to be higher in august followed by july the same trend was observed for mean temperature the study area has very high relative humidity with a mean seasonal june september relative humidity of 81 during the years 2011 2012 the mean monthly relative humidity during the months of june september was 69 93 94 and 93 respectively fig 5d the total seasonal june september rainfall was observed to be 1348 0 and 1115 2mm during the years 2011 and 2012 respectively during the months june september mean monthly total rainfall was 88 4 334 8 509 0 and 182 9mm respectively fig 4f while the daily observed rainfall is given in fig 4 e the valley experienced maximum amount of rainfall in august followed by july while june and september received less rainfall fig 5e melt runoff generated from chorabari glacier is derived mainly from melting of snow and ice and rainfall since total volume of rainfall is less in the study region in comparison to the total volume of discharge therefore most of the discharge is generated from the melting of snow and ice hydrological data for the years 2011 and 2012 was evaluated and detailed analysis of its distribution and variability has been carried out for the ablation period the distribution of daily discharge shows increasing trend from june reaching its highest value in august and then starts reducing fig 4c the mean monthly discharge observed during study period 2011 2012 for the months of june september was 3 3 6 1 7 4 and 3 5m3 s respectively the mean seasonal discharge for the years 2011 2012 is 5 1m3 s the monthly and annual distribution of discharge is shown in fig 4 d further box whisker plots were developed to understand the distribution and variability in the hydrometeorological data fig 5a f the observed air temperature and relative humidity have maximum variability in the months of june and october whereas rainfall and discharge are most variable during the month of august followed by july and september 4 2 characterization distribution and variability in isotopic composition of precipitation the isotopic signatures of rainfall at chorabari glacier during the ablation season 2012 varied between 3 to 22 2 to 157 and 2 to 29 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively small amounts of rain along with wet snow take place during the months of may and june which have enriched values the mean monthly isotopic values for may june are 5 52 32 97 and 11 19 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively the mean δ18o δd and d excess values of rain over the ablation season were 13 01 88 33 and 18 32 respectively the mean monthly isotopic values of rain during july october for δ18o δd and d excess are given in table 2 a the isotopic composition δ18o δd and d excess of rain water indicates a gradual depletion as the ablation season progresses and then enrichment at the end of the ablation season the daily variations in δ18o δd and d excess in precipitation at chorabari glacier are shown in fig 6 a c the δ18o and δd values clearly indicate the response to the onset beginning of july and withdrawal end of september of monsoon from the region i e the source of moisture during summer premonsoon may june monsoon july august september and postmonsoon october november are different the precipitation during the premonsoon and postmonsoon is from westerlies or evaporation from local water bodies like lakes dam reservoirs evapotranspiration and sublimation while during july september the source of highly depleted values is the ism representing hot and humid source conditions the bulk precipitation in the region occurs during the ism the depletion of δ18o and δd in rainfall during july august and september is because of the amount effect of isotopes in precipitation fig 6d incessant increase in d excess indicates that the process of moisture recycling i e evaporation from lakes and reservoirs evapotranspiration sublimation sub cloud evaporation etc is continuous within the region krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 kumar et al 2010a b the maximum d excess during the month of september october is an indication of change in moisture source or recycling of moisture because of precipitation that occurs in small amount becomes more depleted partial evaporation of rain drops while passing through unsaturated atmosphere below the cloud base also influence the isotopic composition of rain especially in semi arid climates wu et al 2015 another important factor to be considered is the influence of westerlies during the retreating or end of the ism september end and october the statistical variations monthly and seasonal of isotopic composition of rainfall have been depicted using box and whiskers fig 6e g data show symmetry about the median except for the months of august and september which are slightly skewed towards the more positive values d excess is a function δ18o and δd which explains the large variations in upper and lower limits in order to understand the role of microclimatic conditions on isotopic composition of rainfall correlation analysis among meteorological records was carried out table 3 a the results show a very high negative correlation between the isotopic signatures δ18o and δd of rainfall and the amount of rainfall r2 0 74 0 76 further substantiating role of the amount effect i e increase in amount of rainfall will lead to more depleted isotopic signatures air temperature and relative humidity have a negative correlation with the isotopic composition of rainfall it is observed that the maximum amount of rainfall occurs during the nighttime in the region srivastava et al 2014b singh et al 2007 therefore leading to moderate correlations between minimum air temperature and isotopic signatures of rainfall r2 0 45 0 48 assessment of the present day δ18o δd and d excess composition and their climatic significance interpretation in the study region is indispensable before attempting any interpretation of palaeoclimatic records sinclair and marshall 2009 rohrmann et al 2014 samples of snowfall were collected at dokriani glacier during the winters november april which have a different source in comparison to the rainfall during the ism the mean isotopic composition of 45 snow samples was 7 40 35 89 and 23 30 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively table 2a these samples are isotopically highly enriched in comparison to rainfall samples during the months of july september but close to the ones from june that could be caused by similar source of origin however d excess values of snowfall are much higher than that of rainfall for all the months the high values of d excess indicate to the fact that winter precipitation in the region is from westerlies snow and glacier meltwater are primary sources and vital to the streamflow and should be significantly addressed in water resource management and prediction for central himalayan region melt runoff is much greater than precipitation and controlled by the amount of winter snowfall and resulting meltwater during summer most of the winter precipitation contributed significantly to the runoff during summer season 4 3 characterization distribution and variability in isotopic composition of proglacial stream and glacier surface ice the spatial and temporal variations in the isotopic composition of river waters mainly depend upon the number and type of its sources and on the evaporation from river surface which is assumed to be negligible the variations in the daily observed values reflect the variable contributions from different sources which can be evaluated if isotopic signatures of the sources are known the isotopic signatures of proglacial stream from chorabari glacier varied from 17 to 7 113 to 52 and 2 8 to 35 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively during the ablation seasons 2011 2012 the mean δ18o δd and d excess values of proglacial stream over the ablation seasons 2011 2012 were 12 9 84 3 and 20 3 respectively the mean monthly characteristics of isotopic signatures of the proglacial stream during may to october for δ18o δd and d excess are depicted in table 2 b the isotopic composition of proglacial stream shows a trend similar to that of rainfall i e depletion as the ablation season progresses and then enrichment towards the end of the ablation season this systematic variation in δ18o and δd values with time corroborates well with the meltwater discharge from chorabari glacier which starts increasing in the month of june reaches maximum in july august depending upon the variation in air temperature and rainfall then reduces in september october the daily variations in δd δ18o and d excess of proglacial stream and the effect of heavy rainfall on the hydrograph are shown in fig 7 a d the corresponding isotopic values of proglacial stream are highly variable during the monsoon season but the extent of variability is less than that of the isotopic composition of precipitation the data are more or less symmetrically distributed about its median fig 7e g the enriched isotopic values of meltwater in may june and depleted during july october reflects the fact that snowmelt is the major contributor to the proglacial stream during may and june snow melts rapidly because of rise in temperature and small amounts of rain takes place which have enriched values in comparison to ice melt while during july september ism rain becomes more depleted because of the amount effect during october major contribution to the discharge is from subglacial melt as very small quantities of precipitation rainfall and snowfall occur the correlations between isotopic composition of proglacial stream and meteorological parameters are similar to that of rainfall but with lower values of r2 in comparison which substantiate the contribution to proglacial stream from different sources viz rainfall snowmelt and glacier melt table 3b there is a significant relationship between the isotopic signatures of proglacial stream and rainfall amount r relative humidity rh mean discharge q while there is no significant relationship with air temperature the isotopic signatures of surface ice from chorabari glacier varied from 19 to 12 120 to 71 and 21 to 30 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively along the central line of the glacier during the ablation season 2012 the mean δ18o δd and d excess values of glacier surface ice were 14 9 93 6 and 25 5 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively 4 4 development of local meteoric water line lmwl for precipitation meltwater and glacier surface ice the relationship between δ18o and δd is well established world over recently it has been shown that significant depletion in isotopic composition is also related to large scale convection lekshmy et al 2014 and the atmospheric residence time of moisture or moisture residence time rt i e ratio of perceptible water q to precipitation rate p and is intrinsically dependent on temperature moisture source and the strength of the hydrological cycle convection aggarwal et al 2012 another important factor controlling the lmwl is secondary evaporation liu et al 2010 pang et al 2011 the seasonal local meteoric water line lmwl using daily and mean monthly values for rainfall events observed at chorabari glacier are represented in fig 8 a b while the corresponding equations including monthly lmwl s are given in table 4 a the large variation in the slope and intercept for each month indicates the complexity of the ism thus the relationship between δ18o and δd is more intricate and points towards the fact that the study region is influenced by both the eastern bay of bengal and western arabian sea limbs of the ism sengupta and sarkar 2006 the d excess values of precipitation are considered to be influenced by the meteorological conditions at the source of the moisture such as relative humidity wind speed and surface temperature over the evaporative surface wu et al 2012 the seasonal lmwl has a slope close to the one of the gmwl but a very high intercept comparisons of the slope and intercept of lmwl with previous studies could be useful for inferring climatic information peng et al 2004 the small amounts of rainfall are often subject to sub cloud secondary effects or secondary evaporation accompanied with fractionation equilibrium and kinetic this leads to substantial lowering of the slope of lmwl peng et al 2007 similarly large precipitation events tend to lower the d excess values significantly the winter precipitation or snowfall events in the study region have a lmwl with a slope 8 13 close to gmwl and an intercept of 24 13 which is shown in fig 9 a and its corresponding equation is in table 4 b the high intercept and d excess values for snowfall signify that these events are from westerlies while the slope and intercept for lmwl of surface ice samples are lower than that of snowfall fig 9a table 4c the intercept is still higher than that of rainfall fig 9b this could be caused by the process of sublimation or diffusion during the transformation of snow to firn and subsequently ice zhou et al 2014 the seasonal lmwl s of proglacial stream have very low slope and highly negative intercept in comparison to lmwl s for rainfall fig 8c d while the monthly and seasonal equations of lmwl s are given in table 4d this further substantiates the complexity in the hydrological system the extremely low value of slope for the monthly equations can be explained on the basis of secondary evaporation sublimation melt refreeze processes etc from the surface of the glacier and snowpack the seasonal lmwl daily and monthly significantly vary from each other zhang et al 2001 which is an indication that composite monthly sampling for isotopic studies are not sufficient and there is a need to shift to daily or event based sampling especially during the ism to better understand the natural processes of the hydrological cycle and extreme events in the himalaya however the sampling protocols may differ from region to region and based on the specific objectives of the research problem further in order to understand the significance of isotopic signatures the different components of streamflow meltwater precipitation glacier ice melt have been plotted against the global meteoric water line gmwl at daily scale most of the data is plotted above the gmwl signifying that the study area lies in a warm temperate region fig 9a b similar studies in the himalayan region have been carried out by various workers dalai et al 2002 kumar et al 2010a b jeelani et al 2013 khan et al 2016 rai et al 2016 whose lmwl are represented in table 5 most of these studies collected either composite monthly samples or discontinuous random sampling both of which are unable to decipher processes taking place on daily scale peng et al 2004 concluded that temperature effects and secondary evaporation effects can be deliberated only by using short term event based samples rather than composite monthly amount weighted samples under the aegis of iaea and global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip a network of rain gauges was established in the bhagirathi basin during the years 2004 2006 by national institute of hydrology nih roorkee kumar et al 2010a b the iaea gnip isotopic data δ18o and δd has been used to compare the isotopic signatures at chorabari glacier along with winter precipitation at dokriani glacier and developed a regional meteoric water line for the garhwal himalaya table 5 further the lmwl for chorabari and dokriani glaciers during the ablation and accumulation seasons respectively have been compared with the gmwl and meteoric water lines of gangotri and gaumukh stations fig 9c 4 5 development and significance of snow and isotopic depletion curves sdc and idc snowmelt begins by the end of april and the snowline ascends up to 5200m a s l by the end of the ablation season i e in the beginning of october the sca for the years 2009 2011 indicates that 97 of the catchment area is covered with snow during winters and reduces to 52 by the end of summers fig 10 subsequently the sca is plotted against the elapsed time and the depletion of sca is mathematically represented by a 2nd degree polynomial equation known as the snow depletion curve sdc with r2 values ranging from 0 8 to 0 9 for the years 2009 2011 fig 11 a c daily sca can be derived by interpolation from sdc indicating rapid depletion of sca during summer months may september which is the general trend as seen in the sdc s the sdc s indicate that the lowest limit of sca during the ablation season june september for the years 2009 2011 was 59 71 and 52 respectively also the sdc indicates that the depletion pattern of the sca is similar for all the years but there is no ground based data to quantify interannual variability further elevation wise distribution and variability in sca is low at high elevation zones 5000m a s l in comparison to lower elevation zones 5000m a s l which is reflected by the coefficient of variation in the study area misra et al 2015 similar trends can be observed in the mean monthly isotopic composition of proglacial meltwater stream which are represented by isotopic depletion curves idc fig 11d the close relationship between sdc and idc indicates that melting of the snow accumulated during the preceding winter is an important component in determining the contribution and quantifying the amount of discharge during the ablation period the isotopic signatures of the proglacial stream emerging from a glacierized catchment responds directly to the melting trend of the snowpack sdc in the catchment the snow starts melting in the beginning of may which leads to an increase in discharge the receding snow line mobilises loose soil and sediments below it which are transported to the proglacial stream subsequently inducing highly enriched isotopic values as the ablation season progresses the sca reduces and the contribution of ism increases while at the end of the ablation season sca is constant and rainfall is low leading to falling limb of the hydrograph and major contribution from glacial melt therefore snow cover protects the glacier from rapid melting and the year with high winter precipitation should delay the glacier melting less negative mass balance further high d excess values 20 are reported for ganga river during the peak monsoon august pointing towards a source of high d excess which may be derived from westerlies implying that the himalayan glaciers receive high contribution of snow from westerlies and is better preserved than that received during the ism maurya et al 2011 also the sdc s and idc s depicts that the glaciers in the garhwal himalaya have significant contribution from winter accumulation to the proglacial stream near the snout during the ablation season as compared to summer accumulation while in reference to glacier mass balance studies most of the glaciers in eastern and central himalaya have been classified as summer accumulation type ageta and higuchi 1984 ageta and fujita 1996 implying that accumulation and ablation maxima occur almost simultaneously during the summer the idc follows the same pattern and such relationships could be a useful tool for understanding the processes governing the hydrological regime of a glacierized catchment which is very significant for long term estimation of meltwater contribution on daily basis it is pertinent to note that there is high interannual and seasonal variability in sca fig 11a c precipitation distribution as well as in the isotopic signatures precipitation meltwater and glacial ice which are concurrent to space and time also from the previous sections it is clear that the isotopic composition of each component snowmelt glacier ice melt rainfall have overlapping ranges which makes it very complicated to separate these components from a hydrograph therefore stable isotope signatures of each component itself are not sufficient to separate the hydrograph appropriately using two or three component mixing models and multiple proxies like physical properties ph conductivity etc or chemical parameters major ions trace elements etc are required in conjunction to accurately separate the hydrograph using end member mixing model 4 6 identification of moisture sources using deuterium excess d excess and backward wind trajectories deuterium excess has values close to 10 for precipitation in temperate climate the deuterium excess depends on relative humidity of air masses at its source of origin oceanic origin ocean surface temperature and kinetic fractionation effects during evaporation the deuterium excess was established by dansgaard 1964 and is defined as eq 2 2 d δd 8 δ18o vsmow summer precipitation in the higher himalayan ranges mainly occurs by the ism which develops in response to the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz that separates wind circulation of both hemispheres in the himalayan glaciers there are mainly two periods of precipitation one period is from june to september when moisture source is from ism and other is from october to april when moisture comes from the westerlies the deuterium excess is governed by many environmental factors in the water vapour source area like relative humidity temperature and wind speed and degree of water vapour recycling that takes place along the transport path of air masses in order to further understand the processes of moisture recycling in the system the relation of δ18o and d excess with prevailing atmospheric temperature was explored and we get a linear relationship for the events in the early ablation season may june and late ablation season or early winter october with an r2 of 0 58 low temperature and relative humidity indicating the role of adiabatic cooling of the moisture laden air parcels in mountainous regions clark and fritz 1997 gat et al 2001 though adiabatic cooling is suggested to occur at temperatures below 0 c pang et al 2011 our data suggests that adiabatic cooling is caused owing to the orographic uplift of the air parcel in the valley at temperatures up to 6 c the isotopic composition of precipitation during the monsoon season july september did not show any significant relationship with mean temperature fig 11e high temperature and relative humidity negate the enrichment caused by temperature effect by moisture recycling within the valley froehlich et al 2008 therefore daily temperature plays an important role in affecting isotopic composition of rainfall during the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons while during the monsoon season the isotopic composition is influenced by the amount effect the isotopic composition of precipitation δ2h δ18o and d excess surface ice and proglacial stream are important parameters for hydrograph separation in runoff generated from glaciers in the himalaya the overall continental and global patterns in precipitation isotopic composition are fairly well described by condensation temperature and rayleigh fractionation during rainout however in order to understand these processes in a small glacierized basin where dynamics of moisture source varies during different seasons it is important to supplement it with other proxies like ph ec physiochemical properties or major ion chemistry or use of modern techniques like modelling here we explore the use of atmospheric back trajectory modelling and associated meteorological variables to explain the large variability observed in the isotopic composition of individual precipitation events at the study site fig 12 the 5 day backward wind trajectory plots for each month illustrate the source of the air parcels causing precipitation at the study site the most intriguing aspects of the plots are that during pre monsoon or early ablation period may june the moisture available for precipitation is regional or local further substantiating the inference that precipitation during early ablation period is governed by local sources and secondary evaporation processes while strong influence of the eastern limb of the ism is observed during september though the winter months get most of the precipitation from westerlies it is viewed that there is a north south shifting in the trajectory source without any distinct monthly pattern we also observe that some of the air parcels have a northward extent up to the arctic circle especially in the month of april 5 conclusions the paper contributes to the hydrology of the indian himalayan region ihr especially in understanding the hydrological cycle and the importance of high resolution observational data in the region the temporal and spatial patterns of δ18o δd and d excess in the central himalayan region are indicative of governing hydrological processes integrated with prevailing weather conditions the precipitation occurring at chorabari glacier during premonsoon may june and postmonsoon september end october or retreating monsoon seasons is mainly caused by mixing of moisture from different sources like local moisture recycling evapotranspiration evaporation from lakes sublimation secondary or sub cloud evaporation etc indian summer monsoon and westerlies as indicated by the variations in d excess while the moisture source for winter precipitation contributing to the accumulation of snow subsequently converting into firn ice is westerlies and the major source of rainfall during the ablation season is from the ism the backward wind trajectories plotted for the precipitation events at chorabari glacier indicate trends similar to that of stable isotopes and corroborate that the major source of solid precipitation is from westerlies during winters while the ism contributes to rainfall events even at an elevation of 4800m a s l snowmelt is the major source of meltwater during the early ablation season and the contribution glacier melt and rainfall increases as the ablation season progresses and base flow or sub glacial melting contributes mainly towards the end of the ablation season the sdc and idc show a progressive depletion over the ablation season and enrichment towards the end which follows a 2nd degree polynomial equation substantiating that snowmelt is an important component of the hydrograph most of the points of the local meteoric water line for precipitation rainfall and snowfall meltwater and glacier surface ice lie above the global meteoric water line indicating warm conditions in the study region the isotopic composition of rain is well correlated with rainfall amount minimum and mean temperature and relative humidity while the isotopic composition of meltwater has good correlations with rainfall amount relative humidity and discharge but no significant relationship with temperature the daily temperature plays an important role in affecting isotopic composition of rainfall during the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons while during the monsoon season the isotopic composition is influenced by the amount effect similar results have been reported by he and richards 2016 for the tibetan region composite monthly sampling for isotopic studies are insufficient to trace detailed hydrological processes extreme events and also for explicit understading of various other processes e g sublimation melting and re freezing in the glacierized basins of the himalaya further the authors suggest that observations and sampling of precipitation for isotopic studies and hydrometeorology during winters should be carried out on various

8525,study region chorabari glacier in upper ganga basin garhwal himalaya study focus authors attempt to characterize the isotopic signatures in different components of the hydrological cycle and decipher the role of summer and winter precipitation on glacier melt using stable isotopes δd δ18o coupled with existing hydrometeorological observations during the glacier ablation season june september for the years 2011 2012 new hydrological insights the isotopic composition of various components of hydrological cycle i e precipitation rainfall and snowfall glacier surface ice and glacier melt have partly overlapping isotopic ranges δ18o δd and d excess compositon indicates that precipitation during pre monsoon may june and post monsoon september october season have mixing of local moisture with that from westerlies while during monsoon june september rainfall runoff contributes to the streamflow with snow and glacier melt the depletion pattern of snow covered area sca reflected by snow depletion curves sdc imply that most of the solid precipitation in the region results from westerlies while during summers the precipitation from the indian summer monsoon ism is in the form of rainfall over higher altitudes the isotopic depletion curve idc of meltwater follows the trend of sdc s the backward wind trajectories for the precipitation events also indicate that the source of winter precipitation is from westerlies while summer precipitation is from ism present day δ18o δd and d excess composition and their climatic interpretation are site and time specific keywords stable isotopes indian summer monsoon westerlies snow depletion curve isotopic depletion curve 1 introduction the application of isotopes in hydrology and climate sciences is based on the general concept of tracing in which either artificially introduced isotopes or naturally occurring environmental isotopes are employed which can be used for a wide range of applications owing to their abundances and natural fractionation phase change in nature these isotopes have been applied to understand the hydrological cycle behrens et al 1975 ramesh and sarin 1992 ladouche et al 2001 burns 2002 carey and quinton 2005 rai et al 2016 cable et al 2011 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 dahlke et al 2014 wang et al 2015 atmospheric processes schmidt et al 2005 tian et al 2007 risi et al 2008 vimeux et al 2011 gao et al 2011 and paleoclimate reconstruction based on proxy archives of ice cores tree rings lake sediments ocean cores speleotherms etc thompson 2000 kang et al 2002 gupta et al 2003 ramirez et al 2003 yao et al 2008 liang and eckstein 2009 cai et al 2010 jones et al 2016 dutt et al 2015 another important development is the use of δ17o and δ17o excess for paleoclimatic reconstructions and its association with relative humidity barkan and luz 2005 2007 landais et al 2008 risi et al 2010 winkler 2012 thus environmental isotopes are unique for regional studies of water resources to obtain time and space integrated characteristics generally isotope tracers are not used as independent tools but to supplement hydrometeorological geophysical and geochemical information and for a better understanding of the processes taking place in a hydrological system lambs 2000 in recent times the use of stable water isotopes has been ubiquitous in catchment hydrology that has led to major advancements in understanding the processes involved in the global hydrological cycle as well as the local hydrometeorological phenomenon gat 1996 diefendorf and patterson 2005 jonsson et al 2009 meredith et al 2009 henderson and shuman 2010 specifically isotopes can be used for tracing the source movement and pollution of ground and surface waters the distribution of δ18o and δd in modern precipitation has been documented under programmes of international atomic energy agency iaea world meteorological organisation wmo global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip global network of isotopes in rivers gnir moisture isotopes in the biosphere and atmosphere miba as well as independent programmes in several countries like national programme on isotopic fingerprinting of waters of india iwin china network of isotope in river and precipitation cnirp etc with the main focus on systematic collection of basic spatial data on the isotope content of precipitation across the globe to determine temporal and spatial variations of both environmental stable isotopes and tritium in precipitation jouzel et al 1997 rozanski et al 1993 yao et al 2013 it is well established that δ18o and δd in precipitation have a linear relationship dansgaard 1953 1954 1964 craig 1961 known as the meteoric water line which is useful in hydrometeorology indicating the source origin of the moisture craig 1961 proposed a global meteoric water line gmwl which was later modified by rozanski et al 1993 the equation δd 8 2 0 1 δ18o 11 3 0 6 for the gmwl on the basis of exhaustive isotope data collected through the iaea wmo worldwide network is given by rozanski et al 1993 the gmwl represents a global normal of numerous local meteoric water lines lmwl lmwl is controlled by the local climatic conditions and the source of the vapour mass particularly the slope of the line is influenced by the secondary evaporation the knowledge of lmwl is essential for regional or local hydrological studies δ18o and δd are well correlated with surface air temperature and precipitation amount at the precipitation site while d excess is correlated with the physical conditions humidity air temperature and sea surface temperature of the oceanic source area of precipitation merlivat and jouzel 1979 yu et al 2008 it also reveals the conditions existing during development and interaction or mixing of air masses during transportation to the precipitation site froehlich et al 2002 jouzel et al 1994 ciais et al 1995 hoffmann et al 2000 exhibits the utility of d excess for calibration of general circulation models gcm s in spite of the integrated efforts of iaea and wmo along with efforts from various countries to develop a global baseline data of isotopes in precipitation there still remains a large gap in the himalayan region the himalayan region is influenced by mid latitude western disturbance wd or westerlies as well as the indian summer monsoon ism that is sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic forcing thus the study of stable isotopes in the himalayan region is imperative for understanding the large scale atmospheric circulation and hydrological systems lyon et al 2009 sinclair and marshall 2009 dahlke and lyon 2013 though a large number of studies have been carried out on the northern slopes of the himalaya aizen et al 1996 kang et al 2002 aizen et al 2009 yu et al 2009 hren et al 2009 lyon et al 2009 yao et al 2009 liu et al 2010 yao et al 2013 yang et al 2011 wu et al 2015 he and richards 2015 only a handful of studies are available on the southern slope and that to in the lower reaches ramesh and sarin 1992 nijampurkar and rao 1992 1993 bartarya et al 1995 pande et al 2000 rai et al 2009 kumar et al 2010a b wen et al 2012 rai et al 2016 the high altitude regions above 3000m asl of the himalaya have a very sparse network of hydrometeorological stations and even fewer stations for collection of precipitation samples rain and snow for isotopic studies thus the isotopic signature of precipitation rain and snow ice proglacial streams at high altitude regions of the indian himalaya is not available furthermore the relationships of isotopic signature of precipitation with meteorological parameters is absent for correct interpretation of time series data generated from archives such as himalayan ice cores high altitude lake sediment cores tree rings etc in this paper we attempt to report the analysis of hydrometeorological data event based and monthly isotopic composition of precipitation rain and snow glacial ice and glacier melt from chorabari glacier monthly and seasonal local meteoric water lines have been developed moisture source has been identified using backward air mass trajectories and d excess an attempt to develop isotopic signature to categorize the hydrograph into its components i e rain snow glacier ice and runoff has been made the isotopic evolution of meltwater discharge in relation to depletion of snow covered area in the selected basin has also been investigated 2 study basin the present investigations were conducted over a medium sized chorabari glacier 30 46 20 58 n 79 2 59 381 e situated in the mandakini sub basin of the upper ganga basin uttarakhand india fig 1 the basin ranges between an elevation of 3800m a s l from the glacier terminus up to the glacier head at an elevation of 6420m a s l kumar et al 2016 proglacial stream emerging from chorabari glacier fig 2 e is the main source of mandakini river a tributary of alaknanda river geological survey of india gsi characterised chorabari glacier with an identification number in 5o132 02 003 according to the glacier inventory of india sangewar and shukla 2009 the glacier is compound valley type glacier oriented in a south facing direction with an accumulation area of 2 99km2 and ablation area of 3 67km2 fig 2c d the glacier length is 7 5km covering an area of 6 6km2 the discharge gauging site 3800m a s l was established 200m downstream of glacier termini kumar et al 2016 defining a catchment of 15 4km2 fig 1 3 study methods 3 1 hydrometeorological data collection and analysis meteorological variables play a dominant role in understanding the physical processes in melting of snow glacier at high altitudes therefore a permanent automatic weather station aws was installed at an elevation of 3800m a s l near the glacier termini fig 2b the aws is equipped with various sensors along with data acquisition system providing continous and reliable data sets kumar et al 2016 meteorological observations were made continuously during ablation season june to september for the years 2009 2012 using automated sensors for air temperature model hmp45c212 with accuracy of 0 1 c and data logger cr 1000 of campbell scientific while rainfall was observed using manual ordinary rain gauge org with daily data being recorded at 08 30 and 17 30h according to the procedures followed by india meteorological department imd velocity area method was employed to estimate discharge in the proglacial stream flow velocity was calculated using float method where the wooden floats are used at least three times and their mean values were used to minimize the error kumar et al 2014 mean flow velocity of the proglacial stream is calculated using a constant factor 0 85 estimated for the high altitude mountainous stream ostrem 1964 bhutiyani 2000 singh et al 2011 a manual staff gauge is used to record water levels installed neatly in a calm spot of the proglacial stream at daily scale 08 00 and 17 00h fig 2a the cross section of the proglacial stream was measured fortnightly in order to account for high fluctuations in discharge by glacier melting and rainfall during the monsoon season the stage data covers both high and low flow values and corresponding discharges were calculated which were used for stable stage discharge relationship or fitting curves for two ablation seasons 2011 2012 sefe 1996 guerrero et al 2012 li et al 2016 fig 4a b the fitting curve has an accuracy of 5 which is also estimated for other central himalayan glaciers singh et al 2006 kumar et al 2014 srivastava et al 2014a kumar et al 2016 3 2 collection of samples for isotopic analysis of precipitation rain and snow proglacial stream and glacier surface ice isotopic hydrochemical and hydroclimatic interpretations are space and time related therefore it is imperative to consider all the related aspects of water sampling procedures and governing hydroclimatic conditions in the study area sampling for isotopic studies at chorabari glacier began during the ablation season of 2011 samples from proglacial stream were collected daily at the gauging site in clean high density poly ethylene hdpe bottles 30ml pre cleaned during the years 2011 and 2012 sampling could not be continued for the year 2013 because of the catastrophic flood event in the region during 16th 17th june samples of precipitation rain and snow were collected at 08 30 and 17 30h on event basis for the year 2012 rain samples were collected from the manual rain gauge collector in high density poly ethylene hdpe bottles 8ml pre cleaned the region is inaccessible during winter period because of harsh weather conditions therefore samples of snow during the winter season could not be collected however we have collected snow samples from dokriani glacier during winters 2010 2014 at the same altitude 3800m a s l which is in close proximity to chorabari glacier hence receiving the same moisture source during the winters snow samples were collected in low density poly ethylene ldpe self sealing bags samples were kept in shade for melting and then transferred into hdpe bottles 8ml pre cleaned in order to avoid sublimation recrystallization redistribution melting and rainfall on snow which alter the isotopic composition of snow and ice the snow sampling was carried out shortly after every snowfall event few surface ice samples were also collected from different elevation zones 3900 5000m a s l of chorabari glacier along the central line fig 2f all samples were sealed with teflon tape to avoid leakage and evaporation 3 2 1 stable isotope analyses the isotopic analyses δ18o and δd were carried out by standard equilibration method in which water samples are equilibrated with co2 and h2 respectively the equilibrated co2 and h2 gases were then analyzed by delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms at wadia institute of himalayan geology dehra dun india before the stable isotope measurements δ18o and δd the reference gases co2 99 99 and h2 99 99 were calibrated against the international standards iaea gisp and vsmow respectively measured isotopic compositions are reported in terms of δ18o and δd against vsmow gonfiantini 1978 deshpande et al 2010 3 2 1 1 stable oxygen isotope δ18o measurement the δ18o measurements are expressed in per mill and given as following eq 1 1 δ 18 o 18 o 16 o s a m p l e 18 o 16 o s t a n d a r d 1 x 1000 all samples containing precipitation snow and rain ice melt and water from proglacial stream were homogenised and well shaken before analyses about 200μl of water was kept into the clean labco exetainer vial 12ml by using an adjustable pipette with disposable pipette tips screw capped vials were kept in a thermostatic sampling tray preset temperature to 32 c on gas bench peripheral head space of every vial was flushed through he co2 gas mixture he and 0 1 co2 for 12min to remove the atmospheric gases after the flushing process the samples were left for a minimum of 18h for equilibration at constant temperature of 32 c the equilibrated gas was sampled from the head space of every vial by introducing pure 99 99 helium he pressure 0 8bar with the help of automated analysis pure co2 sample gas was then introduced into thermo fisher delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer for measuring the isotope ratios 3 2 1 2 stable hydrogen isotope δd measurements the analytical procedure for measurements of δd is almost similar to the measurement of δ18o by using irms delta v plus except the equilibration method where a platinum stick is kept into the vial before flush filling the platinum acts as a catalyst reducing the time of equilibration to one hour in this procedure the mixture of he and 0 05 h2 was used for equilibration 3 2 1 3 calibration and repeatability during the course of this work irms was calibrated with primary standards of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow table 1 and greenland ice sheet precipitation gisp table 1 gisp stands for greenland ice sheet project craig 1961 also a laboratory standard milli q water was used during the analysis table 1 the primary standard vsmow 2 vienna standard mean ocean water 2 is an international standard for the measurement of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water this standard was prepared by water material at the iaea isotope hydrology laboratory in the year 2006 after replacing the exhausting vsmow standard vsmow 2 is a mixture of carefully calibrated distilled natural water samples in order to get a stable isotope composition as similar to vsmow gröning 2011 the reported value of vsmow 2 for δ18o is 0 0 02 and for δd is 0 0 3 given by iaea with standard materials the δ18o values of gisp are based on vsmow slap scale the reported value of gisp for δ18o is 24 76 0 09 and for δd is 189 5 1 2 given by iaea the reproducibility or accuracy of our measurement was smaller than 0 1 0 05 for δ18o and 1 0 6 for δd some of the samples leaked during transportation and have been omitted from the database for further detailed analysis the standard deviation sd of the instrument for analysing δ18o and δd were 0 09 1 3 for snowfall 0 06 0 8 for rainfall 0 05 0 6 for proglacial stream and 0 07 0 8 for ice respectively 3 3 estimation of snow covered area sca during the ablation season melting snowpack has significant contribution to the total stream flow in the himalayan region snowmelt is generated by means of energy exchange between atmosphere and ground affecting soil moisture soil temperature and runoff snow covered area sca can be mapped at different spatial scales throughout the year this consequently helps in monitoring the dynamic nature of the snow cover and its characteristics during melting season when it reaches the basin outlet or discharge measuring site misra et al 2015 the objective of assessment of sca in the present study is to understand its variability during summer months and to comprehend its dynamics through stable isotopes of δd and δ18o at daily time step in order to understand the general trend of snow cover depletion and inter annual variability landsat tm 5 images for the years 2009 2011 have been analysed using normalized difference snow index ndsi and band rationing methods to produce generate snow cover maps hall et al 1995 gupta et al 1982 hall and martinec 1986 salomonson and appel 2004 gupta and deshpande 2005 up to the discharge measuring site images for the year 2012 are unavailable as landsat 5 stopped working after 2011 and landsat 8 was launched in 2013 3 4 plotting of backward wind trajectories backward wind trajectories act as a valuable tool for inferring the source of moisture to a region helsen et al 2004 eames 2008 soderberg et

at the centre for global environmental research cger includes programs for calculating air trajectory visualizing meteorological fields and tools for converting datasets from ecmwf ncep and jma the backward wind trajectories were plotted using the metex model at chorabari glacier at an elevation of 3800m a s l for a period of 5days 120h i e for 5days prior to the actual event zeng 2002 the backward wind trajectories were plotted for all the months of the year by selecting a random event for each month during the study period other similar models like hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit north atlantic marine boundary layer experiment namblex etc are being utilised by incorporating reanalysis data the detailed framework of the adopted methodology for the integrated study is given in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution and variability in hydrometeorological data integrated hydrometeorological studies over high altitude stations are almost negligible in spite of the fact that temperature is one of the most important meteorological variables required for estimation of melt rate of a glacier in the present study the mean minimum and maximum temperatures for the ablation period june september during the years 2011 2012 were recorded as 6 2 c and 12 2 c respectively fig 5 a b the ablation period of 2012 recorded the highest maximum 16 3 c and minimum 9 8 c temperatures in general temperature increases from june to august and starts decreasing in september the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures during the months of june september were 12 1 13 2 12 2 and 11 9 c and 5 5 7 2 7 4 and 4 7 c respectively fig 5c the observed maximum air temperature has less variability during the ablation season in comparison to minimum air temperature caused by the variability in seasonal snowfall and existing microclimatic conditions within the basin kumar et al 2016 the seasonal june september mean temperature for the study years 2011 2012 was 8 6 c the mean air temperature during june september was 8 2 9 7 9 4 and 7 4 c respectively the mean monthly maximum temperature was highest during july followed by august whereas mean monthly minimum temperature was observed to be higher in august followed by july the same trend was observed for mean temperature the study area has very high relative humidity with a mean seasonal june september relative humidity of 81 during the years 2011 2012 the mean monthly relative humidity during the months of june september was 69 93 94 and 93 respectively fig 5d the total seasonal june september rainfall was observed to be 1348 0 and 1115 2mm during the years 2011 and 2012 respectively during the months june september mean monthly total rainfall was 88 4 334 8 509 0 and 182 9mm respectively fig 4f while the daily observed rainfall is given in fig 4 e the valley experienced maximum amount of rainfall in august followed by july while june and september received less rainfall fig 5e melt runoff generated from chorabari glacier is derived mainly from melting of snow and ice and rainfall since total volume of rainfall is less in the study region in comparison to the total volume of discharge therefore most of the discharge is generated from the melting of snow and ice hydrological data for the years 2011 and 2012 was evaluated and detailed analysis of its distribution and variability has been carried out for the ablation period the distribution of daily discharge shows increasing trend from june reaching its highest value in august and then starts reducing fig 4c the mean monthly discharge observed during study period 2011 2012 for the months of june september was 3 3 6 1 7 4 and 3 5m3 s respectively the mean seasonal discharge for the years 2011 2012 is 5 1m3 s the monthly and annual distribution of discharge is shown in fig 4 d further box whisker plots were developed to understand the distribution and variability in the hydrometeorological data fig 5a f the observed air temperature and relative humidity have maximum variability in the months of june and october whereas rainfall and discharge are most variable during the month of august followed by july and september 4 2 characterization distribution and variability in isotopic composition of precipitation the isotopic signatures of rainfall at chorabari glacier during the ablation season 2012 varied between 3 to 22 2 to 157 and 2 to 29 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively small amounts of rain along with wet snow take place during the months of may and june which have enriched values the mean monthly isotopic values for may june are 5 52 32 97 and 11 19 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively the mean δ18o δd and d excess values of rain over the ablation season were 13 01 88 33 and 18 32 respectively the mean monthly isotopic values of rain during july october for δ18o δd and d excess are given in table 2 a the isotopic composition δ18o δd and d excess of rain water indicates a gradual depletion as the ablation season progresses and then enrichment at the end of the ablation season the daily variations in δ18o δd and d excess in precipitation at chorabari glacier are shown in fig 6 a c the δ18o and δd values clearly indicate the response to the onset beginning of july and withdrawal end of september of monsoon from the region i e the source of moisture during summer premonsoon may june monsoon july august september and postmonsoon october november are different the precipitation during the premonsoon and postmonsoon is from westerlies or evaporation from local water bodies like lakes dam reservoirs evapotranspiration and sublimation while during july september the source of highly depleted values is the ism representing hot and humid source conditions the bulk precipitation in the region occurs during the ism the depletion of δ18o and δd in rainfall during july august and september is because of the amount effect of isotopes in precipitation fig 6d incessant increase in d excess indicates that the process of moisture recycling i e evaporation from lakes and reservoirs evapotranspiration sublimation sub cloud evaporation etc is continuous within the region krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 kumar et al 2010a b the maximum d excess during the month of september october is an indication of change in moisture source or recycling of moisture because of precipitation that occurs in small amount becomes more depleted partial evaporation of rain drops while passing through unsaturated atmosphere below the cloud base also influence the isotopic composition of rain especially in semi arid climates wu et al 2015 another important factor to be considered is the influence of westerlies during the retreating or end of the ism september end and october the statistical variations monthly and seasonal of isotopic composition of rainfall have been depicted using box and whiskers fig 6e g data show symmetry about the median except for the months of august and september which are slightly skewed towards the more positive values d excess is a function δ18o and δd which explains the large variations in upper and lower limits in order to understand the role of microclimatic conditions on isotopic composition of rainfall correlation analysis among meteorological records was carried out table 3 a the results show a very high negative correlation between the isotopic signatures δ18o and δd of rainfall and the amount of rainfall r2 0 74 0 76 further substantiating role of the amount effect i e increase in amount of rainfall will lead to more depleted isotopic signatures air temperature and relative humidity have a negative correlation with the isotopic composition of rainfall it is observed that the maximum amount of rainfall occurs during the nighttime in the region srivastava et al 2014b singh et al 2007 therefore leading to moderate correlations between minimum air temperature and isotopic signatures of rainfall r2 0 45 0 48 assessment of the present day δ18o δd and d excess composition and their climatic significance interpretation in the study region is indispensable before attempting any interpretation of palaeoclimatic records sinclair and marshall 2009 rohrmann et al 2014 samples of snowfall were collected at dokriani glacier during the winters november april which have a different source in comparison to the rainfall during the ism the mean isotopic composition of 45 snow samples was 7 40 35 89 and 23 30 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively table 2a these samples are isotopically highly enriched in comparison to rainfall samples during the months of july september but close to the ones from june that could be caused by similar source of origin however d excess values of snowfall are much higher than that of rainfall for all the months the high values of d excess indicate to the fact that winter precipitation in the region is from westerlies snow and glacier meltwater are primary sources and vital to the streamflow and should be significantly addressed in water resource management and prediction for central himalayan region melt runoff is much greater than precipitation and controlled by the amount of winter snowfall and resulting meltwater during summer most of the winter precipitation contributed significantly to the runoff during summer season 4 3 characterization distribution and variability in isotopic composition of proglacial stream and glacier surface ice the spatial and temporal variations in the isotopic composition of river waters mainly depend upon the number and type of its sources and on the evaporation from river surface which is assumed to be negligible the variations in the daily observed values reflect the variable contributions from different sources which can be evaluated if isotopic signatures of the sources are known the isotopic signatures of proglacial stream from chorabari glacier varied from 17 to 7 113 to 52 and 2 8 to 35 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively during the ablation seasons 2011 2012 the mean δ18o δd and d excess values of proglacial stream over the ablation seasons 2011 2012 were 12 9 84 3 and 20 3 respectively the mean monthly characteristics of isotopic signatures of the proglacial stream during may to october for δ18o δd and d excess are depicted in table 2 b the isotopic composition of proglacial stream shows a trend similar to that of rainfall i e depletion as the ablation season progresses and then enrichment towards the end of the ablation season this systematic variation in δ18o and δd values with time corroborates well with the meltwater discharge from chorabari glacier which starts increasing in the month of june reaches maximum in july august depending upon the variation in air temperature and rainfall then reduces in september october the daily variations in δd δ18o and d excess of proglacial stream and the effect of heavy rainfall on the hydrograph are shown in fig 7 a d the corresponding isotopic values of proglacial stream are highly variable during the monsoon season but the extent of variability is less than that of the isotopic composition of precipitation the data are more or less symmetrically distributed about its median fig 7e g the enriched isotopic values of meltwater in may june and depleted during july october reflects the fact that snowmelt is the major contributor to the proglacial stream during may and june snow melts rapidly because of rise in temperature and small amounts of rain takes place which have enriched values in comparison to ice melt while during july september ism rain becomes more depleted because of the amount effect during october major contribution to the discharge is from subglacial melt as very small quantities of precipitation rainfall and snowfall occur the correlations between isotopic composition of proglacial stream and meteorological parameters are similar to that of rainfall but with lower values of r2 in comparison which substantiate the contribution to proglacial stream from different sources viz rainfall snowmelt and glacier melt table 3b there is a significant relationship between the isotopic signatures of proglacial stream and rainfall amount r relative humidity rh mean discharge q while there is no significant relationship with air temperature the isotopic signatures of surface ice from chorabari glacier varied from 19 to 12 120 to 71 and 21 to 30 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively along the central line of the glacier during the ablation season 2012 the mean δ18o δd and d excess values of glacier surface ice were 14 9 93 6 and 25 5 for δ18o δd and d excess respectively 4 4 development of local meteoric water line lmwl for precipitation meltwater and glacier surface ice the relationship between δ18o and δd is well established world over recently it has been shown that significant depletion in isotopic composition is also related to large scale convection lekshmy et al 2014 and the atmospheric residence time of moisture or moisture residence time rt i e ratio of perceptible water q to precipitation rate p and is intrinsically dependent on temperature moisture source and the strength of the hydrological cycle convection aggarwal et al 2012 another important factor controlling the lmwl is secondary evaporation liu et al 2010 pang et al 2011 the seasonal local meteoric water line lmwl using daily and mean monthly values for rainfall events observed at chorabari glacier are represented in fig 8 a b while the corresponding equations including monthly lmwl s are given in table 4 a the large variation in the slope and intercept for each month indicates the complexity of the ism thus the relationship between δ18o and δd is more intricate and points towards the fact that the study region is influenced by both the eastern bay of bengal and western arabian sea limbs of the ism sengupta and sarkar 2006 the d excess values of precipitation are considered to be influenced by the meteorological conditions at the source of the moisture such as relative humidity wind speed and surface temperature over the evaporative surface wu et al 2012 the seasonal lmwl has a slope close to the one of the gmwl but a very high intercept comparisons of the slope and intercept of lmwl with previous studies could be useful for inferring climatic information peng et al 2004 the small amounts of rainfall are often subject to sub cloud secondary effects or secondary evaporation accompanied with fractionation equilibrium and kinetic this leads to substantial lowering of the slope of lmwl peng et al 2007 similarly large precipitation events tend to lower the d excess values significantly the winter precipitation or snowfall events in the study region have a lmwl with a slope 8 13 close to gmwl and an intercept of 24 13 which is shown in fig 9 a and its corresponding equation is in table 4 b the high intercept and d excess values for snowfall signify that these events are from westerlies while the slope and intercept for lmwl of surface ice samples are lower than that of snowfall fig 9a table 4c the intercept is still higher than that of rainfall fig 9b this could be caused by the process of sublimation or diffusion during the transformation of snow to firn and subsequently ice zhou et al 2014 the seasonal lmwl s of proglacial stream have very low slope and highly negative intercept in comparison to lmwl s for rainfall fig 8c d while the monthly and seasonal equations of lmwl s are given in table 4d this further substantiates the complexity in the hydrological system the extremely low value of slope for the monthly equations can be explained on the basis of secondary evaporation sublimation melt refreeze processes etc from the surface of the glacier and snowpack the seasonal lmwl daily and monthly significantly vary from each other zhang et al 2001 which is an indication that composite monthly sampling for isotopic studies are not sufficient and there is a need to shift to daily or event based sampling especially during the ism to better understand the natural processes of the hydrological cycle and extreme events in the himalaya however the sampling protocols may differ from region to region and based on the specific objectives of the research problem further in order to understand the significance of isotopic signatures the different components of streamflow meltwater precipitation glacier ice melt have been plotted against the global meteoric water line gmwl at daily scale most of the data is plotted above the gmwl signifying that the study area lies in a warm temperate region fig 9a b similar studies in the himalayan region have been carried out by various workers dalai et al 2002 kumar et al 2010a b jeelani et al 2013 khan et al 2016 rai et al 2016 whose lmwl are represented in table 5 most of these studies collected either composite monthly samples or discontinuous random sampling both of which are unable to decipher processes taking place on daily scale peng et al 2004 concluded that temperature effects and secondary evaporation effects can be deliberated only by using short term event based samples rather than composite monthly amount weighted samples under the aegis of iaea and global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip a network of rain gauges was established in the bhagirathi basin during the years 2004 2006 by national institute of hydrology nih roorkee kumar et al 2010a b the iaea gnip isotopic data δ18o and δd has been used to compare the isotopic signatures at chorabari glacier along with winter precipitation at dokriani glacier and developed a regional meteoric water line for the garhwal himalaya table 5 further the lmwl for chorabari and dokriani glaciers during the ablation and accumulation seasons respectively have been compared with the gmwl and meteoric water lines of gangotri and gaumukh stations fig 9c 4 5 development and significance of snow and isotopic depletion curves sdc and idc snowmelt begins by the end of april and the snowline ascends up to 5200m a s l by the end of the ablation season i e in the beginning of october the sca for the years 2009 2011 indicates that 97 of the catchment area is covered with snow during winters and reduces to 52 by the end of summers fig 10 subsequently the sca is plotted against the elapsed time and the depletion of sca is mathematically represented by a 2nd degree polynomial equation known as the snow depletion curve sdc with r2 values ranging from 0 8 to 0 9 for the years 2009 2011 fig 11 a c daily sca can be derived by interpolation from sdc indicating rapid depletion of sca during summer months may september which is the general trend as seen in the sdc s the sdc s indicate that the lowest limit of sca during the ablation season june september for the years 2009 2011 was 59 71 and 52 respectively also the sdc indicates that the depletion pattern of the sca is similar for all the years but there is no ground based data to quantify interannual variability further elevation wise distribution and variability in sca is low at high elevation zones 5000m a s l in comparison to lower elevation zones 5000m a s l which is reflected by the coefficient of variation in the study area misra et al 2015 similar trends can be observed in the mean monthly isotopic composition of proglacial meltwater stream which are represented by isotopic depletion curves idc fig 11d the close relationship between sdc and idc indicates that melting of the snow accumulated during the preceding winter is an important component in determining the contribution and quantifying the amount of discharge during the ablation period the isotopic signatures of the proglacial stream emerging from a glacierized catchment responds directly to the melting trend of the snowpack sdc in the catchment the snow starts melting in the beginning of may which leads to an increase in discharge the receding snow line mobilises loose soil and sediments below it which are transported to the proglacial stream subsequently inducing highly enriched isotopic values as the ablation season progresses the sca reduces and the contribution of ism increases while at the end of the ablation season sca is constant and rainfall is low leading to falling limb of the hydrograph and major contribution from glacial melt therefore snow cover protects the glacier from rapid melting and the year with high winter precipitation should delay the glacier melting less negative mass balance further high d excess values 20 are reported for ganga river during the peak monsoon august pointing towards a source of high d excess which may be derived from westerlies implying that the himalayan glaciers receive high contribution of snow from westerlies and is better preserved than that received during the ism maurya et al 2011 also the sdc s and idc s depicts that the glaciers in the garhwal himalaya have significant contribution from winter accumulation to the proglacial stream near the snout during the ablation season as compared to summer accumulation while in reference to glacier mass balance studies most of the glaciers in eastern and central himalaya have been classified as summer accumulation type ageta and higuchi 1984 ageta and fujita 1996 implying that accumulation and ablation maxima occur almost simultaneously during the summer the idc follows the same pattern and such relationships could be a useful tool for understanding the processes governing the hydrological regime of a glacierized catchment which is very significant for long term estimation of meltwater contribution on daily basis it is pertinent to note that there is high interannual and seasonal variability in sca fig 11a c precipitation distribution as well as in the isotopic signatures precipitation meltwater and glacial ice which are concurrent to space and time also from the previous sections it is clear that the isotopic composition of each component snowmelt glacier ice melt rainfall have overlapping ranges which makes it very complicated to separate these components from a hydrograph therefore stable isotope signatures of each component itself are not sufficient to separate the hydrograph appropriately using two or three component mixing models and multiple proxies like physical properties ph conductivity etc or chemical parameters major ions trace elements etc are required in conjunction to accurately separate the hydrograph using end member mixing model 4 6 identification of moisture sources using deuterium excess d excess and backward wind trajectories deuterium excess has values close to 10 for precipitation in temperate climate the deuterium excess depends on relative humidity of air masses at its source of origin oceanic origin ocean surface temperature and kinetic fractionation effects during evaporation the deuterium excess was established by dansgaard 1964 and is defined as eq 2 2 d δd 8 δ18o vsmow summer precipitation in the higher himalayan ranges mainly occurs by the ism which develops in response to the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz that separates wind circulation of both hemispheres in the himalayan glaciers there are mainly two periods of precipitation one period is from june to september when moisture source is from ism and other is from october to april when moisture comes from the westerlies the deuterium excess is governed by many environmental factors in the water vapour source area like relative humidity temperature and wind speed and degree of water vapour recycling that takes place along the transport path of air masses in order to further understand the processes of moisture recycling in the system the relation of δ18o and d excess with prevailing atmospheric temperature was explored and we get a linear relationship for the events in the early ablation season may june and late ablation season or early winter october with an r2 of 0 58 low temperature and relative humidity indicating the role of adiabatic cooling of the moisture laden air parcels in mountainous regions clark and fritz 1997 gat et al 2001 though adiabatic cooling is suggested to occur at temperatures below 0 c pang et al 2011 our data suggests that adiabatic cooling is caused owing to the orographic uplift of the air parcel in the valley at temperatures up to 6 c the isotopic composition of precipitation during the monsoon season july september did not show any significant relationship with mean temperature fig 11e high temperature and relative humidity negate the enrichment caused by temperature effect by moisture recycling within the valley froehlich et al 2008 therefore daily temperature plays an important role in affecting isotopic composition of rainfall during the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons while during the monsoon season the isotopic composition is influenced by the amount effect the isotopic composition of precipitation δ2h δ18o and d excess surface ice and proglacial stream are important parameters for hydrograph separation in runoff generated from glaciers in the himalaya the overall continental and global patterns in precipitation isotopic composition are fairly well described by condensation temperature and rayleigh fractionation during rainout however in order to understand these processes in a small glacierized basin where dynamics of moisture source varies during different seasons it is important to supplement it with other proxies like ph ec physiochemical properties or major ion chemistry or use of modern techniques like modelling here we explore the use of atmospheric back trajectory modelling and associated meteorological variables to explain the large variability observed in the isotopic composition of individual precipitation events at the study site fig 12 the 5 day backward wind trajectory plots for each month illustrate the source of the air parcels causing precipitation at the study site the most intriguing aspects of the plots are that during pre monsoon or early ablation period may june the moisture available for precipitation is regional or local further substantiating the inference that precipitation during early ablation period is governed by local sources and secondary evaporation processes while strong influence of the eastern limb of the ism is observed during september though the winter months get most of the precipitation from westerlies it is viewed that there is a north south shifting in the trajectory source without any distinct monthly pattern we also observe that some of the air parcels have a northward extent up to the arctic circle especially in the month of april 5 conclusions the paper contributes to the hydrology of the indian himalayan region ihr especially in understanding the hydrological cycle and the importance of high resolution observational data in the region the temporal and spatial patterns of δ18o δd and d excess in the central himalayan region are indicative of governing hydrological processes integrated with prevailing weather conditions the precipitation occurring at chorabari glacier during premonsoon may june and postmonsoon september end october or retreating monsoon seasons is mainly caused by mixing of moisture from different sources like local moisture recycling evapotranspiration evaporation from lakes sublimation secondary or sub cloud evaporation etc indian summer monsoon and westerlies as indicated by the variations in d excess while the moisture source for winter precipitation contributing to the accumulation of snow subsequently converting into firn ice is westerlies and the major source of rainfall during the ablation season is from the ism the backward wind trajectories plotted for the precipitation events at chorabari glacier indicate trends similar to that of stable isotopes and corroborate that the major source of solid precipitation is from westerlies during winters while the ism contributes to rainfall events even at an elevation of 4800m a s l snowmelt is the major source of meltwater during the early ablation season and the contribution glacier melt and rainfall increases as the ablation season progresses and base flow or sub glacial melting contributes mainly towards the end of the ablation season the sdc and idc show a progressive depletion over the ablation season and enrichment towards the end which follows a 2nd degree polynomial equation substantiating that snowmelt is an important component of the hydrograph most of the points of the local meteoric water line for precipitation rainfall and snowfall meltwater and glacier surface ice lie above the global meteoric water line indicating warm conditions in the study region the isotopic composition of rain is well correlated with rainfall amount minimum and mean temperature and relative humidity while the isotopic composition of meltwater has good correlations with rainfall amount relative humidity and discharge but no significant relationship with temperature the daily temperature plays an important role in affecting isotopic composition of rainfall during the premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons while during the monsoon season the isotopic composition is influenced by the amount effect similar results have been reported by he and richards 2016 for the tibetan region composite monthly sampling for isotopic studies are insufficient to trace detailed hydrological processes extreme events and also for explicit understading of various other processes e g sublimation melting and re freezing in the glacierized basins of the himalaya further the authors suggest that observations and sampling of precipitation for isotopic studies and hydrometeorology during winters should be carried out on various

east southeast direction and forms the northern headwaters of the larger guadalupe river system which flows to the gulf of mexico the colorado system bounds the watershed to the north and upper guadalupe to its south fig 1 the blanco river extends approximately 75 km through the karst landscape of the eastern edwards plateau before flowing past the balcones escarpment in the lower portion of the watershed the surface geology west of the balcones escarpment mainly consists of lower cretaceous limestones resulting in a rugged surface soils in this area are thin 1 m east of the escarpment

river at normal to dry conditions the blanco contains long stretches of dry stream bed and stagnant pools under extreme drought the river flows for only about half its length much of the stream flow

kg 1 is well distributed throughout the profile along with the environmental lapse rate close to moist adiabatic with a high relative humidity throughout mean of 91 individual cell storm motion could be assumed to be with the 0 6 km mean wind 190 at 15 9 ms 1 however meso beta scale orlanski 1975 convective elements mbes corfidi et al 1996 would be nearly orthogonal and slower 260 at 7 2 ms 1 thus the environment supported deep moist convection and heavy rain especially given the high precipitable water and large warm cloud depth supporting collision coalescence rain processes while the moderate cell motion would typically be a mitigating factor for heavy rain the nearly orthogonal and slow mbe motion and moderate shear could support cell training over localized areas and hence heavy

mcs developing over the texas big bend region and propagating east across south central texas sequential nexrad radar reflectivity fig 4 shows the models verified well from a qualitative perspective what the models did not forecast was the development and propagation of a meso gamma orlanski 1975 convective vortex which propagated along the mean wind and merged with the northern bookend vortex of the mcs around 0100 utc on 24 may 2015 lower left panel of fig 4 this merger maintained heavy rainfall over the upstream western end of the blanco river basin followed by the mcs propagating eastward and down basin potentially providing additional flow as the main floodwave also moved downstream flash flood guidance values generated by the national weather service west gulf river forecast center were well below normal 43 mm in 1 h 58 mm in 3 h and 76 2 mm in 6 h due to rainfall in the preceding two weeks that resulted in increased soil moisture and hence would result in initial flash flooding being observed at lower rainfall rates however nexrad and estimated rainfall in excess of 220 mm in the upper blanco river basin easily exceeded these values 4 rainfall the synoptic and mesoscale

with about 130 mm of precipitation falling over the wettest 7 h fig 5 displays accumulations for maximum 3 6 12 and 15 h totals a key feature of the storm was it remaining nearly stationary over the headwaters of the blanco river during the seven hour period of maximum rainfall strong radar echoes 50 dbz were present in the upper half of the basin upstream of the confluence of the blanco and little blanco rivers when the strongest cells moved off of the headwaters they followed the course of the river downstream supplementary fig a6 displays a rainfall hyetograph for the area delineated at the confluence of the blanco and little blanco rivers this 615 km2 area approximate upper half of the watershed received event totals of approximately 220 mm this area of the basin is characterized by steep channel beds and steep topography forming narrow valleys and channels downstream areas heavily impacted by the floodwave received much less rainfall 25 75 mm the lack of extreme rainfall in the lower populated portion of the basin was a missing environmental cue to the potential of a flood wave coming downstream and may have slowed evacuation response exacerbating the death toll from the event rainfall return periods were calculated at 1 3 6 and 12 h intervals from the stage iv bin containing the highest accumulation for each time period return periods were calculated following the methods of asquith 1998 which employs a regionalization approach for the state of texas utilizing a generalized logistic glo distribution asquith 1998 concluded the glo distribution was more appropriate than the generalized extreme value distribution for storm durations up to 24 h the storm s point annual nonexceedance probability f is estimated by 1 f 1 1 1 κ α x d f ξ 1 κ ξ α and к are parameters of the glo distribution estimated from l moments ξ describes the location along the glo distribution and can be interpreted as a median depth for a given duration α and к describe the scale and shape of the glo distribution respectively xd refers to the precipitation depth for a given duration к is dimensionless while ξ α and xd have units of inches asquith 1998 contains iso maps of the state displaying к ξ and α values which vary by duration and location table 1 shows return periods for a point t at various durations using the stage iv bins the maximum return period was approximately 320 years at the 6 h duration return periods at a point would be somewhat higher than shown here since these are derived from 4 km 4 km radar averages several point estimates rain gauges operating as part of the community collaborative rain hail snow network cocorahs www cocorahs org cifelli et al 2005 captured 24 h accumulations from the event the maximum twenty four hour return period from cocorahs was 270 years if it is assumed this amount fell during a 12 h period which the radar data suggests the return period is 380 years no sub daily rain gauges apart of a formal network are known to have captured the event in the basin it should be noted that while the return periods imply very rare rainfall from the storm event accumulations in excess of 250 mm are not particularly rare when the texas hill country is considered as a whole examining just the previous five years multiple storms along the balcones escarpment can be identified exceeding this threshold 9

authority eaa station were operating in the basin during the flood event fig 2 full stage hydrographs were recorded at an eaa station located mid basin upmost gauging station 675 km2 along with a usgs gauging station at the outlet usgs 08171350 1129 km2 partial discharge hydrographs were collected by the two interior usgs stations separated by a short distance in the lower portion of the basin usgs

rainfall runoff data indicate a very rapid stream flow response with a steep sharp crested hydrograph measured in the middle portion of the basin at the eaa gauging location the river rose over 8 m in one hour lag times defined here as time difference between peak discharge and the time centroid of basin averaged rainfall were calculated for the two locations with full stage hydrographs rainfall for the seven hour maximum 1900 23 may 0200 24 may were clipped to the drainage areas of the gauging stations and we assumed a uniform hourly rainfall rate when calculating the time centroid of the basin s rainfall lag time at the upstream gauge was estimated at 5 5 h 15 min gauge reporting increment and 11 41 h at the watershed outlet 5 min gauge reporting increment the usgs estimated peak flows at the wimberley station usgs 08171000 using indirect slope area techniques peak discharge was estimated at 4955 m3 s with a stage estimate of 13 7 m making it the flood of record for this gauge with measurements dating back to the 1920s flow recurrence intervals were calculated at this station using the methods outlined by the usgs peakfq program flynn et al 2006 peakfq provides statistical flood frequency analysis of annual maximum peak flows following the log pearson type iii frequency distribution parameters of the frequency distribution are estimated from the logarithmic sample

fig a7 displays recurrence intervals for a given flow bracketed with 95 confidence intervals along with annual peak flows the recurrence intervals x axis correspond to the inverse of the exceedance probabilities calculated in accordance with the peakfq methodology flynn et al 2006 the curve displayed in the top panel includes the may 2015 peak flow in the calculations while the bottom panel omits the peak flow when the may 2015 peak flow is included in the dataset the recurrence interval for the may 2015 flood is 178 years when the curve is constructed without the may 2015 data point the usgs indirect estimate represents a recurrence interval of approximately 379 years it s worth noting the probable maximum flood for a basin this size in this region of texas is estimated at 17 000 m3 s 1 asquith and slade 1995 5 2 gssha simulations 5 2 1 model setup the may 2015 flood event was simulated with the gssha model downer and ogden 2004 and hydrological processes simulated included infiltration landscape retention 2 d overland flow and 1 d stream routing evapotranspiration and deep aquifer contributions were not included model preprocessing was conducted using arcgis and aquaveo s watershed modeling system emrl 2016 watershed terrain was constructed from usgs 10 m dems filled using the cleandam algorithm distributed with the gssha model the usgs gauging station at san marcos tx usgs 08171350 served as the outlet land use and land cover data were extracted from the national land cover dataset homer et al 2015 soils data were prepared from natural resources conservation service datasets soil survey 2013 along with maps from the eaa edwards aquifer authority 2015 defining the edwards aquifer recharge zone infiltration calculations were conducted using green and ampt with redistribution ogden and saghafian 1997 and initial saturated hydraulic conductivity values provided by rawls et al 1983 grid cells were assigned to one of 4 land use classes for retention and overland roughness parameterization as discussed in the introduction heavy rainfall in the months leading to the event left very moist soils initial soil moistures were set at 0 3 cm3 cm3 representing very moist conditions up to 80 volumetric water content stream channels were modeled using irregular cross sections for the main channel and large tributaries channel and floodplain geometry were extracted from a triangular irregular network constructed from the dem flood plain geometry was extracted with the channels allowing for control of floodplain simulation upland tributaries were modeled as a uniform trapezoidal profile reach specific manning s n values were assigned based on field observations 125 river sites visited and prior modeling experience in this region of texas sharif et al 2010a sharif et al 2010b sharif et al 2013 elhassan et al 2013 chintalapudi et al 2014 routing was calculated using the diffusive wave equation in 1d for streams and 2d for overland flow the model was run on a 150 m grid with a 1 min time step model performance was assessed using the commonly applied r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias measures moriasi et al 2007 5 2 2 model calibration and validation measured flow and stage iv precipitation data were collected for 6 storms for model calibration and validation flow performance was examined at the wimberley usgs gauge and is the primary focus of our analysis since indirect flow estimates are available the gssha model was calibrated to a single storm event occurring 17 18 november 2004 with the remaining 5 events used to validate the model calibration was performed manually with saturated hydraulic conductivity channel geometry channel roughness and overland roughness showing the most sensitivity table 2 shows calibrated surface parameters used in the final model run the calibration event produced peak flows of approximately one fifth of the may 2015 event at wimberley although other storms in the dataset produced peak flows greater than the calibration storm event it was chosen due to the spatial organization of the rainfall and antecedent conditions the 17 18 november 2004 storm was centered in the upper portion of the basin straddling the little blanco and upper blanco watersheds the may 2015 event contained very similar aerial rainfall coverage across the upper portion of the watershed the two october events producing the highest peak flows were centered just upstream of the wimberley stream gauge visual observations and high water mapping at approximately 125 river locations after the may 2015 event indicated complicated river hydraulics in the upper portion of the basin that would have significantly affected the floodwave essentially flood waters passed through a series of confining canyons and open flood plains between the towns of blanco and wimberley river stage from the may 2015 event varied by more than 8 m in this section of the river depending on the surrounding channel geometry furl unpublished data in addition to the spatial location of the rainfall the november 17 18 2004 event occurred at the tail end of significant rainfall across the area rain gauges in the neighboring basin to the north recorded rainfall in excess of 100 150 mm in the days leading up to the validation event lcra 2016 measured and simulated hydrographs at the wimberley gauge along with model performance statistics are shown in fig 7 and table 3 respectively the calibration event performed well with nse and r2 values 0 9 and pbias near 10 the model performed well for the 22 24 november 2004 event but overestimated volume for the remaining runs 31 october 2013 30 october 2015 08 09 september 2010 25 26 may 2013 the two worst performing validation events 08 09 september 2010 25 26 may 2013 significantly overestimated flows and were fairly low flow events compared to the calibration run overestimations of these events are likely related to antecedent soil moisture conditions which are discussed below 5 2 3 may 2015 simulation results from the may 2015 event simulation are shown in fig 8 the modeled floodwave presents itself as a sharp crested peak and appears similar to the stage hydrograph recorded at the eaa gauge upstream modeled peak flows at the wimberley gauge and basin outlet were 4780 m3s 1 and 4072 m3s 1 respectively simple percent error in peak flows between modeled values and the usgs indirect estimate were less than 5 runoff ratios were calculated for each of the 6 calibration validation events at the wimberley gauge in order to provide comparison with the may 2015 event table 4 the ratios were calculated from stage iv data clipped to the wimberley gauge watershed and measured flows from the gauging station the runoff volume from the may 2015 event were calculated from the gssha output in an attempt to standardize the calculations across events runoff volumes were calculated from the start of the rainfall event to 12 h past peak flows twelve hours past peak flows provided enough time for hydrographs to return to near baseflow runoff ratios ranged an order of magnitude across the events with nearly 10 or less of the rainfall volume exiting the basin for three events september 2010 may 2013 october 2015 and greater than 50 for three events 17 18 november 2004 23 24 november 2004 may 2015 the model was calibrated to one of the high runoff ratio events and model performance was best for other events with increased runoff ratios 23 24 november 2004 and october 2013 the runoff ratio for the may 2015 event was estimated at nearly 70 although this is likely an overestimation given the volume overestimations for some validation results model performance aside the wide ranging runoff ratios suggests antecedent conditions combined with spatiotemporal variations in rainfall play a large role in mediating stream response the october 2015 event occurred just months after the flood of record for the wimberley gauge and produced the eight highest peak flow 2010 m3 s 1 the event was centered just upstream of the wimberley gauge and the stage iv record indicated rainfall volume and rate very close to the may 2015 event fig 9 however much less water exited the basin with a runoff ratio approximately one fifth of the may 2015 estimate soil moisture data were examined from a probe located between wimberley and san marcos as part of the cosmos monitoring network freeman ranch site 57 zreda et al 2012 data were available for the four most recent storm events may 2013 october 2013 may 2015 october 2015 and 10 day antecedent soil moisture values are shown in supplementary fig a8 mean 10 day volumetric soil moisture preceding the may 2015 event was approximately 60 higher than the 10 day period leading up to the october 2013 and 2015 events and nearly double the may 2013 event streamflow volume from the may 2013 event was largely overestimated by the gssha model the effect of soil moisture on model runs was investigated by running the model under varying initial soil moisture conditions ranging from 0 1 0 3 cm3 cm3 representing volumetric soil moisture percentages from 25 to 80 data not shown the various model representations produced only modest changes to runoff volume and peak flow the lack of streamflow response to changes in initial soil moisture conditions is a major shortcoming in the gssha model setup however the model appears to perform reasonably well when antecedent soil moisture is high other researchers have documented the varying ability for storm events to produce runoff in the region in 2009 smith et al 2011 documented rainfall in excess of 200 mm with no appreciable flow response in downstream creeks in the onion creek drainage basin which borders the blanco to the north these results highlight the importance of antecedent conditions and difficulties in building robust hydrologic models that can respond to the soil condition extremes in addition to the heterogeneity of physical features across a basin and channel 6 rainfall transpositions there is much recent interest and research activity in the field of forecasting river flows using qpes or qpfs e g liechti et al 2013 including the recent launch of the united states national water model noaa nwc 2016 and opening of the national water center several numerical weather prediction models are presently available providing near term fine scale qpfs including the thunderstorm identification tracking analysis and nowcasting system dixon and wiener 1993 tracking radar echoes by correlation tuttle and foote 1990 and the high resolution rapid refresh model benjamin et al 2016 forecasting river flows with qpfs has the benefit of providing advanced lead time and some models have the ability to create ensemble forecasts however forecast skill is directly related to lead time and significant errors can arise when attempting to predict rainfall over small narrow drainages vivoni et al 2007 sharif et al 2006 this is particularly problematic in regions like the texas hill country where flood causing precipitation events are often highly localized qpes derived from radar and gauge networks have the ability to produce more reliable estimates e g multi radar multi sensor zhang et al 2016 but the maximum theoretical lead time is equal to the basin s time of concentrations in this section of the paper modest perturbations to the position of the storm centroid and intensity of rainfall are created to examine the sensitivity of peak discharge peak flow timing and runoff ratios as measured through the gssha model simulations at the wimberley gauge rainfall input to the model was varied by displacing the original stage iv grid in 2 km increments up to 24 km these displacements were done radially in 5 increments supplementary fig a9 shows the stage iv grid clipped to approximately 25 km in total 864 72 angular shifts 12 displacements gssha model runs were completed for the original storm additionally the same exercise was completed with a 0 8 and 1 2 multiplier herein referred to as 0 8 and 1 2 storms applied to the original precipitation amounts while the spatial shifts and factor adjustments are arbitrary they fall well within reasonable ranges of errors expected from qpfs and real time qpes with no gauge adjustments cunha et al 2013 bauer et al 2016 for a given storm duration and total amount of rainfall over a catchment the temporal and spatial distributions of the rainfall is controlled by how the storm moved over the catchment this will have a significant impact on the runoff response of the catchment and the characteristics of the outlet hydrograph singh 1998 ogden et al 1995 roberts and klingeman 1970 a storm moving over a catchment in the upstream direction will result in a hydrograph with a longer base time a rising limb with a gentler slope and a smaller peak flow 6 1 peak flows runoff ratios and peak timing peak flows from shifts of the original storm herein referred to as 1 0 storm ranged from 2082 to 4915 m3 s 1 peak discharge from the 1 0 storm with no spatial shift was in the 90th percentile of all 1 0 peak flows the highest peak discharges from the 1 0 storm typically occurred with 25 50 angular shifts and 4 8 km displacements fig 10 moving the storm downstream results in attenuated peak flows an example is provided in supplementary fig a9b by moving the storm along the 340 axis a distance of 16 km in this scenario we preserve total volume of rainfall above the wimberley gauge 1 difference but move the epicenter off of the headlands to near the confluence of the rivers peak flow at the wimberley gauge in this scenario is 25 lower 3531 m3 s 1 than the original storm runoff ratios remain nearly identical between the scenarios which is not unexpected given the low hydraulic conductivity values of the soils and moist conditions the effect is similar to having a storm move in the upstream direction rather than downstream e g ogden et al 1995 the physical mechanisms responsible for the large difference in hydrograph shape likely results from the steep topography in the uplands and differences in the uplands stream network seo 2012 demonstrated that efficient flow networks are much more sensitive to spatial characteristics of a storm maximum flows in the catchment were very sensitive to distance displaced at other angles as well at 10 km displacements all angles flows ranged from 3994 to 4873 and at 20 km displacements the range increased to 2469 4418 fig a10 stated another way displacing the storm 20 km the flow recurrence intervals ranged from 34 to 226 years this in part owes to the narrow shape of the drainage spatial structure of the storm and other surface features such as channel morphology and spatial distribution of soils the timing of peak flows spanned over 5 h for the 1 0 storm with the median time very near the actual peak 5 min peak flow response to the 0 8 and 1 2 multipliers showed a similar response in terms of storm configuration resulting in minimum and maximum responses however there was a non linear response to the linear adjustments made in the precipitation field twenty percent changes in precipitation resulted in approximately 30 changes in median minimum and maximum peak flows for the 0 8 and 1 2 storms runoff ratios for the 1 0 storm ranged from 0 61 to 0 74 including the 0 8 and 1 2 datasets runoff ratios ranged from 0 56 0 77 while not as wide ranging as the runoff ratios recorded from the six additional storms assessed during model calibration and validation a maximum difference of 21 highlights the importance of storm location motion precipitation amount and distributed soil properties across the basin singh 1998 ogden et al 1995 roberts and klingeman 1970 visualization of flood forecasts is often performed by displaying an ensemble of hydrographs produced by model output forced by various precipitation forecasts ideally the observed peak discharge will be enveloped by the members creating the ensemble forecast fig 11 shows a hydrograph ensemble of gssha output for the undisplaced storms 0 8 1 0 1 2 along with the maximum and minimum peak flows and peak timings for each of the three categories the ensemble shows a range of shapes from a single peak to a bimodal distribution peak flows in the ensemble had a maximum difference of nearly 5000 m3 s 1 peak timings had a range of over six hours this exercise highlights the difficulty in creating useful flood ensembles in small medium sized basins from forecasted precipitation 7 conclusions there are three principal conclusions from the work while the synoptic characteristics of intense convective precipitation have been known for decades and the mescoscale characteristics since the mid 1990s the advent of high resolution rapid assimilation and model refresh e g the hrrr dual polarization of the wsr 88d network and high spatial resolution and frequent reporting automated raingauges offers the prospect of short range high quality qpf qpe for input into hydrologic models but as shown here even small displacement of qpf qpe can result in significant differences in hydrograph of resulting flood waves while rainfall amounts from the event were impressive accumulations from the storm were not uncharacteristic for high magnitude events across the texas hill country however the rainfall was able to produce an uncharacteristically large and deadly flood the entire region had received record to near record precipitation amounts in the months leading up to the flood this led to saturated soils and creeks streams and rivers primed for maximum rainfall runoff analysis of the additional storm events used for hydrological model calibration and validation indicated a wide range of runoff ratios runoff ratios for the may 2015 event estimated from the gssha model were much larger 0 7 than other storms examined rainfall from the event began directly over the headwaters of the basin and were able to remain stationary for many hours when the most intense rain cells began to move off the headwaters the entire mesoscale convective system moved slowly downstream analysis of model iterations of the transposed rainfall fields suggests storm location and motion played a significant role in the peak flows when the intense headwater cells were started over the middle portion of the basin peak flows were greatly attenuated while volume of runoff remained similar acknowledgements this work was partially funded by us army corps of engineers engineer

meteorological observations high resolution rainfall estimates and physics based distributed hydrological modeling provide the opportunity to examine the hydrometeorological mechanisms accompanying the extreme storm and subsequent flood additionally transpositions of the radar rain fields forced through the hydrologic model allow for analysis of the effect of position of the centroid of the

the benefit of using real time radar volume scans but their maximum lead time for flood prediction is equal to or less than the basin s time of concentration this can limit their utility in basins such as those found in the texas hill country which are known to respond quickly to rainfall qpfs provide greater lead times for flood forecasting at the cost of accuracy sharif et al 2006 vivoni et al 2007 collier 2007 in the present study we describe the succession of hydrometeorological events leading up to and resulting in the blanco river flood we examine the synoptic scale e g wang et al 2015 and mesoscale weather patterns leading to the development of catastrophic rainfall and detail the structure motion and evolution of rainfall across the basin the flood hydrology of the event is examined through pbd hydrological modeling with the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha model downer and ogden 2004 lastly the effect of storm location and precipitation amount on peak flows are examined by model iterations transposing rainfall fields across different areas of the basin implications for flash flood forecasting are discussed our analysis is divided into separate

discussed throughout 2 area description the blanco river watershed encompasses approximately 1100 km2 at its confluence with the san marcos river in south central texas the watershed is oriented in an east southeast direction and forms the northern headwaters of the larger guadalupe river system which flows to the gulf of mexico the colorado system bounds the watershed to the north and upper guadalupe to its south fig 1 the blanco river extends approximately 75 km through the karst landscape of the eastern edwards plateau before flowing past the balcones escarpment in the lower portion of the watershed the surface geology west of the balcones escarpment mainly consists of lower cretaceous limestones resulting in a rugged surface soils in this area are thin 1 m east of the escarpment surface geology primarily consists of nonresistant upper cretaceous limestones resulting in flat terrain there is significant surface water groundwater interaction throughout the main stem of the river at normal to dry conditions the blanco contains long stretches of dry stream bed and stagnant pools under extreme drought the river flows for only about half its length much of the stream flow under low flow conditions originates from the pleasant valley spring and jacobs well spring fig 2 flow entering sinks along the channel have been dye traced to barton springs approximately 50 km north

the environment supported deep moist convection and heavy rain especially given the high precipitable water and large warm cloud depth supporting collision coalescence rain processes while the moderate cell motion would typically be a mitigating factor for heavy rain the nearly orthogonal and slow mbe motion and moderate shear could support cell training over localized areas and hence heavy

mcs developing over the texas big bend region and propagating east across south central texas sequential nexrad radar reflectivity fig 4 shows the models verified well from a qualitative perspective what the models did not forecast was the development and propagation of a meso gamma orlanski 1975 convective vortex which propagated along the mean wind and merged with the northern bookend vortex of the mcs around 0100 utc on 24 may 2015 lower left panel of fig 4 this merger maintained heavy rainfall over the upstream western end of the blanco river basin followed by the mcs propagating eastward and down basin potentially providing additional flow as the main floodwave also moved downstream flash flood guidance values generated by the national weather service west gulf river forecast center were well below normal 43 mm in 1 h 58 mm in 3 h and 76 2 mm in 6 h due to rainfall in the preceding two weeks that resulted in increased soil moisture and hence would result in initial flash flooding being observed at lower rainfall rates however nexrad and estimated rainfall in excess of 220 mm in the upper blanco river basin easily exceeded these values 4 rainfall the synoptic and mesoscale

have an hourly time step a basin wide hyetograph derived from the stage iv precipitation data are shown in supplementary fig a6 the 1100 km2 watershed averaged about 165 mm during the 15 h maximum with about 130 mm of precipitation falling over the wettest 7 h fig 5 displays accumulations for maximum 3 6 12 and 15 h totals a key feature of the storm was it remaining nearly stationary over the headwaters of the blanco river during the seven hour period of maximum rainfall strong radar echoes 50 dbz were present in the upper half of the basin upstream of the confluence of the blanco and little blanco rivers when the strongest cells moved off of the headwaters they followed the course of the river downstream supplementary fig a6 displays a rainfall hyetograph for the area delineated at the confluence of the blanco and little blanco rivers this 615 km2 area approximate upper half of the watershed received event totals of approximately 220 mm this area of the basin is characterized by steep channel beds and steep topography forming narrow valleys and channels downstream areas heavily impacted by the floodwave received much less rainfall 25 75 mm the lack of extreme rainfall in the lower populated portion of the basin was a missing environmental cue to the potential of a flood wave coming downstream and may have slowed evacuation response exacerbating the death toll from the event rainfall return periods were calculated at 1 3 6 and 12 h intervals from the stage iv bin containing the highest accumulation for each time period return periods were calculated following the methods of asquith 1998 which employs a regionalization approach for the state of texas utilizing a generalized logistic glo distribution asquith 1998 concluded the glo distribution was more appropriate than the generalized extreme value distribution for storm durations up to 24 h the storm s point annual nonexceedance probability f is estimated by 1 f 1 1 1 κ α x d f ξ 1 κ ξ α and к are parameters of the glo distribution estimated from l moments ξ describes the location along the glo distribution and can be interpreted as a median depth for a given duration α and к describe the scale and shape of the glo distribution respectively xd refers to the precipitation depth for a given duration к is dimensionless while ξ α and xd have units of inches asquith 1998 contains iso maps of the state displaying к ξ and α values which vary by duration and location table 1 shows return periods for a point t at various durations using the stage iv bins the maximum return period was approximately 320 years at the 6 h duration return periods at a point would be somewhat higher than shown here since these are derived from 4 km 4 km radar averages several point estimates rain gauges operating as part of the community collaborative rain hail snow network cocorahs www cocorahs org cifelli et al 2005 captured 24 h accumulations from the event the maximum twenty four hour return period from cocorahs was 270 years if it is assumed this amount fell during a 12 h period which the radar data suggests the return period is 380 years no sub daily rain gauges apart of a formal network are known to have captured the event in the basin it should be noted that while the return periods imply very rare rainfall from the storm event accumulations in excess of 250 mm are not particularly rare when the texas hill country is considered as a whole examining just the previous five years multiple storms along the balcones escarpment can be identified exceeding this threshold 9

authority eaa station were operating in the basin during the flood event fig 2 full stage hydrographs were recorded at an eaa station located mid basin upmost gauging station 675 km2 along with a usgs gauging station at the outlet usgs 08171350 1129 km2 partial discharge hydrographs were collected by the two interior usgs stations separated by a short distance in the lower portion of the basin usgs 08171300 kyle 1067 km2 usgs 08171000 wimberley 920 km2 both of the flow measuring gauges failed during the rising limb of the hydrograph fig 6 shows the data collected by the gauging stations the rainfall runoff data indicate a very rapid stream flow response with a steep sharp crested hydrograph measured in the middle portion of the basin at the eaa gauging location the river rose over 8 m in one hour lag times defined here as time difference between peak discharge and the time centroid of basin averaged rainfall were calculated for the two locations with full stage hydrographs rainfall for the seven hour maximum 1900 23 may 0200 24 may were clipped to the drainage areas of the gauging stations and we assumed a uniform hourly rainfall rate when calculating the time centroid of the basin s rainfall lag time at the upstream gauge was estimated at 5 5 h 15 min gauge reporting increment and 11 41 h at the watershed outlet 5 min gauge reporting increment the usgs estimated peak flows at the wimberley station usgs 08171000 using indirect slope area techniques peak discharge was estimated at 4955 m3 s with a stage estimate of 13 7 m making it the flood of record for this gauge with measurements dating back to the 1920s flow recurrence intervals were calculated at this station using the methods outlined by the usgs peakfq program flynn et al 2006 peakfq provides statistical flood frequency analysis of annual maximum peak flows following the log pearson type iii frequency distribution parameters of the frequency distribution are estimated from the logarithmic sample moments mean standard deviation and coefficient of skewness of the record of annual peak flows with adjustments for low outliers high outliers historic peaks and generalized peak skew supplementary fig a7 displays recurrence intervals for a given flow bracketed with 95 confidence intervals along with annual peak flows the recurrence intervals x axis correspond to the inverse of the exceedance probabilities calculated in accordance with the peakfq methodology flynn et al 2006 the curve displayed in the top panel includes the may 2015 peak flow in the calculations while the bottom panel omits the peak flow when the may 2015 peak flow is included in the dataset the recurrence interval for the may 2015 flood is 178 years when the curve is constructed without the may 2015 data point the usgs indirect estimate represents a recurrence interval of approximately 379 years it s worth noting the probable maximum flood for a basin this size in this region of texas is estimated at 17 000 m3 s 1 asquith and slade 1995 5 2 gssha simulations 5 2 1 model setup the may 2015 flood event was simulated with the gssha model downer and ogden 2004 and hydrological processes simulated included infiltration landscape retention 2 d overland flow and 1 d stream routing evapotranspiration and deep aquifer contributions were not included model preprocessing was conducted using arcgis and aquaveo s watershed modeling system emrl 2016 watershed terrain was constructed from usgs 10 m dems filled using the cleandam algorithm distributed with the gssha model the usgs gauging station at san marcos tx usgs 08171350 served as the outlet land use and land cover data were extracted from the national land cover dataset homer et al 2015 soils data were prepared from natural resources conservation service datasets soil survey 2013 along with maps from the eaa edwards aquifer authority 2015 defining the edwards aquifer recharge zone infiltration calculations were conducted using green and ampt with redistribution ogden and saghafian 1997 and initial saturated hydraulic conductivity values provided by rawls et al 1983 grid cells were assigned to one of 4 land use classes for retention and overland roughness parameterization as discussed in the introduction heavy rainfall in the months leading to the event left very moist soils initial soil moistures were set at 0 3 cm3 cm3 representing very moist conditions up to 80 volumetric water content stream channels were modeled using irregular cross sections for the main channel and large tributaries channel and floodplain geometry were extracted from a triangular irregular network constructed from the dem flood plain geometry was extracted with the channels allowing for control of floodplain simulation upland tributaries were modeled as a uniform trapezoidal profile reach specific manning s n values were assigned based on field observations 125 river sites visited and prior modeling experience in this region of texas sharif et al 2010a sharif et al 2010b sharif et al 2013 elhassan et al 2013 chintalapudi et al 2014 routing was calculated using the diffusive wave equation in 1d for streams and 2d for overland flow the model was run on a 150 m grid with a 1 min time step model performance was assessed using the commonly applied r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias measures moriasi et al 2007 5 2 2 model calibration and validation measured flow and stage iv precipitation data were collected for 6 storms for model calibration and validation flow performance was examined at the wimberley usgs gauge and is the primary focus of our analysis since indirect flow estimates are available the gssha model was calibrated to a single storm event occurring 17 18 november 2004 with the remaining 5 events used to validate the model calibration was performed manually with saturated hydraulic conductivity channel geometry channel roughness and overland roughness showing the most sensitivity table 2 shows calibrated surface parameters used in the final model run the calibration event produced peak flows of approximately one fifth of the may 2015 event at wimberley although other storms in the dataset produced peak flows greater than the calibration storm event it was chosen due to the spatial organization of the rainfall and antecedent conditions the 17 18 november 2004 storm was centered in the upper portion of the basin straddling the little blanco and upper blanco watersheds the may 2015 event contained very similar aerial rainfall coverage across the upper portion of the watershed the two october events producing the highest peak flows were centered just upstream of the wimberley stream gauge visual observations and high water mapping at approximately 125 river locations after the may 2015 event indicated complicated river hydraulics in the upper portion of the basin that would have significantly affected the floodwave essentially flood waters passed through a series of confining canyons and open flood plains between the towns of blanco and wimberley river stage from the may 2015 event varied by more than 8 m in this section of the river depending on the surrounding channel geometry furl unpublished data in addition to the spatial location of the rainfall the november 17 18 2004 event occurred at the tail end of significant rainfall across the area rain gauges in the neighboring basin to the north recorded rainfall in excess of 100 150 mm in the days leading up to the validation event lcra 2016 measured and simulated hydrographs at the wimberley gauge along with model performance statistics are shown in fig 7 and table 3 respectively the calibration event performed well with nse and r2 values 0 9 and pbias near 10 the model performed well for the 22 24 november 2004 event but overestimated volume for the remaining runs 31 october 2013 30 october 2015 08 09 september 2010 25 26 may 2013 the two worst performing validation events 08 09 september 2010 25 26 may 2013 significantly overestimated flows and were fairly low flow events compared to the calibration run overestimations of these events are likely related to antecedent soil moisture conditions which are discussed below 5 2 3 may 2015 simulation results from the may 2015 event simulation are shown in fig 8 the modeled floodwave presents itself as a sharp crested peak and appears similar to the stage hydrograph recorded at the eaa gauge upstream modeled peak flows at the wimberley gauge and basin outlet were 4780 m3s 1 and 4072 m3s 1 respectively simple percent error in peak flows between modeled values and the usgs indirect estimate were less than 5 runoff ratios were calculated for each of the 6 calibration validation events at the wimberley gauge in order to provide comparison with the may 2015 event table 4 the ratios were calculated from stage iv data clipped to the wimberley gauge watershed and measured flows from the gauging station the runoff volume from the may 2015 event were calculated from the gssha output in an attempt to standardize the calculations across events runoff volumes were calculated from the start of the rainfall event to 12 h past peak flows twelve hours past peak flows provided enough time for hydrographs to return to near baseflow runoff ratios ranged an order of magnitude across the events with nearly 10 or less of the rainfall volume exiting the basin for three events september 2010 may 2013 october 2015 and greater than 50 for three events 17 18 november 2004 23 24 november 2004 may 2015 the model was calibrated to one of the high runoff ratio events and model performance was best for other events with increased runoff ratios 23 24 november 2004 and october 2013 the runoff ratio for the may 2015 event was estimated at nearly 70 although this is likely an overestimation given the volume overestimations for some validation results model performance aside the wide ranging runoff ratios suggests antecedent conditions combined with spatiotemporal variations in rainfall play a large role in mediating stream response the october 2015 event occurred just months after the flood of record for the wimberley gauge and produced the eight highest peak flow 2010 m3 s 1 the event was centered just upstream of the wimberley gauge and the stage iv record indicated rainfall volume and rate very close to the may 2015 event fig 9 however much less water exited the basin with a runoff ratio approximately one fifth of the may 2015 estimate soil moisture data were examined from a probe located between wimberley and san marcos as part of the cosmos monitoring network freeman ranch site 57 zreda et al 2012 data were available for the four most recent storm events may 2013 october 2013 may 2015 october 2015 and 10 day antecedent soil moisture values are shown in supplementary fig a8 mean 10 day volumetric soil moisture preceding the may 2015 event was approximately 60 higher than the 10 day period leading up to the october 2013 and 2015 events and nearly double the may 2013 event streamflow volume from the may 2013 event was largely overestimated by the gssha model the effect of soil moisture on model runs was investigated by running the model under varying initial soil moisture conditions ranging from 0 1 0 3 cm3 cm3 representing volumetric soil moisture percentages from 25 to 80 data not shown the various model representations produced only modest changes to runoff volume and peak flow the lack of streamflow response to changes in initial soil moisture conditions is a major shortcoming in the gssha model setup however the model appears to perform reasonably well when antecedent soil moisture is high other researchers have documented the varying ability for storm events to produce runoff in the region in 2009 smith et al 2011 documented rainfall in excess of 200 mm with no appreciable flow response in downstream creeks in the onion creek drainage basin which borders the blanco to the north these results highlight the importance of antecedent conditions and difficulties in building robust hydrologic models that can respond to the soil condition extremes in addition to the heterogeneity of physical features across a basin and channel 6 rainfall transpositions there is much recent interest and research activity in the field of forecasting river flows using qpes or qpfs e g liechti et al 2013 including the recent launch of the united states national water model noaa nwc 2016 and opening of the national water center several numerical weather prediction models are presently available providing near term fine scale qpfs including the thunderstorm identification tracking analysis and nowcasting system dixon and wiener 1993 tracking radar echoes by correlation tuttle and foote 1990 and the high resolution rapid refresh model benjamin et al 2016 forecasting river flows with qpfs has the benefit of providing advanced lead time and some models have the ability to create ensemble forecasts however forecast skill is directly related to lead time and significant errors can arise when attempting to predict rainfall over small narrow drainages vivoni et al 2007 sharif et al 2006 this is particularly problematic in regions like the texas hill country where flood causing precipitation events are often highly localized qpes derived from radar and gauge networks have the ability to produce more reliable estimates e g multi radar multi sensor zhang et al 2016 but the maximum theoretical lead time is equal to the basin s time of concentrations in this section of the paper modest perturbations to the position of the storm centroid and intensity of rainfall are created to examine the sensitivity of peak discharge peak flow timing and runoff ratios as measured through the gssha model simulations at the wimberley gauge rainfall input to the model was varied by displacing the original stage iv grid in 2 km increments up to 24 km these displacements were done radially in 5 increments supplementary fig a9 shows the stage iv grid clipped to approximately 25 km in total 864 72 angular shifts 12 displacements gssha model runs were completed for the original storm additionally the same exercise was completed with a 0 8 and 1 2 multiplier herein referred to as 0 8 and 1 2 storms applied to the original precipitation amounts while the spatial shifts and factor adjustments are arbitrary they fall well within reasonable ranges of errors expected from qpfs and real time qpes with no gauge adjustments cunha et al 2013 bauer et al 2016 for a given storm duration and total amount of rainfall over a catchment the temporal and spatial distributions of the rainfall is controlled by how the storm moved over the catchment this will have a significant impact on the runoff response of the catchment and the characteristics of the outlet hydrograph singh 1998 ogden et al 1995 roberts and klingeman 1970 a storm moving over a catchment in the upstream direction will result in a hydrograph with a longer base time a rising limb with a gentler slope and a smaller peak flow 6 1 peak flows runoff ratios and peak timing peak flows from shifts of the original storm herein referred to as 1 0 storm ranged from 2082 to 4915 m3 s 1 peak discharge from the 1 0 storm with no spatial shift was in the 90th percentile of all 1 0 peak flows the highest peak discharges from the 1 0 storm typically occurred with 25 50 angular shifts and 4 8 km displacements fig 10 moving the storm downstream results in attenuated peak flows an example is provided in supplementary fig a9b by moving the storm along the 340 axis a distance of 16 km in this scenario we preserve total volume of rainfall above the wimberley gauge 1 difference but move the epicenter off of the headlands to near the confluence of the rivers peak flow at the wimberley gauge in this scenario is 25 lower 3531 m3 s 1 than the original storm runoff ratios remain nearly identical between the scenarios which is not unexpected given the low hydraulic conductivity values of the soils and moist conditions the effect is similar to having a storm move in the upstream direction rather than downstream e g ogden et al 1995 the physical mechanisms responsible for the large difference in hydrograph shape likely results from the steep topography in the uplands and differences in the uplands stream network seo 2012 demonstrated that efficient flow networks are much more sensitive to spatial characteristics of a storm maximum flows in the catchment were very sensitive to distance displaced at other angles as well at 10 km displacements all angles flows ranged from 3994 to 4873 and at 20 km displacements the range increased to 2469 4418 fig a10 stated another way displacing the storm 20 km the flow recurrence intervals ranged from 34 to 226 years this in part owes to the narrow shape of the drainage spatial structure of the storm and other surface features such as channel morphology and spatial distribution of soils the timing of peak flows spanned over 5 h for the 1 0 storm with the median time very near the actual peak 5 min peak flow response to the 0 8 and 1 2 multipliers showed a similar response in terms of storm configuration resulting in minimum and maximum responses however there was a non linear response to the linear adjustments made in the precipitation field twenty percent changes in precipitation resulted in approximately 30 changes in median minimum and maximum peak flows for the 0 8 and 1 2 storms runoff ratios for the 1 0 storm ranged from 0 61 to 0 74 including the 0 8 and 1 2 datasets runoff ratios ranged from 0 56 0 77 while not as wide ranging as the runoff ratios recorded from the six additional storms assessed during model calibration and validation a maximum difference of 21 highlights the importance of storm location motion precipitation amount and distributed soil properties across the basin singh 1998 ogden et al 1995 roberts and klingeman 1970 visualization of flood forecasts is often performed by displaying an ensemble of hydrographs produced by model output forced by various precipitation forecasts ideally the observed peak discharge will be enveloped by the members creating the ensemble forecast fig 11 shows a hydrograph ensemble of gssha output for the undisplaced storms 0 8 1 0 1 2 along with the maximum and minimum peak flows and peak timings for each of the three categories the ensemble shows a range of shapes from a single peak to a bimodal distribution peak flows in the ensemble had a maximum difference of nearly 5000 m3 s 1 peak timings had a range of over six hours this exercise highlights the difficulty in creating useful flood ensembles in small medium sized basins from forecasted precipitation 7 conclusions there are three principal conclusions from the work while the synoptic characteristics of intense convective precipitation have been known for decades and the mescoscale characteristics since the mid 1990s the advent of high resolution rapid assimilation and model refresh e g the hrrr dual polarization of the wsr 88d network and high spatial resolution and frequent reporting automated raingauges offers the prospect of short range high quality qpf qpe for input into hydrologic models but as shown here even small displacement of qpf qpe can result in significant differences in hydrograph of resulting flood waves while rainfall amounts from the event were impressive accumulations from the storm were not uncharacteristic for high magnitude events across the texas hill country however the rainfall was able to produce an uncharacteristically large and deadly flood the entire region had received record to near record precipitation amounts in the months leading up to the flood this led to saturated soils and creeks streams and rivers primed for maximum rainfall runoff analysis of the additional storm events used for hydrological model calibration and validation indicated a wide range of runoff ratios runoff ratios for the may 2015 event estimated from the gssha model were much larger 0 7 than other storms examined rainfall from the event began directly over the headwaters of the basin and were able to remain stationary for many hours when the most intense rain cells began to move off the headwaters the entire mesoscale convective system moved slowly downstream analysis of model iterations of the transposed rainfall fields suggests storm location and motion played a significant role in the peak flows when the intense headwater cells were started over the middle portion of the basin peak flows were greatly attenuated while volume of runoff remained similar acknowledgements this work was partially funded by us army corps of engineers engineer

show the potential transferability of gdd based coefficients across different locations and climatic conditions keywords actual evapotranspiration canadian prairies crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key component of the hydrological cycle due to the vital role it plays in energy moisture exchanges between the earth and the atmosphere it is a combined process where water is lost from the soil surface through evaporative processes as well as water transpired through growth and temperature regulation processes of plants since more than 99 of the water taken by plants is lost through transpiration lambers et al 2008 et is often used to determine crop water requirement as part of regional water resource planning and management exercises however despite numerous methods available for its measurement and calculation obtaining accurate estimates of et remains challenging amatya et al 2016 direct measurements of et include weighing lysimeters and eddy covariance methods these techniques can be difficult to successfully employ and expensive to install maintain and operate allen et al 1998 shi et al 2008 gebler et al 2015 high costs and time consuming tasks associated with these methods make them unsuitable for routine measurements allen et al 1998 however they remain useful for the evaluation of et estimated from indirect methods such as the residual energy balance halldin and lindroth 1992 bowen ratio energy balance breb bowen 1926 angus and watts 1984 soil water balance ritchie 1985 and other predictive mathematical models see also rana and katerji 2000 for more details rates of evapotranspiration are determined through various climatic factors that describe the energy available to evaporate water e g radiation and temperature and those that affect the movement of the evaporated water away from the evaporating surface e g wind speed and humidity thus when field et measurements are not available mathematical models built around those factors are employed to estimate et using climate and land surface data a common approach to simulate crop et etc is the crop coefficient technique presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 with this approach etc is estimated using the average et of a reference crop eto etr in this study and an adjusting crop coefficient kc for the crop grown the effect of climate on et is reflected by the etr while the effect of crop growth and development is given by the coefficient kc the kc values are derived from measured crop characteristics and thus vary throughout the season in correspondence to the growth stage of the crop crop coefficient curves can be developed as a function of time irmak et al 2013b reddy et al 2015 plant growth stage allen et al 1998 piccinni et al 2009 thermal unit or growing degree days gdd irmak et al 2013a alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b and leaf area index or canopy cover irmak et al 2013b while irmak et al 2013b found that different base scales show no significant differences when predicting crop coefficients for soybeans in nebraska other studies suggested that gdd based crop coefficients should be transferable to other locations with different climatic conditions with an assumption that differences in plant development characteristics are related mainly to temperature sammis et al 1985 irmak et al 2013a the etr estimate on the other hand is independent of crop type and management practices as it only accounts for climate effects it is defined as the et rate from a reference surface of a uniform and actively growing vegetation not short of water and having specified height and surface resistance asce 2005 the two standards for reference evapotranspiration are 1 a short crop with an approximate height of 0 12 m and a daily surface resistance of 70 s m similar to clipped grass and 2 a tall crop with an approximate height of 0 5 m and a daily surface resistance of 45 s m similar to full cover

equations radiation based models e g makkink priestley taylor and turc equations mass transfer based models e g rohwer and trabert mahringer equations and combinations of the above modeling approaches e g penman monteith kimberly penman and penman monteith equations due to the differences in assumptions data requirements and climatic conditions in which these etr models were developed they may result in inconsistent values grismer et al 2002 lu et al 2005 thus several studies attempted to calibrate and validate these models under local conditions most of these studies e g alexandris et al 2008 bogawski and bednorz 2014 djaman et al 2015 calibrated and validated these models against the penman monteith equation which is the globally recognized and accepted standard equation for estimating etr allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation requires detailed climatic parameters that are not always available in historical weather station records e g relative humidity wind speed incoming solar radiation in canada although relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation are now being routinely measured by many canadian weather stations only humidity and wind speed data are readily available across the country solar radiation measurements have been made by provincial agricultural weather networks in alberta alberta agriculture and forestry 2017a and manitoba manitoba agriculture 2017 over the past decade or so which has recently increased the availability of this important parameter for modeling et in those specific regions of canada however it may not be advisable to validate et models using another model as other studies xu and singh 2005 guo et al 2017 indicated that different etr models including the widely accepted penman monteith model perform differently in different climatic conditions also when validation is done against measured crop et correction factors for crop characteristics and water availability have to be applied a number of studies have attempted to validate etr models for the different climatic and agricultural conditions in canada de jong and tugwood 1987 compared different etr models for locations across the country and evaluated models against class a pan evaporation data though the authors also estimated actual etc they did not compare the results to measure etc more recently maulé et al 2006 developed etr models for the agricultural conditions of the canadian prairies using regression against the penman monteith equation but also did not validate model outputs against measured data xing et al 2008 compared the accuracy of three etr models i e penman monteith priestley taylor and penman equations in estimating et from a non irrigated potato crop field in new brunswick using breb data however there might have been a bias in the comparison as different kc values were employed for the different models moreover etc estimates which were not adjusted for water availability were compared to actual measurements which might have been influenced by soil moisture content gervais et al 2012 compared two etr models i e penman monteith model and second generation prairie agrometeorological model pamii for their performance in estimating et from various sites in saskatchewan and manitoba although actual etc estimates were used for comparison they were compared to etc measured indirectly from the difference between the change in soil moisture storage and precipitation soil water balance method with an assumption that runoff and deep drainage were negligible brimelow et al 2010 however evaluated the ability of the pamii to simulate actual daily et against eddy covariance measurements at a grassland and a cropland site in southern alberta in that study the authors found that the model underestimated et i e significant negative bias in both ecosystems brimelow et al 2010 which underscores the need for further et model comparisons with actual et measurements on the canadian prairies for model and technique refinement further as the canadian prairies or the northern great plains in general are vast it is important to have more studies from different locations comparing models to measurements this study was conducted to 1 qualitatively and quantitatively compare a selection of etr models and assess their ability to estimate et from annual crops in the canadian prairies with respect to accuracy in comparison to measured etc and 2 assess the applicability and transferability of gdd based crop coefficients to the climatic conditions of the canadian prairies 2 methodology 2 1 study sites and measurements this study was carried out at two experimental sites in southwestern manitoba canada fig 1 as part of a larger multi year study investigating the water carbon nitrogen and phosphorus balance components of contrasting cropping systems in the area the sites are characterized by semi arid to sub humid climatic conditions the 30 year 1981 2010 normal mean temperature and relative humidity around brandon manitoba is 13 1 c and 69 4 respectively with mean precipitation of 353 mm from may to october environment canada 2016 the first site was an annual crop production field on a private organic farm situated 50 km northwest of brandon manitoba latitude 50 01 16 n longitude 100 34 26 w elevation 477 m it was sown with millet and hemp in june of 2013 and 2014 respectively and with fall rye in september 2014 extreme rainfall events that occurred in late june and early july of 2014 at the site destroyed the hemp crop thus the data for the 2014 growing season was excluded from this analysis the second site was a conventional crop production field at the canada manitoba crop diversification centre carberry located approximately 45 km east of brandon manitoba latitude 49 54 22 n longitude 99 20 49 w elevation 382 m this site was planted with soybean spring wheat and canola in the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively the soils at the two sites have clay loam surface textures and were classified as black chernozem according to the canadian system of soil classification the soil water retention parameters i e field capacity and wilting point used for the organic site were taken from the soil measurement data see del grosso et al 2011 as there were no better data available for this site table 1 the field capacity of each layer layer depths based on canadian soil information service cansis data and within the upper 1 m depth soil profile was assumed to be the maximum soil water content measured after a rain just when soil water started draining to the next lower layer which can be observed from the fluctuations in soil moisture content depth profiles the field capacity of the last layer in the 1 m profile was determined when there was drainage water collected in a lysimeter g2 drain gauge decagon devices inc pullman usa installed at the 0 5 m to 1 2 m depth the wilting point of each layer layer depths from cansis data and also within 1 m depth soil profile was chosen as the lowest soil moisture content observed after a long period 2 weeks without a significant amount of rain 3 mm for the conventional site the field capacity and wilting point used were taken from a soil survey conducted for the site mills and haluschak 1995 the other soil hydraulic parameters i e saturation and saturated hydraulic conductivity used for the two sites were estimated using the soil plant air water spaw model saxton 2009 and the soil physical characteristics from cansis as inputs to the spaw

calibration device model fcd hyquest solutions pty ltd warwick farm australia either annually or every second year in the early spring and were sent for factory calibration at the end of the study during winter 2015 2016 the solar radiation data from both sites were evaluated against theoretical clear sky values for the latitude elevation and other conditions for each site following asce 2005

were measured indirectly using the residual energy balance reb technique amiro 2009 bawazir et al 2014 previous studies conducted in canadian boreal forest sites amiro 2009 indicated that reb et measurements agree well with the eddy covariance technique on daily weekly and seasonal scales data from the organic site in the present study has also shown excellent agreement between reb et

a moving window approach where fits of 240 observations at a time were incrementally solved in steps of 48 points for the half hour datasets from each of the sites amiro 2009 eichelmann et al 2016 for periods where available energy rn g was calculated to be less than zero le was forced to zero amiro 2009 daily etc was calculated by dividing the daily le sums by the latent heat of vaporization for

models i e fao56 penman monteith and maulé et al models three radiation based models i e priestley taylor makkink and turc models and three temperature based models i e blaney criddle hargreaves samani and hamon models descriptions of the eight models are found in the appendix a in supplementary file 2 3 simulation of crop evapotranspiration the daily etc was estimated using the crop coefficient approach presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 which is expressed as 2 e t c k c e t r where etc is in mm d and kc is dimensionless the kc used in this study was a fourth order function of the cumulative gdd given in the form alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b 3 k c a b x c x 2 d x 3 e x 4 where x is the cumulative gdd and a b c d and e are coefficients specific to the crop grown growing degree days were estimated using the equation 4 g d d t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where tbase is the base temperature c below which crop growth ceases the reported base temperatures for most crops range from 0 c to 10 c de beurs and henebry 2010 the base temperature used in this study was 5 c assumed to be a reasonable base temperature for all crops at these study sites gordon and bootsma 1993 alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b since other studies sammis et al 1985 irmak et al 2013a suggested the potential transferability of gdd based kc to different locations with different climatic conditions assuming that temperature is the main factor affecting plant development characteristics gdd based kc were used in this study two sets of kc values were employed in this study table 3 in the first set the kc for spring wheat canola and fall rye were adopted from aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b while values for millet and soybean were derived for this study the derivation for millet and soybean kc values used the growth stage based crop coefficients and crop development stages presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 and the daily normal temperature of beaver city nebraska usa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2016 beaver city was chosen to represent the climatic region where these crop parameters would generally be applicable allen et al 1998 the crop coefficients used in aimm were derived using the breb method and the data for each crop were collected for two years in southern alberta canada harms personal communication while the base data for the fao56 crop coefficients were obtained from across the world the second set of kc were the coefficients of the best fit fourth order polynomial curve for the ratio of observed etc to the product of etr estimated from the penman montieth model and ks estimated from measured soil moisture content kc etc obs etr pm ks ks is defined in the succeeding section we are aware however that comparing observed etc to the etc estimates using this second set of kc would have a bias yet this was done for comparison purposes for method consistency the aimm crop coefficients that are based on alfalfa as the reference crop alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b were converted to grass based coefficients eq 5 allen et al 1998 5 k c g r a s s k r a t i o k c a l f a l f a where kratio is 1 05 for humid and calm conditions 1 20 for arid and moderately windy conditions and 1 35 for arid and windy conditions allen et al 1998 accordingly the value chosen for the study sites was 1 20 2 4 soil moisture considerations for actual crop evapotranspiration as mentioned earlier crops may experience various levels of moisture stress through their growth stages thus a dimensionless soil moisture stress coefficient ks was introduced to eq 2 to account for the available water in the root zone 6 e t c a k s k c e t r where etca is the actual etc which is the crop evapotranspiration rate mm d corrected for the availability of water in the root zone soil moisture stress coefficient was estimated as a logarithmic function of the actual available water aw and the total available water taw alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b 7 k s l o g a w t a w 100 1 log 101 where values for ks could range from 0 maximum water stress to 1 minimum or no water stress in this current study the minimum value for ks was set at 0 1 similar to what is applied in aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b total available water is defined as the amount of water available to plants at field capacity and was estimated as the difference between field capacity fc and wilting point wp 8 taw fc wp similarly aw was calculated as 9 aw sw wp where sw mm is the actual soil water content in the root zone the daily sw was estimated using the water balance approach 10 sw t sw t 1 p et ca ro dp where p is precipitation mm ro is surface runoff mm and dp is the soil water that exceeds field capacity and thus percolates downward out of the root zone mm on day t runoff was estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure scs 1972 it should be noted that no irrigation was applied to both fields during the period considered in this study 2 5 statistical analysis statistical approaches were used to quantitatively assess the performance of the models by comparing the measured etc fluxes against simulated actual etc fluxes the statistical measures implemented include nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean

values respectively n is the number of observations and the overbar indicates mean value the indices rmse mae and mre summarize the mean difference between measured and predicted values and the smaller the difference the better is the agreement between measured and predicted results the value of nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 0 where higher values indicate better agreement a value of 0 for nse indicates that the observed mean is as good as the model prediction while negative values indicate that the observed mean is better than the model prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of measurement results the mean temperatures and relative humidity at the two sites were comparable to growing season normals 1981 2010 except in 2015 which was relatively warmer table 4 the wind speeds were slightly lower than the height adjusted normal value of 3 0 m s there may have been a bias caused by the measurement height correction itself or real differences in the surface roughness characteristics upwind of the cropland site weather stations the seasonal precipitation values at the sites were generally higher than the normal except for 2015 at the organic farm which was slightly lower than normal for the area table 4 the 2014 and 2013 growing seasons were the wettest during the study for the organic and conventional sites respectively with 108 114 mm exceeding the normal the normal solar radiation and etr values for the area were not available however the values for both sites compared well with each other the measured daily etc was found to have positive correlations with solar and net radiation maximum and minimum temperature vapour pressure deficit and maximum relative humidity and negative correlations with minimum relative humidity and wind speed table 5 higher correlations were obtained from radiation net and solar radiation and temperature maximum and minimum temperature which also agreed with the results obtained from the best fit curve regressions fig 2 this verifies that the measured etc at the study sites was mostly driven by the energy available to evaporate water e g radiation and temperature and less so by the factors that removed water vapour from the vegetation surfaces e g relative humidity and wind speed as has been observed by other studies priestley and taylor 1972 wang et al 2007 shi et al 2008 yang et al 2014 it is surprising that et had a negative relationship with wind speed however other studies el bably 2003 also found similar result the seasonal etc of the crops cumulative etc for the entire growing period grown in southwestern manitoba for this study was generally comparable to those published in the literature table 6 literature values of growing season water use for fall rye and canola tended to be lower than those measured in the current study table 6 however the former studies were conducted in parts of saskatchewan which have a more arid climate the published values for soybean et were higher than what were obtained in the current study particularly for fields under irrigation table 6 however those studies were conducted with longer season soybean cultivars under a warmer and wetter climate nebraska than southern manitoba in the current study soybean had the largest etc table 6 which also had the longest growing period 143 days and millet had the lowest etc which also had the shortest growing period 80 days 3 2 etr models comparison using the fao56 penman monteith equation as the benchmark errors mre in the etr estimates by the other seven models ranged from 11 to 34 with the maulé et al equation producing the least error and the blaney criddle model providing the largest table 7 the maulé et al equation which accounts for the effects of radiation humidity and wind speed showed the best fit probably because it was developed using climate data from the canadian prairies the 0 87 nse value obtained in this study was comparable to the 0 93 value obtained by maulé et al 2006 for their equation against the penman monteith equation de jong and tugwood 1987 obtained errors up to 20 by the penman monteith equation and up to 25 by the priestley taylor equation against adjusted class a pan data collected from eight weather stations across canada under a semi arid climate in iran tabari 2010 found errors up to 37 by various models i e turc priestley taylor makkink and hargreaves samani against the penman monteith equation with the hargreaves samani model providing the best fit when contrasted against the penman monteith equation the priestley taylor nse of 0 96 and hargreaves samani nse of 0 97 models were found to work best in a semi arid region in china gao et al 2017 in this current study the hargreaves samani model ranked fourth among the seven models with a nse value of 0 70 18 error which is comparable to the 0 74 obtained by maulé et al 2006 the relatively good performance of the hargreaves samani model in comparison to the penman monteith model for the semi arid to sub humid climate of the canadian prairies would be important particularly for those weather stations that have temperature measurement only 3 3 simulated actual crop evapotranspiration as similar kc and ks values were applied across all the models variations among the actual etc estimates would be due only to the etr inputs from the different models comparison of daily simulated actual etc from the different etr models and using the first set of kc against observed etc produced errors mre ranging from 23 to 68 with the makkink model having the least error and the blaney criddle model providing the largest error table 8 the other statistical indices nse rmse and mae however show the best fit of the turc model overall on a daily basis the turc model produced the smallest error rmse among the eight models followed by the makkink priestley taylor and penman monteith models this indicates that simpler models such as the makkink and turc models can provide estimates comparable to those of the penman monteith model for the crops and agroclimatic conditions at the sites the better performance of the radiation based models agrees with the high correlation found between measured etc and radiation table 5 fig 2 when compared against the penman monteith equation tabari 2010 found the turc model as the best model rmse 0 284 1 106 mm day in estimating et in cold humid and arid climates similar to the climates under which the model was developed however it was also found to perform well for the semi arid climate of southern greece xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 and the sub humid climate of kharagpur india rmse ranging from 0 39 to 0 53 mm day srivastava et al 2016 although the makkink model was developed under temperate humid conditions schneider et al 2007 also found it to give accurate estimates for et rmse 0 59 0 69 mm day in a semi arid region of northern china on a seasonal scale all the eight models resulted in relatively smaller errors as uncertainties tended to balance out on longer time scales however the temperature based hargreaves samani and blaney criddle models produced the least errors fig 3 the daily overestimates by the blaney criddle model were compensated by daily underestimates which were more evident throughout the growth period of the millet fig 4 a and spring wheat fig 4d crops hence it provided similar seasonal totals fig 3 although the hargreaves samani and blaney criddle models performed well on longer time scales more studies are required to better understand the differences on the performance of these models under different time scales and to verify if this would hold under other conditions and crops results from the etc comparison table 8 were slightly different from those of the etr comparisons table 7 except for the turc model which showed good performance in both analyses the equation developed by maulé et al 2006 which provided the most accurate estimates for the penman monteith equation table 7 did not perform any better than the radiation based models i e turc makkink and priestley taylor models table 8 the differences observed in the outcomes could be caused by a number of reasons first validating a model with another model may not always be preferable as mentioned earlier although the penman monteith model is the widely accepted standard procedure for et calculation and has shown to be the most accurate etr model in many studies it can sometimes be outperformed by other models douglas et al 2009 found the et estimates of the priestley taylor and turc equations more accurate than those of the penman monteith model the older version when compared against eddy covariance and bowen ratio data collected over a variety of land cover types in florida in addition the hargreaves samani and makkink equations were also found to perform better than the penman monteith equation when actual etc estimates from the soil and water assessment tool swat using these models were compared to eddy flux measurements collected in a semi arid watershed area in northern china schneider et al 2007 a second reason is that inaccuracies in the actual etc estimates are also affected by the discrepancies in kc and ks values thus the larger errors observed in the etc comparisons table 8 were probably due to the errors in the kc and ks estimates when actual etc values were estimated using the second set of kc kc etc obs etr pm ks errors were smaller and most other statistical indicators of model performance were substantially improved table 9 compared to those obtained using the first set of kc table 8 this difference was expected as the second set of kc values was based on trends in the actual et observations made at the study sites however both kc approaches produced similar model ranking results with the turc model providing the best fit and the blaney criddle model giving the poorest estimate which could indicate the transferability of gdd based kc though more studies are needed to further investigate this while the accuracy of the ks values could also affect the actual etc estimates given that soil properties were not varied in both comparisons tables 8 and 9 and that both used similar etr inputs any differences similarities in the outputs of both analyses could only be due to the kc values the relatively large errors obtained using both sets of kc values tables 8 and 9 might be a reflection of the limited amount of measurement data used in their derivation the one year data used for the derivation of the second set of kc the two year data for aimm kc and the climate normal used in the derivation for millet and soybean kc might not have been sufficient to establish accurate kc the discrepancies in the first set of kc values can also be seen in the inconsistencies between measured and modeled actual etc observed after planting and before harvest fig 4 these differences would increase if precipitation amounts would differ from the setting from which the crop coefficients were developed since the first set of crop coefficients used in this study take into account the combined effects of evaporation and transpiration the variation in evaporation rates particularly during the start and towards the end of the growing period where evaporation is dominant might not have been fully accounted for in the coefficients for example prior to planting the proso millet crop on june 25 2013 the organic site received 60 mm of rainfall over june 22 and 23 as well as an additional 36 mm from june 25 to june 26 following seeding this precipitation 96 mm total around the seeding of the crop evidently lead to high rates of evaporation under the conducive thermal and radiative regimes of late june and early july that were not captured by the crop coefficient used fig 4a correction factors could probably help rectify this problem however there is none available yet in the literature for gdd based crop coefficients for growth stage based coefficients fao56 outlines a method to correct the crop coefficient for the initial stage however it seems difficult to adapt this approach to the gdd based coefficients as length of growth stages varies with heat units it is also worth mentioning that the kc for fall rye in both sets were derived using data collected from may 1st until harvest the same year only however the derived kc was applied to the entire growth period mid september to mid august the following year this means that the kc for fall rye was derived using a portion only of its total growth period this limitation might have caused the discrepancy between modeled and observed etc towards the end of its growth period fig 4b 4 summary and conclusions the mean temperatures and relative humidity at the two sites compared well with the growing season normals 1981 2010 except in 2015 which was relatively warmer the growing season precipitation totals at the measurement sites were generally higher than the normal with 2014 and 2013 being the wettest during the study for the organic and conventional fields respectively correlations between measured etc at the sites and climate variables indicated that et during the study period was mostly driven by the energy available to evaporate water e g radiation and temperature and less so by the factors that removed water vapour from the vegetation surfaces e g relative humidity and wind speed the seasonal cumulative etc of the crops grown in southwestern manitoba for this study fell within the expected range of previously published values comparison of the seven models against the fao56 penman monteith equation showed the maulé et al equation as the best alternative to the penman monteith equation for estimating reference et in the study sites however results were different when actual etc estimated using the eight models including the penman monteith equation were evaluated against measured etc applying two sets of kc values which were derived using data from different locations and climatic environmental conditions showed the turc model as the most accurate and the blaney criddle model as the least accurate on a daily time scale the comparability of the model ranking results from the two sets of kc could indicate the transferability of gdd based kc to various locations and climatic conditions however more studies are needed to further investigate this the errors obtained in this study were contributed not only by the approaches and meteorological parameters accounted for by the etr models but also by the inaccuracies of the kc values as a result of limited data used in their derivation further as the gdd based kc did not account separately for the evaporation and transpiration components larger errors were observed after planting and prior to harvest when evaporation was the dominant process discrepancies became more pronounced when there were more rainfall events correction factors could probably help rectify this problem however there is none available yet in the literature for gdd based kc separate accounting for evaporation and transpiration could also help address this issue however additional data is needed to develop the method in general the radiation based models performed better than the temperature based models on a daily time step however further studies on longer time scales are needed to assess the relevance of the temperature based hargreaves samani and blaney criddle models for calculation of et in the canadian prairies as they may be important for locations having temperature measurement only results of this study provide additional insights on which models to consider that could give accurate et estimates in the canadian prairies accurate et models are important components in estimating regional water balances for efficient water resources planning and management and for better understanding of environmental impacts of water use in agriculture this study also shows the potential transferability of gdd based kc across different locations and climatic conditions however more studies with validated gdd based kc are needed to further investigate this finding as it was found that kc coefficients derived using data collected from the study sites produced better fit it is recommended to collect more data in the region to establish more accurate gdd based kc if reliable gdd based kc for various crops were made available and their application to various locations and climatic conditions were proven meaningful by more studies then crop water use calculations in various related applications would be fairly straightforward conflict of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of

8527,study region this study was carried out in southwestern manitoba in the prairie region of canada study focus mathematical models are routinely used to estimate evapotranspiration et when measurements are lacking this study was conducted to select the most relevant models for estimating et in the canadian prairies eight reference et models i e penman monteith priestley taylor makkink turc maulé et al blaney criddle hargreaves samani and hamon models were evaluated this study also assessed the applicability and transferability of the growing degree day gdd based crop coefficients for estimating crop et in the canadian prairies new hydrological insights the equation developed by maulé et al 2006 was found to be the best reference et alternative to the penman monteith equation with a mean relative error of 11 however when models were validated against measured crop et the simpler radiation based turc and makkink models were found to be the most useful models with daily mean relative errors ranging from 16 to 49 outperforming the widely accepted penman monteith model discrepancies in the gdd based crop coefficients were found to also contribute to errors however results show the potential transferability of gdd based coefficients across different locations and climatic conditions keywords actual evapotranspiration canadian prairies crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key component of the hydrological cycle due to the vital role it plays in energy moisture exchanges between the earth and the atmosphere it is a combined process where water is lost from the soil surface through evaporative processes as well as water transpired through growth and temperature regulation processes of plants since more than 99 of the water taken by plants is lost through transpiration lambers et al 2008 et is often used to determine crop water requirement as part of regional water resource planning and management exercises however despite numerous methods available for its measurement and calculation obtaining accurate estimates of et remains challenging amatya et al 2016 direct measurements of et include weighing lysimeters and eddy covariance methods these techniques can be difficult to successfully employ and expensive to install maintain and operate allen et al 1998 shi et al 2008 gebler et al 2015 high costs and time consuming tasks associated with these methods make them unsuitable for routine measurements allen et al 1998 however they remain useful for the evaluation of et estimated from indirect methods such as the residual energy balance halldin and lindroth 1992 bowen ratio energy balance breb bowen 1926 angus and watts 1984 soil water balance ritchie 1985 and other predictive mathematical models see also rana and katerji 2000 for more details rates of evapotranspiration are determined through various climatic factors that describe the energy available to evaporate water e g radiation and temperature and those that affect the movement of the evaporated water away from the evaporating surface e g wind speed and humidity thus when field et measurements are not available mathematical models built around those factors are employed to estimate et using climate and land surface data a common approach to simulate crop et etc is the crop coefficient technique presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 with this approach etc is estimated using the average et of a reference crop eto etr in this study and an adjusting crop coefficient kc for the crop grown the effect of climate on et is reflected by the etr while the effect of crop growth and development is given by the coefficient kc the kc values are derived from measured crop characteristics and thus vary throughout the season in correspondence to the growth stage of the crop crop coefficient curves can be developed as a function of time irmak et al 2013b reddy et al 2015 plant growth stage allen et al 1998 piccinni et al 2009 thermal unit or growing degree days gdd irmak et al 2013a alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b and leaf area index or canopy cover irmak et al 2013b while irmak et al 2013b found that different base scales show no significant differences when predicting crop coefficients for soybeans in nebraska other studies suggested that gdd based crop coefficients should be transferable to other locations with different climatic conditions with an assumption that differences in plant development characteristics are related mainly to temperature sammis et al 1985 irmak et al 2013a the etr estimate on the other hand is independent of crop type and management practices as it only accounts for climate effects it is defined as the et rate from a reference surface of a uniform and actively growing vegetation not short of water and having specified height and surface resistance asce 2005 the two standards for reference evapotranspiration are 1 a short crop with an approximate height of 0 12 m and a daily surface resistance of 70 s m similar to clipped grass and 2 a tall crop with an approximate height of 0 5 m and a daily surface resistance of 45 s m similar to full cover alfalfa asce 2005 reference evapotranspiration models can be generally categorized into temperature based models e g blaney criddle hargreaves samani hamon thornthwaite baier robertson and linacre equations radiation based models e g makkink priestley taylor and turc equations mass transfer based models e g rohwer and trabert mahringer equations and combinations of the above modeling approaches e g penman monteith kimberly penman and penman monteith equations due to the differences in assumptions data requirements and climatic conditions in which these etr models were developed they may result in inconsistent values grismer et al 2002 lu et al 2005 thus several studies attempted to calibrate and validate these models under local conditions most of these studies e g alexandris et al 2008 bogawski and bednorz 2014 djaman et al 2015 calibrated and validated these models against the penman monteith equation which is the globally recognized and accepted standard equation for estimating etr allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation requires detailed climatic parameters that are not always available in historical weather station records e g relative humidity wind speed incoming solar radiation in canada although relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation are now being routinely measured by many canadian weather stations only humidity and wind speed data are readily available across the country solar radiation measurements have been made by provincial agricultural weather networks in alberta alberta agriculture and forestry 2017a and manitoba manitoba agriculture 2017 over the past decade or so which has recently increased the availability of this important parameter for modeling et in those specific regions of canada however it may not be advisable to validate et models using another model as other studies xu and singh 2005 guo et al 2017 indicated that different etr models including the widely accepted penman monteith model perform differently in different climatic conditions also when validation is done against measured crop et correction factors for crop characteristics and water availability have to be applied a number of studies have attempted to validate etr models for the different climatic and agricultural conditions in canada de jong and tugwood 1987 compared different etr models for locations across the country and evaluated models against class a pan evaporation data though the authors also estimated actual etc they did not compare the results to measure etc more recently maulé et al 2006 developed etr models for the agricultural conditions of the canadian prairies using regression against the penman monteith equation but also did not validate model outputs against measured data xing et al 2008 compared the accuracy of three etr models i e penman monteith priestley taylor and penman equations in estimating et from a non irrigated potato crop field in new brunswick using breb data however there might have been a bias in the comparison as different kc values were employed for the different models moreover etc estimates which were not adjusted for water availability were compared to actual measurements which might have been influenced by soil moisture content gervais et al 2012 compared two etr models i e penman monteith model and second generation prairie agrometeorological model pamii for their performance in estimating et from various sites in saskatchewan and manitoba although actual etc estimates were used for comparison they were compared to etc measured indirectly from the difference between the change in soil moisture storage and precipitation soil water balance method with an assumption that runoff and deep drainage were negligible brimelow et al 2010 however evaluated the ability of the pamii to simulate actual daily et against eddy covariance measurements at a grassland and a cropland site in southern alberta in that study the authors found that the model underestimated et i e significant negative bias in both ecosystems brimelow et al 2010 which underscores the need for further et model comparisons with actual et measurements on the canadian prairies for model and technique refinement further as the canadian prairies or the northern great plains in general are vast it is important to have more studies from different locations comparing models to measurements this study was conducted to 1 qualitatively and quantitatively compare a selection of etr models and assess their ability to estimate et from annual crops in the canadian prairies with respect to accuracy in comparison to measured etc and 2 assess the applicability and transferability of gdd based crop coefficients to the climatic conditions of the canadian prairies 2 methodology 2 1 study sites and measurements this study was carried out at two experimental sites in southwestern manitoba canada fig 1 as part of a larger multi year study investigating the water carbon nitrogen and phosphorus balance components of contrasting cropping systems in the area the sites are characterized by semi arid to sub humid climatic conditions the 30 year 1981 2010 normal mean temperature and relative humidity around brandon manitoba is 13 1 c and 69 4 respectively with mean precipitation of 353 mm from may to october environment canada 2016 the first site was an annual crop production field on a private organic farm situated 50 km northwest of brandon manitoba latitude 50 01 16 n longitude 100 34 26 w elevation 477 m it was sown with millet and hemp in june of 2013 and 2014 respectively and with fall rye in september 2014 extreme rainfall events that occurred in late june and early july of 2014 at the site destroyed the hemp crop thus the data for the 2014 growing season was excluded from this analysis the second site was a conventional crop production field at the canada manitoba crop diversification centre carberry located approximately 45 km east of brandon manitoba latitude 49 54 22 n longitude 99 20 49 w elevation 382 m this site was planted with soybean spring wheat and canola in the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons respectively the soils at the two sites have clay loam surface textures and were classified as black chernozem according to the canadian system of soil classification the soil water retention parameters i e field capacity and wilting point used for the organic site were taken from the soil measurement data see del grosso et al 2011 as there were no better data available for this site table 1 the field capacity of each layer layer depths based on canadian soil information service cansis data and within the upper 1 m depth soil profile was assumed to be the maximum soil water content measured after a rain just when soil water started draining to the next lower layer which can be observed from the fluctuations in soil moisture content depth profiles the field capacity of the last layer in the 1 m profile was determined when there was drainage water collected in a lysimeter g2 drain gauge decagon devices inc pullman usa installed at the 0 5 m to 1 2 m depth the wilting point of each layer layer depths from cansis data and also within 1 m depth soil profile was chosen as the lowest soil moisture content observed after a long period 2 weeks without a significant amount of rain 3 mm for the conventional site the field capacity and wilting point used were taken from a soil survey conducted for the site mills and haluschak 1995 the other soil hydraulic parameters i e saturation and saturated hydraulic conductivity used for the two sites were estimated using the soil plant air water spaw model saxton 2009 and the soil physical characteristics from cansis as inputs to the spaw model three years 2013 2014 and 2015 of climate data were used in this study daily meteorological data which included maximum and minimum temperature model cs500 campbell scientific inc edmonton

traverse city usa at 2 m high and precipitation model tr525 texas electronics inc dallas usa were recorded by data loggers model cr1000 campbell scientific inc on automated weather stations located at the two sites all sensors were purchased new from the manufacturers in 2011 and 2012 so had very recent factory calibrations performed on them with the exception of the cs500 temperature and relative humidity probes which were older sensors but upgraded with new relative humidity chips prior to the beginning of the study the tipping bucket rain gauges were checked for accuracy with a field calibration device model fcd hyquest solutions pty ltd warwick farm australia either annually or every second year in the early spring and were sent for factory calibration at the end of the study during winter 2015 2016 the solar radiation data from both sites were evaluated against theoretical clear sky values for the latitude elevation and other conditions for each site following asce 2005 appendix d weather data integrity assessment and found to always fall within 5 on clear days during all growing seasons studied all parameters used in the study for modeling et from the primary weather stations were verified against data collected by secondary stations decagon devices inc located at each field site as well for the conventional crop production field near carberry manitoba meteorological parameters air temperature relative humidity wind speed rainfall were compared to data from weather stations independently operated by environment and climate change canada and manitoba

were measured indirectly using the residual energy balance reb technique amiro 2009 bawazir et al 2014 previous studies conducted in canadian boreal forest sites amiro 2009 indicated that reb et measurements agree well with the eddy covariance technique on daily weekly and seasonal scales data from the organic site in the present study has also shown excellent agreement between reb et measurements and eddy covariance values at a daily time step during growing season conditions glenn and wilson 2014 using the reb technique etc was estimated as the latent heat flux le calculated from

missing values gaps in the surface energy flux data occurred due to instrument and data logger maintenance malfunctions inclement weather e g rain or heavy dew on the sonic anemometers and quality control filtering small data gaps 2 h or four consecutive half hours were filled by linear interpolation for all variables there were no gaps larger than 2 h for rn or g for the datasets used in this analysis gaps longer than 2 h for h were filled based on linear relationships with available energy rn g the regression coefficients used to fill these gaps were adjusted over the growing season using a moving window approach where fits of 240 observations at a time were incrementally solved in steps of 48 points for the half hour datasets from each of the sites amiro 2009 eichelmann et al 2016 for periods where available energy rn g was calculated to be less than zero le was forced to zero amiro 2009 daily etc was calculated by dividing the daily le sums by the latent heat of vaporization for water 2 2 reference evapotranspiration models eight etr models with different degrees of complexity and data requirements were evaluated in this study table 2 the eight models include two combination models i e fao56 penman monteith and maulé et al models three radiation based models i e priestley taylor makkink and turc models and three temperature based models i e blaney criddle hargreaves samani and hamon models descriptions of the eight models are found in the appendix a in supplementary file 2 3 simulation of crop evapotranspiration the daily etc was estimated using the crop coefficient approach presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 which is expressed as 2 e t c k c e t r where etc is in mm d and kc is dimensionless the kc used in this study was a fourth order function of the cumulative gdd given in the form alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b 3 k c a b x c x 2 d x 3 e x 4 where x is the cumulative gdd and a b c d and e are coefficients specific to the crop grown growing degree days were estimated using the equation 4 g d d t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where tbase is the base temperature c below which crop growth ceases the reported base temperatures for most crops range from 0 c to 10 c de beurs and henebry 2010 the base temperature used in this study was 5 c assumed to be a reasonable base temperature for all crops at these study sites gordon and bootsma 1993 alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b since other studies sammis et al 1985 irmak et al 2013a suggested the potential transferability of gdd based kc to different locations with different climatic conditions assuming that temperature is the main factor affecting plant development characteristics gdd based kc were used in this study two sets of kc values were employed in this study table 3 in the first set the kc for spring wheat canola and fall rye were adopted from aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b while values for millet and soybean were derived for this study the derivation for millet and soybean kc values used the growth stage based crop coefficients and crop development stages presented in fao56 allen et al 1998 and the daily normal temperature of beaver city nebraska usa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2016 beaver city was chosen to represent the climatic region where these crop parameters would generally be applicable allen et al 1998 the crop coefficients used in aimm were derived using the breb method and the data for each crop were collected for two years in southern alberta canada harms personal communication while the base data for the fao56 crop coefficients were obtained from across the world the second set of kc were the coefficients of the best fit fourth order polynomial curve for the ratio of observed etc to the product of etr estimated from the penman montieth model and ks estimated from measured soil moisture content kc etc obs etr pm ks ks is defined in the succeeding section we are aware however that comparing observed etc to the etc estimates using this second set of kc would have a bias yet this was done for comparison purposes for method consistency the aimm crop coefficients that are based on alfalfa as the reference crop alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b were converted to grass based coefficients eq 5 allen et al 1998 5 k c g r a s s k r a t i o k c a l f a l f a where kratio is 1 05 for humid and calm conditions 1 20 for arid and moderately windy conditions and 1 35 for arid and windy conditions allen et al 1998 accordingly the value chosen for the study sites was 1 20 2 4 soil moisture considerations for actual crop evapotranspiration as mentioned earlier crops may experience various levels of moisture stress through their growth stages thus a dimensionless soil moisture stress coefficient ks was introduced to eq 2 to account for the available water in the root zone 6 e t c a k s k c e t r where etca is the actual etc which is the crop evapotranspiration rate mm d corrected for the availability of water in the root zone soil moisture stress coefficient was estimated as a logarithmic function of the actual available water aw and the total available water taw alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b 7 k s l o g a w t a w 100 1 log 101 where values for ks could range from 0 maximum water stress to 1 minimum or no water stress in this current study the minimum value for ks was set at 0 1 similar to what is applied in aimm alberta agriculture and forestry 2017b total available water is defined as the amount of water available to plants at field capacity and was estimated as the difference between field capacity fc and wilting point wp 8 taw fc wp similarly aw was calculated as 9 aw sw wp where sw mm is the actual soil water content in the root zone the daily sw was estimated using the water balance approach 10 sw t sw t 1 p et ca ro dp where p is precipitation mm ro is surface runoff mm and dp is the soil water that exceeds field capacity and thus percolates downward out of the root zone mm on day t runoff was estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure scs 1972 it should be noted that no irrigation was applied to both fields during the period considered in this study 2 5 statistical analysis statistical approaches were used to quantitatively assess the performance of the models by comparing the measured etc fluxes against simulated actual etc fluxes the statistical measures implemented include nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean

values respectively n is the number of observations and the overbar indicates mean value the indices rmse mae and mre summarize the mean difference between measured and predicted values and the smaller the difference the better is the agreement between measured and predicted results the value of nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 0 where higher values indicate better agreement a value of 0 for nse indicates that the observed mean is as good as the model prediction while negative values indicate that the observed mean is better than the model prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of measurement results the mean temperatures and relative humidity at the two sites were comparable to growing season normals 1981 2010 except in 2015 which was relatively warmer table 4 the wind speeds were slightly lower than the height adjusted normal value of 3 0 m s there may have been a bias caused by the measurement height correction itself or real differences in the surface roughness characteristics upwind of the cropland site weather stations the seasonal precipitation values at the sites were generally higher than the normal except for 2015 at the organic farm which was slightly lower than normal for the area table 4 the 2014 and 2013 growing seasons were the wettest during the study for the organic and conventional sites respectively with 108 114 mm exceeding the normal the normal solar radiation and etr values for the area were not available however the values for both sites compared well with each other the measured daily etc was found to have positive correlations with solar and net radiation maximum and minimum temperature vapour pressure deficit and maximum relative humidity and negative correlations with minimum relative humidity and wind speed table 5 higher correlations were obtained from radiation net and solar radiation and temperature maximum and minimum temperature which also agreed with the results obtained from the best fit curve regressions fig 2 this verifies that the measured etc at the study sites was mostly driven by the energy available to evaporate water e g radiation and temperature and less so by the factors that removed water vapour from the vegetation surfaces e g relative humidity and wind speed as has been observed by other studies priestley and taylor 1972 wang et al 2007 shi et al 2008 yang et al 2014 it is surprising that et had a negative relationship with wind speed however other studies el bably 2003 also found similar result the seasonal etc of the crops cumulative etc for the entire growing period grown in southwestern manitoba for this study was generally comparable to those published in the literature table 6 literature values of growing season water use for fall rye and canola tended to be lower than those measured in the current study table 6 however the former studies were conducted in parts of saskatchewan which have a more arid climate the published values for soybean et were higher than what were obtained in the current study particularly for fields under irrigation table 6 however those studies were conducted with longer season soybean cultivars under a warmer and wetter climate nebraska than southern manitoba in the current study soybean had the largest etc table 6 which also had the longest growing period 143 days and millet had the lowest etc which also had the shortest growing period 80 days 3 2 etr models comparison using the fao56 penman monteith equation as the benchmark errors mre in the etr estimates by the other seven models ranged from 11 to 34 with the maulé et al equation producing the least error and the blaney criddle model providing the largest table 7 the maulé et al equation which accounts for the effects of radiation humidity and wind speed showed the best fit probably because it was developed using climate data from the canadian prairies the 0 87 nse value obtained in this study was comparable to the 0 93 value obtained by maulé et al 2006 for their equation against the penman monteith equation de jong and tugwood 1987 obtained errors up to 20 by the penman monteith equation and up to 25 by the priestley taylor equation against adjusted class a pan data collected from eight weather stations across canada under a semi arid climate in iran tabari 2010 found errors up to 37 by various models i e turc priestley taylor makkink and hargreaves samani against the penman monteith equation with the hargreaves samani model providing the best fit when contrasted against the penman monteith equation the priestley taylor nse of 0 96 and hargreaves samani nse of 0 97 models were found to work best in a semi arid region in china gao et al 2017 in this current study the hargreaves samani model ranked fourth among the seven models with a nse value of 0 70 18 error which is comparable to the 0 74 obtained by maulé et al 2006 the relatively good performance of the hargreaves samani model in comparison to the penman monteith model for the semi arid to sub humid climate of the canadian prairies would be important particularly for those weather stations that have temperature measurement only 3 3 simulated actual crop evapotranspiration as similar kc and ks values were applied across all the models variations among the actual etc estimates would be due only to the etr inputs from the different models comparison of daily simulated actual etc from the different etr models and using the first set of kc against observed etc produced errors mre ranging from 23 to 68 with the makkink model having the least error and the blaney criddle model providing the largest error table 8 the other statistical indices nse rmse and mae however show the best fit of the turc model overall on a daily basis the turc model produced the smallest error rmse among the eight models followed by the makkink priestley taylor and penman monteith models this indicates that simpler models such as the makkink and turc models can provide estimates comparable to those of the penman monteith model for the crops and agroclimatic conditions at the sites the better performance of the radiation based models agrees with the high correlation found between measured etc and radiation table 5 fig 2 when compared against the penman monteith equation tabari 2010 found the turc model as the best model rmse 0 284 1 106 mm day in estimating et in cold humid and arid climates similar to the climates under which the model was developed however it was also found to perform well for the semi arid climate of southern greece xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 and the sub humid climate of kharagpur india rmse ranging from 0 39 to 0 53 mm day srivastava et al 2016 although the makkink model was developed under temperate humid conditions schneider et al 2007 also found it to give accurate estimates for et rmse 0 59 0 69 mm day in a semi arid region of northern china on a seasonal scale all the eight models resulted in relatively smaller errors as uncertainties tended to balance out on longer time scales however the temperature based hargreaves samani and blaney criddle models produced the least errors fig 3 the daily overestimates by the blaney criddle model were compensated by daily underestimates which were more evident throughout the growth period of the millet fig 4 a and spring wheat fig 4d crops hence it provided similar seasonal totals fig 3 although the hargreaves samani and blaney criddle models performed well on longer time scales more studies are required to better understand the differences on the performance of these models under different time scales and to verify if this would hold under other conditions and crops results from the etc comparison table 8 were slightly different from those of the etr comparisons table 7 except for the turc model which showed good performance in both analyses the equation developed by maulé et al 2006 which provided the most accurate estimates for the penman monteith equation table 7 did not perform any better than the radiation based models i e turc makkink and priestley taylor models table 8 the differences observed in the outcomes could be caused by a number of reasons first validating a model with another model may not always be preferable as mentioned earlier although the penman monteith model is the widely accepted standard procedure for et calculation and has shown to be the most accurate etr model in many studies it can sometimes be outperformed by other models douglas et al 2009 found the et estimates of the priestley taylor and turc equations more accurate than those of the penman monteith model the older version when compared against eddy covariance and bowen ratio data collected over a variety of land cover types in florida in addition the hargreaves samani and makkink equations were also found to perform better than the penman monteith equation when actual etc estimates from the soil and water assessment tool swat using these models were compared to eddy flux measurements collected in a semi arid watershed area in northern china schneider et al 2007 a second reason is that inaccuracies in the actual etc estimates are also affected by the discrepancies in kc and ks values thus the larger errors observed in the etc comparisons table 8 were probably due to the errors in the kc and ks estimates when actual etc values were estimated using the second set of kc kc etc obs etr pm ks errors were smaller and most other statistical indicators of model performance were substantially improved table 9 compared to those obtained using the first set of kc table 8 this difference was expected as the second set of kc values was based on trends in the actual et observations made at the study sites however both kc approaches produced similar model ranking results with the turc model providing the best fit and the blaney criddle model giving the poorest estimate which could indicate the transferability of gdd based kc though more studies are needed to further investigate this while the accuracy of the ks values could also affect the actual etc estimates given that soil properties were not varied in both comparisons tables 8 and 9 and that both used similar etr inputs any differences similarities in the outputs of both analyses could only be due to the kc values the relatively large errors obtained using both sets of kc values tables 8 and 9 might be a reflection of the limited amount of measurement data used in their derivation the one year data used for the derivation of the second set of kc the two year data for aimm kc and the climate normal used in the derivation for millet and soybean kc might not have been sufficient to establish accurate kc the discrepancies in the first set of kc values can also be seen in the inconsistencies between measured and modeled actual etc observed after planting and before harvest fig 4 these differences would increase if precipitation amounts would differ from the setting from which the crop coefficients were developed since the first set of crop coefficients used in this study take into account the combined effects of evaporation and transpiration the variation in evaporation rates particularly during the start and towards the end of the growing period where evaporation is dominant might not have been fully accounted for in the coefficients for example prior to planting the proso millet crop on june 25 2013 the organic site received 60 mm of rainfall over june 22 and 23 as well as an additional 36 mm from june 25 to june 26 following seeding this precipitation 96 mm total around the seeding of the crop evidently lead to high rates of evaporation under the conducive thermal and radiative regimes of late june and early july that were not captured by the crop coefficient used fig 4a correction factors could probably help rectify this problem however there is none available yet in the literature for gdd based crop coefficients for growth stage based coefficients fao56 outlines a method to correct the crop coefficient for the initial stage however it seems difficult to adapt this approach to the gdd based coefficients as length of growth stages varies with heat units it is also worth mentioning that the kc for fall rye in both sets were derived using data collected from may 1st until harvest the same year only however the derived kc was applied to the entire growth period mid september to mid august the following year this means that the kc for fall rye was derived using a portion only of its total growth period this limitation might have caused the discrepancy between modeled and observed etc towards the end of its growth period fig 4b 4 summary and conclusions the mean temperatures and relative humidity at the two sites compared well with the growing season normals 1981 2010 except in 2015 which was relatively warmer the growing season precipitation totals at the measurement sites were generally higher than the normal with 2014 and 2013 being the wettest during the study for the organic and conventional fields respectively correlations between measured etc at the sites and climate variables indicated that et during the study period was mostly driven by the energy available to evaporate water e g radiation and temperature and less so by the factors that removed water vapour from the vegetation surfaces e g relative humidity and wind speed the seasonal cumulative etc of the crops grown in southwestern manitoba for this study fell within the expected range of previously published values comparison of the seven models against the fao56 penman monteith equation showed the maulé et al equation as the best alternative to the penman monteith equation for estimating reference et in the study sites however results were different when actual etc estimated using the eight models including the penman monteith equation were evaluated against measured etc applying two sets of kc values which were derived using data from different locations and climatic environmental conditions showed the turc model as the most accurate and the blaney criddle model as the least accurate on a daily time scale the comparability of the model ranking results from the two sets of kc could indicate the transferability of gdd based kc to various locations and climatic conditions however more studies are needed to further investigate this the errors obtained in this study were contributed not only by the approaches and meteorological parameters accounted for by the etr models but also by the inaccuracies of the kc values as a result of limited data used in their derivation further as the gdd based kc did not account separately for the evaporation and transpiration components larger errors were observed after planting and prior to harvest when evaporation was the dominant process discrepancies became more pronounced when there were more rainfall events correction factors could probably help rectify this problem however there is none available yet in the literature for gdd based kc separate accounting for evaporation and transpiration could also help address this issue however additional data is needed to develop the method in general the radiation based models performed better than the temperature based models on a daily time step however further studies on longer time scales are needed to assess the relevance of the temperature based hargreaves samani and blaney criddle models for calculation of et in the canadian prairies as they may be important for locations having temperature measurement only results of this study provide additional insights on which models to consider that could give accurate et estimates in the canadian prairies accurate et models are important components in estimating regional water balances for efficient water resources planning and management and for better understanding of environmental impacts of water use in agriculture this study also shows the potential transferability of gdd based kc across different locations and climatic conditions however more studies with validated gdd based kc are needed to further investigate this finding as it was found that kc coefficients derived using data collected from the study sites produced better fit it is recommended to collect more data in the region to establish more accurate gdd based kc if reliable gdd based kc for various crops were made available and their application to various locations and climatic conditions were proven meaningful by more studies then crop water use calculations in various related applications would be fairly straightforward conflict of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of

8528,study region the mekong floodplains and delta are among the most agriculturally productive and biologically diverse waterscapes of the world but sea level rise land subsidence and the proposed upstream development of over 126 hydropower dams and extensive delta based water infrastructure have raised concern due to potential impacts on the hydrology of the region study focus this study aims to quantify the effects of water infrastructure development land subsidence and sea level rise on hydrological regimes of the mekong floodplains and delta through the development and application of a hydrodynamic model new hydrological insights for the region depending on hydrological characteristics of each region river dominated transitional or tidal the influence of each potential driver may vary the operation of proposed hydropower dams would change river dominated upper floodplain s water levels by 26 to 70 and 0 8 to 5 9 in the dry and wet season respectively but the impact diminishes throughout the floodplains in the wet season the upper vietnamese delta changes from a transitional stage to a river dominated stage and localized water infrastructure development in the upper delta has the greatest effect on water levels in the region land subsidence combined with sea level rise could have the greatest future influence on flooding in the delta if current rates are extrapolated sustainable water management strategies are thus necessary to mitigate changes in the floodplains and delta and increase resilience to sea level rise and land subsidence keywords mekong floodplains and delta water infrastructure sea level rise land subsidence hydrodynamic modeling 1 introduction river floodplains are among the most biologically productive and ecologically diverse regions in the world however modifications to their flow regimes caused by both direct human interventions such as dam construction flood protection or river diversions and climate change have accelerated in recent times lehner et al 2011 doll and schmied 2012 hydrology is a fundamental driver of floodplain ecosystems and any hydrological alteration is likely to result in subsequent changes to aquatic biota and riverine ecology townsend and hildrew 1994 stanford et al 1996 poff et al 1997 the hydrology of the mekong floodplains and delta has not been heavily influenced by upstream development in terms of discharge yet kuenzer et al 2012 dang et al 2016 but it is highly affected by local water infrastructure development sea level rise and land subsidence deltares 2013 erban et al 2014 dang et al 2016 all these factors however are interrelated for example sea level rise may propagate flooding van 2012 resulting in the requirement of flood prevention systems in extensive areas of the floodplains and delta the development of water and transportation infrastructure subsequently defines human settlements throughout the delta an increase in population density then results in intensification of well pumping which causes soil compaction and land subsidence as described in erban et al 2014 hydrological alterations in the mekong and their implications for floodplain management have been the subject of a number of recent modeling studies for instance the cumulative influence of hydropower dams and climate change on the cambodian lowlands was studied by västilä et al 2010 and arias et al 2014a these two studies however did not consider the effect of hourly tidal variation on the vietnamese delta moreover the impact of delta based water infrastructure on flooding in the delta was studied by le et al 2007 2008 and triet et al 2017 le et al 2007 2008 and triet et al 2017 analyzed changes in maximum water levels and maximum flooding extent but did not report on other hydrological indicators which are also key drivers of ecological and agricultural productivity in floodplains townsend and hildrew 1994 poff et al 1997 arias et al 2013 a different study on impacts of climate change on flooding propagation in the delta concluded that larger inundated areas and longer flooding durations would be observed along the coastal part of the delta due to sea level rise van 2012 despite these important findings the study did not include ongoing water infrastructure development making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of different drivers of change the impact of sea level rise on the delta in the dry season was discussed in smajgl et al 2015 but the authors focused on adaptation strategies for climate change resilience rather than hydrological alterations given the current status of the literature in the mekong delta a comprehensive quantification of contributions from all major drivers of large scale change is thus needed to better evaluate future water resources management alternatives the mekong floodplains and delta as other large lowland drainage systems around the world are affected by complex natural and anthropogenic drivers understanding the inter and intra annual impact of each driver on the different zones of the mekong floodplains and delta may also help understand hydrological processes of river floodplains worldwide and will help formulate appropriate water resources management and development plan options thus this paper aims to quantify the cumulative and marginal effect of hydropower dams delta based water infrastructure development sea level rise and land subsidence on spatial and temporal hydrological patterns using a complex and detailed application of a hydrodynamic model for the mekong floodplains and delta monthly water levels flood extents flood depths flood durations 30 day maximum water levels 30 day minimum water levels and water levels raising and falling rates were the hydrological indicators considered in the extent of this paper 2 study area the mekong river in south east asia is ranked 12th in length and 8th in water discharge in the world the mekong originates in the tibetan plateau and then flows through china myanmar laos and thailand before pouring into the alluvial floodplains and delta in cambodia and vietnam the mekong floodplains and delta can be classified into three regions the cambodian lowland cbl the tonle sap floodplain tsf and the vietnam mekong delta vmd fig 1 in the middle of the floodplain at phnom penh cambodia s capital the mekong branches off into the tonle river towards the tonle sap lake and the mekong and bassac rivers towards the vietnamese delta where there is a complex river and canal network the tonle sap lake plays an important role in hydrological regulation for the mekong floodplains and delta by storing and releasing water from its 76 05 million m3 water storage capacity koponen et al 2007 the mekong basin is facing the development of water infrastructure for different purposes the upper part of the basin has a large potential for hydropower development because of its mountainous terrain since 1991 the construction of 74 dams has significantly changed hydrological regimes in the basin cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 the influence of dam construction on hydrology is however currently limited to the upper mekong floodplains because the current combined reservoir capacity is much lower than the annual flow of the mekong river in the floodplains dang et al 2016 however if all proposed dams are constructed the cumulative impact of dams may cause substantial changes to hydrological regimes of the lower mekong upstream of the floodplains lauri et al 2012 and the tonle sap floodplain arias et al 2014b after the vietnamese reunification in 1975 the government strongly incentivized the development of water infrastructure to reduce poverty hoanh et al 2014 land redistribution the widespread adoption of high yielding and short duration rice varieties and the construction of low dykes to delay the august flood increased rice productivity to much higher levels than the pre 1975 period kakonen 2008 howie 2011 hoanh et al 2014 during the first decade of the 21st century limited land availability for rice cultivation was the main obstacle to increase agricultural production further consequently flood prevention systems for agricultural expansion and intensification grew by about 500 000 ha during the 2000 s kontgis et al 2015 which included the construction of high dykes to keep out all flooding from compartments during the monsoon season these flood control systems however have had a large impact on water levels raising and falling rates water levels fluctuations and flood boundaries in the floodplains since 2007 as shown through a historical data analysis conducted by dang et al 2016 sea level rise and land subsidence will also likely pose additional pressure on the development of the region van 2012 deltares 2013 erban et al 2014 smajgl et al 2015 global sea level rise will certainly affect the coastal region of the vmd van 2012 smajgl et al 2015 the challenge of either attempting to adapt to climate change or sustaining local development is unfolded in social and ecological systems of the vmd chapman and darby 2016 moreover land subsidence rates which exceeded sea level rise at some locations in the delta erban et al 2014 will likely worsen the flooding situation the mekong floodplains and delta are responsible for a large proportion of the agricultural and fisheries production in vietnam and cambodia hortle 2007 gso 2013 fish catch in the region provided up to 75 of protein demands in cambodia contributes significantly to the subsistence of local livelihoods nuorteva et al 2010 keskinen et al 2011 given the high dependency of the region s livelihoods on water resources the consequences of development of upstream and localized water infrastructure on the hydrological regime should be carefully examined in conjunction with sea level rise and land subsidence 3 methodology to study the impact of water infrastructure development sea level rise and land subsidence in the large and tidal influenced mekong floodplains and delta the hydrodynamic model dhi mike 11 was chosen the software was applied in previous studies in the mekong floodplains and delta nguyen et al 2011 nguyen et al 2015 smajgl et al 2015 and a detailed hydraulic network for the whole mekong floodplains and delta was available from the institute for water and environment research vietnam fig 2 a the model was developed during the time the main author worked at the institute it was used for unpublished work and it was further calibrated and validated for the aim of this study 3 1 hydraulic network the hydraulic network includes the region from kratie in cambodia to the estuarine boundary in vietnam fig 2a the network has 25 427 nodes making 3586 branches and link channels the network is sufficiently detailed to resolve the floodplain hydraulics at the regional scale surveyed cross sections an example in fig 2b collected from different projects represent segments of river channels and other flowing water bodies because the floodplains were divided into compartments enclosed by dykes overland flows on each compartment were simulated by link channels with the storage capacity obtained from the 90 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem also used in nguyen et al 2011 and smajgl et al 2015 the link channels used the relationship between elevation and terrestrial volume of the compartments within those areas between main channels to simulate flooding storage capacity nguyen et al 2011 described this method in their studies but they used cross sections to simulate terrestrial parts of the floodplains using the relationship between elevation and volume as done in this study has the advantage that the model can take into consideration the storage capacity of whole compartments where applicable link channels were connected with the river system by control structures fig 2c catchment runoff from precipitation was simulated by the integrated mike11 nam model in which the floodplains and delta were divided into 1819 sub catchments nam nedbør afstrømnings mode is a lumped catchment runoff model which has been widely used for research purposes e g madsen 2000 butts et al 2004 rainfall and evaporation data from 39 stations were used in the nam model to account for moisture content changes in each catchment the rainy season overlaps with the flood season in the floodplains when soil has high moisture content saturated conditions so all rainfall is assumed to contribute to run off hourly measured sea levels at 11 coastal stations were used as downstream boundaries fig 2a discharge boundaries were obtained from kratie dau tieng phuoc hoa and tri an stations and discharge data series at kratie were used as an upstream boundary of the mekong water level discharge evaporation and rainfall data were provided by the mekong river commission and the south region hydrology meteorology center of vietnam 3 2 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated with recorded water levels at 33 stations fig 1a these data sets were employed in previous studies of the impact of water infrastructure and climate changes on water levels cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 dang et al 2016 triet et al 2017 water levels instead of discharges were used to calibrate and validate the model because downstream from kratie the mekong s flow regime is highly influenced by the floodplains storage capacity mrc 2012 and overland flow velocity during the flood season are not accurately measured dang et al 2016 the calibration was done by adjusting manning s n roughness coefficient in waterways the values of manning s n in main river segments ranged from 0 016 to 0 024 and from 0 022 to 0 027 for secondary branches ranges are as recommended in chow 1959 roughness coefficients for floodplains link channels varied from 0 033 to 0 035 based on a land cover map source of data siwrp 2000 in order to validate the hydrodynamic model the nash sutcliffe coefficient e was used nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 e 1 t 1 n h t h m t 2 t 1 n h t h 2 where h is the mean of observed water levels ht and hmt are observed and modeled water level at time t respectively the model was calibrated manually on an hourly basis for the year 2000 and was validated for the years 1998 2001 and 2002 for the vmd 1998 was considered a dry year and 2000 2002 were wet years in the floodplains and delta mrc 2012 because the year 2007 marked the rapid development of high dykes for flood prevention in the vmd dang et al 2016 data for years after 2007 were not used for calibration and validation purposes preliminary analysis with available hourly water levels from 2007 to 2014 at phnom penh and kratie showed that tide had little impacts on water levels in these stations the use of daily water levels measured at 7 00 am and 7 00 pm for 1998 2000 2002 for the cambodian lowlands was thus sufficient for calibrating the model upstream of the vmd inundation patterns derived from the hydrodynamic model were validated with analogous information derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite images the product mod09a1 was downloaded at the peak time of the wet season in 2000 to generate maximum inundation maps as described in dang et al 2016 the inundation maps derived by the satellite images and model simulations were compared using the cohen s kappa coefficient smeeton 1985 which was calculated as following 2 k p 0 p e 1 p e where po is the relative observed agreement between flood maps calculated by the percentage of flooded and non flooded areas appearing in both maps pe is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement based on the percentage of flooded areas 3 p 0 p 11 p 00 4 p e p f l o o d e d p u n f l o o d e d 5 p f l o o d e d p 11 p 10 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 x p 11 p 01 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 6 p u n f l o o d e d p 00 p 10 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 x p 00 p 01 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 where p 11 is the number of flooded pixels in simulation and modis observation p 00 is the number of unflooded pixels in simulation and modis observation p 10 is the number of pixels which are flooded in simulation and unflooded in modis observation p 01 is the number of pixels which are unflooded in simulation and flooded in modis observation a cell was considered as a flooded cell if the water depth was more than 10 cm the tsf was not considered for this spatial evaluation because a large fraction of this semi natural floodplain is covered with varying types of vegetation canopies tall gallery forests grasslands and bush which can reduce the accuracy of the inundation pattern derived from modis nguyen et al 2013 3 3 hydrodynamic modeling scenarios in order to understand the impact of dams delta based water infrastructure sea level rise and land subsidence on the floodplains six different scenarios were simulated with the hydrological conditions of the dry 1998 normal 1999 and wet years 2000 as summarized in table 1 and described in detail as follows each driver was assessed independently to see how they impact on the floodplains this is so called a sensitivity based scenario neutral approach prudhomme et al 2010 this approach was also used in nguyen et al 2015 to study the impact of dams climate change and sea level rise on sedimentation in the vietnam mekong delta vmd dam and water infrastructure development plans may change in the future but the most critical cases were chosen to examine how far dam and dyke construction would affect the floodplains bl scenario the baseline scenario was based on the years 1998 1999 and 2000 which were the driest below 26 normal above 6 and wettest above 38 years on record respectively in terms of annual flood volume in the lower mekong basin over the past 50 years before the rapid development of water infrastructure in 2007 mrc 2012 hp scenario upstream flows were modified to simulate full hydropower development 126 dams as in lauri et al 2012 and arias et al 2014a and downstream boundaries were kept similar to the bl in this scenario monthly outflows from reservoirs were simulated to maximize energy production by optimally managing reservoir active storage using linear programming lp optimization lauri et al 2012 although the future development of dams may be uncertain the level of hydrological alterations caused by dams will range from the pristine condition bl scenario to this full dam development scenario wid scenario in the wid scenario the lxq por and mbr were protected by dykes for rice cultivation throughout the flood season as proposed in deltares 2013 fig 1b the so called food production scenario upstream and downstream boundaries conditions were maintained as in the bl a large proportion of the floodplains have been already protected by dykes 60 70 during the 1st decade of the 21 century and the effect of dykes on water levels along the main stream was demonstrated by historical data analysis in dang et al 2016 a future in which the whole upper vmd is protected for rice cultivation is thus very likely widr scenario this scenario was based on the wid scenario but it included a bypass in which water was transferred to neighboring areas fig 1c this was simulated by doubling river widths with the purpose of reducing the pressure of water infrastructure development on the hydrology of the protected regions which represented the major flood diversion scenario as in deltares 2013 ls scenario the land subsidence scenario was simulated by using the land subsidence map of erban et al 2014 land subsidence rates varied spatially and these were used to modify the topography srtm dem of the floodplains accordingly storage capacity of link channels was thus recalculated in many parts of the delta because the subsidence rate varied throughout the floodplains it was assumed that water extraction rates would be constant over the study period 2000 2050 and only vertical subsidence was considered as in erban et al 2014 the subsidence rates ranged from 0 to 4 cm per year and the areas where subsidence rates were high 1 cm per year included cities like can tho and the coastal part of the mekong delta slr scenario upstream discharges were similar to the bl scenario but downstream water level boundaries were increased based on measured data corresponding to the projected sea level rise in 2050 global sea level is predicted to rise in a range from 17 to 38 cm corresponding to different emission scenarios ipcc 2014 sea level rise was the focus of this scenario as it will likely be the driver of climate change effects in the delta as opposed to basin rainfall runoff a recent modeling effort by hoang et al 2016 projected climate change impacted water levels along the mekong but projected flow alterations at kratie were considered insignificant in the timeframe of this study up to 2050 3 4 indicators of hydrological alterations the modeling scenarios were analyzed for changes in 30 day minimum water levels 30 day maximum water levels monthly average water levels water level rise fall rates maximum flood extent and flood duration indicators which are frequently the most altered by water infrastructure development tockner and stanford 2002 these were also the indicators historically identified as having changed under the effects of water infrastructure in the mekong floodplains dang et al 2016 the non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to determine if sets of indicators derived from each scenario were different from each other as a quasi 2d hydrodynamic model was employed in this study in order to derive inundation maps the invert distance weighting idw method was used to interpolate between known water level points in the model 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation and regional classifications overall there was a good fit between observed and simulated water levels with nash sutcliffe coefficients e ranging from 0 61 to 0 98 through the study region fig 3 because of the minor influence of tides on water level fluctuations nash sutcliffe coefficients e were highest at stations in cambodia ranging from 0 70 to 0 98 in the vmd e coefficients ranged between 0 65 and 0 89 and were especially high for stations on the mekong and bassac rivers high correlation coefficients e 0 8 values were also found between modeling and measured water levels at the key stations for the calibration and validation years of 1998 and 2000 2002 fig s1 in supplemental data fig 4 a and b illustrate the inundation map derived from the mod09a1 product and the baseline simulation result from september 29 2000 this date was chosen to check the agreement between the two inundation maps because it was close to the date when the water level reached its maximum at tan chau september 23 2000 and the proportion of cloud cover was low pe 0 64 and po 0 83 resulting in a cohen s kappa of k 0 63 which indicated that the remotely sensed inundation map coincided well with the modeling inundation map the areas of similarity between the modis imagery and modeling results were large 83 fig 4c however land use also influenced the accuracy of the modis derived inundation maps fig 4e in the lower vmd while water levels were low orchard and built up area land uses in the region made the observations by the satellite become less accurate and contributed to the discrepancy between modis and the modeling results additionally in the middle and coastal parts of the delta water depths were shallow so satellite based inundation maps may be influenced by bottom reflectance and vegetation arguably the main source of uncertainties in this study came from the definition of channel network and river cross sections in the hydrodynamic model the model domain covers an extension of around 70 000 km2 creating a complex logistical challenge to collect thousands of cross sections of the river and canal network moreover the heterogeneity in the physiography of river catchments may cause different levels of water resistance resulting in different roughness coefficient even in a short river segment nevertheless the high correlation coefficient between modeling results and measured water levels increase the accuracy in modeling results it is important to note that the locations of the boundaries among the river dominated tidal and transitional regions were dynamic in the dry season water fluctuations were still observed at phnom penh but the magnitude of water levels fluctuation along the river from phnom penh to the region near the border between vietnam and cambodia were small less than 0 25 m fig 5 a and c thus the cambodia lowlands and the tonle sap floodplain can be classified as river dominant regions the vietnam mekong delta includes transitional and tidal regions the effects of tides on water levels in the coastal part of the delta are prominent in the flood season the upper vmd turns into a river dominated region fig 5b and d there is not much difference between the dry year fig 5a and c and the wet year fig 5b and d in terms of seasonal boundaries three key locations kampong cham tan chau and my thuan locations in fig 1 which are in each region were chosen to illustrate the impact of each scenario on monthly water levels and other hydrological indicators 4 2 future impacts on monthly mean water levels along the mekong mainstream modeling results showed that the magnitude of impacts of different drivers on water levels varied considerably from one region to another mean monthly water levels in the dry 1998 normal 1999 and wet 2000 years along the mekong river varied according to different scenarios simulated fig 6 hydropower dams hp scenario increased monthly mean water levels in the dry season and reduced monthly mean water levels in the wet season throughout the mekong mainstream from kampong cham tan chau to my thuan fig 6 in the wet year mean water levels increased by 25 5 in the dry months and decreased by 0 8 in the wet months at kampong cham compared to the bl scenario in the dry year the influence of hydropower on monthly water levels was observed dam operation increased water levels by 70 in the dry months and decreased water levels by 5 9 in the wet months this indicates that hydropower dams could affect water levels in a dry year more severely than in a wet year and in the dry season more heavily than in the wet season the difference in monthly water levels between bl and hp diminished downstream fig 6 in the middle and coastal parts of the vmd the difference in mainstream water levels between bl and hp was small less than 10 cm at my thuan fig 6c f and i statistically there were significant differences in monthly water levels from kratie to chau doc and tan chau observed between the bl and hp scenarios according to the kruskal wallis test p values 0 05 but the difference in monthly water levels from can tho and my thuan to the river mouth was insignificant p values 0 05 contrary to the effect of dams the impact of flood prevention systems on mainstream water levels was observed in the wet season in the normal and wet years fig 6e and h mean of monthly water levels were projected to increase by 15 about 0 4 m p values 0 05 at tan chau in the wet months from june to december in 2000 fig 6h and the mean of water level was predicted to increase by only 5 in the same period in 1998 fig 6b water levels were also expected to increase slightly by around 0 03 0 05 m at the lower stations of my thuan during the wet season in 1998 fig 6c and 2000 fig 6i the widening of canal systems in the vmd widr resulted in a maximum water level decrease of about 6 cm in the wet season at tan chau in the wet year fig 6h but did not affect water levels in other parts of the mainstream compared to the wid scenario sea level rise was the most important driver contributing to rising water levels p values 0 05 at my thuan if the sea level rose the expected 17 cm annual water levels at my thuan would increase about 10 cm and 12 cm during the dry year and the wet year respectively fig 6c and i sea level rise by 38 cm will cause an increase of 30 cm in the wet year at my thuan fig 6i this rise is nearly a three fold increase from the hp scenario projections modeling results suggests that hydrological regimes of the middle and the lower delta part of the mekong river would be much more heavily affected by the tidal regime than by upstream alterations although land subsidence increased water retention capacity in different parts of the floodplains monthly water levels with respect to mean sea levels did not change in the ls scenario at can tho and my thuan where the land subsidence rates were almost 4 cm year erban et al 2014 observed changes in water levels were minor fig 6 as expected modeling results showed that water level alterations in a normal year 1999 ranged between the changes in the driest year 1998 and a wettest year 2000 thus the analysis of the characteristics of the normal year are embedded in the range provided by the other two years analyzed 4 3 future impacts on maximum flooding extent and flood depth for the bl scenario maximum flood extent was about 54 000 km2 in the year 2000 of which 27 was in the tsl 18 in the cbl and 55 in the vmd full dam development is expected to reduce maximum flooding extent by 6 in the wet year 2000 fig 7 h and by 3 in the dry year 1998 fig 7b compared to the bl fig 7g and a however delta based water infrastructure sea level rise and land subsidence are expected to have greater effects in the vmd than in the cambodian lowlands fig 7c d e f i j k and l maximum water depths tend to decrease in the upper part of the mekong delta according to the hp scenarios but the impact of hydropower dams on the middle and coastal regions was very limited fig 8 in the wid scenario maximum water levels increased along the riverine corridor between the mekong and the bassac rivers to the east sea fig 8 maximum water level increased up to 1 0 m at the vietnam cambodia border but only increased by 0 1 0 3 m in the middle of the delta continuing future land subsidence ls scenario would be a major driver of change causing increased maximum water depths in the whole vietnamese delta although maximum water levels decreased the influence of land subsidence on the maximum flooding depths is more pronounced in the wet year rather than in the dry year the changes in flood depth are likely relative to the change in ground elevation rather than water levels which should be compared with a datum this is because the alterations in water levels are low as mentioned in the previous section the middle and coastal parts of the delta were heavily influenced by sea level rise overall the total extent of effected areas under the slr38 scenario in the vmd was about 32 500 km2 93 of the entire zone if sea level increases by 38 cm sea level rise had a very limited effect on maximum flood depths at por lxq and mbr fig 8 4 4 future impacts on flooding duration in general the total unflooded areas and the regions where the inundation time was greater than one month in the wet year 2000 were 1 45 times less than in the dry year 1998 hydropower dams hp scenario would not reduce the total extent of flooding but would reduce the length of inundation duration of those areas that are normally flooded for more than 6 months ie wetland areas fig 9 the construction of water infrastructure was predicted to increase agricultural land availability and this development decreased flooded areas by 6 during a dry year and increased permanent flooding areas 6 months the widening of canal systems should potentially decrease flooded areas caused by water infrastructure development by a factor from 1 11 to 1 16 sea level rise would prolong flooded time by about 25 and 36 in the 1998 and 2000 scenarios if sea level increases by 38 cm land subsidence would expand flooded areas by 21 in the dry year and 12 in the wet year and this phenomenon would exacerbate the permanent flooding areas 6 months by 32 in the 1998 scenario and 36 in the 2000 scenario 4 5 future impacts on annual hydrological alteration indicators changes to annual indicators of hydrological alterations along the mekong and bassac rivers are shown in table 2 overall the magnitude of changes varied spatially according to scenarios with hydropower bringing the largest alterations in the cambodian lowlands while sea level rise and water infrastructure development cause the greatest impacts on the vmd dams reduced the rise rate by up to 11 at kampong cham but the rates remained the same at tan chau and can tho water level fall rates meanwhile decrease by 11 at kampong cham in terms of extreme water levels full hydropower dam development increased 30 day minimum water levels by 74 at kampong cham and by 10 at can tho the development of water infrastructure development wid and widr in the form of flood prevention systems mostly changes rise fall rates and maximum water levels at tan chau the rise rates increase by approximate 11 and the fall rates decrease by 20 in the both scenarios in the wid scenario 30 day maximum water levels increase by about 15 17 at tan chau and can tho land subsidence does not change the 30 day minimum water levels but results in 30 day maximum water level declining about 4 5 at tan chau and can tho sea level rise on the other hand affects extreme water levels for examples if sea level rises 38 cm 30 day minimum water levels at phnom penh tan chau and can tho would increase by 14 15 cm 557 28 cm and 47 44 cm respectively 30 day maximum water levels do not change much along the river upstream of tan chau but from can tho to the river mouth it increases by 16 24 cm 5 discussion this study found that the results of the different scenarios of future alterations have different magnitudes and distinct characteristics in the cambodian lowlands versus the vietnam mekong delta a discuss of the implications for each of these two regions follows 5 1 hydrological changes in the cambodian lowlands hydropower dams increase water levels in the dry season and decrease water levels in the wet season in the upper floodplains because reservoirs retain water in the wet season for use in the dry season to extend generation output in the dry season water levels in the upper floodplain are strongly linked to the flow regimes because this is a river dominated region and dam operations would modify the hydrology of the mekong floodplains in a similar way as to what has recently occurred in the upper basin and upper part of the floodplains kummu and sarkkula 2008 piman et al 2012 cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 dams mainly changed water levels in the dry season fig 6 water level fluctuations and water levels rising and falling rates table 2 these hydrological alterations in the upper floodplains consequently may endanger riverine ecology and aquatic species hydropower is an attractive source of energy currently providing 16 6 of the global electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity ren21 2016 but it is causing tension between mekong countries and some of their main economic sectors increasing demand of electricity for economic development in china and south east asia countries resulting in 7 mainstream dams dachaoshan gongguoquiao nuozhadu jinghong manwan xayaburi and don sahong mrc database 2014 are examples of this on going tension consequently policy makers should have plans to confront the consequences on the floodplains and delta of upstream dam development this study also found that maximum flooding extent fig 7 maximum flooding depth fig 8 and inundation times fig 9 did not change much in the hp scenario compared to the bl the effect of dams reduces through the floodplains as the terrain becomes flatter the regulation effect of the tonle sap lake as described in arias et al 2014b may also contribute to this buffering effect 5 2 hydrological changes in the vmd in the vmd the main aim of localized flood prevention systems is to shift from double to triple crops but this activity may alter hydrological regimes in the region water infrastructure development did not always have positive outcomes in terms of total income chapman and darby 2016 however delta based water infrastructure could become the main driver of hydrological alterations in the wet season if the development of such systems is not well managed the influence of the system in the dry season is limited this is because water infrastructure has been developed in the region which is transferred from a transitional stage to a river dominated stage in the wet season fig 5 water infrastructure development modifies the delta hydrology in the wet season by two mechanisms redistributing water retention capacity and reducing water transfer capacity of the floodplains the development of high dykes to enable a third rice crop results in excess water that can be discharged to other regions and make local water levels to increase because the flood protection will limit areas to disperse water fig 7c the two main rivers bassac and mekong have much higher conveying capacity compared to canals thus water will mostly flow towards the vietnamese east sea and this lead to the increase of water levels in the middle delta and the neighboring basin fig 6c f and i additionally the m shaped semi diurnal tide of the vietnamese east sea enables easier water discharge to the east rather than to the west because of the diurnal tide of the vietnamese west sea van 2012 this process will require downstream provinces to build their own flood prevention systems which may then trigger another flood propagation process this study confirmed the finding in triet et al 2017 that the construction of dykes increased shift water levels downstream but we also found that there was the increase of local water levels this may be a result of the reduction in water transfer capacity of the floodplains the designation of freshwater conservation areas which can be managed for multiple purposes should be considered in the floodplains in order to prevent some of the water management issues expected to occur once all the factors of change begin to affect the vmd the widening of canals in the upper vmd illustrated in the widr scenario was considered as an approach to reduce the stress of water infrastructure development during the wet season this may increase the availability of water in the dry season for irrigation but the effect during the wet season would be only minor the transfer capacity of canals even when widened is limited compared to the two main rivers which overflow in the wet season and thus widening of the canals may not result in a significant advantage furthermore if water is transferred uncontrolledly to other regions it may stimulate flooding problems in those regions the changing in water balance among river basins requires a comprehensive inter basin investigation study the middle delta in vietnam is a transitional region where water levels will increase by the influence from upstream systems and downstream sea level rise the influence of sea level rise on water levels is higher than that caused by upstream infrastructure development by either dams or localized water infrastructure the reason for this is that the middle delta has a dense canal system which drains water easily but this canal system also makes sea water easy to penetrate into the delta and a sea level rise of 38 cm will impact 93 of the region in the tidal region or the coastal part of the vmd sea level rise will be the only driver of hydrological alterations land subsidence at the rate up to 4 cm year erban et al 2014 causes significant increases in flood depths but this phenomenon does not change baseline water levels land subsidence theoretically increases water retention capacity in various parts of the delta however because subsiding lands mostly occur in the tidal regions land subsidence induced water storage has little impact on water levels in addition to changes in water levels in terms of quantity and timing due to impacts of water infrastructure development it is also important to consider the issue of water quality and fluvial geomorphology kondolf and rubin 2014 chapman and darby 2016 flooding in the wet season brings with its nutrients attached in alluvium laden water kakonen 2008 dams for example would lessen sediment movement downstream about 55 100 of the 160 200 106 ton year pearse smith 2012 kondolf and rubin 2014 this could lead to a reduction of the sediment bound nutrients delivered from the mekong in the floodplains whether high dykes would offer poor farmers a significant improvement in livelihoods howie 2011 hoanh et al 2014 or would only create short term and negligible benefits chapman and darby 2016 it is clear that high dykes would change the availability of nutrients in protected areas the effort to control water would result in increases in agrochemicals usage and may harm poor farmers who cannot afford them fertilizers and flood prevention systems kakonen 2008 further interdisciplinary research is needed to address the complex relationships between water infrastructure development and social economic and environmental issues 6 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that the impacts of water infrastructure sea level rise and land subsidence on water levels in the mekong floodplains vary depending on the hydrological characteristics of each region thus well planned comprehensive water management strategies will be needed in each region in the cambodian lowlands which are mostly a river dominated region any alterations in hydrological regimes caused by the development of hydropower dams would have a direct effect on water levels hydropower reservoirs which may impact on seasonal water levels fluctuations and water levels rising and falling rates would need to be operated under regimes to minimize the impact on the region in the upper vietnamese delta the impact of delta based water infrastructure on hydrological regimes is more significant than other factors in the wet season but sea level rise will be the main driver in the dry season in the wet season dykes may not only affect water storage capacity but also water transfer capacity of the floodplains while efforts to widen the current canal systems to mitigate the impact of dykes would have limited effect in relieving impacts water storage areas should be maintained to reduce possible impact of localized water infrastructure development finally land subsidence and sea level rise will have the greatest effect on both the middle delta and coastal areas of the vmd and the vulnerability of flooding in the delta would increase in the coming years a combination of strategies such as sea dyke establishment reductions in groundwater pumping and mangrove forests restoration should be considered to alleviate water management issues in this large and important region acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the

8528,study region the mekong floodplains and delta are among the most agriculturally productive and biologically diverse waterscapes of the world but sea level rise land subsidence and the proposed upstream development of over 126 hydropower dams and extensive delta based water infrastructure have raised concern due to potential impacts on the hydrology of the region study focus this study aims to quantify the effects of water infrastructure development land subsidence and sea level rise on hydrological regimes of the mekong floodplains and delta through the development and application of a hydrodynamic model new hydrological insights for the region depending on hydrological characteristics of each region river dominated transitional or tidal the influence of each potential driver may vary the operation of proposed hydropower dams would change river dominated upper floodplain s water levels by 26 to 70 and 0 8 to 5 9 in the dry and wet season respectively but the impact diminishes throughout the floodplains in the wet season the upper vietnamese delta changes from a transitional stage to a river dominated stage and localized water infrastructure development in the upper delta has the greatest effect on water levels in the region land subsidence combined with sea level rise could have the greatest future influence on flooding in the delta if current rates are extrapolated sustainable water management strategies are thus necessary to mitigate changes in the floodplains and delta and increase resilience to sea level rise and land subsidence keywords mekong floodplains and delta water infrastructure sea level rise land subsidence hydrodynamic modeling 1 introduction river floodplains are among the most biologically productive and ecologically diverse regions in the world however modifications to their flow regimes caused by both direct human interventions such as dam construction flood protection or river diversions and climate change have accelerated in recent times lehner et al 2011 doll and schmied 2012 hydrology is a fundamental driver of floodplain ecosystems and any hydrological alteration is likely to result in subsequent changes to aquatic biota and riverine ecology townsend and hildrew 1994 stanford et al 1996 poff et al 1997 the hydrology of the mekong floodplains and delta has not been heavily influenced by upstream development in terms of discharge yet kuenzer et al 2012 dang et al 2016 but it is highly affected by local water infrastructure development sea level rise and land subsidence deltares 2013 erban et al 2014 dang et al 2016 all these factors however are interrelated for example sea level rise may propagate flooding van 2012 resulting in the requirement of flood prevention systems in extensive areas of the floodplains and delta the development of water and transportation infrastructure subsequently defines human settlements throughout the delta an increase in population density then results in intensification of well pumping which causes soil compaction and land subsidence as described in erban et al 2014 hydrological alterations in the mekong and their implications for floodplain management have been the subject of a number of recent modeling studies for instance the cumulative influence of hydropower dams and climate change on the cambodian lowlands was studied by västilä et al 2010 and arias et al 2014a these two studies however did not consider the effect of hourly tidal variation on the vietnamese delta moreover the impact of delta based water infrastructure on flooding in the delta was studied by le et al 2007 2008 and triet et al 2017 le et al 2007 2008 and triet et al 2017 analyzed changes in maximum water levels and maximum flooding extent but did not report on other hydrological indicators which are also key drivers of ecological and agricultural productivity in floodplains townsend and hildrew 1994 poff et al 1997 arias et al 2013 a different study on impacts of climate change on flooding propagation in the delta concluded that larger inundated areas and longer flooding durations would be observed along the coastal part of the delta due to sea level rise van 2012 despite these important findings the study did not include ongoing water infrastructure development making it difficult to assess the relative contribution of different drivers of change the impact of sea level rise on the delta in the dry season was discussed in smajgl et al 2015 but the authors focused on adaptation strategies for climate change resilience rather than hydrological alterations given the current status of the literature in the mekong delta a comprehensive quantification of contributions from all major drivers of large scale change is thus needed to better evaluate future water resources management alternatives the mekong floodplains and delta as other large lowland drainage systems around the world are affected by complex natural and anthropogenic drivers understanding the inter and intra annual impact of each driver on the different zones of the mekong floodplains and delta may also help understand hydrological processes of river floodplains worldwide and will help formulate appropriate water resources management and development plan options thus this paper aims to quantify the cumulative and marginal effect of hydropower dams delta based water infrastructure development sea level rise and land subsidence on spatial and temporal hydrological patterns using a complex and detailed application of a hydrodynamic model for the mekong floodplains and delta monthly water levels flood extents flood depths flood durations 30 day maximum water levels 30 day minimum water levels and water levels raising and falling rates were the hydrological indicators considered in the extent of this paper 2 study area the mekong river in south east asia is ranked 12th in length and 8th in water discharge in the world the mekong originates in the tibetan plateau and then flows through china myanmar laos and thailand before pouring into the alluvial floodplains and delta in cambodia and vietnam the mekong floodplains and delta can be classified into three regions the cambodian lowland cbl the tonle sap floodplain tsf and the vietnam mekong delta vmd fig 1 in the middle of the floodplain at phnom penh cambodia s capital the mekong branches off into the tonle river towards the tonle sap lake and the mekong and bassac rivers towards the vietnamese delta where there is a complex river and canal network the tonle sap lake plays an important role in hydrological regulation for the mekong floodplains and delta by storing and releasing water from its 76 05 million m3 water storage capacity koponen et al 2007 the mekong basin is facing the development of water infrastructure for different purposes the upper part of the basin has a large potential for hydropower development because of its mountainous terrain since 1991 the construction of 74 dams has significantly changed hydrological regimes in the basin cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 the influence of dam construction on hydrology is however currently limited to the upper mekong floodplains because the current combined reservoir capacity is much lower than the annual flow of the mekong river in the floodplains dang et al 2016 however if all proposed dams are constructed the cumulative impact of dams may cause substantial changes to hydrological regimes of the lower mekong upstream of the floodplains lauri et al 2012 and the tonle sap floodplain arias et al 2014b after the vietnamese reunification in 1975 the government strongly incentivized the development of water infrastructure to reduce poverty hoanh et al 2014 land redistribution the widespread adoption of high yielding and short duration rice varieties and the construction of low dykes to delay the august flood increased rice productivity to much higher levels than the pre 1975 period kakonen 2008 howie 2011 hoanh et al 2014 during the first decade of the 21st century limited land availability for rice cultivation was the main obstacle to increase agricultural production further consequently flood prevention systems for agricultural expansion and intensification grew by about 500 000 ha during the 2000 s kontgis et al 2015 which included the construction of high dykes to keep out all flooding from compartments during the monsoon season these flood control systems however have had a large impact on water levels raising and falling rates water levels fluctuations and flood boundaries in the floodplains since 2007 as shown through a historical data analysis conducted by dang et al 2016 sea level rise and land subsidence will also likely pose additional pressure on the development of the region van 2012 deltares 2013 erban et al 2014 smajgl et al 2015 global sea level rise will certainly affect the coastal region of the vmd van 2012 smajgl et al 2015 the challenge of either attempting to adapt to climate change or sustaining local development is unfolded in social and ecological systems of the vmd chapman and darby 2016 moreover land subsidence rates which exceeded sea level rise at some locations in the delta erban et al 2014 will likely worsen the flooding situation the mekong floodplains and delta are responsible for a large proportion of the agricultural and fisheries production in vietnam and cambodia hortle 2007 gso 2013 fish catch in the region provided up to 75 of protein demands in cambodia contributes significantly to the subsistence of local livelihoods nuorteva et al 2010 keskinen et al 2011 given the high dependency of the region s livelihoods on water resources the consequences of development of upstream and localized water infrastructure on the hydrological regime should be carefully examined in conjunction with sea level rise and land subsidence 3 methodology to study the impact of water infrastructure development sea level rise and land subsidence in the large and tidal influenced mekong floodplains and delta the hydrodynamic model dhi mike 11 was chosen the software was applied in previous studies in the mekong floodplains and delta nguyen et al 2011 nguyen et al 2015 smajgl et al 2015 and a detailed hydraulic network for the whole mekong floodplains and delta was available from the institute for water and environment research vietnam fig 2 a the model was developed during the time the main author worked at the institute it was used for unpublished work and it was further calibrated and validated for the aim of this study 3 1 hydraulic network the hydraulic network includes the region from kratie in cambodia to the estuarine boundary in vietnam fig 2a the network has 25 427 nodes making 3586 branches and link channels the network is sufficiently detailed to resolve the floodplain hydraulics at the regional scale surveyed cross sections an example in fig 2b collected from different projects represent segments of river channels and other flowing water bodies because the floodplains were divided into compartments enclosed by dykes overland flows on each compartment were simulated by link channels with the storage capacity obtained from the 90 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem also used in nguyen et al 2011 and smajgl et al 2015 the link channels used the relationship between elevation and terrestrial volume of the compartments within those areas between main channels to simulate flooding storage capacity nguyen et al 2011 described this method in their studies but they used cross sections to simulate terrestrial parts of the floodplains using the relationship between elevation and volume as done in this study has the advantage that the model can take into consideration the storage capacity of whole compartments where applicable link channels were connected with the river system by control structures fig 2c catchment runoff from precipitation was simulated by the integrated mike11 nam model in which the floodplains and delta were divided into 1819 sub catchments nam nedbør afstrømnings mode is a lumped catchment runoff model which has been widely used for research purposes e g madsen 2000 butts et al 2004 rainfall and evaporation data from 39 stations were used in the nam model to account for moisture content changes in each catchment the rainy season overlaps with the flood season in the floodplains when soil has high moisture content saturated conditions so all rainfall is assumed to contribute to run off hourly measured sea levels at 11 coastal stations were used as downstream boundaries fig 2a discharge boundaries were obtained from kratie dau tieng phuoc hoa and tri an stations and discharge data series at kratie were used as an upstream boundary of the mekong water level discharge evaporation and rainfall data were provided by the mekong river commission and the south region hydrology meteorology center of vietnam 3 2 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated with recorded water levels at 33 stations fig 1a these data sets were employed in previous studies of the impact of water infrastructure and climate changes on water levels cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 dang et al 2016 triet et al 2017 water levels instead of discharges were used to calibrate and validate the model because downstream from kratie the mekong s flow regime is highly influenced by the floodplains storage capacity mrc 2012 and overland flow velocity during the flood season are not accurately measured dang et al 2016 the calibration was done by adjusting manning s n roughness coefficient in waterways the values of manning s n in main river segments ranged from 0 016 to 0 024 and from 0 022 to 0 027 for secondary branches ranges are as recommended in chow 1959 roughness coefficients for floodplains link channels varied from 0 033 to 0 035 based on a land cover map source of data siwrp 2000 in order to validate the hydrodynamic model the nash sutcliffe coefficient e was used nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 e 1 t 1 n h t h m t 2 t 1 n h t h 2 where h is the mean of observed water levels ht and hmt are observed and modeled water level at time t respectively the model was calibrated manually on an hourly basis for the year 2000 and was validated for the years 1998 2001 and 2002 for the vmd 1998 was considered a dry year and 2000 2002 were wet years in the floodplains and delta mrc 2012 because the year 2007 marked the rapid development of high dykes for flood prevention in the vmd dang et al 2016 data for years after 2007 were not used for calibration and validation purposes preliminary analysis with available hourly water levels from 2007 to 2014 at phnom penh and kratie showed that tide had little impacts on water levels in these stations the use of daily water levels measured at 7 00 am and 7 00 pm for 1998 2000 2002 for the cambodian lowlands was thus sufficient for calibrating the model upstream of the vmd inundation patterns derived from the hydrodynamic model were validated with analogous information derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite images the product mod09a1 was downloaded at the peak time of the wet season in 2000 to generate maximum inundation maps as described in dang et al 2016 the inundation maps derived by the satellite images and model simulations were compared using the cohen s kappa coefficient smeeton 1985 which was calculated as following 2 k p 0 p e 1 p e where po is the relative observed agreement between flood maps calculated by the percentage of flooded and non flooded areas appearing in both maps pe is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement based on the percentage of flooded areas 3 p 0 p 11 p 00 4 p e p f l o o d e d p u n f l o o d e d 5 p f l o o d e d p 11 p 10 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 x p 11 p 01 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 6 p u n f l o o d e d p 00 p 10 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 x p 00 p 01 p 00 p 01 p 10 p 11 where p 11 is the number of flooded pixels in simulation and modis observation p 00 is the number of unflooded pixels in simulation and modis observation p 10 is the number of pixels which are flooded in simulation and unflooded in modis observation p 01 is the number of pixels which are unflooded in simulation and flooded in modis observation a cell was considered as a flooded cell if the water depth was more than 10 cm the tsf was not considered for this spatial evaluation because a large fraction of this semi natural floodplain is covered with varying types of vegetation canopies tall gallery forests grasslands and bush which can reduce the accuracy of the inundation pattern derived from modis nguyen et al 2013 3 3 hydrodynamic modeling scenarios in order to understand the impact of dams delta based water infrastructure sea level rise and land subsidence on the floodplains six different scenarios were simulated with the hydrological conditions of the dry 1998 normal 1999 and wet years 2000 as summarized in table 1 and described in detail as follows each driver was assessed independently to see how they impact on the floodplains this is so called a sensitivity based scenario neutral approach prudhomme et al 2010 this approach was also used in nguyen et al 2015 to study the impact of dams climate change and sea level rise on sedimentation in the vietnam mekong delta vmd dam and water infrastructure development plans may change in the future but the most critical cases were chosen to examine how far dam and dyke construction would affect the floodplains bl scenario the baseline scenario was based on the years 1998 1999 and 2000 which were the driest below 26 normal above 6 and wettest above 38 years on record respectively in terms of annual flood volume in the lower mekong basin over the past 50 years before the rapid development of water infrastructure in 2007 mrc 2012 hp scenario upstream flows were modified to simulate full hydropower development 126 dams as in lauri et al 2012 and arias et al 2014a and downstream boundaries were kept similar to the bl in this scenario monthly outflows from reservoirs were simulated to maximize energy production by optimally managing reservoir active storage using linear programming lp optimization lauri et al 2012 although the future development of dams may be uncertain the level of hydrological alterations caused by dams will range from the pristine condition bl scenario to this full dam development scenario wid scenario in the wid scenario the lxq por and mbr were protected by dykes for rice cultivation throughout the flood season as proposed in deltares 2013 fig 1b the so called food production scenario upstream and downstream boundaries conditions were maintained as in the bl a large proportion of the floodplains have been already protected by dykes 60 70 during the 1st decade of the 21 century and the effect of dykes on water levels along the main stream was demonstrated by historical data analysis in dang et al 2016 a future in which the whole upper vmd is protected for rice cultivation is thus very likely widr scenario this scenario was based on the wid scenario but it included a bypass in which water was transferred to neighboring areas fig 1c this was simulated by doubling river widths with the purpose of reducing the pressure of water infrastructure development on the hydrology of the protected regions which represented the major flood diversion scenario as in deltares 2013 ls scenario the land subsidence scenario was simulated by using the land subsidence map of erban et al 2014 land subsidence rates varied spatially and these were used to modify the topography srtm dem of the floodplains accordingly storage capacity of link channels was thus recalculated in many parts of the delta because the subsidence rate varied throughout the floodplains it was assumed that water extraction rates would be constant over the study period 2000 2050 and only vertical subsidence was considered as in erban et al 2014 the subsidence rates ranged from 0 to 4 cm per year and the areas where subsidence rates were high 1 cm per year included cities like can tho and the coastal part of the mekong delta slr scenario upstream discharges were similar to the bl scenario but downstream water level boundaries were increased based on measured data corresponding to the projected sea level rise in 2050 global sea level is predicted to rise in a range from 17 to 38 cm corresponding to different emission scenarios ipcc 2014 sea level rise was the focus of this scenario as it will likely be the driver of climate change effects in the delta as opposed to basin rainfall runoff a recent modeling effort by hoang et al 2016 projected climate change impacted water levels along the mekong but projected flow alterations at kratie were considered insignificant in the timeframe of this study up to 2050 3 4 indicators of hydrological alterations the modeling scenarios were analyzed for changes in 30 day minimum water levels 30 day maximum water levels monthly average water levels water level rise fall rates maximum flood extent and flood duration indicators which are frequently the most altered by water infrastructure development tockner and stanford 2002 these were also the indicators historically identified as having changed under the effects of water infrastructure in the mekong floodplains dang et al 2016 the non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to determine if sets of indicators derived from each scenario were different from each other as a quasi 2d hydrodynamic model was employed in this study in order to derive inundation maps the invert distance weighting idw method was used to interpolate between known water level points in the model 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation and regional classifications overall there was a good fit between observed and simulated water levels with nash sutcliffe coefficients e ranging from 0 61 to 0 98 through the study region fig 3 because of the minor influence of tides on water level fluctuations nash sutcliffe coefficients e were highest at stations in cambodia ranging from 0 70 to 0 98 in the vmd e coefficients ranged between 0 65 and 0 89 and were especially high for stations on the mekong and bassac rivers high correlation coefficients e 0 8 values were also found between modeling and measured water levels at the key stations for the calibration and validation years of 1998 and 2000 2002 fig s1 in supplemental data fig 4 a and b illustrate the inundation map derived from the mod09a1 product and the baseline simulation result from september 29 2000 this date was chosen to check the agreement between the two inundation maps because it was close to the date when the water level reached its maximum at tan chau september 23 2000 and the proportion of cloud cover was low pe 0 64 and po 0 83 resulting in a cohen s kappa of k 0 63 which indicated that the remotely sensed inundation map coincided well with the modeling inundation map the areas of similarity between the modis imagery and modeling results were large 83 fig 4c however land use also influenced the accuracy of the modis derived inundation maps fig 4e in the lower vmd while water levels were low orchard and built up area land uses in the region made the observations by the satellite become less accurate and contributed to the discrepancy between modis and the modeling results additionally in the middle and coastal parts of the delta water depths were shallow so satellite based inundation maps may be influenced by bottom reflectance and vegetation arguably the main source of uncertainties in this study came from the definition of channel network and river cross sections in the hydrodynamic model the model domain covers an extension of around 70 000 km2 creating a complex logistical challenge to collect thousands of cross sections of the river and canal network moreover the heterogeneity in the physiography of river catchments may cause different levels of water resistance resulting in different roughness coefficient even in a short river segment nevertheless the high correlation coefficient between modeling results and measured water levels increase the accuracy in modeling results it is important to note that the locations of the boundaries among the river dominated tidal and transitional regions were dynamic in the dry season water fluctuations were still observed at phnom penh but the magnitude of water levels fluctuation along the river from phnom penh to the region near the border between vietnam and cambodia were small less than 0 25 m fig 5 a and c thus the cambodia lowlands and the tonle sap floodplain can be classified as river dominant regions the vietnam mekong delta includes transitional and tidal regions the effects of tides on water levels in the coastal part of the delta are prominent in the flood season the upper vmd turns into a river dominated region fig 5b and d there is not much difference between the dry year fig 5a and c and the wet year fig 5b and d in terms of seasonal boundaries three key locations kampong cham tan chau and my thuan locations in fig 1 which are in each region were chosen to illustrate the impact of each scenario on monthly water levels and other hydrological indicators 4 2 future impacts on monthly mean water levels along the mekong mainstream modeling results showed that the magnitude of impacts of different drivers on water levels varied considerably from one region to another mean monthly water levels in the dry 1998 normal 1999 and wet 2000 years along the mekong river varied according to different scenarios simulated fig 6 hydropower dams hp scenario increased monthly mean water levels in the dry season and reduced monthly mean water levels in the wet season throughout the mekong mainstream from kampong cham tan chau to my thuan fig 6 in the wet year mean water levels increased by 25 5 in the dry months and decreased by 0 8 in the wet months at kampong cham compared to the bl scenario in the dry year the influence of hydropower on monthly water levels was observed dam operation increased water levels by 70 in the dry months and decreased water levels by 5 9 in the wet months this indicates that hydropower dams could affect water levels in a dry year more severely than in a wet year and in the dry season more heavily than in the wet season the difference in monthly water levels between bl and hp diminished downstream fig 6 in the middle and coastal parts of the vmd the difference in mainstream water levels between bl and hp was small less than 10 cm at my thuan fig 6c f and i statistically there were significant differences in monthly water levels from kratie to chau doc and tan chau observed between the bl and hp scenarios according to the kruskal wallis test p values 0 05 but the difference in monthly water levels from can tho and my thuan to the river mouth was insignificant p values 0 05 contrary to the effect of dams the impact of flood prevention systems on mainstream water levels was observed in the wet season in the normal and wet years fig 6e and h mean of monthly water levels were projected to increase by 15 about 0 4 m p values 0 05 at tan chau in the wet months from june to december in 2000 fig 6h and the mean of water level was predicted to increase by only 5 in the same period in 1998 fig 6b water levels were also expected to increase slightly by around 0 03 0 05 m at the lower stations of my thuan during the wet season in 1998 fig 6c and 2000 fig 6i the widening of canal systems in the vmd widr resulted in a maximum water level decrease of about 6 cm in the wet season at tan chau in the wet year fig 6h but did not affect water levels in other parts of the mainstream compared to the wid scenario sea level rise was the most important driver contributing to rising water levels p values 0 05 at my thuan if the sea level rose the expected 17 cm annual water levels at my thuan would increase about 10 cm and 12 cm during the dry year and the wet year respectively fig 6c and i sea level rise by 38 cm will cause an increase of 30 cm in the wet year at my thuan fig 6i this rise is nearly a three fold increase from the hp scenario projections modeling results suggests that hydrological regimes of the middle and the lower delta part of the mekong river would be much more heavily affected by the tidal regime than by upstream alterations although land subsidence increased water retention capacity in different parts of the floodplains monthly water levels with respect to mean sea levels did not change in the ls scenario at can tho and my thuan where the land subsidence rates were almost 4 cm year erban et al 2014 observed changes in water levels were minor fig 6 as expected modeling results showed that water level alterations in a normal year 1999 ranged between the changes in the driest year 1998 and a wettest year 2000 thus the analysis of the characteristics of the normal year are embedded in the range provided by the other two years analyzed 4 3 future impacts on maximum flooding extent and flood depth for the bl scenario maximum flood extent was about 54 000 km2 in the year 2000 of which 27 was in the tsl 18 in the cbl and 55 in the vmd full dam development is expected to reduce maximum flooding extent by 6 in the wet year 2000 fig 7 h and by 3 in the dry year 1998 fig 7b compared to the bl fig 7g and a however delta based water infrastructure sea level rise and land subsidence are expected to have greater effects in the vmd than in the cambodian lowlands fig 7c d e f i j k and l maximum water depths tend to decrease in the upper part of the mekong delta according to the hp scenarios but the impact of hydropower dams on the middle and coastal regions was very limited fig 8 in the wid scenario maximum water levels increased along the riverine corridor between the mekong and the bassac rivers to the east sea fig 8 maximum water level increased up to 1 0 m at the vietnam cambodia border but only increased by 0 1 0 3 m in the middle of the delta continuing future land subsidence ls scenario would be a major driver of change causing increased maximum water depths in the whole vietnamese delta although maximum water levels decreased the influence of land subsidence on the maximum flooding depths is more pronounced in the wet year rather than in the dry year the changes in flood depth are likely relative to the change in ground elevation rather than water levels which should be compared with a datum this is because the alterations in water levels are low as mentioned in the previous section the middle and coastal parts of the delta were heavily influenced by sea level rise overall the total extent of effected areas under the slr38 scenario in the vmd was about 32 500 km2 93 of the entire zone if sea level increases by 38 cm sea level rise had a very limited effect on maximum flood depths at por lxq and mbr fig 8 4 4 future impacts on flooding duration in general the total unflooded areas and the regions where the inundation time was greater than one month in the wet year 2000 were 1 45 times less than in the dry year 1998 hydropower dams hp scenario would not reduce the total extent of flooding but would reduce the length of inundation duration of those areas that are normally flooded for more than 6 months ie wetland areas fig 9 the construction of water infrastructure was predicted to increase agricultural land availability and this development decreased flooded areas by 6 during a dry year and increased permanent flooding areas 6 months the widening of canal systems should potentially decrease flooded areas caused by water infrastructure development by a factor from 1 11 to 1 16 sea level rise would prolong flooded time by about 25 and 36 in the 1998 and 2000 scenarios if sea level increases by 38 cm land subsidence would expand flooded areas by 21 in the dry year and 12 in the wet year and this phenomenon would exacerbate the permanent flooding areas 6 months by 32 in the 1998 scenario and 36 in the 2000 scenario 4 5 future impacts on annual hydrological alteration indicators changes to annual indicators of hydrological alterations along the mekong and bassac rivers are shown in table 2 overall the magnitude of changes varied spatially according to scenarios with hydropower bringing the largest alterations in the cambodian lowlands while sea level rise and water infrastructure development cause the greatest impacts on the vmd dams reduced the rise rate by up to 11 at kampong cham but the rates remained the same at tan chau and can tho water level fall rates meanwhile decrease by 11 at kampong cham in terms of extreme water levels full hydropower dam development increased 30 day minimum water levels by 74 at kampong cham and by 10 at can tho the development of water infrastructure development wid and widr in the form of flood prevention systems mostly changes rise fall rates and maximum water levels at tan chau the rise rates increase by approximate 11 and the fall rates decrease by 20 in the both scenarios in the wid scenario 30 day maximum water levels increase by about 15 17 at tan chau and can tho land subsidence does not change the 30 day minimum water levels but results in 30 day maximum water level declining about 4 5 at tan chau and can tho sea level rise on the other hand affects extreme water levels for examples if sea level rises 38 cm 30 day minimum water levels at phnom penh tan chau and can tho would increase by 14 15 cm 557 28 cm and 47 44 cm respectively 30 day maximum water levels do not change much along the river upstream of tan chau but from can tho to the river mouth it increases by 16 24 cm 5 discussion this study found that the results of the different scenarios of future alterations have different magnitudes and distinct characteristics in the cambodian lowlands versus the vietnam mekong delta a discuss of the implications for each of these two regions follows 5 1 hydrological changes in the cambodian lowlands hydropower dams increase water levels in the dry season and decrease water levels in the wet season in the upper floodplains because reservoirs retain water in the wet season for use in the dry season to extend generation output in the dry season water levels in the upper floodplain are strongly linked to the flow regimes because this is a river dominated region and dam operations would modify the hydrology of the mekong floodplains in a similar way as to what has recently occurred in the upper basin and upper part of the floodplains kummu and sarkkula 2008 piman et al 2012 cochrane et al 2014 lu et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 dams mainly changed water levels in the dry season fig 6 water level fluctuations and water levels rising and falling rates table 2 these hydrological alterations in the upper floodplains consequently may endanger riverine ecology and aquatic species hydropower is an attractive source of energy currently providing 16 6 of the global electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity ren21 2016 but it is causing tension between mekong countries and some of their main economic sectors increasing demand of electricity for economic development in china and south east asia countries resulting in 7 mainstream dams dachaoshan gongguoquiao nuozhadu jinghong manwan xayaburi and don sahong mrc database 2014 are examples of this on going tension consequently policy makers should have plans to confront the consequences on the floodplains and delta of upstream dam development this study also found that maximum flooding extent fig 7 maximum flooding depth fig 8 and inundation times fig 9 did not change much in the hp scenario compared to the bl the effect of dams reduces through the floodplains as the terrain becomes flatter the regulation effect of the tonle sap lake as described in arias et al 2014b may also contribute to this buffering effect 5 2 hydrological changes in the vmd in the vmd the main aim of localized flood prevention systems is to shift from double to triple crops but this activity may alter hydrological regimes in the region water infrastructure development did not always have positive outcomes in terms of total income chapman and darby 2016 however delta based water infrastructure could become the main driver of hydrological alterations in the wet season if the development of such systems is not well managed the influence of the system in the dry season is limited this is because water infrastructure has been developed in the region which is transferred from a transitional stage to a river dominated stage in the wet season fig 5 water infrastructure development modifies the delta hydrology in the wet season by two mechanisms redistributing water retention capacity and reducing water transfer capacity of the floodplains the development of high dykes to enable a third rice crop results in excess water that can be discharged to other regions and make local water levels to increase because the flood protection will limit areas to disperse water fig 7c the two main rivers bassac and mekong have much higher conveying capacity compared to canals thus water will mostly flow towards the vietnamese east sea and this lead to the increase of water levels in the middle delta and the neighboring basin fig 6c f and i additionally the m shaped semi diurnal tide of the vietnamese east sea enables easier water discharge to the east rather than to the west because of the diurnal tide of the vietnamese west sea van 2012 this process will require downstream provinces to build their own flood prevention systems which may then trigger another flood propagation process this study confirmed the finding in triet et al 2017 that the construction of dykes increased shift water levels downstream but we also found that there was the increase of local water levels this may be a result of the reduction in water transfer capacity of the floodplains the designation of freshwater conservation areas which can be managed for multiple purposes should be considered in the floodplains in order to prevent some of the water management issues expected to occur once all the factors of change begin to affect the vmd the widening of canals in the upper vmd illustrated in the widr scenario was considered as an approach to reduce the stress of water infrastructure development during the wet season this may increase the availability of water in the dry season for irrigation but the effect during the wet season would be only minor the transfer capacity of canals even when widened is limited compared to the two main rivers which overflow in the wet season and thus widening of the canals may not result in a significant advantage furthermore if water is transferred uncontrolledly to other regions it may stimulate flooding problems in those regions the changing in water balance among river basins requires a comprehensive inter basin investigation study the middle delta in vietnam is a transitional region where water levels will increase by the influence from upstream systems and downstream sea level rise the influence of sea level rise on water levels is higher than that caused by upstream infrastructure development by either dams or localized water infrastructure the reason for this is that the middle delta has a dense canal system which drains water easily but this canal system also makes sea water easy to penetrate into the delta and a sea level rise of 38 cm will impact 93 of the region in the tidal region or the coastal part of the vmd sea level rise will be the only driver of hydrological alterations land subsidence at the rate up to 4 cm year erban et al 2014 causes significant increases in flood depths but this phenomenon does not change baseline water levels land subsidence theoretically increases water retention capacity in various parts of the delta however because subsiding lands mostly occur in the tidal regions land subsidence induced water storage has little impact on water levels in addition to changes in water levels in terms of quantity and timing due to impacts of water infrastructure development it is also important to consider the issue of water quality and fluvial geomorphology kondolf and rubin 2014 chapman and darby 2016 flooding in the wet season brings with its nutrients attached in alluvium laden water kakonen 2008 dams for example would lessen sediment movement downstream about 55 100 of the 160 200 106 ton year pearse smith 2012 kondolf and rubin 2014 this could lead to a reduction of the sediment bound nutrients delivered from the mekong in the floodplains whether high dykes would offer poor farmers a significant improvement in livelihoods howie 2011 hoanh et al 2014 or would only create short term and negligible benefits chapman and darby 2016 it is clear that high dykes would change the availability of nutrients in protected areas the effort to control water would result in increases in agrochemicals usage and may harm poor farmers who cannot afford them fertilizers and flood prevention systems kakonen 2008 further interdisciplinary research is needed to address the complex relationships between water infrastructure development and social economic and environmental issues 6 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that the impacts of water infrastructure sea level rise and land subsidence on water levels in the mekong floodplains vary depending on the hydrological characteristics of each region thus well planned comprehensive water management strategies will be needed in each region in the cambodian lowlands which are mostly a river dominated region any alterations in hydrological regimes caused by the development of hydropower dams would have a direct effect on water levels hydropower reservoirs which may impact on seasonal water levels fluctuations and water levels rising and falling rates would need to be operated under regimes to minimize the impact on the region in the upper vietnamese delta the impact of delta based water infrastructure on hydrological regimes is more significant than other factors in the wet season but sea level rise will be the main driver in the dry season in the wet season dykes may not only affect water storage capacity but also water transfer capacity of the floodplains while efforts to widen the current canal systems to mitigate the impact of dykes would have limited effect in relieving impacts water storage areas should be maintained to reduce possible impact of localized water infrastructure development finally land subsidence and sea level rise will have the greatest effect on both the middle delta and coastal areas of the vmd and the vulnerability of flooding in the delta would increase in the coming years a combination of strategies such as sea dyke establishment reductions in groundwater pumping and mangrove forests restoration should be considered to alleviate water management issues in this large and important region acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the

8529,study region the athabasca river basin arb with its head waters located within the canadian rockies study focus investigating the snow response of the athabasca watershed to projected climate using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model and statistically downscaled future climate data from a selected set of cmip5 gcms forced with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios new hydrological insights for the region high resolution end of century projections of swe over the athabasca watershed show an overall decreasing trend in the mean monthly swe over the watershed with the largest decreases occurring in march and april especially in the high elevation sub basin there are also widespread decreases in annual maximum swe swemax with the middle basin showing slight increases under the rcp4 5 scenario the dates of swemax are generally getting earlier with rcp4 5 showing a less linear response than rcp8 5 increases in early spring snowmelt are followed by decreases during the late spring and summer months mainly as a result of earlier start of snowmelt an overall decrease in snow cover duration of up to fifty days is projected with the largest decrease occurring in the high elevation sub basin such projected declines in snow water storage and a shift to earlier peak swe and snowmelt over the arb have significant implications for the magnitude and timing of the watershed soil moisture content and hydrologic regime of the athabasca river keywords climate change snow cover swe snow melt athabasca watershed vic model 1 introduction snowfall and seasonal snow cover are important components of the hydrologic cycle in cold regions because of their strong linkages with the regional climate and hydrology through their significant effects on energy and moisture budgets specifically snow cover depth plays a significant role because of its water storage effect and role in generating spring snowmelt streamflow originating from mountainous headwater catchments are primarily dependent on snow accumulation and melt from the higher elevations which provide the major contributions to total basin flow after the snowmelt various processes such as refreezing of water within the cold snow cover marsh and woo 1985 and frozen soil infiltration gray et al 1985 will affect the movement of water into the soil column below and to the stream channels the relatively high albedo and low thermal conductivity of snow cover also have major influences on surface energy exchanges and the ground thermal regime with important consequences for snowmelt and soil hydraulic properties after reviewing the potential impacts of a warming climate in snow dominated regions barnett et al 2005 indicated that less winter precipitation will occur as snow and the melting of winter snow will occur earlier in the spring berghuijs et al 2014 have also indicated that one of the most widely anticipated changes in the hydrological cycle is the temperature induced shift of precipitation from snow to rain that will affect snowpacks mostly in the mid to later part of the snow season this shift has the potential to alter the frequency of rain on snow events that have a number of implications for hydrological processes over the land surface including snow melt and streamflow cohen et al 2015 snow response to projected changes in temperature and precipitation in northern and alpine dominated watersheds is complex with the rate and sign of changes varying with local climate regime and elevation locally snow water equivalent swe responds to changes in both precipitation and air temperature and the magnitude and seasonal characteristic of the change depends on the various interplay between a shortened snow accumulation period the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow and the frequency and intensity of winter thaw events räisänen 2008 brown and mote 2009 beniston and stoffel 2016 identified that rain on snow events are major drivers of alpine flood events and future trends show that these events may increase as a first response to sustained warming but may decline thereafter a global scale assessment of mountainous systems by huss et al 2017 shows the major shifts in seasonal runoff regimes around the world that will result from the effect of reduced snow cover and ice based on recent evidence over the european alps marty et al 2017 also reported a widespread reduction in snow mass which is more pronounced for spring than for winter with even the highest elevation sites showing a decline in spring swe using recently updated data to provide a comprehensive view of climate variability and long term changes for the period of instrumental record over canada vincent et al 2015 reported a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow in the south fewer days with snow cover an earlier start of the spring high flow season and an increase in april streamflow all consistent with the observed warming and precipitation trends they have also demonstrated that the different modes of low frequency variability resulting from atmospheric teleconnections modulate the spatial distribution and strength of the trends however they alone cannot explain the observed long term trends in these climate variables most of the major rivers crossing the canadian prairies originate in the rocky mountains where deep snowpacks and melting glaciers maintain river and groundwater supplies schindler and donahue 2006 however quantifying the volume of snow on the ground is challenging owing to its high spatial variability and sparse surface observations as well as difficulties in retrieving relevant snow information from raw satellite data long term observational data sets for snow cover extent have only recently been reconciled and considerable observational uncertainty remains brown et al 2010 lapp et al 2005 have demonstrated that the projected increase in winter precipitation over the upper oldman river basin in southwestern alberta will not compensate for regional changes in the rain to snow ratios and the net result will be a decline in winter accumulations of precipitation as snow and hence an expected decline in spring runoff pomeroy et al 2015 have reported that a 2 c warming in the canadian rockies will lead to a shift from snowfall to rainfall dominance a substantial decline in snowpack magnitude and a shortening of the duration of snow season at all elevations however in many regions including the athabasca river basin the spatial and seasonal response of swe to a warming climate has not been addressed in detail with most previous studies focusing only on season average or annual maximum swe swemax the main objective of this paper is to present the findings of a detailed investigation conducted as part of the governments of alberta and canada joint oil sands monitoring program josmp 2012 on the athabasca watershed snow response to a changing climate with its head waters located within the canadian rockies snow accumulation and melt constitute a larger proportion of the athabasca river discharge which plays an important role in sustaining aquatic habitats and in supporting various industrial activities in the region the scenario based study is conducted using the variable infiltration capacity vic process based and distributed hydrologic model liang et al 1994 and the cmip5 climate projection maloney et al 2014 the vic model has been used in numerous climate studies including evaluation of declines in western snowpack mote et al 2005 mao et al 2015 and it has also been successfully applied for evaluating the effects of climate change on hydrologic regimes for watersheds with different basin size climatology and hydrologic processes cuo et al 2011 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 elsner et al 2010 werner et al 2013 the vic performance in modelling snow over the athabasca watershed is first evaluated by comparing the swe values simulated using gridded observed climate data with measured swe data from snow course observations as well as an observation based gridded snow product over the baseline period this is followed by an assessment of the projected changes in the driving hydro climatic variables temperature and precipitation over the watershed using the bias corrected and spatially downscaled climate projections from the latest cmip5 data set the cmip5 daily precipitation and temperature data were also used to drive the vic model to simulate the hydrologic response of the athabasca river basin arb for the baseline and future periods and compute the projected changes in the swe over the entire watershed this analysis focuses primarily on the spatial and seasonal changes in the magnitude and timing of the mean monthly and annual maximum swe snowmelt and snow cover duration scd in the 21 st century corresponding to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios the study area considered for this analysis the arb is described in section 2 followed by a description of the hydrologic modelling approach and the input data sets in section 3 the results of the investigation are presented and discussed in section 4 and a summary of key findings and final conclusions are presented in section 5 2 studied basin description the athabasca river basin arb originates in the canadian rockies from the athabasca glacier at over 3700 m above mean sea level amsl and flows approximately 1500 km north eastward to lake athabasca at 187 m amsl its total drainage area attains approximately 156 000 km2 near old fort before it flows into lake athabasca mean annual precipitation in the watershed ranges from around 300 mm at the downstream end near lake athabasca to over 1000 mm at the high elevation head waters the arb has been divided into three hydro physiographic regions based on differing climatic hydrologic and topographic characteristics northern river basins study 2002 ramp 2008 the three corresponding sub basins along with their topographic characteristics are depicted in fig 1 the upper basin is characterized by mountainous topography and an alpine hydrologic regime dominated by significant snow and glacier ice melt the middle basin consists of rolling foothills dominated by boreal forest and is the origin of three major tributaries mcleod pembina and lesser slave rivers the lower basin begins at fort mcmurray where the river is joined by the clearwater river and includes several smaller tributaries such as the steepbank muskeg and firebag rivers flowing from the east and the mackay and ells rivers from the west all three sub basins display a typical nival hydrologic regime with low flows during the snow accumulation period of late autumn to early spring november to march and higher spring flows typically starting in april when air temperatures rise above 0 c table 1 summarizes the physiographic and hydro climatic characteristics for the upper middle and lower sub basins including the percentage of each reach with respect to the total drainage area and the corresponding runoff coefficient depicting the generated runoff as a percentage of the total precipitation in each region the athabasca river plays an important role in sustaining aquatic habitats and in supporting various industrial activities such as utilities mining and bitumen extraction in northern alberta cema 2006 the viability of all these industrial activities in the region depends on water availability that could be affected by alterations to the basin snow regime resulting from a changing regional climate 3 data and methods this study is conducted by running a calibrated vic model eum et al 2017 with observation based daily gridded temperature and precipitation data and comparing the modelled swe against observed snow surveys and observation based gridded snow products over the 1981 2010 baseline period to determine the ability of the model to simulate observed swe this is followed by running a set of vic model simulations with bias corrected and statistically downscaled cmip5 daily temperature and precipitation data for the 1981 2010 1990s baseline and two 30 year future periods 2041 2070 1950s 2071 2100 2080s and computing projected change in monthly mean swe magnitudes and dates of swemax snowmelt and scd a detailed description of the climatic drivers and the hydrologic model used in this study are presented below 3 1 climatic drivers 3 1 1 observation based gridded data this study employed high spatial resolution gridded daily precipitation and air temperature data for driving forcing a hydrologic model of the athabasca watershed during a calibration and validation baseline period eum et al 2017 the gridded data set which includes daily precipitation and minimum maximum air temperature was developed by applying a thin plate smoothing splines anusplin technique to station observations hutchinson 2004 hopkinson et al 2011 the anusplin data generated by natural resource canada provides a daily gridded data set covering the period from 1951 to 2010 at 10 km resolution over canada taking into account complex spatial patterns in elevation and weather station density hutchinson et al 2009 a previous study has found that this data set provides one of the most reliable long term high resolution gridded hydro climatic data for the athabasca watershed eum et al 2014a therefore the anusplin daily precipitation and temperature data has been used as climatic drivers of the vic hydrologic model during the calibration validation period as well as for statistical downscaling of the cmip5 global climate models gcms over both the historical and future periods 3 1 2 climate model projections hydrologic projections of future conditions are typically generated by forcing well calibrated hydrologic models with global and regional climate projections that are based on a range of emissions scenarios such as from the latest representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 the latest generation of gcm projections originate from the cmip5 long term experimental runs corresponding to the four different levels of concentrations rcp2 5 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in which the labels of rcp represent an approximation of the radiative forcing in the year 2100 taylor et al 2012 murdock et al 2013 suggested twelve representative cmip5 gcms to fully capture future climate variability for the western north america wna region the ranking of the models which differs by region is carried out to provide the widest spread range in projected future climate for smaller subsets of the full ensemble cannon 2015 the present study uses statistically downscaled data from the top six of the twelve gcms corresponding to mid range mitigation rcp4 5 and high emissions rcp8 5 scenarios that represent a wider range of climate extremes and seasonal means of precipitation and temperature table 2 presents the six gcms from the cmip5 experiment used in this study 3 1 3 statistical downscaling of climate model projections murdock et al 2013 compared the skills of different statistical downscaling sd techniques based on sequencing distribution and spatial pattern related indicators and recommended two of the more reliable sd techniques the bias correction spatial downscaling bcsd maurer and hidalgo 2008 and the bias correction climate imprint bcci hunter and meentemeyer 2005 for regional applications over canada these two sd techniques were adopted by the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic at the university of victoria to downscale the climate scenario data for precipitation as well as daily minimum and maximum air temperature covering the period 1951 2100 to a 10 km spatial resolution using the anusplin data for the 1951 2010 reference period werner and cannon 2016 the bcsd method is an empirical statistical technique in which the monthly precipitation and temperature output from a gcm are downscaled using a quantile based mapping of the probability density functions for the monthly gcm precipitation and temperature onto those of gridded observed data spatially aggregated to the gcm scale daily results at high spatial resolution are obtained by spatial and temporal disaggregation using rescaled randomly sampled historical observations the same low to high resolution mapping is applied to future gcm projections to generate statistically downscaled climate data corresponding to the various emissions scenarios the bcci method on the other hand uses long term averages i e 30 years from the high resolution observational data as a spatial imprint to represent spatial gradients the ratio of daily gcm precipitation values to the long term average monthly climatology of the baseline period is multiplied by the corresponding fine scale monthly values for a location to get the daily precipitation the procedure is similar for minimum and maximum temperature except values are calculated as the difference instead of the ratio between the monthly mean and the daily value hunter and meentemeyer 2005 finally the method applies quantile mapping as a post processing step to the interpolated fine scale outputs based on the six cmip5 gcms identified earlier this modelling study employs a total of 24 climate projections 6 gcms 2 rcps rcp4 5 rcp8 5 2 downscaling methods bcci bcsd to investigate the snow response of the athabasca watershed to projected climate change evaluation of the accuracy of these statistically downscaled climate data over western canada and including the athabasca watershed by dibike et al 2017 showed that the downscaled temperature and precipitation data were able to replicate the corresponding gridded historic data set over the baseline period giving confidence in applying the data set for this study 3 2 the vic hydrologic model the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model is a process based and spatially distributed macro scale hydrologic model that simulates the water and energy balances necessary to accurately account for cold climate hydrologic processes such as snow accumulation snowmelt and infiltration into frozen ground and to simulate the soil atmosphere transfer processes based on prescribed land cover and three soil layers liang et al 1994 1996 specifically it employs an energy balance approach to represent snow accumulation and ablation on the ground andreadis et al 2009 the model contains an explicit canopy snow interception scheme that accounts for sublimation drip and release of intercepted snow based on the leaf area index lai ground snow accumulation and melt are simulated using a two layer energy balance model in which the snowpack is divided into two layers a thin surface layer and the underlying pack layer and all the important heat and energy fluxes are considered anderson 1968 additionally each grid cell is subdivided into elevation bands that represent the effect of sub grid topography on snow accumulation and melt through orographic controls on precipitation and temperature at each time step the model calculates the rain or snow fraction that is added to the snowpack there are several energy fluxes involved in the melting of snow that can act in opposing directions that is either delivering heat to or removing heat from the snowpack all those energy fluxes are then calculated and if the energy balance is positive melt occurs snowmelt is water produced by the melting of snowpack and if the liquid water holding capacity of both the surface and pack layers are exceeded then the excess liquid water is immediately released as snowpack outflow the features of such process based modelling allow the extrapolation of plausible hydrologic processes corresponding to future climate projections ludwig et al 2009 mote et al 2016 compared statewide average april 1st swe from snow course measurements over each of the three u s pacific states of california oregon and washington with the corresponding vic simulations and found them to be highly correlated with correlation coefficients of 0 92 0 94 eum et al 2014a b have also applied the vic model version 4 1 2 to the athabasca river basin at 1 16 grid resolution using 3 hourly disaggregated anusplin precipitation and air temperature data as well as surface pressure wind speed specific humidity shortwave and longwave radiation data from the north american regional reanalysis narr because the cmip5 climate projections used in this study have been downscaled based on the anusplin data at 10 km resolution only three variables daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin are available for long term hydrologic simulations in recognition of this eum et al 2017 2016 previously applied the vic model over the entire athabasca watershed and to one of its sub basins the muskeg river basin using those variables from the anusplin and statistically downscaled cmip5 climate model projections receiving the daily tmax tmin and precipitation values vic is able to empirically estimate the other energy flux terms over the basin based on geographic coordinates and topographic information this study also used the eum et al 2017 setup of the vic hydrologic model over the athabasca watershed with more emphasis on the analysis of the snow response to the projected climate 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrologic model calibration validation the vic hydrologic model calibration and validation for the athabasca watershed was performed using daily discharge data from seven hydrometric stations for the periods 1985 1997 and 1998 2010 respectively eum et al 2017 five soil and baseflow parameters which are most sensitive to runoff generation demaria et al 2007 and that would considerably affect hydrologic responses for snow dominated environments shi et al 2008 bennett et al 2012 as well as two routing model parameters were calibrated to minimize a multi objective function consisting of the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient and a normalized form of root mean square error rmsenormal computed from the daily observed and simulated streamflow the performance of the vic model to replicate the mean daily discharge of the athabasca river mainstem during both the calibration and validation periods is summarized in table 3 for more information see eum et al 2014b 2017 with the best ns value being one the vic model ns values for the calibration period range between 0 78 and 0 90 while it varies between 0 74 and 0 80 for the validation period similarly with the best rmsenormal value being zero the corresponding values for the calibration and validation period range between 0 27 0 33and 0 27 0 35 respectively the calibrated vic model was then run with the high resolution anusplin gridded climate data for the period 1981 2010 fig 2 presents the comparison of observed swe values obtained from alberta environment and park s snow course measurement sites at three locations from the upper middle and lower sub basins of the athabasca watershed with the vic simulated swe values at grid points nearest to each of the three sites the comparisons are plotted for the 1981 2000 period during which there is a good record of swe observations that covers a range of conditions with both high and low swe and especially those years with lower swe values that most probably correspond with the warm winters of the future scenarios the maximum observed swe is close to 300 mm for the marmot jasper station in the upper sub basin while it is in the range of 100 mm and 150 mm for the barrhead west and embarras port stations located in the middle and lower sub basins respectively the vic simulated swe values clearly show these same regional differences although the model slightly overestimates swe values in the upper reaches and sometimes underestimate them in the lower reaches mean absolute errors mae between the observed and the vic simulated swe values are calculated to be 20 9 19 5 and 75 5 mm corresponding to the station located in the lower middle and upper sub basins respectively these differences could be explained partly by the fact that the simulated results are average values over each model grid but not point values exactly at the same location as the observing stations while uncertainty in the observed swe values could also have played a role the other factor could be the fact that all the parameters needed for the snow energy balance calculation have to be derived from the three primary forcings precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature used in this study comparison is also made between the vic simulated monthly mean swe values and observation based gridded snow product to see the broader special and seasonal validations as shown in fig 3 the observation based gridded snow climatology for the 1981 2010 baseline period was deriving by combining the atmospheric model intercomparison project amip2 monthly swe product that covers the 1979 1997 period brown et al 2003 with the canadian meteorological centre cmc monthly swe estimates for the 1998 2010 period brown et al 2010 while the vic simulation resulted in slightly lower monthly mean swe especially at the high elevation region of the watershed it was able to reproduce the overall spatial and seasonal pattern of the observation based amip2 cmc swe analysis product these validation results are considered to provide sufficient confidence for using the cmip5 driven vic hydrologic model projections to evaluate the long term to end of 21 st century spatial and seasonal variations in projected change in swe over the athabasca watershed 4 2 climate change scenarios the projected changes in seasonal winter december february spring march may summer june august autumn september november mean precipitation and air temperature over the athabasca river basin are shown as a scatter plot in fig 4 the figure shows projected changes as percentage differences for precipitation and absolute differences for air temperature calculated as the average of tmin and tmax between the 1990s baseline 1981 2010 and the two future periods of 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 based on the statistically downscaled data from the six cmip5 gcms projections corresponding to the two emission scenarios i e rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 spatially averaged over the athabasca river basin the plots show projected increases in both precipitation and air temperature over the region except in the summer season when some models project decreases in precipitation and one model even decreases in air temperature the ensemble mean values for projected change in mean annual precipitation temperature in the basin for the rcp4 5 scenario in 2050s and 2080s are 6 8 2 7 c and 12 5 3 2 c while the corresponding values for rcp8 5 scenarios are 9 7 3 3 c and 14 4 5 6 c respectively fig 4 also shows that the inter model variability in the climate projections becomes larger with increasing emission concentrations and projection horizons however there is a strong agreement among all the models that the highest increase in temperature is projected to occur in winter while the highest projected increase in precipitation is in spring this is also evident in figure a 1 of the suplementary material which shows the highest projected increase in the ensemble mean monthly precipitation occurring in may and june and decreases in july and august considering the spatial variations in projected precipitation changes over the watershed also reveals that the highest increases in most seasons occur primarily in the upper alpine portions of the basin 4 3 snow response to projected climate the potential response of the athabasca watershed snow regime to a changing climate is investigated by forcing the calibrated validated vic model with the statistically downscaled cmip5 climate projections for the baseline and the two future periods then the ensemble mean changes in the monthly mean swe magnitude and date of swemax snowmelt and scd values between the baseline and future periods corresponding to each of the two emissions scenarios are computed over the basin the inter model variabilities in the projected changes in swe values are also presented in the supplementary material provided with this paper 4 3 1 changes in monthly mean swe the ensemble mean projected changes in mean monthly swe at each grid point over the athabasca watershed are calculated by averaging the changes in mean monthly swe values between the baseline 1990s and each of the two future periods 2050s and 2080s corresponding to each of the 12 sets of climatic drivers fig 5 presents the snow response over the watershed corresponding to both the rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 emissions scenarios the results corresponding to the rcp 4 5 scenario indicate that while there are projected increases in swe in some parts of the athabasca watershed during the winter months from december to february projections for all the spring months over the whole watershed as well as some parts of the watershed in the winter months show substantial decline in monthly mean swe the slight increases in swe during the winter months are attributable to the projected increase in winter precipitation and the generally below freezing winter temperature in the region in case of the rcp8 5 scenario the model projects an overall decrease in swe in both winter and spring seasons over all parts of the watershed the decreases in swe corresponding to rcp8 5 are also generally higher than those for rcp4 5 the swe decrease over high elevation portions of the upper basin even extends to the summer and fall seasons for both emission scenarios in general while winter and spring precipitation in the region is projected to increase it would not be able to compensate the effect of rising temperature in terms of reduced solid precipitation and enhanced melting of the snowpack the regional differences in swe response to the projected climate are also depicted in fig 6 where the areal mean values of the ensemble monthly projected changes in swe are plotted for each of the upper middle and lower sub basins of the watershed the results show that while the decrease in swe for the upper sub basin occurs over the whole year owing to the fact that the high elevation alpine areas in this region are covered by snow for most of the year the largest decreases will be for the months of april may and june with the monthly mean decreases by the end of this century ranging between 18 mm to 64 mm swe varying with the selected emissions scenario the projected decreases for the middle and lower sub basins are relatively lower than that of the upper sub basin and are mainly in april and may ranging between 6 mm to 26 mm in monthly mean swe in all regions the rcp8 5 scenario generally results in a higher decrease in monthly mean swe especially during the 2080s period however there are also inter model variations in the projected change in swe especially for the winter and spring months and the variability is highest over the high elevation region of the upper sub basin as shown in fig a 2 of the supplementary materials one can also see in fig a 2 the differences between the results corresponding to each of the two sd methods used to downscale the climatic drivers in general the hydrologic model projections with the bcsd data shows higher decrease in swe values during the winter and spring months compared to those with the bcci data and over the upper sub basin the differences in projected changes between the two sd methods are as big as and some times more than those between the different gcms box and whisker plots of the ensemble mean monthly swe values for the baseline and future periods for each of the three sub basins are also presented in fig a 3 of the supplementary materials the figure shows that the relative magnitudes of the projected changes in the monthly mean swe values are quite significant as compared to their inter annual variability the inter annual variability in the monthly mean sew for the future periods remain more or less the same as the baseline period except for the months of february and march over the middle and upper sub basins where the variability increases slightly for the future periods 4 3 2 changes in swemax in most part of the athabasca watershed the swemax usually occurs in the winter months of february and march although there may be some inter annual and regional variations from those months fig 7 a presents the ensemble mean projected changes in the swemax value over the athabasca watershed and the results under the rcp4 5 emissions scenario show a small projected increase in the order of 1 10 mm in the swemax values in most parts of the middle sub basins most probably due to the precipitation increase during winter while other parts of the upper and lower sub basins show a slight decrease or no change at the same time some very high elevation areas in the upper sub basin could experience relatively higher decreases in the order of 30 50 mm in their swemax this result is consistent with those in fig 5 that show slight increases in mean monthly swe values in some regions of the athabasca watershed during the winter months and the generally below freezing winter temperatures in the case of the rcp8 5 emissions scenario the model projected some decreases in swemax over most part of the upper sub basin with slight or no change in most part of the middle and lower sub basins by the 2050s however by the 2080s under the rcp8 5 emissions scenario all parts of the athabasca watershed are projected to experience substantial decreases in the swemax ranging from 5 mm to over 50 mm depending on the region with the largest decrease occurring in the upper sub basin these results are consistent with some earlier suggestions stewart 2009 that increases in cold season precipitation could mask the effects of climate warming until the warming is large enough to outweigh the effect of increased precipitation at which time snowpack may experience a sudden change the corresponding ensemble mean changes in the dates of swemax are also examined and presented in fig 7b the results show that the average date of swemax under the future climate will generally be earlier than that in the baseline climate while the magnitudes of the change varying between 3 to over 30 days depending on the location and climate scenario considered the projected changes for the 2050s and the 2080s under rcp4 5 scenario are relatively small ranging mostly between 3 15 days while the changes for the 2080s under the rcp8 5 scenario are relatively bigger ranging mostly between 15 to over 30 days in all the cases the high elevation region of the upper sub basin will experience the largest change in the date of swemax the box and whisker plots of the dates of swemax from all of the 12 gcms for the baseline and future periods presented in figure a 4 of the supplementary materials also indicate that the relative magnitude of the changes in the dates of swemax with respect to its inter annual variability are quite significant at each of the three sub basinns and for both climate scenarios additional analyses on projected changes in the march 1st and april 1st swe values are also presented in figures a 5 of the supplementary materials those results also indicate that while most regions corresponding to the rcp8 5 scenario and some regions corresponding to rcp4 5 emissions scenario show decreases in march 1st swe values almost all regions show decreases in the april 1st swe values for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios 4 3 3 changes in snowmelt while part of the overall decrease in swe is due to the decrease in the proportion of the total precipitation that falls in the form of snow solid precipitation the other important factor is the corresponding change in the snowmelt regime melt magnitude and timing over the basin both resulting from projected increases in air temperature fig 8 shows these projected changes in monthly snowmelt values over the athabasca watershed corresponding to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios and the two future periods compared to the 1990s baseline period the results indicate the general increase in snowmelt over the predominantly cold and snow covered months between november and march which are also expected to experience larger increases in air temperature the snow cover gets depleted more quickly by earlier spring melt hence there will be even less snow available on the ground to be melted resulting in decreases in snowmelt during the late spring months of april and may including the summer months for the upper sub basin there will also be a projected decrease in snowmelt for the early fall months of september and october most probably because of the decrease in snow fall as a result of the projected increase in temperature the regional difference in the snowmelt response to the changing climate is better visualised in fig 9 this figure shows a substantial change in the snowmelt regime over the high elevation alpine region of the upper basin with substantial increase in snowmelt and hence depletion of the available snow on the ground between november and april followed by a corresponding decrease in snowmelt between may and september while the projected change in the snowmelt regime for the middle and lower reaches of the basin shows similar pattern the magnitude of the changes are relatively smaller all these changes in the snowmelt regime will have significant effect on the soil moisture regime over the watershed that would in tern affect the flow regimes in all tributaries and the main stem of the athabasca river 4 3 4 changes in scd one other effect of climate change and the associated increase in temperature is the potential reduction in scd or the reduction in the average number of days with some snow on the ground in this analysis the average scd is calculated using a threshold of 1 mm swe to count the number of days with swe 1 mm within each model grid over the athabasca watershed notably while it is recognized that such a low swe value corresponds to minimal depths of either newly fallen light density snow e g 10 mm at ρ 100 kg m3 or well ripened melt phase snow e g 2 mm at ρ 500 kg m3 the objective here is to simply show the basic changes in the presence absence of snow in each model grid scd is computed from the vic swe output corresponding to each statistically downscaled gcm driver and each of the two emission scenarios for the baseline and the two future periods fig 10 a presents the spatial maps of ensemble mean scd changes that show an overall reduction in the projected scd over the athabasca watershed while the median scd for the baseline period is in the order of 200 days see fig a 6 in the supplementary materials fig 10b shows that the reduction in scd is generally in the order of 15 days to over 50 days by the 2080s with the largest decreases in the high elevation regions of the upper sub basin the reduction in scd corresponding to the rcp8 5 emissions scenario is also much higher than that of the rcp4 5 especially for the 2080s period 5 summary and conclusions the spatially distributed and process based land surface hydrologic model vic of the athabasca watershed driven by high resolution gridded climate data was generally able to reproduce the spatial and seasonal patterns of the observed as well as the observation based swe analysis data over the watershed for the 1981 2010 baseline period application of vic with a set of cmip5 gcm climate projections statistically downscaled to the same resolution of the observational gridded climate data project future trends in the magnitude and seasonality of the watershed snow cover while precipitation is projected to increase in all seasons except in summer the hydrologic model simulations resulted in an overall decreasing trend in swe over the entire watershed the largest decreases of up to 50 are expected in march and april with more decreases corresponding to the rcp8 5 than the rcp4 5 emissions scenarios the decreases in swe are generally higher in the upper high elevation regions than other parts of the watershed mainly because of the generally higher than average snow accumulation at higher elevations and their relatively strong response to the warming trend most of these changes are largely attributable to the overall increase in temperature projected over the region that would result in lower than normal proportion of precipitation falling as snow however swemax which usually occurs in february and march is projected to increase in some parts of the watershed mostly in the middle sub basin in the case of rcp4 5 scenario while it decreases throughout the watershed for the case of rcp8 5 scenario the projected increase in temperature also results in increasing snowmelt during winter and early spring months followed by decreases during the late spring months of april and may including the summer months for the upper sub basin all these changes will result in an overall decrease in the average scd in the order of 20 50 days for end of century scenarios with the biggest decrease being again in the upper high elevation portions of the watershed in general the overall projected reduction in snow cover over all regions of the athabasca watershed is introduced by the warm future climate that will reduce the average number of days with below freezing temperatures and lead to a portion of the precipitation shifting from snowfall to rainfall dominance the projected increases in winter and spring temperatures will also increase the rate of snow ablation and melt thereby reducing both the swe and scd over the entire watershed with the reductions being more pronounced in the high elevation alpine region of the upper sub basin the largest reductions in monthly mean swe however are projected to occur in march and april except in the upper sub basin where it extends from march to june moreover while the differences in the projected changes in swe and scd corresponding to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios are relatively small by the 2050s they are significantly larger by the 2080s the relatively small increases in the swemax over the middle sub basin of the watershed corresponding to the rcp4 5 scenario could be attributed to the projected increase in winter precipitation with a more moderate increase in temperature for that particular scenario the widespread decrease in swemax corresponding to the rcp8 5 scenario and especially during the 2080s indicate an enhanced response to higher emissions further into the future the average date of the swemax is also shifted to earlier period by about 3 to over 30 days depending on geographic location and end of century climate scenarios considered with the biggest shift being projected for the higher elevation region of the upper sub basin and rcp8 5 scenario however there are also significant inter model variabilities in the snow response to projected climate including those between the different sd approaches while the results presented in this study accounts some of the uncertainties resulting from different emission scenarios climate model projections and downscaling techniques a number of other uncertainties resulting from hydrologic model representation model parameter estimation etc may still remain all these changes in the snow accumulation and snowmelt regime over the athabasca watershed is expected to have huge implications on the magnitude and timing of the watershed soil moisture content and subsequently on the hydrologic regime of the athabasca river resulting in warming induced shifts in

8529,study region the athabasca river basin arb with its head waters located within the canadian rockies study focus investigating the snow response of the athabasca watershed to projected climate using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model and statistically downscaled future climate data from a selected set of cmip5 gcms forced with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios new hydrological insights for the region high resolution end of century projections of swe over the athabasca watershed show an overall decreasing trend in the mean monthly swe over the watershed with the largest decreases occurring in march and april especially in the high elevation sub basin there are also widespread decreases in annual maximum swe swemax with the middle basin showing slight increases under the rcp4 5 scenario the dates of swemax are generally getting earlier with rcp4 5 showing a less linear response than rcp8 5 increases in early spring snowmelt are followed by decreases during the late spring and summer months mainly as a result of earlier start of snowmelt an overall decrease in snow cover duration of up to fifty days is projected with the largest decrease occurring in the high elevation sub basin such projected declines in snow water storage and a shift to earlier peak swe and snowmelt over the arb have significant implications for the magnitude and timing of the watershed soil moisture content and hydrologic regime of the athabasca river keywords climate change snow cover swe snow melt athabasca watershed vic model 1 introduction snowfall and seasonal snow cover are important components of the hydrologic cycle in cold regions because of their strong linkages with the regional climate and hydrology through their significant effects on energy and moisture budgets specifically snow cover depth plays a significant role because of its water storage effect and role in generating spring snowmelt streamflow originating from mountainous headwater catchments are primarily dependent on snow accumulation and melt from the higher elevations which provide the major contributions to total basin flow after the snowmelt various processes such as refreezing of water within the cold snow cover marsh and woo 1985 and frozen soil infiltration gray et al 1985 will affect the movement of water into the soil column below and to the stream channels the relatively high albedo and low thermal conductivity of snow cover also have major influences on surface energy exchanges and the ground thermal regime with important consequences for snowmelt and soil hydraulic properties after reviewing the potential impacts of a warming climate in snow dominated regions barnett et al 2005 indicated that less winter precipitation will occur as snow and the melting of winter snow will occur earlier in the spring berghuijs et al 2014 have also indicated that one of the most widely anticipated changes in the hydrological cycle is the temperature induced shift of precipitation from snow to rain that will affect snowpacks mostly in the mid to later part of the snow season this shift has the potential to alter the frequency of rain on snow events that have a number of implications for hydrological processes over the land surface including snow melt and streamflow cohen et al 2015 snow response to projected changes in temperature and precipitation in northern and alpine dominated watersheds is complex with the rate and sign of changes varying with local climate regime and elevation locally snow water equivalent swe responds to changes in both precipitation and air temperature and the magnitude and seasonal characteristic of the change depends on the various interplay between a shortened snow accumulation period the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow and the frequency and intensity of winter thaw events räisänen 2008 brown and mote 2009 beniston and stoffel 2016 identified that rain on snow events are major drivers of alpine flood events and future trends show that these events may increase as a first response to sustained warming but may decline thereafter a global scale assessment of mountainous systems by huss et al 2017 shows the major shifts in seasonal runoff regimes around the world that will result from the effect of reduced snow cover and ice based on recent evidence over the european alps marty et al 2017 also reported a widespread reduction in snow mass which is more pronounced for spring than for winter with even the highest elevation sites showing a decline in spring swe using recently updated data to provide a comprehensive view of climate variability and long term changes for the period of instrumental record over canada vincent et al 2015 reported a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow in the south fewer days with snow cover an earlier start of the spring high flow season and an increase in april streamflow all consistent with the observed warming and precipitation trends they have also demonstrated that the different modes of low frequency variability resulting from atmospheric teleconnections modulate the spatial distribution and strength of the trends however they alone cannot explain the observed long term trends in these climate variables most of the major rivers crossing the canadian prairies originate in the rocky mountains where deep snowpacks and melting glaciers maintain river and groundwater supplies schindler and donahue 2006 however quantifying the volume of snow on the ground is challenging owing to its high spatial variability and sparse surface observations as well as difficulties in retrieving relevant snow information from raw satellite data long term observational data sets for snow cover extent have only recently been reconciled and considerable observational uncertainty remains brown et al 2010 lapp et al 2005 have demonstrated that the projected increase in winter precipitation over the upper oldman river basin in southwestern alberta will not compensate for regional changes in the rain to snow ratios and the net result will be a decline in winter accumulations of precipitation as snow and hence an expected decline in spring runoff pomeroy et al 2015 have reported that a 2 c warming in the canadian rockies will lead to a shift from snowfall to rainfall dominance a substantial decline in snowpack magnitude and a shortening of the duration of snow season at all elevations however in many regions including the athabasca river basin the spatial and seasonal response of swe to a warming climate has not been addressed in detail with most previous studies focusing only on season average or annual maximum swe swemax the main objective of this paper is to present the findings of a detailed investigation conducted as part of the governments of alberta and canada joint oil sands monitoring program josmp 2012 on the athabasca watershed snow response to a changing climate with its head waters located within the canadian rockies snow accumulation and melt constitute a larger proportion of the athabasca river discharge which plays an important role in sustaining aquatic habitats and in supporting various industrial activities in the region the scenario based study is conducted using the variable infiltration capacity vic process based and distributed hydrologic model liang et al 1994 and the cmip5 climate projection maloney et al 2014 the vic model has been used in numerous climate studies including evaluation of declines in western snowpack mote et al 2005 mao et al 2015 and it has also been successfully applied for evaluating the effects of climate change on hydrologic regimes for watersheds with different basin size climatology and hydrologic processes cuo et al 2011 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 elsner et al 2010 werner et al 2013 the vic performance in modelling snow over the athabasca watershed is first evaluated by comparing the swe values simulated using gridded observed climate data with measured swe data from snow course observations as well as an observation based gridded snow product over the baseline period this is followed by an assessment of the projected changes in the driving hydro climatic variables temperature and precipitation over the watershed using the bias corrected and spatially downscaled climate projections from the latest cmip5 data set the cmip5 daily precipitation and temperature data were also used to drive the vic model to simulate the hydrologic response of the athabasca river basin arb for the baseline and future periods and compute the projected changes in the swe over the entire watershed this analysis focuses primarily on the spatial and seasonal changes in the magnitude and timing of the mean monthly and annual maximum swe snowmelt and snow cover duration scd in the 21 st century corresponding to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios the study area considered for this analysis the arb is described in section 2 followed by a description of the hydrologic modelling approach and the input data sets in section 3 the results of the investigation are presented and discussed in section 4 and a summary of key findings and final conclusions are presented in section 5 2 studied basin description the athabasca river basin arb originates in the canadian rockies from the athabasca glacier at over 3700 m above mean sea level amsl and flows approximately 1500 km north eastward to lake athabasca at 187 m amsl its total drainage area attains approximately 156 000 km2 near old fort before it flows into lake athabasca mean annual precipitation in the watershed ranges from around 300 mm at the downstream end near lake athabasca to over 1000 mm at the high elevation head waters the arb has been divided into three hydro physiographic regions based on differing climatic hydrologic and topographic characteristics northern river basins study 2002 ramp 2008 the three corresponding sub basins along with their topographic characteristics are depicted in fig 1 the upper basin is characterized by mountainous topography and an alpine hydrologic regime dominated by significant snow and glacier ice melt the middle basin consists of rolling foothills dominated by boreal forest and is the origin of three major tributaries mcleod pembina and lesser slave rivers the lower basin begins at fort mcmurray where the river is joined by the clearwater river and includes several smaller tributaries such as the steepbank muskeg and firebag rivers flowing from the east and the mackay and ells rivers from the west all three sub basins display a typical nival hydrologic regime with low flows during the snow accumulation period of late autumn to early spring november to march and higher spring flows typically starting in april when air temperatures rise above 0 c table 1 summarizes the physiographic and hydro climatic characteristics for the upper middle and lower sub basins including the percentage of each reach with respect to the total drainage area and the corresponding runoff coefficient depicting the generated runoff as a percentage of the total precipitation in each region the athabasca river plays an important role in sustaining aquatic habitats and in supporting various industrial activities such as utilities mining and bitumen extraction in northern alberta cema 2006 the viability of all these industrial activities in the region depends on water availability that could be affected by alterations to the basin snow regime resulting from a changing regional climate 3 data and methods this study is conducted by running a calibrated vic model eum et al 2017 with observation based daily gridded temperature and precipitation data and comparing the modelled swe against observed snow surveys and observation based gridded snow products over the 1981 2010 baseline period to determine the ability of the model to simulate observed swe this is followed by running a set of vic model simulations with bias corrected and statistically downscaled cmip5 daily temperature and precipitation data for the 1981 2010 1990s baseline and two 30 year future periods 2041 2070 1950s 2071 2100 2080s and computing projected change in monthly mean swe magnitudes and dates of swemax snowmelt and scd a detailed description of the climatic drivers and the hydrologic model used in this study are presented below 3 1 climatic drivers 3 1 1 observation based gridded data this study employed high spatial resolution gridded daily precipitation and air temperature data for driving forcing a hydrologic model of the athabasca watershed during a calibration and validation baseline period eum et al 2017 the gridded data set which includes daily precipitation and minimum maximum air temperature was developed by applying a thin plate smoothing splines anusplin technique to station observations hutchinson 2004 hopkinson et al 2011 the anusplin data generated by natural resource canada provides a daily gridded data set covering the period from 1951 to 2010 at 10 km resolution over canada taking into account complex spatial patterns in elevation and weather station density hutchinson et al 2009 a previous study has found that this data set provides one of the most reliable long term high resolution gridded hydro climatic data for the athabasca watershed eum et al 2014a therefore the anusplin daily precipitation and temperature data has been used as climatic drivers of the vic hydrologic model during the calibration validation period as well as for statistical downscaling of the cmip5 global climate models gcms over both the historical and future periods 3 1 2 climate model projections hydrologic projections of future conditions are typically generated by forcing well calibrated hydrologic models with global and regional climate projections that are based on a range of emissions scenarios such as from the latest representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 the latest generation of gcm projections originate from the cmip5 long term experimental runs corresponding to the four different levels of concentrations rcp2 5 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in which the labels of rcp represent an approximation of the radiative forcing in the year 2100 taylor et al 2012 murdock et al 2013 suggested twelve representative cmip5 gcms to fully capture future climate variability for the western north america wna region the ranking of the models which differs by region is carried out to provide the widest spread range in projected future climate for smaller subsets of the full ensemble cannon 2015 the present study uses statistically downscaled data from the top six of the twelve gcms corresponding to mid range mitigation rcp4 5 and high emissions rcp8 5 scenarios that represent a wider range of climate extremes and seasonal means of precipitation and temperature table 2 presents the six gcms from the cmip5 experiment used in this study 3 1 3 statistical downscaling of climate model projections murdock et al 2013 compared the skills of different statistical downscaling sd techniques based on sequencing distribution and spatial pattern related indicators and recommended two of the more reliable sd techniques the bias correction spatial downscaling bcsd maurer and hidalgo 2008 and the bias correction climate imprint bcci hunter and meentemeyer 2005 for regional applications over canada these two sd techniques were adopted by the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic at the university of victoria to downscale the climate scenario data for precipitation as well as daily minimum and maximum air temperature covering the period 1951 2100 to a 10 km spatial resolution using the anusplin data for the 1951 2010 reference period werner and cannon 2016 the bcsd method is an empirical statistical technique in which the monthly precipitation and temperature output from a gcm are downscaled using a quantile based mapping of the probability density functions for the monthly gcm precipitation and temperature onto those of gridded observed data spatially aggregated to the gcm scale daily results at high spatial resolution are obtained by spatial and temporal disaggregation using rescaled randomly sampled historical observations the same low to high resolution mapping is applied to future gcm projections to generate statistically downscaled climate data corresponding to the various emissions scenarios the bcci method on the other hand uses long term averages i e 30 years from the high resolution observational data as a spatial imprint to represent spatial gradients the ratio of daily gcm precipitation values to the long term average monthly climatology of the baseline period is multiplied by the corresponding fine scale monthly values for a location to get the daily precipitation the procedure is similar for minimum and maximum temperature except values are calculated as the difference instead of the ratio between the monthly mean and the daily value hunter and meentemeyer 2005 finally the method applies quantile mapping as a post processing step to the interpolated fine scale outputs based on the six cmip5 gcms identified earlier this modelling study employs a total of 24 climate projections 6 gcms 2 rcps rcp4 5 rcp8 5 2 downscaling methods bcci bcsd to investigate the snow response of the athabasca watershed to projected climate change evaluation of the accuracy of these statistically downscaled climate data over western canada and including the athabasca watershed by dibike et al 2017 showed that the downscaled temperature and precipitation data were able to replicate the corresponding gridded historic data set over the baseline period giving confidence in applying the data set for this study 3 2 the vic hydrologic model the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model is a process based and spatially distributed macro scale hydrologic model that simulates the water and energy balances necessary to accurately account for cold climate hydrologic processes such as snow accumulation snowmelt and infiltration into frozen ground and to simulate the soil atmosphere transfer processes based on prescribed land cover and three soil layers liang et al 1994 1996 specifically it employs an energy balance approach to represent snow accumulation and ablation on the ground andreadis et al 2009 the model contains an explicit canopy snow interception scheme that accounts for sublimation drip and release of intercepted snow based on the leaf area index lai ground snow accumulation and melt are simulated using a two layer energy balance model in which the snowpack is divided into two layers a thin surface layer and the underlying pack layer and all the important heat and energy fluxes are considered anderson 1968 additionally each grid cell is subdivided into elevation bands that represent the effect of sub grid topography on snow accumulation and melt through orographic controls on precipitation and temperature at each time step the model calculates the rain or snow fraction that is added to the snowpack there are several energy fluxes involved in the melting of snow that can act in opposing directions that is either delivering heat to or removing heat from the snowpack all those energy fluxes are then calculated and if the energy balance is positive melt occurs snowmelt is water produced by the melting of snowpack and if the liquid water holding capacity of both the surface and pack layers are exceeded then the excess liquid water is immediately released as snowpack outflow the features of such process based modelling allow the extrapolation of plausible hydrologic processes corresponding to future climate projections ludwig et al 2009 mote et al 2016 compared statewide average april 1st swe from snow course measurements over each of the three u s pacific states of california oregon and washington with the corresponding vic simulations and found them to be highly correlated with correlation coefficients of 0 92 0 94 eum et al 2014a b have also applied the vic model version 4 1 2 to the athabasca river basin at 1 16 grid resolution using 3 hourly disaggregated anusplin precipitation and air temperature data as well as surface pressure wind speed specific humidity shortwave and longwave radiation data from the north american regional reanalysis narr because the cmip5 climate projections used in this study have been downscaled based on the anusplin data at 10 km resolution only three variables daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin are available for long term hydrologic simulations in recognition of this eum et al 2017 2016 previously applied the vic model over the entire athabasca watershed and to one of its sub basins the muskeg river basin using those variables from the anusplin and statistically downscaled cmip5 climate model projections receiving the daily tmax tmin and precipitation values vic is able to empirically estimate the other energy flux terms over the basin based on geographic coordinates and topographic information this study also used the eum et al 2017 setup of the vic hydrologic model over the athabasca watershed with more emphasis on the analysis of the snow response to the projected climate 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrologic model calibration validation the vic hydrologic model calibration and validation for the athabasca watershed was performed using daily discharge data from seven hydrometric stations for the periods 1985 1997 and 1998 2010 respectively eum et al 2017 five soil and baseflow parameters which are most sensitive to runoff generation demaria et al 2007 and that would considerably affect hydrologic responses for snow dominated environments shi et al 2008 bennett et al 2012 as well as two routing model parameters were calibrated to minimize a multi objective function consisting of the nash sutcliffe ns coefficient and a normalized form of root mean square error rmsenormal computed from the daily observed and simulated streamflow the performance of the vic model to replicate the mean daily discharge of the athabasca river mainstem during both the calibration and validation periods is summarized in table 3 for more information see eum et al 2014b 2017 with the best ns value being one the vic model ns values for the calibration period range between 0 78 and 0 90 while it varies between 0 74 and 0 80 for the validation period similarly with the best rmsenormal value being zero the corresponding values for the calibration and validation period range between 0 27 0 33and 0 27 0 35 respectively the calibrated vic model was then run with the high resolution anusplin gridded climate data for the period 1981 2010 fig 2 presents the comparison of observed swe values obtained from alberta environment and park s snow course measurement sites at three locations from the upper middle and lower sub basins of the athabasca watershed with the vic simulated swe values at grid points nearest to each of the three sites the comparisons are plotted for the 1981 2000 period during which there is a good record of swe observations that covers a range of conditions with both high and low swe and especially those years with lower swe values that most probably correspond with the warm winters of the future scenarios the maximum observed swe is close to 300 mm for the marmot jasper station in the upper sub basin while it is in the range of 100 mm and 150 mm for the barrhead west and embarras port stations located in the middle and lower sub basins respectively the vic simulated swe values clearly show these same regional differences although the model slightly overestimates swe values in the upper reaches and sometimes underestimate them in the lower reaches mean absolute errors mae between the observed and the vic simulated swe values are calculated to be 20 9 19 5 and 75 5 mm corresponding to the station located in the lower middle and upper sub basins respectively these differences could be explained partly by the fact that the simulated results are average values over each model grid but not point values exactly at the same location as the observing stations while uncertainty in the observed swe values could also have played a role the other factor could be the fact that all the parameters needed for the snow energy balance calculation have to be derived from the three primary forcings precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature used in this study comparison is also made between the vic simulated monthly mean swe values and observation based gridded snow product to see the broader special and seasonal validations as shown in fig 3 the observation based gridded snow climatology for the 1981 2010 baseline period was deriving by combining the atmospheric model intercomparison project amip2 monthly swe product that covers the 1979 1997 period brown et al 2003 with the canadian meteorological centre cmc monthly swe estimates for the 1998 2010 period brown et al 2010 while the vic simulation resulted in slightly lower monthly mean swe especially at the high elevation region of the watershed it was able to reproduce the overall spatial and seasonal pattern of the observation based amip2 cmc swe analysis product these validation results are considered to provide sufficient confidence for using the cmip5 driven vic hydrologic model projections to evaluate the long term to end of 21 st century spatial and seasonal variations in projected change in swe over the athabasca watershed 4 2 climate change scenarios the projected changes in seasonal winter december february spring march may summer june august autumn september november mean precipitation and air temperature over the athabasca river basin are shown as a scatter plot in fig 4 the figure shows projected changes as percentage differences for precipitation and absolute differences for air temperature calculated as the average of tmin and tmax between the 1990s baseline 1981 2010 and the two future periods of 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 based on the statistically downscaled data from the six cmip5 gcms projections corresponding to the two emission scenarios i e rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 spatially averaged over the athabasca river basin the plots show projected increases in both precipitation and air temperature over the region except in the summer season when some models project decreases in precipitation and one model even decreases in air temperature the ensemble mean values for projected change in mean annual precipitation temperature in the basin for the rcp4 5 scenario in 2050s and 2080s are 6 8 2 7 c and 12 5 3 2 c while the corresponding values for rcp8 5 scenarios are 9 7 3 3 c and 14 4 5 6 c respectively fig 4 also shows that the inter model variability in the climate projections becomes larger with increasing emission concentrations and projection horizons however there is a strong agreement among all the models that the highest increase in temperature is projected to occur in winter while the highest projected increase in precipitation is in spring this is also evident in figure a 1 of the suplementary material which shows the highest projected increase in the ensemble mean monthly precipitation occurring in may and june and decreases in july and august considering the spatial variations in projected precipitation changes over the watershed also reveals that the highest increases in most seasons occur primarily in the upper alpine portions of the basin 4 3 snow response to projected climate the potential response of the athabasca watershed snow regime to a changing climate is investigated by forcing the calibrated validated vic model with the statistically downscaled cmip5 climate projections for the baseline and the two future periods then the ensemble mean changes in the monthly mean swe magnitude and date of swemax snowmelt and scd values between the baseline and future periods corresponding to each of the two emissions scenarios are computed over the basin the inter model variabilities in the projected changes in swe values are also presented in the supplementary material provided with this paper 4 3 1 changes in monthly mean swe the ensemble mean projected changes in mean monthly swe at each grid point over the athabasca watershed are calculated by averaging the changes in mean monthly swe values between the baseline 1990s and each of the two future periods 2050s and 2080s corresponding to each of the 12 sets of climatic drivers fig 5 presents the snow response over the watershed corresponding to both the rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 emissions scenarios the results corresponding to the rcp 4 5 scenario indicate that while there are projected increases in swe in some parts of the athabasca watershed during the winter months from december to february projections for all the spring months over the whole watershed as well as some parts of the watershed in the winter months show substantial decline in monthly mean swe the slight increases in swe during the winter months are attributable to the projected increase in winter precipitation and the generally below freezing winter temperature in the region in case of the rcp8 5 scenario the model projects an overall decrease in swe in both winter and spring seasons over all parts of the watershed the decreases in swe corresponding to rcp8 5 are also generally higher than those for rcp4 5 the swe decrease over high elevation portions of the upper basin even extends to the summer and fall seasons for both emission scenarios in general while winter and spring precipitation in the region is projected to increase it would not be able to compensate the effect of rising temperature in terms of reduced solid precipitation and enhanced melting of the snowpack the regional differences in swe response to the projected climate are also depicted in fig 6 where the areal mean values of the ensemble monthly projected changes in swe are plotted for each of the upper middle and lower sub basins of the watershed the results show that while the decrease in swe for the upper sub basin occurs over the whole year owing to the fact that the high elevation alpine areas in this region are covered by snow for most of the year the largest decreases will be for the months of april may and june with the monthly mean decreases by the end of this century ranging between 18 mm to 64 mm swe varying with the selected emissions scenario the projected decreases for the middle and lower sub basins are relatively lower than that of the upper sub basin and are mainly in april and may ranging between 6 mm to 26 mm in monthly mean swe in all regions the rcp8 5 scenario generally results in a higher decrease in monthly mean swe especially during the 2080s period however there are also inter model variations in the projected change in swe especially for the winter and spring months and the variability is highest over the high elevation region of the upper sub basin as shown in fig a 2 of the supplementary materials one can also see in fig a 2 the differences between the results corresponding to each of the two sd methods used to downscale the climatic drivers in general the hydrologic model projections with the bcsd data shows higher decrease in swe values during the winter and spring months compared to those with the bcci data and over the upper sub basin the differences in projected changes between the two sd methods are as big as and some times more than those between the different gcms box and whisker plots of the ensemble mean monthly swe values for the baseline and future periods for each of the three sub basins are also presented in fig a 3 of the supplementary materials the figure shows that the relative magnitudes of the projected changes in the monthly mean swe values are quite significant as compared to their inter annual variability the inter annual variability in the monthly mean sew for the future periods remain more or less the same as the baseline period except for the months of february and march over the middle and upper sub basins where the variability increases slightly for the future periods 4 3 2 changes in swemax in most part of the athabasca watershed the swemax usually occurs in the winter months of february and march although there may be some inter annual and regional variations from those months fig 7 a presents the ensemble mean projected changes in the swemax value over the athabasca watershed and the results under the rcp4 5 emissions scenario show a small projected increase in the order of 1 10 mm in the swemax values in most parts of the middle sub basins most probably due to the precipitation increase during winter while other parts of the upper and lower sub basins show a slight decrease or no change at the same time some very high elevation areas in the upper sub basin could experience relatively higher decreases in the order of 30 50 mm in their swemax this result is consistent with those in fig 5 that show slight increases in mean monthly swe values in some regions of the athabasca watershed during the winter months and the generally below freezing winter temperatures in the case of the rcp8 5 emissions scenario the model projected some decreases in swemax over most part of the upper sub basin with slight or no change in most part of the middle and lower sub basins by the 2050s however by the 2080s under the rcp8 5 emissions scenario all parts of the athabasca watershed are projected to experience substantial decreases in the swemax ranging from 5 mm to over 50 mm depending on the region with the largest decrease occurring in the upper sub basin these results are consistent with some earlier suggestions stewart 2009 that increases in cold season precipitation could mask the effects of climate warming until the warming is large enough to outweigh the effect of increased precipitation at which time snowpack may experience a sudden change the corresponding ensemble mean changes in the dates of swemax are also examined and presented in fig 7b the results show that the average date of swemax under the future climate will generally be earlier than that in the baseline climate while the magnitudes of the change varying between 3 to over 30 days depending on the location and climate scenario considered the projected changes for the 2050s and the 2080s under rcp4 5 scenario are relatively small ranging mostly between 3 15 days while the changes for the 2080s under the rcp8 5 scenario are relatively bigger ranging mostly between 15 to over 30 days in all the cases the high elevation region of the upper sub basin will experience the largest change in the date of swemax the box and whisker plots of the dates of swemax from all of the 12 gcms for the baseline and future periods presented in figure a 4 of the supplementary materials also indicate that the relative magnitude of the changes in the dates of swemax with respect to its inter annual variability are quite significant at each of the three sub basinns and for both climate scenarios additional analyses on projected changes in the march 1st and april 1st swe values are also presented in figures a 5 of the supplementary materials those results also indicate that while most regions corresponding to the rcp8 5 scenario and some regions corresponding to rcp4 5 emissions scenario show decreases in march 1st swe values almost all regions show decreases in the april 1st swe values for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios 4 3 3 changes in snowmelt while part of the overall decrease in swe is due to the decrease in the proportion of the total precipitation that falls in the form of snow solid precipitation the other important factor is the corresponding change in the snowmelt regime melt magnitude and timing over the basin both resulting from projected increases in air temperature fig 8 shows these projected changes in monthly snowmelt values over the athabasca watershed corresponding to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios and the two future periods compared to the 1990s baseline period the results indicate the general increase in snowmelt over the predominantly cold and snow covered months between november and march which are also expected to experience larger increases in air temperature the snow cover gets depleted more quickly by earlier spring melt hence there will be even less snow available on the ground to be melted resulting in decreases in snowmelt during the late spring months of april and may including the summer months for the upper sub basin there will also be a projected decrease in snowmelt for the early fall months of september and october most probably because of the decrease in snow fall as a result of the projected increase in temperature the regional difference in the snowmelt response to the changing climate is better visualised in fig 9 this figure shows a substantial change in the snowmelt regime over the high elevation alpine region of the upper basin with substantial increase in snowmelt and hence depletion of the available snow on the ground between november and april followed by a corresponding decrease in snowmelt between may and september while the projected change in the snowmelt regime for the middle and lower reaches of the basin shows similar pattern the magnitude of the changes are relatively smaller all these changes in the snowmelt regime will have significant effect on the soil moisture regime over the watershed that would in tern affect the flow regimes in all tributaries and the main stem of the athabasca river 4 3 4 changes in scd one other effect of climate change and the associated increase in temperature is the potential reduction in scd or the reduction in the average number of days with some snow on the ground in this analysis the average scd is calculated using a threshold of 1 mm swe to count the number of days with swe 1 mm within each model grid over the athabasca watershed notably while it is recognized that such a low swe value corresponds to minimal depths of either newly fallen light density snow e g 10 mm at ρ 100 kg m3 or well ripened melt phase snow e g 2 mm at ρ 500 kg m3 the objective here is to simply show the basic changes in the presence absence of snow in each model grid scd is computed from the vic swe output corresponding to each statistically downscaled gcm driver and each of the two emission scenarios for the baseline and the two future periods fig 10 a presents the spatial maps of ensemble mean scd changes that show an overall reduction in the projected scd over the athabasca watershed while the median scd for the baseline period is in the order of 200 days see fig a 6 in the supplementary materials fig 10b shows that the reduction in scd is generally in the order of 15 days to over 50 days by the 2080s with the largest decreases in the high elevation regions of the upper sub basin the reduction in scd corresponding to the rcp8 5 emissions scenario is also much higher than that of the rcp4 5 especially for the 2080s period 5 summary and conclusions the spatially distributed and process based land surface hydrologic model vic of the athabasca watershed driven by high resolution gridded climate data was generally able to reproduce the spatial and seasonal patterns of the observed as well as the observation based swe analysis data over the watershed for the 1981 2010 baseline period application of vic with a set of cmip5 gcm climate projections statistically downscaled to the same resolution of the observational gridded climate data project future trends in the magnitude and seasonality of the watershed snow cover while precipitation is projected to increase in all seasons except in summer the hydrologic model simulations resulted in an overall decreasing trend in swe over the entire watershed the largest decreases of up to 50 are expected in march and april with more decreases corresponding to the rcp8 5 than the rcp4 5 emissions scenarios the decreases in swe are generally higher in the upper high elevation regions than other parts of the watershed mainly because of the generally higher than average snow accumulation at higher elevations and their relatively strong response to the warming trend most of these changes are largely attributable to the overall increase in temperature projected over the region that would result in lower than normal proportion of precipitation falling as snow however swemax which usually occurs in february and march is projected to increase in some parts of the watershed mostly in the middle sub basin in the case of rcp4 5 scenario while it decreases throughout the watershed for the case of rcp8 5 scenario the projected increase in temperature also results in increasing snowmelt during winter and early spring months followed by decreases during the late spring months of april and may including the summer months for the upper sub basin all these changes will result in an overall decrease in the average scd in the order of 20 50 days for end of century scenarios with the biggest decrease being again in the upper high elevation portions of the watershed in general the overall projected reduction in snow cover over all regions of the athabasca watershed is introduced by the warm future climate that will reduce the average number of days with below freezing temperatures and lead to a portion of the precipitation shifting from snowfall to rainfall dominance the projected increases in winter and spring temperatures will also increase the rate of snow ablation and melt thereby reducing both the swe and scd over the entire watershed with the reductions being more pronounced in the high elevation alpine region of the upper sub basin the largest reductions in monthly mean swe however are projected to occur in march and april except in the upper sub basin where it extends from march to june moreover while the differences in the projected changes in swe and scd corresponding to the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emissions scenarios are relatively small by the 2050s they are significantly larger by the 2080s the relatively small increases in the swemax over the middle sub basin of the watershed corresponding to the rcp4 5 scenario could be attributed to the projected increase in winter precipitation with a more moderate increase in temperature for that particular scenario the widespread decrease in swemax corresponding to the rcp8 5 scenario and especially during the 2080s indicate an enhanced response to higher emissions further into the future the average date of the swemax is also shifted to earlier period by about 3 to over 30 days depending on geographic location and end of century climate scenarios considered with the biggest shift being projected for the higher elevation region of the upper sub basin and rcp8 5 scenario however there are also significant inter model variabilities in the snow response to projected climate including those between the different sd approaches while the results presented in this study accounts some of the uncertainties resulting from different emission scenarios climate model projections and downscaling techniques a number of other uncertainties resulting from hydrologic model representation model parameter estimation etc may still remain all these changes in the snow accumulation and snowmelt regime over the athabasca watershed is expected to have huge implications on the magnitude and timing of the watershed soil moisture content and subsequently on the hydrologic regime of the athabasca river resulting in warming induced shifts in
