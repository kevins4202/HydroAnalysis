9980,the unavailability of thermal infrared satellite observations in cloudy conditions has limited the spatial distribution and temporal coverage of remotely sensed evapotranspiration et data as a result a number of approaches have been developed to reconstruct remotely sensed daily et data in cloudy sky conditions despite the wide application of these approaches no work has been conducted to compare their performance over a wide variety of climatic and vegetative conditions in this study three commonly used et reconstruction approaches namely reference et fraction etof land surface temperature reconstruction lstr and variational data assimilation vda are used to obtain daily et data under cloudy conditions the abovementioned three approaches are applied to the heihe river basin hrb in the northwest of china during the growing season in 2015 the hrb covers an area of approximately 1 432 000 km2 and contains various land covers the large aperture scintillometer las and eddy covariance ec measurements are used to evaluate performance of the abovementioned three methods over the grassland cropland and riparian forest sites in the hrb the results show that the etof approach underestimates et at the grassland and riparian sites in cloudy days because of the negatively biased et eto where eto is the reference evapotranspiration in clear sky days the vda approach overestimates et in cloudy sky conditions because of the overpredicted evaporative fraction values the lstr approach overestimates et due to the under reconstructed lst in cloudy day the mean absolute percentage difference mapd and root mean square error rmse statistical metrics are used to compare performance of the three approaches the lstr mapd 43 1 and rmse 1 3 mm day and vda mapd 46 7 and rmse 1 4 mm day approaches slightly outperform etof mapd 46 6 and rmse 1 5 mm day the rmses of reconstructed et values by etof vda and lstr increase respectively from 1 6 1 2 and 1 5 mm day to 2 2 1 9 and 2 0 mm day as the number of consecutive cloudy days increases from 1 to 3 these outcomes suggest that synergistic use of space borne microwave and thermal infrared lst observations into remote sensing

and dickinson 2012 remotely sensed data have been used in a number of models to estimate et over large scale domains delogu et al 2012 the remote sensing based et models typically use visible and near infrared vnir and or thermal infrared tir satellite data as inputs kustas and anderson 2009 however the satellite derived tir data are not available when the sky is cloudy sun et al 2017 the cloudy earth s land surface areas can reach up to 50 jin and dickinson 1999 in addition to clouds the revisit frequency of satellites also limits the availability of remotely sensed lst observations these shortcomings hinder most of the remotely sensed et approaches to generate spatially and temporally continuous et estimates to overcome this problem the reference evapotranspiration fraction etof approach has been used to derive spatially and temporally continuous daily et values this approach relates the land surface conditions to the atmosphere data and has been recommended to fill the gap of daily et data between two successive clear days delogu et al 2012 van niel et al 2012 it calculates the ratio of evapotranspiration et to reference evapotranspiration eto i e etof et eto in cloudy

eto i e et etof eto xu et al 2015 etof can be higher in clear sky days compared to the cloudy days delogu et al 2012 hence the interpolated etof values in cloudy days may be higher than their true values delogu et al 2012 etof values also do not follow a monotonic increasing decreasing trend in cloudy days and thus their variations cannot be captured by linear interpolation these drawbacks can cause errors in the et estimates for cloudy days given the abovementioned shortcomings of the etof approach other methods such as the land surface temperature reconstruction lstr and variational data assimilation vda have been used to estimate et in cloudy days song et al 2018 xu et al 2019 in the lstr method the missing lst data in cloud contaminant pixels are filled by the lst observations in

area the study area is the heihe river basin hrb which is located in northwestern china and has an area of approximately 1 432 000 km2 the basin includes an upstream cryosphere with glaciers frozen soil grass and forests midstream with croplands growing maize wheat and irrigated vegetables and downstream with riparian ecosystems and a wide desert fig 1 the sensible heat flux was measured by the optical large aperture scintillometers las at the arou grassland daman cropland and sidaoqiao forest sites and averaged over 30 min fig 1 the las system was installed at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites in october 2012 may 2012 and may 2013 respectively at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites the las system has a path of 2 390 1 90 and 2 40 km and an effective height of 9 5 22 5 and 25 5 m above the ground respectively this allows the source area of las systems in these sites to cover a region encompassing more than two modis pixels the details of las observations over different land covers are discussed in song et al 2018 the las measurements of the 1 min refractive index of air cn2 were averaged over 30 min periods along with these las transects eddy covariance ec flux towers were installed in the middle of the path to measure sensible and latent heat fluxes the ec system consists of an open path infrared gas analyzer and a 3 d sonic anemometer the raw measurements of sensible latent and carbon fluxes by the ec system had a frequency of 10 hz these recorded raw data were processed and reported with the frequency of 30 min via the edire software http www geos ed ac uk abs

the las system the latent heat flux was obtained as the residual of surface energy balance equation the spatial distribution of latent heat flux measurements from the ec flux towers at the arou and

cloudy sky daily etof is linearly interpolated from two consecutive clear day etof values this allows to reconstruct continuous daily etof values thereafter the interpolated etof value is multiplied by eto on that day to obtain et i e et etof eto the daily eto is estimated by the penman monteith equation pm for clear sky conditions the daily et is obtained by upscaling the instantaneous et estimate from the dual temperature difference dtd model song et al 2018 the upscaling of et is conducted by the ratio of instantaneous to daily insolation approach fig 2 cammalleri et al 2014 3 2 land surface temperature reconstruction lstr the main input of remotely sensed energy balance et models is lst space borne lst observations can be affected by cloud contamination resulting in their spatio temporal discontinuities to generate a spatio temporal continuous remote sensing lst product the information from clear sky neighboring pixels can be used to reconstruct cloud contaminated pixels sun et al 2017 the reconstructed lst map along with the micrometeorological data from wrf were used in the dtd model to estimate instantaneous et at the satellite overpass time in the hrb finally daily et is obtained by upscaling instantaneous et estimates song et al 2018 details of the dtd model can be found in guzinski et al 2013 2015 song et al 2018 3 3 variational data assimilation vda the vda approach estimates et even for instances in which there are no lst data by assimilating lst observations into the heat diffusion equation xu et al 2019 the key unknown parameters of the vda approach are the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient c hn and evaporative fraction for soil efs and canopy efc c hn varies with vegetation phenology on a monthly time scale efs and efc change on a daily time scale the vda system finds the optimal values of c hn efs and efc by minimizing the diﬀerence between measured and estimated lst the readers are referred to xu et al 2019 for a detailed description of the vda approach 4 results 4 1 daily et reconstruction for variable cloudy days fig 3 compares the estimated et values from etof lstr and vda with observations at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites for day of years doys 152 273 in general et estimates from the three methods showed a characteristic response to weather conditions i e the daily et retrievals mostly decreased when the sky became cloudy however the reconstructed et values in cloudy days by the etof approach became higher than those of nearby clear sky days the erroneous et estimates by etof is due to the uncertainties of et estimates in clear sky days and errors of micrometeorological data in cloudy days the reconstructed et values by the vda and lstr methods were more accurate than those of etof at the arou site grassland the et estimates from the lstr approach were generally in agreement with the observations with the bias mean absolute percentage deviation mapd and root mean square error rmse of 0 6 mm day 51 7 and 1 5 mm day respectively while the etof vda reconstruction method underestimated overestimated et in cloudy conditions the bias rmse of et estimations from etof and vda were 1 2 1 7 mm day and 1 3 1 7 mm day respectively at the daman site semi arid irrigated cropland the three methods performed fairly well and the reconstructed et values agreed with the ground measurements however they overestimated et in most of the days with low et smaller than 2 mm day the etof lstr and vda approaches performed similarly at the daman site with the bias rmse of 1 0 1 7 mm day 1 0 1 6 mm day and 1 0 1 6 mm day respectively at the sidaoqiao site arid riparian forest the etof and lstr reconstruction methods performed similarly with the same bias and rmse of 0 1 mm day and 1 0 mm day respectively the vda approach slightly underestimated et in cloudy days with the bias and rmse of 0 2 mm day and 1 0 mm day the bias mapd and rmse of all approaches are lower at the sidaoqiao site mainly because of the lower number of cloudy days in this site 4 2 daily et reconstruction for continuous cloudy days thermal infrared lst data with high revisit time although desirable are unavailable in cloudy conditions herein the etof vda and lstr approaches were used to reconstruct et in 1 4 continuous cloudy days at the abovementioned three sites the results showed that performance of the three methods did not degrade continuously as the time lag between two successive clear sky days increased fig 4 as can be seen the rmse of reconstructed daily et values did not steadily enhance when the number of cloudy days increased the lstr reconstruction method outperformed the other approaches for the time lag of 1 day between two clear sky days all the methods had a similar accuracy when the number of continuous cloudy days increased from 1 to 2 the rmse of reconstructed et values from all approaches grew for a 3 day gap between clear sky days but they decreased when the gap increased to 4 days in general performances of the three methods were consistent when the number of continuous cloudy days increased from 1 to 4 the mapd of estimated daily et from the three reconstruction methods increased continuously when the number of consecutive cloudy days rose from 1 to 3 days overall lstr outperformed the other two approaches with a lower rmse and mapd the mapd of et estimates from lstr increased from about 41 3 74 7 by rising the number of cloudy days from 1 to 4 the errors from the three methods did not increase when the number of consecutive cloudy days became larger than 4 fig 5 shows the monthly accumulated et retrievals from the etof lstr and vda approaches over the hrb during the modeling period june september as shown the spatial and temporal patterns of monthly accumulated et estimates from all approaches are similar the et retrievals are high over irrigated agricultural areas in the midstream and grassland in the upstream and low over most areas in the downstream the et values increase from june to july and then gradually decrease from july to september results from the three approaches are more consistent over the barren areas where monthly accumulated et values are low in the upstream of the hrb mainly covered by the grass the spatial patterns of reconstructed et values from the three approaches have a larger difference which increases with the vegetation density the vda approach generated the highest et values followed by lstr and etof the relatively large difference of reconstructed et values over the plateau mountain areas is due to the higher number of the cloudy days in this region while the discrepancy of the three reconstructed et maps over the midstream and the downstream of hrb are relatively small because of the decreased number of cloudy days 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties of the reconstructed et values as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the lstr reconstruction approach outperformed etof and vda also the mapd of et estimates from all three methods grew as the number of the cloudy days increased the lstr approach which is based on the surface energy balance equation is mainly affected by the errors of lst data the accuracy of the reconstructed lst data reduces as the time gap between two clear sky days and or the area obscured by clouds increases the reconstructed lst data had the bias rmse of 0 8 2 8 k at arou grassland and 0 3 and 2 3 k at daman cropland song et al 2018 to assess the effect of lst uncertainties on the lstr et estimates a number of sensitivity analysis tests were conducted two white noise time series with the standard deviations of 1 k and 3 k are added to the lst data the magnitude of introduced errors is proportional to the uncertainties caused by the lst gap filling approach in cloudy days the lstr approach was run with the synthetically generated noisy lst data at the three sites and its et estimates were compared with those of original run with unperturbed lst data table 3 at the arou site the lstr approach using noisy lst data with the standard deviation of 1 k and 3 k led to the rmse of 0 026 mm day and 0 082 mm day respectively corresponding rmses are 0 057 mm day and 0 192 mm day at daman and 0 040 mm day and 0 150 mm day at sidaoqiao table 3 shows that the noisy lst data slightly affect the uncertainty of et estimates it also indicates that the rmse of estimated et values grow with an increase in the standard deviation of added error to the lst data similar results are obtained at the daman and sidaoqiao sites the sensitivity test indicates that the lstr approach can produce reliable et values by using the modis lst product as its error is less than 1 k duan et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that the reconstructed lst data in cloud contaminated pixels and heterogeneous land surfaces can introduce more uncertainties in lst data that may deteriorate performance of the lstr approach as mentioned earlier the etof reconstruction method retrieves the ratio of et to eto i e etof et eto in cloudy days by the linear interpolation of etof values in two nearby successive clear sky days however in clear sky days etof is higher than cloudy days this leads to an overestimation of interpolated etof values in cloudy days ultimately causing overestimated et values this happens because et in clear sky days may be controlled by the soil moisture availability while it is constrained most by the available energy in cloudy days moreover etof does not follow a monotonic trend i e its variations are not uniform during cloudy conditions and thus its changes cannot be captured by a linear interpolation these shortcomings can introduce errors in the reconstructed et values for cloudy days the interpolated etof values at daman irrigated cropland and arou grassland have a rmse of 0 3 mm day and 0 5 mm day respectively the errors of daily et estimates in nearby clear sky days can also cause uncertainties in the daily etof retrievals for example the underestimated et and etof values in clear days at the arou site result in lower etof and et estimates in cloudy days at the arou site the land surface was relatively wet during the growing season due to rainfall and et was controlled mainly by the available energy this may contribute to the negatively biased reconstructed et values from the etof approach on the other hand the atmospheric evaporative demand is high at daman irrigated cropland resulting in larger eto values even in cloudy days the high daily eto values reduce the variation of etof the positively biased et estimates from the vda approach is due to the simplistic assumptions such as constant daily ef constant monthly c hn and invariant soil thermal conductivity and heat capacity during the modeling period following xu et al 2019 the a priori ef is calculated from its key determining factors namely lai and apparent thermal inertia the vda approach exploits information in the sequences of lst to update ef the results indicate that the vda approach slightly overestimates ef with the bias rmse of 0 06 mm day 0 11 mm day and 0 10 mm day 0 14 mm day at arou and daman respectively the overestimated ef values lead to positively biased et estimates in these two sites the day to day oscillations of et retrievals from the etof lstr and vda approaches match with those of observations fig 3 however they have a positive bias at the daman site irrigated cropland during thick cloudy days when the available energy is significantly lower than clear days fig 3 5 2 estimation of soil evaporation and canopy transpiration by the lstr and vda methods the lstr approach can partition et into the e and t by the dtd model song et al 2018 the vda approach can also estimate e and t which allow us to assess the water use efficiency wue in irrigated agricultural fields however the accuracy of these estimates cannot be evaluated easily due to the shortage of reliable observations in this study the uwue method is used to partition et measurements from flux tower at the daman and arou sites into e and t bai et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 as can be seen in fig 6 t et estimates from the lstr approach are more accurate than those of vda and can capture the day to day fluctuations in the t et observations fairly well t et estimates from the vda approach have a larger discrepancy with the values calculated by uwue approach t et retrievals from both lstr and vda show a higher deviation from calculation of uwue at the beginning of the growing season this happens mainly because the lai data at the beginning of the growing season are low and thus have a high uncertainty song et al 2018 in addition there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of t et estimations and measurements the t et retrievals from lstr and vda represent a coarse spatial resolution of about 1 km while the et data from the eddy covariance system have a footprint of a few hundreds of meters bai et al 2019 the t et estimations have a larger spatial heterogeneity during the early growing season in which the land surface is more patchy reducing the spatial representative of observations this could contribute to the larger discrepancy between the t et estimates and those of uwue calculation during the growing season 6 conclusion this study used reference et fraction etof land surface temperature reconstruction lstr and variational data assimilation vda approaches to reconstruct daily evapotranspiration et in cloudy days the etof approach is built based on interpolating the values of et eto from two consecutive clear days the lstr approach works on the basis of interpolating land surface temperature the vda obtains the optimum values of neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient and evaporative fraction by assimilating land surface temperature observations the performance of these approaches is tested at the arou add vegetation cover daman add vegetation cover and sidaoqiao add vegetation cover sites over the heihe river basin hrb in china the lstr and vda approaches can also partition et between the soil evaporation e and canopy transpiration t in addition the drawbacks of the three approaches are discussed the main conclusions are presented below 1 et estimates from the three utilized reconstruction approaches show a strong response to the climatic and vegetative conditions the estimated et values from the lstr approach are closer to measurements implying that the lstr is more accurate than the etof and vda approaches in all the study sites 2 the difference between the reconstructed and measured daily et values enhance gradually as the number of cloudy days grow the estimated t et values from the lstr method agree

uncertainties of et estimates in clear sky days and errors of micrometeorological data in cloudy days the reconstructed et values by the vda and lstr methods were more accurate than those of etof at the arou site grassland the et estimates from the lstr approach were generally in agreement with the observations with the bias mean absolute percentage deviation mapd and root mean square error rmse of 0 6 mm day 51 7 and 1 5 mm day respectively while the etof vda reconstruction method underestimated overestimated et in cloudy conditions the bias rmse of et estimations from etof and vda were 1 2 1 7 mm day and 1 3 1 7 mm day respectively at the daman site semi arid irrigated cropland the three methods performed fairly well and the reconstructed et values agreed with the ground measurements however they overestimated et in most of the days with low et smaller than 2 mm day the etof lstr and vda approaches performed similarly at the daman site with the bias rmse of 1 0 1 7 mm day 1 0 1 6 mm day and 1 0 1 6 mm day respectively at the sidaoqiao site arid riparian forest the etof and lstr reconstruction methods performed similarly with the same bias and rmse of 0 1 mm day and 1 0 mm day respectively the vda approach slightly underestimated et in cloudy days with the bias and rmse of 0 2 mm day and 1 0 mm day the bias mapd and rmse of all approaches are lower at the sidaoqiao site mainly because of the lower number of cloudy days in this site 4 2 daily et reconstruction for continuous cloudy days thermal infrared lst data with high revisit time although desirable are unavailable in cloudy conditions herein the etof vda and lstr approaches were used to reconstruct et in 1 4 continuous cloudy days at the abovementioned three sites the results showed that performance of the three methods did not degrade continuously as the time lag between two successive clear sky days increased fig 4 as can be seen the rmse of reconstructed daily et values did not steadily enhance when the number of cloudy days increased the lstr reconstruction method outperformed the other approaches for the time lag of 1 day between two clear sky days all the methods had a similar accuracy when the number of continuous cloudy days increased from 1 to 2 the rmse of reconstructed et values from all approaches grew for a 3 day gap between clear sky days but they decreased when the gap increased to 4 days in general performances of the three methods were consistent when the number of continuous cloudy days increased from 1 to 4 the mapd of estimated daily et from the three reconstruction methods increased continuously when the number of consecutive cloudy days rose from 1 to 3 days overall lstr outperformed the other two approaches with a lower rmse and mapd the mapd of et estimates from lstr increased from about 41 3 74 7 by rising the number of cloudy days from 1 to 4 the errors from the three methods did not increase when the number of consecutive cloudy days became larger than 4 fig 5 shows the monthly accumulated et retrievals from the etof lstr and vda approaches over the hrb during the modeling period june september as shown the spatial and temporal patterns of monthly accumulated et estimates from all approaches are similar the et retrievals are high over irrigated agricultural areas in the midstream and grassland in the upstream and low over most areas in the downstream the et values increase from june to july and then gradually decrease from july to september results from the three approaches are more consistent over the barren areas where monthly accumulated et values are low in the upstream of the hrb mainly covered by the grass the spatial patterns of reconstructed et values from the three approaches have a larger difference which increases with the vegetation density the vda approach generated the highest et values followed by lstr and etof the relatively large difference of reconstructed et values over the plateau mountain areas is due to the higher number of the cloudy days in this region while the discrepancy of the three reconstructed et maps over the midstream and the downstream of hrb are relatively small because of the decreased number of cloudy days 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties of the reconstructed et values as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the lstr reconstruction approach outperformed etof and vda also the mapd of et estimates from all three methods grew as the number of the cloudy days increased the lstr approach which is based on the surface energy balance equation is mainly affected by the errors of lst data the accuracy of the reconstructed lst data reduces as the time gap between two clear sky days and or the area obscured by clouds increases the reconstructed lst data had the bias rmse of 0 8 2 8 k at arou grassland and 0 3 and 2 3 k at daman cropland song et al 2018 to assess the effect of lst uncertainties on the lstr et estimates a number of sensitivity analysis tests were conducted two white noise time series with the standard deviations of 1 k and 3 k are added to the lst data the magnitude of introduced errors is proportional to the uncertainties caused by the lst gap filling approach in cloudy days the lstr approach was run with the synthetically generated noisy lst data at the three sites and its et estimates were compared with those of original run with unperturbed lst data table 3 at the arou site the lstr approach using noisy lst data with the standard deviation of 1 k and 3 k led to the rmse of 0 026 mm day and 0 082 mm day respectively corresponding rmses are 0 057 mm day and 0 192 mm day at daman and 0 040 mm day and 0 150 mm day at sidaoqiao table 3 shows that the noisy lst data slightly affect the uncertainty of et estimates it also indicates that the rmse of estimated et values grow with an increase in the standard deviation of added error to the lst data similar results are obtained at the daman and sidaoqiao sites the sensitivity test indicates that the lstr approach can produce reliable et values by using the modis lst product as its error is less than 1 k duan et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that the reconstructed lst data in cloud contaminated pixels and heterogeneous land surfaces can introduce more uncertainties in lst data that may deteriorate performance of the lstr approach as mentioned earlier the etof reconstruction method retrieves the ratio of et to eto i e etof et eto in cloudy days by the linear interpolation of etof values in two nearby successive clear sky days however in clear sky days etof is higher than cloudy days this leads to an overestimation of interpolated etof values in cloudy days ultimately causing overestimated et values this happens because et in clear sky days may be controlled by the soil moisture availability while it is constrained most by the available energy in cloudy days moreover etof does not follow a monotonic trend i e its variations are not uniform during cloudy conditions and thus its changes cannot be captured by a linear interpolation these shortcomings can introduce errors in the reconstructed et values for cloudy days the interpolated etof values at daman irrigated cropland and arou grassland have a rmse of 0 3 mm day and 0 5 mm day respectively the errors of daily et estimates in nearby clear sky days can also cause uncertainties in the daily etof retrievals for example the underestimated et and etof values in clear days at the arou site result in lower etof and et estimates in cloudy days at the arou site the land surface was relatively wet during the growing season due to rainfall and et was controlled mainly by the available energy this may contribute to the negatively biased reconstructed et values from the etof approach on the other hand the atmospheric evaporative demand is high at daman irrigated cropland resulting in larger eto values even in cloudy days the high daily eto values reduce the variation of etof the positively biased et estimates from the vda approach is due to the simplistic assumptions such as constant daily ef constant monthly c hn and invariant soil thermal conductivity and heat capacity during the modeling period following xu et al 2019 the a priori ef is calculated from its key determining factors namely lai and apparent thermal inertia the vda approach exploits information in the sequences of lst to update ef the results indicate that the vda approach slightly overestimates ef with the bias rmse of 0 06 mm day 0 11 mm day and 0 10 mm day 0 14 mm day at arou and daman respectively the overestimated ef values lead to positively biased et estimates in these two sites the day to day oscillations of et retrievals from the etof lstr and vda approaches match with those of observations fig 3 however they have a positive bias at the daman site irrigated cropland during thick cloudy days when the available energy is significantly lower than clear days fig 3 5 2 estimation of soil evaporation and canopy transpiration by the lstr and vda methods the lstr approach can partition et into the e and t by the dtd model song et al 2018 the vda approach can also estimate e and t which allow us to assess the water use efficiency wue in irrigated agricultural fields however the accuracy of these estimates cannot be evaluated easily due to the shortage of reliable observations in this study the uwue method is used to partition et measurements from flux tower at the daman and arou sites into e and t bai et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 as can be seen in fig 6 t et estimates from the lstr approach are more accurate than those of vda and can capture the day to day fluctuations in the t et observations fairly well t et estimates from the vda approach have a larger discrepancy with the values calculated by uwue approach t et retrievals from both lstr and vda show a higher deviation from calculation of uwue at the beginning of the growing season this happens mainly because the lai data at the beginning of the growing season are low and thus have a high uncertainty song et al 2018 in addition there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of t et estimations and measurements the t et retrievals from lstr and vda represent a coarse spatial resolution of about 1 km while the et data from the eddy covariance system have a footprint of a few hundreds of meters bai et al 2019 the t et estimations have a larger spatial heterogeneity during the early growing season in which the land surface is more patchy reducing the spatial representative of observations this could contribute to the larger discrepancy between the t et estimates and those of uwue calculation during the growing season 6 conclusion this study used reference et fraction etof land surface temperature reconstruction lstr and variational data assimilation vda approaches to reconstruct daily evapotranspiration et in cloudy days the etof approach is built based on interpolating the values of et eto from two consecutive clear days the lstr approach works on the basis of interpolating land surface temperature the vda obtains the optimum values of neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient and evaporative fraction by assimilating land surface temperature observations the performance of these approaches is tested at the arou add vegetation cover daman add vegetation cover and sidaoqiao add vegetation cover sites over the heihe river basin hrb in china the lstr and vda approaches can also partition et between the soil evaporation e and canopy transpiration t in addition the drawbacks of the three approaches are discussed the main conclusions are presented below 1 et estimates from the three utilized reconstruction approaches show a strong response to the climatic and vegetative conditions the estimated et values from the lstr approach are closer to measurements implying that the lstr is more accurate than the etof and vda approaches in all the study sites 2 the difference between the reconstructed and measured daily et values enhance gradually as the number of cloudy days grow the estimated t et values from the lstr method agree

9981,the performance of a low cost soil water content sensor 5te decagon devices inc for monitoring volumetric soil water content in an agricultural field was investigated prior to the in field measurements calibration methods for the sensor to correct the influences on soil temperature and electrical conductivity ec of the soil water were established dried soil collected from the agricultural field pure water and an in laboratory thermostatic reservoir were used first calibration formulas for the soil temperature and ec were obtained using a dataset of laboratory measurements second the soil water content in the field was measured using the 5te sensor with three different calibration curves applying a no correction of ec for curves at 20 c b temperature correction only and c temperature and ec corrections the differences between the sensor and actual measurements were 1 2 5 2 2 5 and 3 2 2 expressed as volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 higher accuracy was confirmed in the 5te sensor measurements under condition 3 at higher ec values finally we demonstrated that the 5te sensor with the proposed calibration method is useful for monitoring soil water content in agricultural fields keywords volumetric soil water content electrical conductivity soil temperature 5te sensor 1 introduction soil water content swc is one of the most important factors controlling the yield of agricultural products jones and tardieu 1998 flexas et al 2004 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 a simple and reliable method to determine swc is the gravimetric method combined with air heat or freeze drying the soil this method is difficult to implement in an extensive area because frequent data collection is required which is time consuming although it provides highly accurate swc values additionally in field swc is temporally modified by factors such as precipitation temperature air moisture and irrigation therefore a method to measure swc under low time and cost conditions is required for water management in agricultural fields sensor measurements of swc using dielectric permittivity are widely accepted in numerous fields robinson et al 2008 in a soil water air mixture the dielectric permittivities ε for both air and water are approximately constant at room temperature ε 1 and 80 respectively and the permittivity of soils is typically within a specific range depending on its texture ε 4 16 hallikainen et al 1985 or and wraith 1999 because the ε values for air water and soil are different and inherent to each other a change in swc can be monitored by permittivity measurements in their mixtures after sensor calibration this method is useful for the extensive and continuous monitoring of swc assuming adequate selection of the sensor and its calibration method soil water sensors of the ech2o series decagon devices inc usa which are capacitance soil water sensors with responses related to the dielectric permittivity have been widely used and evaluated in terms of their performance in several fields e g blonquist et al 2005 robinson et al 2008 fares et al 2016 in the ech2o series the 5te sensor is equipped with an advanced capacitance sensor with sensors for soil temperature and electrical conductivity ec measured in soil water decagon devices inc 2006 the 5te sensor is not expensive compared to other commercially available dielectric sensors the suitability of 5te sensors and their derivatives ec 5 which has no temperature and ec sensors has been investigated in several studies e g bogena et al 2007 2010 fares et al 2016 soil temperature and ec in soil water influence the measured value using the dielectric sensor because these parameters change the electrical properties of soil water for the 5te and ec 5 sensors the degree of influence of temperature and ec has been investigated and calibration methods considering these influences have been addressed in previous studies bogena et al 2007 kizito et al 2008 saito et al 2009 kodešová et al 2011 fares et al 2016 although detailed datasets related to the influence of temperature and ec in laboratory experiments have been reported therein they include insufficient validation in field environments there is a lack of applications in agricultural fields using information from existing studies in addition the referred calibration methods are often complicated because they imply the use of specific reagents and numerical analysis for convenient use of 5te sensors in agricultural fields it is essential to define a calibration method for the influences of temperature and ec under simple operation and to validate the method in the real world environment ec is considered an important factor for sensor measurements because fertilizing increases ec values in the soil water of agricultural fields the purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the reliability and accessibility of the 5te sensor used in agricultural fields a calibration method to address the influences of soil temperature and ec in soil water was defined through a lab scale experiment subsequently the validation of this method was examined through in field measurements for laboratory experiments sensor measurements were conducted under various soil conditions using dried field soil pure water nh4cl solution and a thermostatic reservoir subsequently a calibration formula for the swc was established from the experimental data for in field measurements swc in the soils was monitored using the 5te sensor which followed a calibration method by means of weekly actual gravimetric measurements additionally an enrichment experiment using inorganic elemental solutions and chemical fertilizers was conducted in the field to observe the influence of ec comparing the sensor measurements and the actual values of swc the 5te sensor and its calibration method were validated finally the high suitability of the 5te sensor in the agricultural field using the proposed calibration method was confirmed 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments soil was collected from the surface top of 5 cm of the agricultural field at the institute of environmental sciences ies located in the northeast of japan 40 57 n 141 22 e table 1 the sand content which largely influences the moisture holding ability of the collected soil was not remarkable the soil was dried at 60 c until its weight remained constant and then it was sufficiently mixed by testing a portion of the dried soil a small change in its weight after heating at 105 c for 1 d was confirmed this indicates that drying at 60 c was sufficient to remove the soil water dried soil was defined as 0 volumetric water content a schematic of the experimental procedure is presented in fig 1 to prepare soil samples with various water contents the dried soil ca 300 g per operation and an arbitrary amount of pure water were transferred to an aluminum bag lamizip al 22 300 mm 220 mm seisannipponsha ltd japan and mixed by hand shaking for 10 min subsequently the aluminum bag with soil was left at 60 c for 30 min heating was performed to homogenize the swc after heating the soil temperature decreased to 31 36 c to determine the volumetric water content in the adjusted soil a fraction of the soil was packed into a cylindrical polystyrene container 68 mm 56 mm φ and weighed because the gravimetric water content and weight of the treated soil were known the amount of soil water in the container could be estimated from the amount of water in the adjusted soil and the volume of the container the volumetric water content of the soil was estimated the adjusted soil from the container was directly used for subsequent experiments three 5te sensors connected to a data logger em50 decagon devices inc with a recording interval of 1 min were installed in the adjusted soil that filled the cylindrical polystyrene container fig 1b additionally the polystyrene container was designed to be relatively small for convenient use in the laboratory experiment three sensors were installed on the container were spaced at 0 2 mm intervals although the tight spacing of the sensors may cause problems such as interference between sensors the size and handleability of the container preceded this concern the difference between the three sensors was small described in the following section suggesting a small influence from the tight spacing of the sensors for installation of the sensor in soil it is recommended that the black plastic base of the sensor be fully buried in the soil decagon devices inc 2006 however the base was not fully buried in this study because the aim was to measure the surface 0 5 cm soil of the actual field the soil was in a warm condition 31 36 c because of the preceding step the experimental system in fig 1b was left in a thermostatic reservoir cn 25 c mitsubishi electric co ltd japan at 4 c for 1 5 h therefore measurements using the 5te sensor under different swcs 0 56 1 m3 m 3 and soil temperatures 13 30 c were obtained this was defined as the pure water experiment this measured value was used in a calibration formula under the condition of no influence of ec on the soil water to obtain a dataset for the analysis of the influence of ec a measured value for the 5te sensor was obtained by an experimental system similar to that described above using nh4cl solutions at different concentrations 0 002 0 5 m instead of pure water this was defined as the nh4cl solution experiment the soil temperature ec and dielectric permittivity in soil water were measured for all laboratory experiments using the 5te sensor 2 2 in field measurements 2 2 1 continuous monitoring experiment exp 1 five 5te sensors were installed on the surface of the agricultural field at the ies from may 22 to august 31 2017 fig 2 the sensor was vertically set for the laboratory experiments fig 1b and the swc at a depth of ca 5 cm from the surface was monitored the measured value from the sensor was recorded using the same type of data logger as the laboratory experiment at 5 min intervals the amount of precipitation was also monitored in the field using a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset inc usa chemical mixed fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium was added to the field before the observations and cabbage was cultivated during that period for the gravimetric measurement of swc a soil surface 0 5 cm sample was collected weekly using a cylindrical stainless cup 50 mm 56 mm φ the soil was obtained from zones a b and c in fig 2 resulting in a sample number of three in one sampling the water content in the soil was measured using the gravimetric method at 60 c 2 2 2 enrichment experiment exp 2 in a similar field as exp 1 a 20 20 cm quadrat was prepared using an acrylic plate in the field with three 5te sensors installed fig 3 a solution 1 1 of nh4cl 1 m and kcl 1 m or a slurry of pure water with organic chemical fertilizer 25 g l 1 nagaoka yuuki no 2 nagaokakasei co ltd japan carbon and nitrogen contents of 6 5 and 0 3 respectively were irrigated in the quadrat at a volume of 2 l after 3 h of irrigation five core samples were collected from the quadrats from four corners and the center using a polyethylene corer 50 300 mm fujiwara scientific co ltd japan the top 5 cm of the core sample was transferred to an aluminum bag the top 5 cm of the residual core sample i e 5 10 cm of the core sample was also collected after measurements from three 5te sensors were performed per sample therefore the measured values from the sensor were n 3 for the top 5 cm and n 15 for 5 10 cm the water content of the collected core samples was measured by the gravimetric method at 60 c which was defined as the actual measurement value the sensor and actual measured values were compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration for influence of soil temperature the calibration curves of the 5te sensor at each temperature were successfully constructed using the dataset in the pure water experiment fig 4 the calibration curves at each temperature are represented by the following regression lines with a high determination coefficient r2 0 93 1 y a x b where y is the volumetric water content in the soil m3 m 3 x is the sensor measurement mv a m3 m 3 mv 1 is a coefficient and b m3 m 3 is a constant because the correlation coefficient negligibly changed with an increase in the degree of regression lines degree 1 4 r 0 97 0 99 the regression of the first degree was selected for the calibration curve in the calibration curves for each temperature the values of coefficients a and b for each soil temperature were different from each other indicating that the measured value from the 5te sensor is influenced by temperature this is consistent with previous studies bogena et al 2007 kizito et al 2008 saito et al 2009 fares et al 2016 coefficients a and b in eq 1 were expressed as functions of temperature using quadric regressions with high determination coefficients r2 0 99 fig 5 this suggests that a specific soil temperature calibration curve can be established using the equations presented in fig 5 3 2 calibration to investigate the influence of ec in soil water the solute i e nh4cl in the soil water clearly influenced the sensor measurements fig 6 however the degree of influence was not proportional to the solute concentration under the same swc the changing ratio from the measured value of the sensor related to the pure water experiment was not proportional to the concentration of nh4cl the non proportionality between the sensor measurement and the solute concentration was also addressed by bogena et al 2007 the value increases with ec in the soil water in the range of 0 100 ms m 1 and then decreases in the range of 100 250 ms m 1 the decrease in the measured values from the sensor at higher solute concentrations i e higher ec could not be explained precisely from the results of the present study since an interionic interaction generally increases with a high solute concentration it may influence the non proportionality to quantitatively evaluate the influence of ec the ec factor ecf defined as the change ratio of the sensor measurement by the influence of ec was defined as follows 2 e c f r n a r p a where rn a is the measured value from the sensor in a swc of a in the nh4cl solution experiment mv and rp a is the measured value from the sensor in a swc of a in the pure water experiment mv the ec factor represents the ratio of the sensor measurement in the pure water experiment to that of the nh4cl solution experiment under the same swc the ec factor is dependent on the ec ec is measured in the soil water air mixture along with the dielectric permittivity using the 5te sensor ec in the solution changes in soil due to interactions with water and soil particles corwin and lesch 2003 herein the ec of 0 05 m nh4cl solution at 20 c was measured to be ca 640 ms m 1 using the 5te sensor while the ec of the soil in which the water content was adjusted to 40 by 0 05 m nh4cl solution was ca 170 ms m 1 therefore the ec measured in the soil water air mixture was applied for the functional analysis of the ec factor in addition the data for nh4cl solutions less than 10 ms m 1 were not used for this analysis because of the wide differences in the measured values from the sensors plots for the ec factor as a function of ec at each temperature fig 7 were constructed and tertiary regressions were applied with a high determination coefficient r2 0 90 at each temperature using the polynomial equation 3 y a x 3 b x 2 c x 1 where x is the ec measured by the 5te sensor ms m 1 a ms 3 m3 b ms 2 m2 and c ms 1 m are coefficients the tertiary regression was selected because the determination coefficient for this regression was significantly greater than that of the quadratic regression from 20 to 30 c p 0 05 and was similar to that of the quadratic regression at the measured temperature p 0 1 the coefficients in eq 3 were represented by functions linearly related to the soil temperature fig 8 which led to high determination coefficients r2 0 95 this suggests that the soil temperature specific eq 3 can be constructed using the equations in fig 8 resulting in an estimated soil temperature specific ec factor using the ec factor the measured values from the sensor influenced by ec can be changed to values with no influence from ec 3 3 exp 1 in field measurement to estimate the swc from the measured values from the sensor three calibration curves were applied the first curve a was established using the data obtained from the pure water experiment at 20 c the second b was estimated using eq 1 which was complemented by the functions shown in fig 5 i e correction of the temperature influence the third one c was similarly constructed with b after the correction of the sensor measured value using the ec factor which was estimated using eq 3 and presented in fig 8 i e correction for temperature and ec influence the temperature and ec data were measured using the 5te sensor along with the dielectric permittivity fig 9a and b the sensor and actual measured values of the swcs in the field are shown in fig 10 the changes in both values were clearly related to precipitation events fig 9c for the data in fig 10 the difference between the sensor and the actual measured values ds a was estimated as follows 4 d s a a b s s t a t a t where s t is a sensor measured value on a date of t a t is the actual measured value in the date indicated as t and abs denotes an absolute value in the angled bracket the average ds a values for calibrations a b and c were 11 5 13 1 sd 1σ 11 6 12 9 and 10 4 13 1 respectively fig 10 these differences corresponded to 2 5 1 8 2 5 1 7 and 2 2 1 9 of the swc m3 m 3 respectively calibration c led to the smallest difference between the sensor and actual measurements which corrected the temperature and ec influences a high similarity of calibration c with the actual measurements was observed early in the observation period fig 11 this was due to the high ec in soil water during this period fig 9b and the high ec was probably derived from the dissolution of the fertilizer added before the observation term details in section 2 in calibrations a and b the difference from the actual measurement was almost similar fig 11 because the soil temperature was approximately 20 c during the field measurement fig 9a it is suggested that correction for the influence of temperature was not as effective for the swc estimation a calibration curve defined in the field at an average soil temperature may be sufficient to monitor swc using the 5te sensor when ec in soil water is low 3 4 exp 2 in field measurement the volumetric swc data evaluated using the 5te sensor were obtained from the top 5 cm and 5 10 cm of the field after irrigation with nh4cl kcl solution or the fertilizer solution fig 12 the differences between the actual measurement heating dry and corrected or uncorrected 5te sensor measured values were 2 5 0 86 and 5 1 2 8 respectively indicating that the error of the sensor decreased by half due to the correction in particular the effect of this correction was remarkable in the first experiment using the nh4cl kcl solution because a higher ec was observed the relative difference between the actual measurement and the uncorrected 5te sensor measurement was a maximum of 20 figs 12a 5 10 cm in the experiment using the mixture solution a previous study showed that 30 of the measurement values of swc sensors were changed by the effect of ec bogena et al 2007 this suggests that this field experiment covered approximately the maximum effect of ec on the 5te sensor therefore it is concluded that the method proposed by the present study is sufficient for correcting the maximum effect of ec on the 5te sensor 4 conclusion the current study defined a calibration method for the 5te sensor to address the influences of soil temperature and ec on the soil water which exhibits facile operation in the laboratory the high validity of this method was demonstrated by in field measurements of agricultural soil samples in particular the good performance of the calibration method was validated in samples after the fertilization of the soils and thus the ec in soil water increased from these results we concluded that the 5te sensor combined with the calibration method presented in the present study is useful for monitoring swc in the soil of agricultural fields

in field environments there is a lack of applications in agricultural fields using information from existing studies in addition the referred calibration methods are often complicated because they imply the use of specific reagents and numerical analysis for convenient use of 5te sensors in agricultural fields it is essential to define a calibration method for the influences of temperature and ec under simple operation and to validate the method in the real world environment ec is considered an important factor for sensor measurements because fertilizing increases ec values in the soil water of agricultural fields the purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the reliability and accessibility of the 5te sensor used in agricultural fields a calibration method to address the influences of soil temperature and ec in soil water was defined through a lab scale experiment subsequently the validation of this method was examined through in field measurements for laboratory experiments sensor measurements were conducted under various soil conditions using dried field soil pure water nh4cl solution and a thermostatic reservoir subsequently a calibration formula for the swc was established from the experimental data for in field measurements swc in the soils was monitored using the 5te sensor which followed a calibration method by means of weekly actual gravimetric measurements additionally an enrichment experiment using inorganic elemental solutions and chemical fertilizers was conducted in the field to observe the influence of ec comparing the sensor measurements and the actual values of swc the 5te sensor and its calibration method were validated finally the high suitability of the 5te sensor in the agricultural field using the proposed calibration method was confirmed 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments soil was collected from the surface top of 5 cm of the agricultural field at the institute of environmental sciences ies located in the northeast of japan 40 57 n 141 22 e table 1 the sand content which largely influences the moisture holding ability of the collected soil was not remarkable the soil was dried at 60 c until its weight remained constant and then it was sufficiently mixed by testing a portion of the dried soil a small change in its weight after heating at 105 c for 1 d was confirmed this indicates that drying at 60 c was sufficient to remove the soil water dried soil was defined as 0 volumetric water content a schematic of the experimental procedure is presented in fig 1 to prepare soil samples with various water contents the dried soil ca 300 g per operation and an arbitrary amount of pure water were transferred to an aluminum bag lamizip al 22 300 mm 220 mm seisannipponsha ltd japan and mixed by hand shaking for 10 min subsequently the aluminum bag with soil was left at 60 c for 30 min heating was performed to homogenize the swc after heating the soil temperature decreased to 31 36 c to determine the volumetric water content in the adjusted soil a fraction of the soil was packed into a cylindrical polystyrene container 68 mm 56 mm φ and weighed because the gravimetric water content and weight of the treated soil were known the amount of soil water in the container could be estimated from the amount of water in the adjusted soil and the volume of the container the volumetric water content of the soil was estimated the adjusted soil from the container was directly used for subsequent experiments three 5te sensors connected to a data logger em50 decagon devices inc with a recording interval of 1 min were installed in the adjusted soil that filled the cylindrical polystyrene container fig 1b additionally the polystyrene container was designed to be relatively small for convenient use in the laboratory experiment three sensors were installed on the container were spaced at 0 2 mm intervals although the tight spacing of the sensors may cause problems such as interference between sensors the size and handleability of the container preceded this concern the difference between the three sensors was small described in the following section suggesting a small influence from the tight spacing of the sensors for installation of the sensor in soil it is recommended that the black plastic base of the sensor be fully buried in the soil decagon devices inc 2006 however the base was not fully buried in this study because the aim was to measure the surface 0 5 cm soil of the actual field the soil was in a warm condition 31 36 c because of the preceding step the experimental system in fig 1b was left in a thermostatic reservoir cn 25 c mitsubishi electric co ltd japan at 4 c for 1 5 h therefore measurements using the 5te sensor under different swcs 0 56 1 m3 m 3 and soil temperatures 13 30 c were obtained this was defined as the pure water experiment this measured value was used in a calibration formula under the condition of no influence of ec on the soil water to obtain a dataset for the analysis of the influence of ec a measured value for the 5te sensor was obtained by an experimental system similar to that described above using nh4cl solutions at different concentrations 0 002 0 5 m instead of pure water this was defined as the nh4cl solution experiment the soil temperature ec and dielectric permittivity in soil water were measured for all laboratory experiments using the 5te sensor 2 2 in field measurements 2 2 1 continuous monitoring experiment exp 1 five 5te sensors were installed on the surface of the agricultural field at the ies from may 22 to august 31 2017 fig 2 the sensor was vertically set for the laboratory experiments fig 1b and the swc at a depth of ca 5 cm from the surface was monitored the measured value from the sensor was recorded using the same type of data logger as the laboratory experiment at 5 min intervals the amount of precipitation was also monitored in the field using a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset inc usa chemical mixed fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus and potassium was added to the field before the observations and cabbage was cultivated during that period for the gravimetric measurement of swc a soil surface 0 5 cm sample was collected weekly using a cylindrical stainless cup 50 mm 56 mm φ the soil was obtained from zones a b and c in fig 2 resulting in a sample number of three in one sampling the water content in the soil was measured using the gravimetric method at 60 c 2 2 2 enrichment experiment exp 2 in a similar field as exp 1 a 20 20 cm quadrat was prepared using an acrylic plate in the field with three 5te sensors installed fig 3 a solution 1 1 of nh4cl 1 m and kcl 1 m or a slurry of pure water with organic chemical fertilizer 25 g l 1 nagaoka yuuki no 2 nagaokakasei co ltd japan carbon and nitrogen contents of 6 5 and 0 3 respectively were irrigated in the quadrat at a volume of 2 l after 3 h of irrigation five core samples were collected from the quadrats from four corners and the center using a polyethylene corer 50 300 mm fujiwara scientific co ltd japan the top 5 cm of the core sample was transferred to an aluminum bag the top 5 cm of the residual core sample i e 5 10 cm of the core sample was also collected after measurements from three 5te sensors were performed per sample therefore the measured values from the sensor were n 3 for the top 5 cm and n 15 for 5 10 cm the water content of the collected core samples was measured by the gravimetric method at 60 c which was defined as the actual measurement value the sensor and actual measured values were compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration for influence of soil temperature the calibration curves of the 5te sensor at each temperature were successfully constructed using the dataset in the pure water experiment fig 4 the calibration curves at each temperature are represented by the following regression lines with a high determination coefficient r2 0 93 1 y a x b where y is the volumetric water content in the soil m3 m 3 x is the sensor measurement mv a m3 m 3 mv 1 is a coefficient and b m3 m 3 is a constant because the correlation coefficient negligibly changed with an increase in the degree of regression lines degree 1 4 r 0 97 0 99 the regression of the first degree was selected for the calibration curve in the calibration curves for each temperature the values of coefficients a and b for each soil temperature were different from each other indicating that the measured value from the 5te sensor is influenced by temperature this is consistent with previous studies bogena et al 2007 kizito et al 2008 saito et al 2009 fares et al 2016 coefficients a and b in eq 1 were expressed as functions of temperature using quadric regressions with high determination coefficients r2 0 99 fig 5 this suggests that a specific soil temperature calibration curve can be established using the equations presented in fig 5 3 2 calibration to investigate the influence of ec in soil water the solute i e nh4cl in the soil water clearly influenced the sensor measurements fig 6 however the degree of influence was not proportional to the solute concentration under the same swc the changing ratio from the measured value of the sensor related to the pure water experiment was not proportional to the concentration of nh4cl the non proportionality between the sensor measurement and the solute concentration was also addressed by bogena et al 2007 the value increases with ec in the soil water in the range of 0 100 ms m 1 and then decreases in the range of 100 250 ms m 1 the decrease in the measured values from the sensor at higher solute concentrations i e higher ec could not be explained precisely from the results of the present study since an interionic interaction generally increases with a high solute concentration it may influence the non proportionality to quantitatively evaluate the influence of ec the ec factor ecf defined as the change ratio of the sensor measurement by the influence of ec was defined as follows 2 e c f r n a r p a where rn a is the measured value from the sensor in a swc of a in the nh4cl solution experiment mv and rp a is the measured value from the sensor in a swc of a in the pure water experiment mv the ec factor represents the ratio of the sensor measurement in the pure water experiment to that of the nh4cl solution experiment under the same swc the ec factor is dependent on the ec ec is measured in the soil water air mixture along with the dielectric permittivity using the 5te sensor ec in the solution changes in soil due to interactions with water and soil particles corwin and lesch 2003 herein the ec of 0 05 m nh4cl solution at 20 c was measured to be ca 640 ms m 1 using the 5te sensor while the ec of the soil in which the water content was adjusted to 40 by 0 05 m nh4cl solution was ca 170 ms m 1 therefore the ec measured in the soil water air mixture was applied for the functional analysis of the ec factor in addition the data for nh4cl solutions less than 10 ms m 1 were not used for this analysis because of the wide differences in the measured values from the sensors plots for the ec factor as a function of ec at each temperature fig 7 were constructed and tertiary regressions were applied with a high determination coefficient r2 0 90 at each temperature using the polynomial equation 3 y a x 3 b x 2 c x 1 where x is the ec measured by the 5te sensor ms m 1 a ms 3 m3 b ms 2 m2 and c ms 1 m are coefficients the tertiary regression was selected because the determination coefficient for this regression was significantly greater than that of the quadratic regression from 20 to 30 c p 0 05 and was similar to that of the quadratic regression at the measured temperature p 0 1 the coefficients in eq 3 were represented by functions linearly related to the soil temperature fig 8 which led to high determination coefficients r2 0 95 this suggests that the soil temperature specific eq 3 can be constructed using the equations in fig 8 resulting in an estimated soil temperature specific ec factor using the ec factor the measured values from the sensor influenced by ec can be changed to values with no influence from ec 3 3 exp 1 in field measurement to estimate the swc from the measured values from the sensor three calibration curves were applied the first curve a was established using the data obtained from the pure water experiment at 20 c the second b was estimated using eq 1 which was complemented by the functions shown in fig 5 i e correction of the temperature influence the third one c was similarly constructed with b after the correction of the sensor measured value using the ec factor which was estimated using eq 3 and presented in fig 8 i e correction for temperature and ec influence the temperature and ec data were measured using the 5te sensor along with the dielectric permittivity fig 9a and b the sensor and actual measured values of the swcs in the field are shown in fig 10 the changes in both values were clearly related to precipitation events fig 9c for the data in fig 10 the difference between the sensor and the actual measured values ds a was estimated as follows 4 d s a a b s s t a t a t where s t is a sensor measured value on a date of t a t is the actual measured value in the date indicated as t and abs denotes an absolute value in the angled bracket the average ds a values for calibrations a b and c were 11 5 13 1 sd 1σ 11 6 12 9 and 10 4 13 1 respectively fig 10 these differences corresponded to 2 5 1 8 2 5 1 7 and 2 2 1 9 of the swc m3 m 3 respectively calibration c led to the smallest difference between the sensor and actual measurements which corrected the temperature and ec influences a high similarity of calibration c with the actual measurements was observed early in the observation period fig 11 this was due to the high ec in soil water during this period fig 9b and the high ec was probably derived from the dissolution of the fertilizer added before the observation term details in section 2 in calibrations a and b the difference from the actual measurement was almost similar fig 11 because the soil temperature was approximately 20 c during the field measurement fig 9a it is suggested that correction for the influence of temperature was not as effective for the swc estimation a calibration curve defined in the field at an average soil temperature may be sufficient to monitor swc using the 5te sensor when ec in soil water is low 3 4 exp 2 in field measurement the volumetric swc data evaluated using the 5te sensor were obtained from the top 5 cm and 5 10 cm of the field after irrigation with nh4cl kcl solution or the fertilizer solution fig 12 the differences between the actual measurement heating dry and corrected or uncorrected 5te sensor measured values were 2 5 0 86 and 5 1 2 8 respectively indicating that the error of the sensor decreased by half due to the correction in particular the effect of this correction was remarkable in the first experiment using the nh4cl kcl solution because a higher ec was observed the relative difference between the actual measurement and the uncorrected 5te sensor measurement was a maximum of 20 figs 12a 5 10 cm in the experiment using the mixture solution a previous study showed that 30 of the measurement values of swc sensors were changed by the effect of ec bogena et al 2007 this suggests that this field experiment covered approximately the maximum effect of ec on the 5te sensor therefore it is concluded that the method proposed by the present study is sufficient for correcting the maximum effect of ec on the 5te sensor 4 conclusion the current study defined a calibration method for the 5te sensor to address the influences of soil temperature and ec on the soil water which exhibits facile operation in the laboratory the high validity of this method was demonstrated by in field measurements of agricultural soil samples in particular the good performance of the calibration method was validated in samples after the fertilization of the soils and thus the ec in soil water increased from these results we concluded that the 5te sensor combined with the calibration method presented in the present study is useful for monitoring swc in the soil of agricultural fields

9982,water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of plant carbon gain to water use in various spatio temporal scales is a complex indicator of physiological agronomic and engineering processes as well as management practices improving wue at different scales is an important pathway to combat the global water shortage and ensure food supply which requires both understanding the physiological mechanisms of crop responding and adapting to water deficit and innovating field water management technologies we reviewed advances and perspectives in the research field related to improving wue at different scales and discussed the key obstacles and possible solutions in practice a water saving quality improving high efficient water use strategy was proposed and an integrative management approach making use of diverse advanced wue improving technologies was constructed both the water use strategy and integrative approach were developed based on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit crop life water requirements precision irrigation water management according to real time monitoring of crop responses to water deficit as well as crop water yield quality models the review was expected to provide a reference for researchers in the water management communities and boost sustainable development of water saving agriculture in water shortage areas keywords water use efficiency water deficit physiological mechanisms crop water yield quality model irrigation water management spatio temporal scale integrated strategy 1 introduction the imbalance between rising food demand and insufficient water supply for agriculture is a global issue lobell et al 2014 the world population is expected to continuously grow at a fast pace in the future 30 50 years united nations 2017 the continuous growth of the world population poses a great challenge to global food supply and water security lesk et al 2016 fao has warned in 2018 that global food production has to increase by 70 in 2050 to ensure food security while increasing food production requires more agricultural water use elliott et al 2014 therefore food and water security have become an important challenge for humankind condon 2020 water security is the foundation of food security as water shortage will directly lead to fluctuation of food production alcamo et al 2007 kang et al 2017 agriculture is the major water consumption sector accounting for more than 70 of total water use worldwide it is unsustainable to increase food production simply by expanding agricultural water use hence saving water in agriculture becomes a necessary part of the solution kang 2019 developing water saving agriculture and improving water use efficiency wue is necessary for ensuring global water and food security wue defined as the ratio of plant carbon gain to water use in various spatio temporal scales is a complex indicator of physiological agronomic engineering processes and management practices leakey et al 2019 clothier et al 2020 fernández et al 2020 final grain or fruit wue is coordinated by the three key processes the ratio of transpiration to total water use transpiration efficiency for carbon fixation per unit of water and the ratio of biomass converted into grain yield or harvest index condon 2020 water use efficiency is also referred to as water productivity wp in the literature when wue is expressed as the ratio of biomass yield or fruit to water supply or total evapotranspiration kijne et al 2003 molden et al 2003 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 steduto et al 2009 crop wue involves different spatial scales of molecular cell organ leaf plant population field watershed and temporal scales of instant hour day month growth season year condon 2020 wue at different spatio temporal scales might not be positively related due to different time canopy and environmental conditions involved sadras and richards 2014 for example improvement in wue at the leaf scale does not necessarily mean wue improvement at a plant or population scale similarly the largest wue at an instant or daily scale is not the largest at the growth period or year scale sadras and richards 2014 the so called decoupling or inconsistencies of wue at different scales is found more pronounced under water deficit therefore improving wue requires the optimum coupling of water and carbon processes at various spatio temporal scales and multi factor coordination dunn et al 2019 kang et al 2017 papacek et al 2019 condon 2020 maurel and nacry 2020 numerous studies have reviewed the progress and approaches of improving wue in agriculture sinclair et al 1984 howell 2001 kijne et al 2003 condon et al 2004 blum 2005 deng et al 2006 nonetheless there is still room for improvement in the extent of adopting water saving agriculture and in the developing countries where there is a big gap between actual and potential wue at different scales of individual crop and field hsiao et al 2007 kang et al 2017 changing the irrigation and fertilization ways is possible to improve yield by 30 when the other conditions are similar mueller et al 2012 factors contributing to the gap between actual and potential wue include unmatched or not closely matched high efficient irrigation technologies with agronomic practices lack of scientific and precise control of field water use and imbalance between regional cropping structure and water resources howell 2001 hsiao et al 2007 kang et al 2017 following the three factors mentioned above there are three aspects needed to be worked on to promote water saving agriculture and improve wue first improving wue has to be done from a plant or crop perspective and requires studies on exploiting the crop s physiological water saving potential to reduce water consumption and maintain yield condon et al 2004 blum 2005 fereres and soriano 2007 kang 2019 although water stress may interrupt crop normal growth the crop itself has evolved to be able to prevent water loss prioritize water supply to important organs maintain cell water content and develop surviving strategies under water stress condon et al 2004 nadal and flexas 2019 the impact of water stress on crops depends on crops drought tolerance as well as the intensity and duration of water stress blum 2005 studying the mechanisms of crops maintaining growth under mild to moderate stress and based on the results designing a strategy that can improve crop survival ability could provide solutions for improving yield and wue gupta et al 2020 it is also important to develop new cultivars that were drought tolerant and use water effectively medrano et al 2015 second new water saving quality improving and high efficient irrigation technologies are needed for improving wue at the field scale jovanovic et al 2020 these technologies are applied for the smart control of field water status according to precisely monitoring crops life water requirements clwr and crop responses to water stress and can also stimulate the compensatory effects after a certain level of water stress control redundant growth and regulate stomatal water carbon relations through root shoot signaling kang et al 2017 other techniques that can reduce soil evaporation increase infiltration and soil water storage improve light use efficiency and field wue such as planting density and cropping structure adjustment fertilization application of anti transpirant and soil additives plastic and straw mulches etc green et al 2010 vaz et al 2016 yang et al 2018 are also needed mueller et al 2012 third improving wue requires exploiting the water saving potential of irrigation systems at a regional scale hsiao et al 2007 for that regional water resources are needed to be properly allocated to match the cropping structure and from that to build a climate adaptive and water saving planting system green et al 2010 smart irrigation districts are needed for the precise allocation of water resources according to the cropping structure and crop models to reduce water loss and improve wue the objectives of this review were to propose a high efficient water use strategy and to construct an integrative approach that puts together diverse wue improving methods fig 1 the water use strategy was developed based on the physiological responses of the crop to water deficit crop life water requirements precision irrigation management according to real time monitoring crop responses to water deficit and crop water yield quality models the integrated approaches were built using the physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit as well as innovative irrigation technologies we reviewed the advances of associated research fields and discussed the main obstacles and possible solutions in adopting the strategy in practice as well as the outlook of future studies in the field specifically the topics focused on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit stress and improving water use efficiency regulating field water status precisely and improving water use efficiency based on accurate monitoring crop s responses to water deficit measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements and quantitative models of water yield quality relations the review was anticipated to provide references for researchers in the field and encourage the development of water saving agriculture in arid and water shortage areas 2 physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water deficit many studies have shown that the improvement of wue under mild or moderate water stress is the result of the combined effects of root growth sharp et al 2004 prince et al 2017 kang 2019 root shoot signaling and stomata optimum regulation kang and zhang 2004 zait et al 2019 redundant growth control and compensatory effect after water stress goodwin and boland 2002 kang and cai 2002 gucci et al 2019 fig 2 showed the physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water deficit as well as the processes related to their effects on wue adapting from the findings of previous studies zhang and davies 1989 davies et al 2002 sharp 2002 chaves et al 2003 wilkinson 2004 wilkinson and hartung 2009 papacek et al 2019 some studies reported that root development could be maintained under water deficit stress sharp 2002 wilkinson and hartung 2009 kang 2019 papacek et al 2019 maurel and nacry 2020 the mechanisms underlying root growth maintenance under water stress are osmotic adjustment cell loosening enhancement and abscisic acid aba accumulation sharp et al 2004 hormone aba plays an important role in regulating root development responding to water deficit and has been proven essential for maintaining root growth at low water potential sharp 2002 crops under water deficit need an elevated aba level relative to those with sufficient water supply to prevent excess ethylene production sharp 2002 this difference might be related to the role played by the accumulated aba in promoting anti oxidation systems to keep reactive oxygen species ros at a non destructive level during the water deficit ober and sharp 2003 primary roots of different species such as cotton and corn were shown to have similar tissue water potential and spatial pattern which indicates the two species had the same osmotic adjustment mechanism kang 2019 however comparing the metabolic reaction of corn and cotton at the same tissue water potential showed that the two species had distinct metabolic regulation mechanisms the difference in glutathione content between corn and cotton responding to water deficit reflects the difference of root exposure to ros between the two species indicating that in the cotton root system catalase cat and ascorbate peroxidase apx had an important anti oxidation function to prevent ros production and exposure while corn adopted a more diverse metabolic and enzymatic anti oxidation strategy kang 2019 studies also showed that high efficient root metabolism could improve crop tolerance to drought genard et al 2014 water deficit can improve root water conductivity and use efficiency by increasing root xylem quantity stimulating lateral root growth increasing root surface area and root shoot ratio prince et al 2017 the mechanisms of the direct effects of water stress on root growth and development and tissue hydraulics have been revealed while the signaling mechanisms controlling partial and systematic responses to water deficit as a function of wue remain largely unknown maurel and nacry 2020 when soil becomes increasingly drier more roots would produce signaling chemicals with greater intensity which enables crops to regulate above ground physiological growth and development according to soil water availability cramer et al 2009 studies on the signal s type production and transduction showed that root could synthesize and emit many types of signal chemicals when soil is under drought and these signals could be emitted in the form of electrochemical waves or chemicals themselves from cells under water stress and transduced from the place they are produced to the place they act on davies et al 2002 wilkinson and hartung 2009 aba is produced in roots under drought transduced to above ground through transpiration where leaf physiological functions e g leaf expansion rate and stomatal conductance are regulated davies et al 2002 liang et al 1997 the root can produce aba quickly after suffering water stress and its content varies several to dozens of times depending on different crops davies and zhang 1991 moreover the amount of aba produced by roots is closely related to soil water content surrounding those roots indicating aba could be one of the indices for root zone soil water content kang and zhang 2004 dodd et al 2008 these root signals can help reduce water transpiration through stomata when branches and leaves have not yet sensed water deficit which could be the first line of defense for crops combating drought the second line of defense might be the wilting of lower and senile leaves with the enduring drought schulz et al 2021 this root shoot signaling theory provided the theoretical background for regulating root zone water deficit conditions to improve wue and based on that alternate partial rootzone irrigation apri theory and technologies have been developed kang and zhang 2004 alternative wetting and drying part of the root zone could induce roots in dry soil producing aba signal and leaves ethylene emission pérez pérez et al 2020 which in turn reduce stomatal openness leaf growth rate and luxury transpiration improve wue achieving the goal of saving water without yield reduction and higher fruit quality kang et al 1997 loveys et al 1997 kang and zhang 2004 wang et al 2012 the most direct response of crops to water deficit is to partially close stomata to reduce stomatal conductance and water transpiration tambussi et al 2007 zait et al 2019 mild water deficit could enhance photosynthesis by impacting mesophyll conductance through osmotic adjustment leaf structure change and photosynthetic ability cano et al 2014 buckley et al 2017 zait et al 2019 a large ratio of mesophyll to stomatal conductance under water stress could reduce transpiration while maintaining or enhancing photosynthesis tomás et al 2014 water deficit could improve photosynthetic ability by increasing nitrogen content per unit leaf area while having little impact on stomatal conductance buckley et al 2017 studies showed that proper water stress could improve photosynthesis to achieve better water carbon balance and improve wue by enhancing carboxylation rate increasing co2 saturated maximum photosynthetic rate and reducing vascular bundle sheath cell leaking von caemmerer and furbank 2016 relative to sufficient water supply more carbon is transported to root or shoot under water stress which increases water uptake and transport ability per unit leaf area and results in a greater capacity to regulate water carbon exchange buckley et al 2017 ullah et al 2019 however severe water stress could damage leaf tissue and reduce photosynthesis buckley et al 2017 when the root zone is drying stomatal conductance reduction is faster than photosynthesis reduction and with shrinking stomatal openness the decline of photosynthesis rate is slower than transpiration rate so that wue is improved condon 2020 although redundant growth is an ecological strategy for crops adapting to the changing environment to enhance survival and reduce the risk of extinction this has become the waste and burden in a water deficit cropland dodd 2009 reasonable water supply can regulate root growth to prevent the excessive growth of root stem leaf and other components maintain the optimal growth of each component balance the root shoot ratio and improve economic yield and wue chai et al 2015 costa et al 2007 ali et al 2018 gucci et al 2019 crops can undergo certain compensatory growth after water stress was alleviated kang et al 2002a 2000b a strategic growth stage based deficit irrigation in maize about 1 2 water amount of full irrigation at the seedling stage and 2 3 water amount of full irrigation at the jointing stage improved significantly wue while maintained yield kang et al 2000b du et al 2015 water deficit could shorten the vegetative growth period and lengthen the grain filling period so that biomass could be accumulated more on kernel after flowering zhang et al 2008 reducing irrigation water by 50 at a certain period of pears did not affect yield significantly goodwin and boland 2002 because of the discrepancy between fruit trees vegetative growth branches and fruit growth rate strictly controlling irrigation frequency and amount during the fruit earlier development stage about 4 weeks after flowering and fruit slow growth period and enforcing trees undergoing certain water stress could adjust the distribution of photosynthetic products among different organs and reduce vegetative organs redundant growth re watering during fruit fast growth stage could lead to fruit quick expansion costa et al 2007 gucci et al 2019 to improve wue genotypes or cultivars of efficient water use are required by either natural mutation or gene engineering or both condon 2020 studies were carried out extensively on identifying and exploiting the target traits valuable for improving wue to facilitate breeding drought tolerance and high efficient water use cultivars dunn et al 2019 condon 2020 traditionally genotypes or cultivars were grown under non irrigated conditions in mediterranean environments and selected based on their adaptation to water deficit conditions galmés et al 2011 patanè et al 2016 guida et al 2017 the selection of landraces other than those of drought tolerant genotypes or cultivars represents an interesting genetic source in breeding and or biotechnological improvements for drought tolerance and high wue galmés et al 2011 2013 siracusa et al 2012 medrano et al 2015 3 regulating field water status precisely and improving water use efficiency based on accurate monitoring of crop water status accurately monitoring crop responses to water deficit is the key element for precisely regulating field water status and improving yield and wue clothier et al 2020 fernández et al 2020 many technologies have been developed to monitor crop responses to water deficit through new non contact high throughput phenotyping techniques instead of measuring soil water content watt et al 2020 to improve wue and exert a designed level of water stress accurately monitoring crop water status and precisely regulating field water status are both required so that crop water could be maintained in the proper range and the goals of water saving good quality and high efficiency could be achieved kang et al 1994 hsiao et al 2007 table 1 showed the available precise regulation techniques of field water status based on accurate monitoring and diagnosis of crop response to water deficit along with the measuring indicators these techniques can be classified into three types the first type is based on the direct measurement of water deficit status visible wilting tissue water content leaf water potential via pressure chamber psychrometer pressure probe etc or xylem cavitation embolism were measured as indicators of crop water status kang et al 1994 jones 2004 liu et al 2020 the drawbacks of these methods when used in irrigation scheduling are that they cannot tell how much to irrigate and sometimes the threshold values of some indices to trigger irrigation need to be recalibrated given that the short time fluctuation of the index might be greater than the treatment difference jones 2004 for example irrigation water use was reduced by 10 without yield reduction when irrigation was triggered by leaf water potential reaching 0 7 mpa relative to those cases with the threshold values at 0 4 and 0 5 mpa for a manually operated variable rate lateral irrigated cotton field in the south eastern u s meeks et al 2020 therefore leaf water potential between 0 5 mpa to 0 7 mpa could be used as a threshold value to trigger irrigation to achieve a high yield and larger wue for cotton meeks et al 2020 the second type is based on measuring indices indicating crop response to water deficit e g leaf stomatal conductance porometer leaf or canopy temperature stem or fruit diameter sap flow etc ortuño et al 2008 liu et al 2011 the maximum daily variation of stem diameter mds is an important parameter of stem diameter indicating the change of crop cell water uptake water loss cycle and thermal expansion and contraction daudet et al 2004 signal strength dividing mds or sf under water deficit by those under sufficient water simds and sisf was used for water deficit diagnosis ortuño et al 2010 simds was used to diagnose the water deficit of apricots goldhamer and fereres 2004 puerto et al 2013 other studies indicated that relative to sisf simds was more sensitive to water change of pears and irrigation scheduling based on simds was more precise conejero et al 2007a 2007b however opposite results have been reported that both simds and sisf were not suitable for water status diagnosis for olive trees under water deficit conditions fernández et al 2011 girón et al 2016 therefore this type of method is mostly limited in research studies and has not been adopted widely in practice the third type is based on non contact measuring indices including handhold or portable crop phenotype measurements handhold chlorophyll fluorometer handhold hyper spectrometer smart handhold hyperspectral imager portable chlorophyll fluorescence imager etc hou et al 2019 matese et al 2018 greenhouse compact and large conveyor belt imager and analysis platform chlorophyll fluorescence imaging spectral imaging of rgb hyperspectral imaging and infrared thermal imaging etc drone and remote sensing phenotype analysis platform drone equipped with rgb imaging hyperspectral imaging infrared thermal imaging multispectral imaging light detection and ranging lidar vanegas et al 2018 and aerial remote sensing french et al 2020 these methods are non destructive take crop environment into account and sometimes are very sensitive for these methods the threshold values to trigger irrigation need to be calibrated also instruments are expensive and often need to be operated by professionally trained personals therefore this type of method is still in the research and development phase and is expected to gain wide application in the future leaf chlorophyll content can represent well the intensity of water deficit and be measured directly with chlorophyll fluorometer hou et al 2019 and indirectly through the relations between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and chlorophyll content established using remote sensing data chlorophyll content was estimated with ndvi obtained by a multispectral camera mao et al 2018 however information included in the ndvi alone is quite limited and chlorophyll sensitive wavelength differs between different growth periods recently many scientists have carried out studies on estimating chlorophyll content with multi ndvi and also on chlorophyll content of different growth periods through inversion of remote sensing data xu et al 2019 crop water stress index cwsi obtained through canopy temperature reflects canopy water status and could be used to guide field water management practices condon 2020 a drone equipped with an infrared thermal imager provided a new high efficient and reliable method for fast measuring large area canopy temperature matese et al 2018 leaf area index and biomass were estimated through statistical models established with a series of ndvis of multispectral and hyperspectral cameras with ground truth data or through machine learning aasen et al 2015 li et al 2018 the lidar could actively collect plant cloud data to get morphological and structure information harkel et al 2019 li et al 2020 however given that crops are often densely planted and short lidar alone is not good enough for extract phenotype information and assimilation with other data sources is needed to increase the estimation accuracy nora et al 2015 combing the accurate monitoring of crop responses to water deficit with precise control of field water status would play an important role in improving wue 4 measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements crop life water requirements clwr is an essential component for implementing high efficient water use and precise water management practices clwr is defined as the sum of plant transpiration soil evaporation and water incorporated into plant tissues during their lifetime period when the plant has always been disease free well fertilized under optimum soil water conditions and achieving full production in the large area under given climatic condition kang et al 1994 allen et al 1998 since the amount of water incorporated into the plant tissues is relatively small accounting for less than 1 of clwr clwr is generally approximated as the sum of the first two components referred to as evapotranspiration et allen et al 1998 plant transpiration is affected by root zone water supply xylem hydraulic transport leaf stomatal regulation and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit berry et al 2010 jones 2014 tardieu et al 2015 soil evaporation a process in which the water phase changes from a liquid to a vapor state on the soil surface and diffuses to the atmosphere is controlled by meteorological factors crop canopy coverage and soil surface moisture shuttleworth 2007 physically water flows from the soil into the atmosphere via the plant commonly known as the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac specifically water molecules are absorbed into the plant root system from the soil transported through the stem xylem enters the leaf and then diffuses from the leaf stomata to the atmospheric boundary layer kang et al 1994 monteith 1995 caldeira et al 2014 the spac system is an integrated dynamic interactive and continuous system clwr depends on the climate crop characteristics management practices and soil environments allen et al 1998 meteorological variables such as solar radiation atmospheric temperature humidity and wind speed exert control on clwr by affecting evaporation demand water requirement varies for different crop types cultivars and growth periods when the growing conditions are similar the water requirement is determined by stomata resistance crop height roughness reflectivity canopy coverage and root conditions shuttleworth 2007 management practices and growing conditions affect clwr by changing the local microclimate and crop growth for example agronomic practices and irrigation methods affected clwr by altering local microclimate crop growth and development or the surface soil and leaves humidity jones 2014 planting windbreak forests in windy and arid areas with high temperatures could reduce clwr in the encircled field by decreasing wind speed schymanski and or 2016 different plant densities affected clwr through changing canopy coverage and plant height jiang et al 2014 soil evaporation and evapotranspiration were reduced after using water saving irrigation methods drip and micro sprinkler irrigation due to partial soil surface wetting wang et al 2020b and plastic or straw mulches besides the clwr is influenced by environmental conditions such as soil textures organic matter contents and groundwater supply kang et al 2001 jones 2014 there are two types of classical methods for determining clwr direct measurement and indirect methods i e model estimation table 2 direct measurement methods include soil water balance method lysimeter bowen ratio energy balance eddy covariance plant physiology methods sap flow and porometer inversion based on remote sensing etc shuttleworth 2007 zhang et al 2007 ding et al 2010 jones 2014 pereira et al 2020 model estimation method includes crop coefficient method big leaf penman monteith dual source shuttleworth wallace multilayer model etc allen et al 1998 shuttleworth 2007 zhang et al 2008 2009 monteith and unsworth 2013 ding et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 2018 jiang et al 2019 pereira et al 2020 each method has its advantages and disadvantages and is suitable for different conditions table 2 among them the lysimeter method and crop coefficient method are the most widely used direct measurement and model estimation methods respectively allen et al 1998 shuttleworth 2007 pereira et al 2020 the crop coefficient approach estimates clwr by multiplying crop coefficients for a specific crop under different conditions with the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 smart water management based on clwr is an important approach for improving wue irrigation scheduling determined based on clwr reduced irrigation water by as much as 42 compared with conventional empirical irrigation scheduling davis and dukes 2010 precise et estimation helps to implement effective irrigation management while effective irrigation management in turn can save irrigation water reduce the risks of groundwater loss and degradation save energy and maintain crop yield irrigation scheduling based on et reduced irrigation by 21 34 while maintaining a similar yield in a study conducted on lettuce and cauliflower at salinas experimental station ca u s johnson et al 2016 studies on both woody plants and field crops in arid areas of the south eastern part of spain have also shown that et based irrigation scheduling improved wue significantly garcía et al 2020 irrigation scheduling based on et was found to control soil water status prevent water stress save irrigation water use and improve wue in an olive orchard in an arid area argentina capraro et al 2018 other researchers have tried to use meteorological data to directly estimate surface resistance and clwr salvucci and gentine 2013 rigden and salvucci 2015 variables related to crop physiological processes and characteristics have been included in estimating clwr such as canopy radiation use efficiency rue wue and photosynthetic carbon fixation stoy et al 2019 sinclair and ghanem 2020 although there have been some encouraging results some issues regarding the accurate determination of the clwrs remain to be addressed 1 to develop methods that can accurately partition between soil evaporation and plant transpiration plant transpiration is directly related to crop photosynthetic production while soil evaporation is generally considered to be lost and ineffective for plant production pieruschka et al 2010 however the two components are difficult to differentiate allen et al 1998 kool et al 2014 therefore studies on the methods that are based on physical and physiological mechanisms and able to partition the two components in a more precise way are urgently needed 2 to develop clwr estimation methods based on crop physiological mechanisms and water consumption processes current methods are essentially empirical and indirect given that they do not take full account of crop water physiological processes stoy et al 2019 sinclair and ghanem 2020 physiological methods that can take advantage of the latest advances in crop physiology and stomatal regulation theory are needed 3 to develop clwr diagnosis methods and associated precision management practices based on real time monitoring crop water or stomatal opening status real time monitoring crop water content or stomatal opening becomes feasible with the advances of modern technologies for example remote sensing technology or ground infrared thermometer can be used to monitor canopy temperature or albedo and then obtain crop moisture and stomatal opening jones 2014 matese et al 2018 stoy et al 2019 however precise clwr diagnosis methods as well as precise water management practices based on real time data are still needed 5 quantitative models of crop water yield quality and their applications crop water yield models have been the focus of many studies and gained wide application in practice allen et al 1998 steduto et al 2009 there are two types of crop water yield models depending on the length of growth period considered in the model steduto et al 2009 the first type of model is to describe the relations between crop yield and the total water consumption or relative water consumption during the whole growing period having either linear or parabolic forms the second type of model is to related crop yield to water consumption at different growth stages these models are often used to allocate limited water supply for optimum irrigation timing and amount of each irrigation attempting to maximize the crop yield or total production at a given area kang and cai 2002 hsiao et al 2007 although there have been extensive studies on water yield models since the 1960 s many critical issues remain unsolved steduto et al 2009 from the late 1960s crop models capable of simulating crop growth dynamics have been established based on knowledge in crop physiology ecology and micrometeorology and have been used to optimize irrigation and fertilization practices through scenario analysis todorovic et al 2009 malik et al 2019 most crop models do not address crop quality simulation also there are still few studies on crop water quality models kang and cai 2002 chen et al 2014 as consumers pay more and more attention to crop quality high efficient water use decisions require a trade off between high yield and good quality chen et al 2021 preliminary development of statistical and process based water yield quality models has been explored based on many experiments and numerical studies chen et al 2014 génard et al 2014 adapted from crop water yield models crop water quality empirical statistical models have been developed to simulate the relationship between tomato quality and water deficit in different growth stages chen et al 2014 models based on plant physiological processes that could quantitatively describe the formation of crop quality have been developed fishman and génard 1998 génard et al 2014 for example the sugar model could simulate the changes in the sugar composition and content during fruit growth following the principle of fruit carbon balance fishman and génard 1998 fruit soluble sugar content is the result of a series of physiological and biochemical processes génard et al 2014 first the photosynthetic product mainly sucrose is transported from the leaves through the phloem and unloaded into the fruit then biochemical metabolism is carried out through the action of various enzymes in the fruit cell symplast apoplast and vacuole some of the metabolism products are used to synthesize cell wall materials organic acids proteins and temporary storage materials such as starch while some of them flow out of the fruit in the form of co2 through respiration and the rest of the products remain in fruit as soluble sugars mainly glucose and fructose meanwhile fruit water content has an important influence on soluble sugar content through dilution génard et al 2014 therefore three main underlying processes affect fruit soluble sugar content assimilation supply a metabolic transformation of sugars and dilution by fruit water content prudent et al 2011 water stress alters the input of fruit assimilate the transformation of sugar kobashi et al 2000 and fruit water balance keller et al 2006 thereby affecting the soluble sugar content conde et al 2007 although many studies have reported that water deficit affects the fruit soluble sugar content mitchell et al 1991 there are still different explanations for the mechanisms behind it some research reported that water deficit influenced the sugar metabolism process and increased the total sugar content in fruit veit köhler et al 1999 while others believed that water deficit only reduced the water content in fruit thus affecting the sugar concentration by dilution dehydration chen et al 2020 ehret and ho 1986 the process based dynamic model combining the effects of plant growth environment factors and agronomic management with fruit sugar metabolism processes could provide a valuable method to quantitatively describe the response of fruit soluble sugar content to external environmental and management practices génard et al 2007 chen et al 2020 following the sugar metabolisms and feedback loops of tomato fruits the tom sugar model was developed chen et al 2021 adapted from the sugar model génard et al 2007 further the tom sugar wc model was established according to the regulation of fruit water content on sugar metabolism to quantify the effect of fruit water content on transformation rates such as soluble sugar into other compounds or starch with the model the simulation accuracy of tomato sugar content has been improved especially under water deficit conditions chen et al 2020 also the sugar model has been coupled with the fruit growth model to simulate fruit growth and quality under different irrigation conditions chen et al 2021 one of the drawbacks of the process based crop water quality models is that the parameters in the model are complicated and difficult to obtain further studies are needed to incorporate the model into crop water saving and quality improving high efficient water use decision making systems 6 an integrated strategy of improving water use efficiency based on physiological mechanisms of crop response to water deficit and innovating irrigation methods implementing innovative irrigation technologies developed based on the understanding of physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit could greatly improve wue kang et al 2000a 2017 blanco et al 2019 gucci et al 2019 sarker et al 2020 ortega farisa et al 2020 owing to close cooperation between crop physiologists irrigation scientists and irrigation engineers a series of new irrigation strategies and technologies based on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit has been developed advancing from conventional irrigation scheduling based on soil water balance or et ertek et al 2006 hunsaker et al 2012 the newly developed strategies include non full irrigation nfi regulated deficit irrigation rdi controlled alternate partial rootzone irrigation apri and irrigation for coordinated regulating yield and quality iryq etc the advantages and disadvantages of these irrigation strategies and the applicable conditions were summarized in table 3 these water saving strategies could be implemented by surface furrow sprinkler and micro irrigation methods e g drip subsurface drip sprinkler water gun etc jovanovic et al 2020 6 1 non full irrigation recognizing that crop response and sensitivity to water deficit differ between different growth stages researchers proposed nfi when there is not enough water for full irrigation trout and dejonge 2017 under nfi the applied irrigation water does not meet clwr during the whole growing period nfi is not designed to maximize the yield as the full irrigation rather allow a certain degree of yield reduction nfi is a strategy that optimizes the allocation of limited water resources between different crops in a region and between different growth periods of a crop kang and cai 2002 to minimize yield loss and maximize return the limited amount of water under nfi is applied preferentially to the growth stages that are the most sensitive to water stress and have the greatest impact on the final yield while allowing crops during the other stages to suffer a certain degree of water stress essentially nfi is to solve the problem of how to allocate limited water optimally into different growth stages and the principle that nfi relies on is the water yield models mentioned above nfi has been extensively studied and applied in water shortage areas of china such as in shaanxi shanxi gansu hebei inner mongolia ningxia xinjiang shandong henan and heilongjiang for crops of wheat maize cotton and rice since the 1980s with remarkable water saving achievements kang and cai 2002 du et al 2015 jia et al 2018 future research and application of nfi need to be focused on the development of a network based nfi design software or decision support system for a specific crop or an irrigated area which directly serves irrigation managers and farmers further more efforts need to be done to provide suitable advanced surface irrigation methods and supporting equipment for nfi and strengthen farmers training on this technology to better promote the application of nfi du et al 2015 6 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi was developed based on the knowledge that crops physiological and biochemical processes may be affected by genes or growth hormones and the distribution of their photosynthetic products in different tissues or organs could be determined by water status during each growth period fereres and soriano 2007 in rdi crops are subjected to a certain level of water stress on purpose during some designated growth stages i e crops undergo some sort of water deficit training kang and cai 2002 through regulating the water status of different growth stages rdi can keep or increase the yield while hindering the vegetative growth and total biomass output which in turn could lead to greater planting density and higher yield less pruning work for crops like cotton and fruit trees and better fruit quality goodwin and boland 2002 kang et al 2017 this technology was first proposed and named rdi by the tatura centre of the australian institute of sustainable irrigated agriculture in the mid 1970s the mechanism for rdi to save water and increase yield is to control crop redundant vegetative growth and stimulate compensatory effect after applying water stress during some designated growth period kang and cai 2002 studies on rdi have been carried out extensively in the water limited regions of many countries with arid and semi arid climate such as australia chile china iran italy portugal spain turkey etc and included cereals fruit trees grapes and berries oil crops and vegetables e g maize wheat cherry hazelnut olives orange peaches pear jujubes blueberry grapes sunflower carrots cherry tomato tomato etc table 4 most of the studies reported that rdi could achieve the goal of high yield and good quality with less water use karam et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 kuscu et al 2014 blanco et al 2019 gucci et al 2019 garcia tejero et al 2010 ortega farisa et al 2020 a recent study has shown that rdi slightly reduced the 100 berry weight of grapes while increased fruit soluble solid content juice ph sugar content and total anthocyanin content and deceased total acid content before fruit ripening yang et al 2020 transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis screened out many differentially expressed genes deg and significantly changed metabolites scm in the rdi treatment group rdi treatment with 30 et could increase the expression level of seven genes related to the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway as well as the content of some metabolites yang et al 2020 future studies should advance the understanding of how crops would respond to various water deficit levels at different growth stages specifically how dynamics of water loss photosynthesis assimilate distribution and conversion efficiency between assimilating and economic yield would change what is the optimum allocation strategy of crop population photosynthate and what extent the effects of re watering on crop growth and yield are chai et al 2015 du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 for practical application of rdi optimal time and intensity i e optimal irrigation scheduling should be developed for fruit trees vegetables and field crops as well as precision irrigation technologies and agricultural management practices for ensuring successful application of rdi rdi should be integrated into water saving strategy techniques of micro irrigation to facilitate the precision and smart irrigation adopted for farmers jovanovic et al 2020 6 3 alternate partial rootzone irrigation apri is an innovative irrigation technology that combines physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit and an advanced approach for controlling water distribution at fields kang et al 1997 1998 dry and loveys 1999 the technology was developed based on root shoot signaling and leaf stomatal water carbon coordinated processes kang and zhang 2004 the procedure of apri is that soil in the root zone should be separated into parts in the horizontal or vertical direction and they should be kept alternately dry and wet during the growth period to make the roots in different zones undergo a certain degree of water deficit priming at different times roots in the dry soil would emit abscisic acid aba which is a signal responding to water stress and transmitted to the leaves the leaves then adjust stomata openness accordingly so that the luxury transpiration could be reduced significantly without having much effect on the accumulation of crop photosynthetic products kang et al 1997 1998 dry and loveys 1999 kang and zhang 2004 studies have shown that apri could stimulate root oxalate secretion regulate the water and nutrient availability in the root soil micro region enhance the compensatory uptake of the root system and increase root water and nutrient absorption in the wet root zone table 5 further apri could reduce soil evaporation and deep percolation loss by reducing the wetting area of irrigation kang et al 2000a kang and cai 2002 sarker et al 2020 in practical implementation apri can be carried out by irrigating part of the root zone soil in either horizontal or vertical directions apri has been studied in the water limited regions of many countries with arid and semi arid climate including brail iran italy new zealand turkey tunis u k and the u s and is suitable for cereals fiber crops fruit trees grapes and berries legumes oil crops roots and tubers and vegetables e g maize cotton apples banana mango olives orange peaches pears blueberry grapes green beans soybeans sunflower potato tomato etc table 5 most of the results indicated that apri could reduce irrigation significantly increase wue and improve fruit quality table 5 with less irrigation apri does not lead to great yield reduction rather in some cases has a higher yield compared with full irrigation kang et al 1998 green and clothier 1999 chaves et al 2010 for example apri reduced the evapotranspiration of pears but increased the fruit number and total yield kang et al 2017 compared to full irrigation grape yield and wue were significantly increased by 13 and 30 respectively under apri du et al 2013 dry and loveys 1999 found that vegetative growth was significantly inhibited but the grape yield and size did not change significantly under apri however a few studies reported a small yield decline under apri ghrab et al 2013 our studies on maize cotton tomato pepper grapes and other crops found that apri increased total root mass root shoot ratio and stem diameter saved irrigation water by 34 4 36 8 while maintaining a similar yield as full irrigation table 5 apri has been widely applied in the minqin desert oasis of northwest china where the annual precipitation is about 110 mm kang et al 2017 using apri the total irrigation amount was only 2100 m3 ha 1 during the whole growing season of maize while the yield was in the range of 12750 13500 kg hm 2 and percentage of saved water was about 40 and water productivity could reach as high as 2 93 kg m 3 1 7 times of conventional border irrigation and 1 3 times of conventional furrow irrigation kang and cai 2002 du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 apri extends the rdi strategies from when and how much to irrigate to the combination of a spatial wetting pattern of root systems with crops high efficient water use mechanisms kang and zhang 2004 apri is a new and effective approach for saving irrigation water in arid areas du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 more studies are needed on the optimum alternating cycle irrigation amount and other related technical parameters of apri for different crops and growth periods in different hydrological years with varying soil and groundwater conditions operational guidelines on the practical application of apri should be provided for farmers 6 4 irrigation for regulating yield and quality different from conventional full irrigation or non full irrigation iryq is a new irrigation strategy intended to achieve multiple goals of saving water improving crop quality and improving irrigation efficiency fig 3 iryq was developed based on the knowledge of the effects of field water status on crops physiological growth and fruit quality as well as the relations between crop water yield and quality wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 with the improvement of people s living standards more and more attention has been paid to the quality of agricultural products especially fruits and vegetables however it is common in practice to rely on a large amount of irrigation and fertilizer to obtain a high yield which might lower crop quality and farmers income and to make things worse often accompanied by great water loss and unsustainable environment du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 to solve this problem it is essential to develop and apply an iryq strategy based on the crop water yield quality relationship due to the diversity of crop quality traits appearance flavor nutritional ingredient storage transportation processing etc and the complexity of the fruit formation process affecting quality many factors should be considered when considering the influence of water deficit on fruit quality such as water deficit intensity timing and irrigation method etc treeby et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 in terms of water deficit intensity many studies have shown that reducing irrigation by 20 could improve crop quality without a significant yield reduction treeby et al 2007 moderate water deficit could significantly improve the fruit soluble solid content sugar content organic acid and other flavor quality traits treeby et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 as well as the nutritional traits such as lycopene and vitamin c patanè and cosentino 2010 in terms of water deficit timing reducing irrigation amount by 33 3 in the mid and late stages of tomato fruit development could significantly improve the tomato flavor and nutritional quality chen et al 2013 2014 in the study of pear jujube water deficit in the fruit development stage could improve fruit flavor and nutritional quality reduce rotten fruit proportion and improve storage and transportation traits cui et al 2008 four physiological mechanisms might contribute to the effects of moderate water deficit leading to fruit quality improvement 1 water deficit reduces fruit water content thus increases the concentration of carbohydrate and other substances zhang et al 2017 2 water deficit limits plant vegetative growth and promotes the distribution of assimilates from lateral branches to fruits by regulating the source sink ratio patanè et al 2011 3 moderate water deficit increases the accumulation of starch at the early stage of fruit development thus the proportion of starch converted into soluble sugar is increased during fruit ripening zegbe et al 2004 besides vegetative growth restriction increases the light transmittance of plants which is conducive to fruit coloring and response to the synthesis and transformation of nutrients bénard et al 2009 4 water deficits can stimulate the mrna expression related to sugar metabolism as a result the activities of sugar metabolism enzymes are enhanced which promotes the accumulation and transformation of sugar deluc et al 2009 on the other hand the content of aba and ethylene are also increased which are related to the initiation and promotion of fruit ripening zaharah et al 2013 in practice a trade off between high yield and good quality has to be made in the irrigation decision process quantitatively modeling the interactive relationship between water yield quality of cash crops is the key to realize iryq wang et al 2011 iryq strategy should consider the effects of irrigation on both yield and quality and their combined effects on economic returns iryq has also been applied in joint optimization of irrigation scheduling and planting patterns for seed maize fig 4 in addition to the high yield producing more seeds with high vigor is also important for seed maize kernel number and weight that determine the seed maize yield are affected by the interactions of irrigation relative planting time and the ratio of female to male plants therefore the irrigation scheduling should be jointly optimized incorporating the planting pattern of female and male plants to have kernels as many as possible with the kernel weight within a specific range to achieve the ultimate goals of water saving good quality and high efficiency to do that a model that can accurately simulate kernel numbers and weight under different water conditions has to be constructed wang et al 2017 2018 the flowering model proposed by lizaso et al 2003 was used to simulate kernel number formation by flowering characteristics under sufficient water supply adapted from the flowering model the water flowering model can simulate the kernel number formation under different water conditions for seed maize wang et al 2017 2018 specifically the model modified the pollination silking and kernel formation module of the flowering model by incorporating the effect of water stress during the vegetative and flowering stages on the pollen shedding and silking and the effect of seed set capacity sc on the kernel formation kernel weight of maize is closely related to the source sink ratio after flowering ssr however studies have shown that kernel weight could differ by as much as 100 mg per kernel with the same ssr tanaka and maddonni 2008 to reduce the risk of seed germination failure the upper and lower limit of kernel weight ulkw a simulation model for the lower limit of kernel weight at different ssr levels was developed wang et al 2019 the joint optimization of irrigation scheduling of iryq and planting pattern for seed maize become feasible with kernel number and weight model available fig 4 a joint optimization system of irrigation scheduling and planting pattern joipp for seed maize was established based on the water flowering model and ulkw model in the water flowering model the pollen shedding and silking time under sufficient irrigation were transformed into functions of the relative planting time of male to female plants and the planting density of male and female plants into the function of plant row spacing and the ratio of male to female plants the optimization objectives were to maximize the yield and the number of kernels with kernel weight within a specific range and minimize irrigation water use the multi objectives were transformed into a single objective by summing the weighted objectives compared with the planting pattern adopted by farmers the optimized planting pattern could increase the yield by 10 and wue by 7 3 wang et al 2020 iryq is a step forward from conventional irrigation scheduling based on water balance and water yield models moving toward the development of high efficient irrigation strategies that are based on both clwr and water yield quality interactions zhou et al 2020 due to the complexity of iryq further research and improvements are needed 7 conclusions and prospect an integrated strategy for improving wue based on physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit and innovative field water regulation technologies was presented in the review this strategy involves understanding of physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit and wue improvement precise regulation of field water based on accurate monitoring and diagnosis of water status precise measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements construction of water yield quality models under water stress and integration of the physiological mechanisms with innovative field water regulation the strategy is expected to save water improve quality and increase efficiency and be the approach for achieving modern sustainable water saving agriculture in the future however mechanisms of crop drought tolerance and wue are complex involving many physiological processes signal transduction pathways and network and gene encodings such as a light reaction and carbon fixation in photosynthesis and plant hormones and their associated pathways stomata functioning etc schulz et al 2021 to improve wue requires the coordinated improvement of wue at different spatio temporal scales which asks for close cooperation among physiologists agronomists soil scientists irrigation scientists and engineers to promote the development and continuous improvement of the strategy and to put forward an integrated solution in the future further studies are needed in the following five topics 1 to identify crops drought tolerance genes to help screen out and develop new varieties capable of saving water or high efficient water use and investigate the relations between wue and various physiological processes based on bioinformatics to help understand the key processes controlling crop wue 2 to examine the relationships and relative importance of wue with soil water nutrients gases heat and crop planting structure and density root shoot ratio and rhizosphere microorganisms to help put forward a multi factor coordinated wue improvement solution 3 to develop high throughput technologies of crop responding to water deficit based on space air ground infrared thermal imaging fluorescence imaging multispectral and hyperspectral imaging and lidar to improve the accuracy of parameters inversion and to explore the feasibility of field water regulation at multiple scales and regional water resources optimal allocation based on crop phenotype data 4 to construct smart irrigation strategies based on more precise water yield quality for different types and cultivar at different growth periods under different soils climates hydrological years and agronomic management practices and 5 to build climate adaptive agronomy smart water saving crop systems according to the balance between water and land in the region incorporating the uncertainties of climate change scenarios and model parameters to develop a plan for improving wue in the future and provide integrative solutions for sustainable agricultural development in the future water shortage areas

9982,water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of plant carbon gain to water use in various spatio temporal scales is a complex indicator of physiological agronomic and engineering processes as well as management practices improving wue at different scales is an important pathway to combat the global water shortage and ensure food supply which requires both understanding the physiological

different scales and discussed the key obstacles and possible solutions in practice a water saving quality improving high efficient water use strategy was proposed and an integrative management approach making use of diverse advanced wue improving technologies was constructed both the water use strategy and integrative approach were developed based on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit crop life water requirements precision irrigation water management according to real time monitoring of crop responses to water deficit as well as crop water yield quality models the review was expected to provide a reference for researchers in the water management communities and boost sustainable development of water saving agriculture in water shortage areas keywords water use efficiency water deficit physiological mechanisms crop water yield quality model irrigation water management spatio temporal scale integrated strategy 1 introduction the imbalance between rising food demand and insufficient water supply for agriculture is a global issue lobell et al 2014 the world population is expected to continuously grow at a fast pace in the future 30 50 years united nations 2017 the continuous growth of the world population poses a great challenge to global food supply and water security lesk et al 2016 fao has warned in 2018 that global food production has to increase by 70 in 2050 to ensure food security while increasing food production requires more agricultural water use elliott et al 2014 therefore food and water security have become an important challenge for humankind condon 2020 water security is the foundation of food security as water shortage will directly lead to fluctuation of food production alcamo et al 2007 kang et al 2017 agriculture is the major water consumption sector accounting for more than 70 of total water use worldwide it is unsustainable to increase food production simply by expanding agricultural water use hence saving water in agriculture becomes a necessary part of the solution kang 2019 developing water saving agriculture and improving water use efficiency wue is necessary for ensuring global water and food security wue defined as the ratio of plant carbon gain to water use in various spatio temporal scales is a complex indicator of physiological agronomic engineering processes and management practices leakey et al 2019 clothier et al 2020 fernández et al 2020 final grain or fruit wue is coordinated by the three key processes the ratio of transpiration to total water use transpiration efficiency for carbon fixation per unit of water and the ratio of biomass converted into grain yield or harvest index condon 2020 water use efficiency is also referred to as water productivity wp in the literature when wue is expressed as the ratio of biomass yield or fruit to water supply or total evapotranspiration kijne et al 2003 molden et al 2003 2010 fereres and soriano 2007 steduto et al 2009 crop wue involves different spatial scales of molecular cell organ leaf plant population field watershed and temporal scales of instant hour day month growth season year condon 2020 wue at different spatio temporal scales might not be positively related due to different time canopy and environmental conditions involved sadras and richards 2014 for example improvement in wue at the leaf scale does not necessarily mean wue improvement at a plant or population scale similarly the largest wue at an instant or daily scale is not the largest at the growth period or year scale sadras and richards 2014 the so called decoupling or inconsistencies of wue at different scales is found more pronounced under water deficit therefore improving wue requires the optimum coupling of water and carbon processes at various spatio temporal scales and multi factor coordination dunn et al 2019 kang et al 2017 papacek et al 2019 condon 2020 maurel and nacry 2020 numerous studies have reviewed the progress and approaches of improving wue in agriculture sinclair et al 1984 howell 2001 kijne et al 2003 condon et al 2004 blum 2005 deng et al 2006 nonetheless there is still room for improvement in the extent of adopting water saving agriculture and in the developing countries where there is a big gap between actual and potential wue at different scales of individual crop and field hsiao et al 2007 kang et al 2017 changing the irrigation and fertilization ways is possible to improve yield by 30 when the other conditions are similar mueller et al 2012 factors contributing to the gap between actual and potential wue include unmatched or not closely matched high efficient irrigation technologies with agronomic practices lack of scientific and precise control of field water use and imbalance between regional cropping structure and water resources howell 2001 hsiao et al 2007 kang et al 2017 following the three factors mentioned above there are three aspects needed to be worked on to promote water saving agriculture and improve wue first improving wue has to be done from a plant or crop perspective and requires studies on exploiting the crop s physiological water saving potential to reduce water consumption and maintain yield condon et al 2004 blum 2005 fereres and soriano 2007 kang 2019 although water stress may interrupt crop normal growth the crop itself has evolved to be able to prevent water loss prioritize water supply to important organs maintain cell water content and develop surviving strategies under water stress condon et al 2004 nadal and flexas 2019 the impact of water stress on crops depends on crops drought tolerance as well as the intensity and duration of water stress blum 2005 studying the mechanisms of crops maintaining growth under mild to moderate stress and based on the results designing a strategy that can improve crop survival ability could provide solutions for improving yield and wue gupta et al 2020 it is also important to develop new cultivars that were drought tolerant and use water effectively medrano et al 2015 second new water saving quality improving and high efficient irrigation technologies are needed for improving wue at the field scale jovanovic et al 2020 these technologies are applied for the smart control of field water status according to precisely monitoring crops life water requirements clwr and crop responses to water stress and can also stimulate the compensatory effects after a certain level of water stress control redundant growth and regulate stomatal water carbon relations through root shoot signaling kang et al 2017 other techniques that can reduce soil evaporation increase infiltration and soil water storage improve light use efficiency and field wue such as planting density and cropping structure adjustment fertilization application of anti transpirant and soil additives plastic and straw mulches etc green et al 2010 vaz et al 2016 yang et al 2018 are also needed mueller et al 2012 third improving wue requires exploiting the water saving potential of irrigation systems at a regional scale hsiao et al 2007 for that regional water resources are needed to be properly allocated to match the cropping structure and from that to build a climate adaptive and water saving planting system green et al 2010 smart irrigation districts are needed for the precise allocation of water resources according to the cropping structure and crop models to reduce water loss and improve wue the objectives of this review were to propose a high efficient water use strategy and to construct an integrative approach that puts together diverse wue improving methods fig 1 the water use strategy was developed based on the physiological responses of the crop to water deficit crop life water requirements precision irrigation management according to real time monitoring crop responses to water deficit and crop water yield quality models the integrated approaches were built using the physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit as well as innovative irrigation technologies we reviewed the advances of associated research fields and discussed the main obstacles and possible solutions in adopting the strategy in practice as well as the outlook of future studies in the field specifically the topics focused on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit stress and improving water use efficiency regulating field water status precisely and improving water use efficiency based on accurate monitoring crop s responses to water deficit measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements and quantitative models of water yield quality relations the review was anticipated to provide references for researchers in the field and encourage the development of water saving agriculture in arid and water shortage areas 2 physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water deficit many studies have shown that the improvement of wue under mild or moderate water stress is the result of the combined effects of root growth sharp et al 2004 prince et al 2017 kang 2019 root shoot signaling and stomata optimum regulation kang and zhang 2004 zait et al 2019 redundant growth control and compensatory effect after water stress goodwin and boland 2002 kang and cai 2002 gucci et al 2019 fig 2 showed the physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water deficit as well as the processes related to their effects on wue adapting from the findings of previous studies zhang and davies 1989 davies et al 2002 sharp 2002 chaves et al 2003 wilkinson 2004 wilkinson and hartung 2009 papacek et al 2019 some studies reported that root development could be maintained under water deficit stress sharp 2002 wilkinson and hartung 2009 kang 2019 papacek et al 2019 maurel and nacry 2020 the mechanisms underlying root growth maintenance under water stress are osmotic adjustment cell loosening enhancement and abscisic acid aba accumulation sharp et al 2004 hormone aba plays an important role in regulating root development responding to water deficit and has been proven essential for maintaining root growth at low water potential sharp 2002 crops under water deficit need an elevated aba level relative to those with sufficient water supply to prevent excess ethylene production sharp 2002 this difference might be related to the role played by the accumulated aba in promoting anti oxidation systems to keep reactive oxygen species ros at a non destructive level during the water deficit ober and sharp 2003 primary roots of different species such as cotton and corn were shown to have similar tissue water potential and spatial pattern which indicates the two species had the same osmotic adjustment mechanism kang 2019 however comparing the metabolic reaction of corn and cotton at the same tissue water potential showed that the two species had distinct metabolic regulation mechanisms the difference in glutathione content between corn and cotton responding to water deficit reflects the difference of root exposure to ros between the two species indicating that in the cotton root system catalase cat and ascorbate peroxidase apx had an important anti oxidation function to prevent ros production and exposure while corn adopted a more diverse metabolic and enzymatic anti oxidation strategy kang 2019 studies also showed that high efficient root metabolism could improve crop tolerance to drought genard et al 2014 water deficit can improve root water conductivity and use efficiency by increasing root xylem quantity stimulating lateral root growth increasing root surface area and root shoot ratio prince et al 2017 the mechanisms of the direct effects of water stress on root growth and development and tissue hydraulics have been revealed while the signaling mechanisms controlling partial and systematic responses to water deficit as a function of wue remain largely unknown maurel and nacry 2020 when soil becomes increasingly drier more roots would produce signaling chemicals with greater intensity which enables crops to regulate above ground physiological growth and development according to soil water availability cramer et al 2009 studies on the signal s type production and transduction showed that root could synthesize and emit many types of signal chemicals when soil is under drought and these signals could be emitted in the form of electrochemical waves or chemicals themselves from cells under water stress and transduced from the place they are produced to the place they act on davies et al 2002 wilkinson and hartung 2009 aba is produced in roots under drought transduced to above ground through transpiration where leaf physiological functions e g leaf expansion rate and stomatal conductance are regulated davies et al 2002 liang et al 1997 the root can produce aba quickly after suffering water stress and its content varies several to dozens of times depending on different crops davies and zhang 1991 moreover the amount of aba produced by roots is closely related to soil water content surrounding those roots indicating aba could be one of the indices for root zone soil water content kang and zhang 2004 dodd et al 2008 these root signals can help reduce water transpiration through stomata when branches and leaves have not yet sensed water deficit which could be the first line of defense for crops combating drought the second line of defense might be the wilting of lower and senile leaves with the enduring drought schulz et al 2021 this root shoot signaling theory provided the theoretical background for regulating root zone water deficit conditions to improve wue and based on that alternate partial rootzone irrigation apri theory and technologies have been developed kang and zhang 2004 alternative wetting and drying part of the root zone could induce roots in dry soil producing aba signal and leaves ethylene emission pérez pérez et al 2020 which in turn reduce stomatal openness leaf growth rate and luxury transpiration improve wue achieving the goal of saving water without yield reduction and higher fruit quality kang et al 1997 loveys et al 1997 kang and zhang 2004 wang et al 2012 the most direct response of crops to water deficit is to partially close stomata to reduce stomatal conductance and water transpiration tambussi et al 2007 zait et al 2019 mild water deficit could enhance photosynthesis by impacting mesophyll conductance through osmotic adjustment leaf structure change and photosynthetic ability cano et al 2014 buckley et al 2017 zait et al 2019 a large ratio of mesophyll to stomatal conductance under water stress could reduce transpiration while maintaining or enhancing photosynthesis tomás et al 2014 water deficit could improve photosynthetic ability by increasing nitrogen content per unit leaf area while having little impact on stomatal conductance buckley et al 2017 studies showed that proper water stress could improve photosynthesis to achieve better water carbon balance and improve wue by enhancing carboxylation rate increasing co2 saturated maximum photosynthetic rate and reducing vascular bundle sheath cell leaking von caemmerer and furbank 2016 relative to sufficient water supply more carbon is transported to root or shoot under water stress which increases water uptake and transport ability per unit leaf area and results in a greater capacity to regulate water carbon exchange buckley et al 2017 ullah et al 2019 however severe water stress could damage leaf tissue and reduce photosynthesis buckley et al 2017 when the root zone is drying stomatal conductance reduction is faster than photosynthesis reduction and with shrinking stomatal openness the decline of photosynthesis rate is slower than transpiration rate so that wue is improved condon 2020 although redundant growth is an ecological strategy for crops adapting to the changing environment to enhance survival and reduce the risk of extinction this has become the waste and burden in a water deficit cropland dodd 2009 reasonable water supply can regulate root growth to prevent the excessive growth of root stem leaf and other components maintain the optimal growth of each component balance the root shoot ratio and improve economic yield and wue chai et al 2015 costa et al 2007 ali et al 2018 gucci et al 2019 crops can undergo certain compensatory growth after water stress was alleviated kang et al 2002a 2000b a strategic growth stage based deficit irrigation in maize about 1 2 water amount of full irrigation at the seedling stage and 2 3 water amount of full irrigation at the jointing stage improved significantly wue while maintained yield kang et al 2000b du et al 2015 water deficit could shorten the vegetative growth period and lengthen the grain filling period so that biomass could be accumulated more on kernel after flowering zhang et al 2008 reducing irrigation water by 50 at a certain period of pears did not affect yield significantly goodwin and boland 2002 because of the discrepancy between fruit trees vegetative growth branches and fruit growth rate strictly controlling irrigation frequency and amount during the fruit earlier development stage about 4 weeks after flowering and fruit slow growth period and enforcing trees undergoing certain water stress could adjust the distribution of photosynthetic products among different organs and reduce vegetative organs redundant growth re watering during fruit fast growth stage could lead to fruit quick expansion costa et al 2007 gucci et al 2019 to improve wue genotypes or cultivars of efficient water use are required by either natural mutation or gene engineering or both condon 2020 studies were carried out extensively on identifying and exploiting the target traits valuable for improving wue to facilitate breeding drought tolerance and high efficient water use cultivars dunn et al 2019 condon 2020 traditionally genotypes or cultivars were grown under non irrigated conditions in mediterranean environments and selected based on their adaptation to water deficit conditions galmés et al 2011 patanè et al 2016 guida et al 2017 the selection of landraces other than those of drought tolerant genotypes or cultivars represents an interesting genetic source in breeding and or biotechnological improvements for drought tolerance and high wue galmés et al 2011 2013 siracusa et al 2012 medrano et al 2015 3 regulating field water status precisely and improving water use efficiency based on accurate monitoring of crop water status accurately monitoring crop responses to water deficit is the key element for precisely regulating field water status and improving yield and wue clothier et al 2020 fernández et al 2020 many technologies have been developed to monitor crop responses to water deficit through new non contact high throughput phenotyping techniques instead of measuring soil water content watt et al 2020 to improve wue and exert a designed level of water stress accurately monitoring crop water status and precisely regulating field water status are both required so that crop water could be maintained in the proper range and the goals of water saving good quality and high efficiency could be achieved kang et al 1994 hsiao et al 2007 table 1 showed the available precise regulation techniques of field water status based on accurate monitoring and diagnosis of crop response to water deficit along with the measuring indicators these techniques can be classified into three types the first type is based on the direct measurement of water deficit status visible wilting tissue water content leaf water potential via pressure chamber psychrometer pressure probe etc or xylem cavitation embolism were measured as indicators of crop water status kang et al 1994 jones 2004 liu et al 2020 the drawbacks of these methods when used in irrigation scheduling are that they cannot tell how much to irrigate and sometimes the threshold values of some indices to trigger irrigation need to be recalibrated given that the short time fluctuation of the index might be greater than the treatment difference jones 2004 for example irrigation water use was reduced by 10 without yield reduction when irrigation was triggered by leaf water potential reaching 0 7 mpa relative to those cases with the threshold values at 0 4 and 0 5 mpa for a manually operated variable rate lateral irrigated cotton field in the south eastern u s meeks et al 2020 therefore leaf water potential between 0 5 mpa to 0 7 mpa could be used as a threshold value to trigger irrigation to achieve a high yield and larger wue for cotton meeks et al 2020 the second type is based on measuring indices indicating crop response to water deficit e g leaf stomatal conductance porometer leaf or canopy temperature stem or fruit diameter sap flow etc ortuño et al 2008 liu et al 2011 the maximum daily variation of stem diameter mds is an important parameter of stem diameter indicating the change of crop cell water uptake water loss cycle and thermal expansion and contraction daudet et al 2004 signal strength dividing mds or sf under water deficit by those under sufficient water simds and sisf was used for water deficit diagnosis ortuño et al 2010 simds was used to diagnose the water deficit of apricots goldhamer and fereres 2004 puerto et al 2013 other studies indicated that relative to sisf simds was more sensitive to water change of pears and irrigation scheduling based on simds was more precise conejero et al 2007a 2007b however opposite results have been reported that both simds and sisf were not suitable for water status diagnosis for olive trees under water deficit conditions fernández et al 2011 girón et al 2016 therefore this type of method is mostly limited in research studies and has not been adopted widely in practice the third type is based on non contact measuring indices including handhold or portable crop phenotype measurements handhold chlorophyll fluorometer handhold hyper spectrometer smart handhold hyperspectral imager portable chlorophyll fluorescence imager etc hou et al 2019 matese et al 2018 greenhouse compact and large conveyor belt imager and analysis platform chlorophyll fluorescence imaging spectral imaging of rgb hyperspectral imaging and infrared thermal imaging etc drone and remote sensing phenotype analysis platform drone equipped with rgb imaging hyperspectral imaging infrared thermal imaging multispectral imaging light detection and ranging lidar vanegas et al 2018 and aerial remote sensing french et al 2020 these methods are non destructive take crop environment into account and sometimes are very sensitive for these methods the threshold values to trigger irrigation need to be calibrated also instruments are expensive and often need to be operated by professionally trained personals therefore this type of method is still in the research and development phase and is expected to gain wide application in the future leaf chlorophyll content can represent well the intensity of water deficit and be measured directly with chlorophyll fluorometer hou et al 2019 and indirectly through the relations between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and chlorophyll content established using remote sensing data chlorophyll content was estimated with ndvi obtained by a multispectral camera mao et al 2018 however information included in the ndvi alone is quite limited and chlorophyll sensitive wavelength differs between different growth periods recently many scientists have carried out studies on estimating chlorophyll content with multi ndvi and also on chlorophyll content of different growth periods through inversion of remote sensing data xu et al 2019 crop water stress index cwsi obtained through canopy temperature reflects canopy water status and could be used to guide field water management practices condon 2020 a drone equipped with an infrared thermal imager provided a new high efficient and reliable method for fast measuring large area canopy temperature matese et al 2018 leaf area index and biomass were estimated through statistical models established with a series of ndvis of multispectral and hyperspectral cameras with ground truth data or through machine learning aasen et al 2015 li et al 2018 the lidar could actively collect plant cloud data to get morphological and structure information harkel et al 2019 li et al 2020 however given that crops are often densely planted and short lidar alone is not good enough for extract phenotype information and assimilation with other data sources is needed to increase the estimation accuracy nora et al 2015 combing the accurate monitoring of crop responses to water deficit with precise control of field water status would play an important role in improving wue 4 measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements crop life water requirements clwr is an essential component for implementing high efficient water use and precise water management practices clwr is defined as the sum of plant transpiration soil evaporation and water incorporated into plant tissues during their lifetime period when the plant has always been disease free well fertilized under optimum soil water conditions and achieving full production in the large area under given climatic condition kang et al 1994 allen et al 1998 since the amount of water incorporated into the plant tissues is relatively small accounting for less than 1 of clwr clwr is generally approximated as the sum of the first two components referred to as evapotranspiration et allen et al 1998 plant transpiration is affected by root zone water supply xylem hydraulic transport leaf stomatal regulation and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit berry et al 2010 jones 2014 tardieu et al 2015 soil evaporation a process in which the water phase changes from a liquid to a vapor state on the soil surface and diffuses to the atmosphere is controlled by meteorological factors crop canopy coverage and soil surface moisture shuttleworth 2007 physically water flows from the soil into the atmosphere via the plant commonly known as the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac specifically water molecules are absorbed into the plant root system from the soil transported through the stem xylem enters the leaf and then diffuses from the leaf stomata to the atmospheric boundary layer kang et al 1994 monteith 1995 caldeira et al 2014 the spac system is an integrated dynamic interactive and continuous system clwr depends on the climate crop characteristics management practices and soil environments allen et al 1998 meteorological variables such as solar radiation atmospheric temperature humidity and wind speed exert control on clwr by affecting evaporation demand water requirement varies for different crop types cultivars and growth periods when the growing conditions are similar the water requirement is determined by stomata resistance crop height roughness reflectivity canopy coverage and root conditions shuttleworth 2007 management practices and growing conditions affect clwr by changing the local microclimate and crop growth for example agronomic practices and irrigation methods affected clwr by altering local microclimate crop growth and development or the surface soil and leaves humidity jones 2014 planting windbreak forests in windy and arid areas with high temperatures could reduce clwr in the encircled field by decreasing wind speed schymanski and or 2016 different plant densities affected clwr through changing canopy coverage and plant height jiang et al 2014 soil evaporation and evapotranspiration were reduced after using water saving irrigation methods drip and micro sprinkler irrigation due to partial soil surface wetting wang et al 2020b and plastic or straw mulches besides the clwr is influenced by environmental conditions such as soil textures organic matter contents and groundwater supply kang et al 2001 jones 2014 there are two types of classical methods for determining clwr direct measurement and indirect methods i e model estimation table 2 direct measurement methods include soil water balance method lysimeter bowen ratio energy balance eddy covariance plant physiology methods sap flow and porometer inversion based on remote sensing etc shuttleworth 2007 zhang et al 2007 ding et al 2010 jones 2014 pereira et al 2020 model estimation method includes crop coefficient method big leaf penman monteith dual source shuttleworth wallace multilayer model etc allen et al 1998 shuttleworth 2007 zhang et al 2008 2009 monteith and unsworth 2013 ding et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 2018 jiang et al 2019 pereira et al 2020 each method has its advantages and disadvantages and is suitable for different conditions table 2 among them the lysimeter method and crop coefficient method are the most widely used direct measurement and model estimation methods respectively allen et al 1998 shuttleworth 2007 pereira et al 2020 the crop coefficient approach estimates clwr by multiplying crop coefficients for a specific crop under different conditions with the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 smart water management based on clwr is an important approach for improving wue irrigation scheduling determined based on clwr reduced irrigation water by as much as 42 compared with conventional empirical irrigation scheduling davis and dukes 2010 precise et estimation helps to implement effective irrigation management while effective irrigation management in turn can save irrigation water reduce the risks of groundwater loss and degradation save energy and maintain crop yield irrigation scheduling based on et reduced irrigation by 21 34 while maintaining a similar yield in a study conducted on lettuce and cauliflower at salinas experimental station ca u s johnson et al 2016 studies on both woody plants and field crops in arid areas of the south eastern part of spain have also shown that et based irrigation scheduling improved wue significantly garcía et al 2020 irrigation scheduling based on et was found to control soil water status prevent water stress save irrigation water use and improve wue in an olive orchard in an arid area argentina capraro et al 2018 other researchers have tried to use meteorological data to directly estimate surface resistance and clwr salvucci and gentine 2013 rigden and salvucci 2015 variables related to crop physiological processes and characteristics have been included in estimating clwr such as canopy radiation use efficiency rue wue and photosynthetic carbon fixation stoy et al 2019 sinclair and ghanem 2020 although there have been some encouraging results some issues regarding the accurate determination of the clwrs remain to be addressed 1 to develop methods that can accurately partition between soil evaporation and plant transpiration plant transpiration is directly related to crop photosynthetic production while soil evaporation is generally considered to be lost and ineffective for plant production pieruschka et al 2010 however the two components are difficult to differentiate allen et al 1998 kool et al 2014 therefore studies on the methods that are based on physical and physiological mechanisms and able to partition the two components in a more precise way are urgently needed 2 to develop clwr estimation methods based on crop physiological mechanisms and water consumption processes current methods are essentially empirical and indirect given that they do not take full account of crop water physiological processes stoy et al 2019 sinclair and ghanem 2020 physiological methods that can take advantage of the latest advances in crop physiology and stomatal regulation theory are needed 3 to develop clwr diagnosis methods and associated precision management practices based on real time monitoring crop water or stomatal opening status real time monitoring crop water content or stomatal opening becomes feasible with the advances of modern technologies for example remote sensing technology or ground infrared thermometer can be used to monitor canopy temperature or albedo and then obtain crop moisture and stomatal opening jones 2014 matese et al 2018 stoy et al 2019 however precise clwr diagnosis methods as well as precise water management practices based on real time data are still needed 5 quantitative models of crop water yield quality and their applications crop water yield models have been the focus of many studies and gained wide application in practice allen et al 1998 steduto et al 2009 there are two types of crop water yield models depending on the length of growth period considered in the model steduto et al 2009 the first type of model is to describe the relations between crop yield and the total water consumption or relative water consumption during the whole growing period having either linear or parabolic forms the second type of model is to related crop yield to water consumption at different growth stages these models are often used to allocate limited water supply for optimum irrigation timing and amount of each irrigation attempting to maximize the crop yield or total production at a given area kang and cai 2002 hsiao et al 2007 although there have been extensive studies on water yield models since the 1960 s many critical issues remain unsolved steduto et al 2009 from the late 1960s crop models capable of simulating crop growth dynamics have been established based on knowledge in crop physiology ecology and micrometeorology and have been used to optimize irrigation and fertilization practices through scenario analysis todorovic et al 2009 malik et al 2019 most crop models do not address crop quality simulation also there are still few studies on crop water quality models kang and cai 2002 chen et al 2014 as consumers pay more and more attention to crop quality high efficient water use decisions require a trade off between high yield and good quality chen et al 2021 preliminary development of statistical and process based water yield quality models has been explored based on many experiments and numerical studies chen et al 2014 génard et al 2014 adapted from crop water yield models crop water quality empirical statistical models have been developed to simulate the relationship between tomato quality and water deficit in different growth stages chen et al 2014 models based on plant physiological processes that could quantitatively describe the formation of crop quality have been developed fishman and génard 1998 génard et al 2014 for example the sugar model could simulate the changes in the sugar composition and content during fruit growth following the principle of fruit carbon balance fishman and génard 1998 fruit soluble sugar content is the result of a series of physiological and biochemical processes génard et al 2014 first the photosynthetic product mainly sucrose is transported from the leaves through the phloem and unloaded into the fruit then biochemical metabolism is carried out through the action of various enzymes in the fruit cell symplast apoplast and vacuole some of the metabolism products are used to synthesize cell wall materials organic acids proteins and temporary storage materials such as starch while some of them flow out of the fruit in the form of co2 through respiration and the rest of the products remain in fruit as soluble sugars mainly glucose and fructose meanwhile fruit water content has an important influence on soluble sugar content through dilution génard et al 2014 therefore three main underlying processes affect fruit soluble sugar content assimilation supply a metabolic transformation of sugars and dilution by fruit water content prudent et al 2011 water stress alters the input of fruit assimilate the transformation of sugar kobashi et al 2000 and fruit water balance keller et al 2006 thereby affecting the soluble sugar content conde et al 2007 although many studies have reported that water deficit affects the fruit soluble sugar content mitchell et al 1991 there are still different explanations for the mechanisms behind it some research reported that water deficit influenced the sugar metabolism process and increased the total sugar content in fruit veit köhler et al 1999 while others believed that water deficit only reduced the water content in fruit thus affecting the sugar concentration by dilution dehydration chen et al 2020 ehret and ho 1986 the process based dynamic model combining the effects of plant growth environment factors and agronomic management with fruit sugar metabolism processes could provide a valuable method to quantitatively describe the response of fruit soluble sugar content to external environmental and management practices génard et al 2007 chen et al 2020 following the sugar metabolisms and feedback loops of tomato fruits the tom sugar model was developed chen et al 2021 adapted from the sugar model génard et al 2007 further the tom sugar wc model was established according to the regulation of fruit water content on sugar metabolism to quantify the effect of fruit water content on transformation rates such as soluble sugar into other compounds or starch with the model the simulation accuracy of tomato sugar content has been improved especially under water deficit conditions chen et al 2020 also the sugar model has been coupled with the fruit growth model to simulate fruit growth and quality under different irrigation conditions chen et al 2021 one of the drawbacks of the process based crop water quality models is that the parameters in the model are complicated and difficult to obtain further studies are needed to incorporate the model into crop water saving and quality improving high efficient water use decision making systems 6 an integrated strategy of improving water use efficiency based on physiological mechanisms of crop response to water deficit and innovating irrigation methods implementing innovative irrigation technologies developed based on the understanding of physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit could greatly improve wue kang et al 2000a 2017 blanco et al 2019 gucci et al 2019 sarker et al 2020 ortega farisa et al 2020 owing to close cooperation between crop physiologists irrigation scientists and irrigation engineers a series of new irrigation strategies and technologies based on physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit has been developed advancing from conventional irrigation scheduling based on soil water balance or et ertek et al 2006 hunsaker et al 2012 the newly developed strategies include non full irrigation nfi regulated deficit irrigation rdi controlled alternate partial rootzone irrigation apri and irrigation for coordinated regulating yield and quality iryq etc the advantages and disadvantages of these irrigation strategies and the applicable conditions were summarized in table 3 these water saving strategies could be implemented by surface furrow sprinkler and micro irrigation methods e g drip subsurface drip sprinkler water gun etc jovanovic et al 2020 6 1 non full irrigation recognizing that crop response and sensitivity to water deficit differ between different growth stages researchers proposed nfi when there is not enough water for full irrigation trout and dejonge 2017 under nfi the applied irrigation water does not meet clwr during the whole growing period nfi is not designed to maximize the yield as the full irrigation rather allow a certain degree of yield reduction nfi is a strategy that optimizes the allocation of limited water resources between different crops in a region and between different growth periods of a crop kang and cai 2002 to minimize yield loss and maximize return the limited amount of water under nfi is applied preferentially to the growth stages that are the most sensitive to water stress and have the greatest impact on the final yield while allowing crops during the other stages to suffer a certain degree of water stress essentially nfi is to solve the problem of how to allocate limited water optimally into different growth stages and the principle that nfi relies on is the water yield models mentioned above nfi has been extensively studied and applied in water shortage areas of china such as in shaanxi shanxi gansu hebei inner mongolia ningxia xinjiang shandong henan and heilongjiang for crops of wheat maize cotton and rice since the 1980s with remarkable water saving achievements kang and cai 2002 du et al 2015 jia et al 2018 future research and application of nfi need to be focused on the development of a network based nfi design software or decision support system for a specific crop or an irrigated area which directly serves irrigation managers and farmers further more efforts need to be done to provide suitable advanced surface irrigation methods and supporting equipment for nfi and strengthen farmers training on this technology to better promote the application of nfi du et al 2015 6 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi was developed based on the knowledge that crops physiological and biochemical processes may be affected by genes or growth hormones and the distribution of their photosynthetic products in different tissues or organs could be determined by water status during each growth period fereres and soriano 2007 in rdi crops are subjected to a certain level of water stress on purpose during some designated growth stages i e crops undergo some sort of water deficit training kang and cai 2002 through regulating the water status of different growth stages rdi can keep or increase the yield while hindering the vegetative growth and total biomass output which in turn could lead to greater planting density and higher yield less pruning work for crops like cotton and fruit trees and better fruit quality goodwin and boland 2002 kang et al 2017 this technology was first proposed and named rdi by the tatura centre of the australian institute of sustainable irrigated agriculture in the mid 1970s the mechanism for rdi to save water and increase yield is to control crop redundant vegetative growth and stimulate compensatory effect after applying water stress during some designated growth period kang and cai 2002 studies on rdi have been carried out extensively in the water limited regions of many countries with arid and semi arid climate such as australia chile china iran italy portugal spain turkey etc and included cereals fruit trees grapes and berries oil crops and vegetables e g maize wheat cherry hazelnut olives orange peaches pear jujubes blueberry grapes sunflower carrots cherry tomato tomato etc table 4 most of the studies reported that rdi could achieve the goal of high yield and good quality with less water use karam et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 kuscu et al 2014 blanco et al 2019 gucci et al 2019 garcia tejero et al 2010 ortega farisa et al 2020 a recent study has shown that rdi slightly reduced the 100 berry weight of grapes while increased fruit soluble solid content juice ph sugar content and total anthocyanin content and deceased total acid content before fruit ripening yang et al 2020 transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis screened out many differentially expressed genes deg and significantly changed metabolites scm in the rdi treatment group rdi treatment with 30 et could increase the expression level of seven genes related to the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway as well as the content of some metabolites yang et al 2020 future studies should advance the understanding of how crops would respond to various water deficit levels at different growth stages specifically how dynamics of water loss photosynthesis assimilate distribution and conversion efficiency between assimilating and economic yield would change what is the optimum allocation strategy of crop population photosynthate and what extent the effects of re watering on crop growth and yield are chai et al 2015 du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 for practical application of rdi optimal time and intensity i e optimal irrigation scheduling should be developed for fruit trees vegetables and field crops as well as precision irrigation technologies and agricultural management practices for ensuring successful application of rdi rdi should be integrated into water saving strategy techniques of micro irrigation to facilitate the precision and smart irrigation adopted for farmers jovanovic et al 2020 6 3 alternate partial rootzone irrigation apri is an innovative irrigation technology that combines physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit and an advanced approach for controlling water distribution at fields kang et al 1997 1998 dry and loveys 1999 the technology was developed based on root shoot signaling and leaf stomatal water carbon coordinated processes kang and zhang 2004 the procedure of apri is that soil in the root zone should be separated into parts in the horizontal or vertical direction and they should be kept alternately dry and wet during the growth period to make the roots in different zones undergo a certain degree of water deficit priming at different times roots in the dry soil would emit abscisic acid aba which is a signal responding to water stress and transmitted to the leaves the leaves then adjust stomata openness accordingly so that the luxury transpiration could be reduced significantly without having much effect on the accumulation of crop photosynthetic products kang et al 1997 1998 dry and loveys 1999 kang and zhang 2004 studies have shown that apri could stimulate root oxalate secretion regulate the water and nutrient availability in the root soil micro region enhance the compensatory uptake of the root system and increase root water and nutrient absorption in the wet root zone table 5 further apri could reduce soil evaporation and deep percolation loss by reducing the wetting area of irrigation kang et al 2000a kang and cai 2002 sarker et al 2020 in practical implementation apri can be carried out by irrigating part of the root zone soil in either horizontal or vertical directions apri has been studied in the water limited regions of many countries with arid and semi arid climate including brail iran italy new zealand turkey tunis u k and the u s and is suitable for cereals fiber crops fruit trees grapes and berries legumes oil crops roots and tubers and vegetables e g maize cotton apples banana mango olives orange peaches pears blueberry grapes green beans soybeans sunflower potato tomato etc table 5 most of the results indicated that apri could reduce irrigation significantly increase wue and improve fruit quality table 5 with less irrigation apri does not lead to great yield reduction rather in some cases has a higher yield compared with full irrigation kang et al 1998 green and clothier 1999 chaves et al 2010 for example apri reduced the evapotranspiration of pears but increased the fruit number and total yield kang et al 2017 compared to full irrigation grape yield and wue were significantly increased by 13 and 30 respectively under apri du et al 2013 dry and loveys 1999 found that vegetative growth was significantly inhibited but the grape yield and size did not change significantly under apri however a few studies reported a small yield decline under apri ghrab et al 2013 our studies on maize cotton tomato pepper grapes and other crops found that apri increased total root mass root shoot ratio and stem diameter saved irrigation water by 34 4 36 8 while maintaining a similar yield as full irrigation table 5 apri has been widely applied in the minqin desert oasis of northwest china where the annual precipitation is about 110 mm kang et al 2017 using apri the total irrigation amount was only 2100 m3 ha 1 during the whole growing season of maize while the yield was in the range of 12750 13500 kg hm 2 and percentage of saved water was about 40 and water productivity could reach as high as 2 93 kg m 3 1 7 times of conventional border irrigation and 1 3 times of conventional furrow irrigation kang and cai 2002 du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 apri extends the rdi strategies from when and how much to irrigate to the combination of a spatial wetting pattern of root systems with crops high efficient water use mechanisms kang and zhang 2004 apri is a new and effective approach for saving irrigation water in arid areas du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 more studies are needed on the optimum alternating cycle irrigation amount and other related technical parameters of apri for different crops and growth periods in different hydrological years with varying soil and groundwater conditions operational guidelines on the practical application of apri should be provided for farmers 6 4 irrigation for regulating yield and quality different from conventional full irrigation or non full irrigation iryq is a new irrigation strategy intended to achieve multiple goals of saving water improving crop quality and improving irrigation efficiency fig 3 iryq was developed based on the knowledge of the effects of field water status on crops physiological growth and fruit quality as well as the relations between crop water yield and quality wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 with the improvement of people s living standards more and more attention has been paid to the quality of agricultural products especially fruits and vegetables however it is common in practice to rely on a large amount of irrigation and fertilizer to obtain a high yield which might lower crop quality and farmers income and to make things worse often accompanied by great water loss and unsustainable environment du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 to solve this problem it is essential to develop and apply an iryq strategy based on the crop water yield quality relationship due to the diversity of crop quality traits appearance flavor nutritional ingredient storage transportation processing etc and the complexity of the fruit formation process affecting quality many factors should be considered when considering the influence of water deficit on fruit quality such as water deficit intensity timing and irrigation method etc treeby et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 in terms of water deficit intensity many studies have shown that reducing irrigation by 20 could improve crop quality without a significant yield reduction treeby et al 2007 moderate water deficit could significantly improve the fruit soluble solid content sugar content organic acid and other flavor quality traits treeby et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 as well as the nutritional traits such as lycopene and vitamin c patanè and cosentino 2010 in terms of water deficit timing reducing irrigation amount by 33 3 in the mid and late stages of tomato fruit development could significantly improve the tomato flavor and nutritional quality chen et al 2013 2014 in the study of pear jujube water deficit in the fruit development stage could improve fruit flavor and nutritional quality reduce rotten fruit proportion and improve storage and transportation traits cui et al 2008 four physiological mechanisms might contribute to the effects of moderate water deficit leading to fruit quality improvement 1 water deficit reduces fruit water content thus increases the concentration of carbohydrate and other substances zhang et al 2017 2 water deficit limits plant vegetative growth and promotes the distribution of assimilates from lateral branches to fruits by regulating the source sink ratio patanè et al 2011 3 moderate water deficit increases the accumulation of starch at the early stage of fruit development thus the proportion of starch converted into soluble sugar is increased during fruit ripening zegbe et al 2004 besides vegetative growth restriction increases the light transmittance of plants which is conducive to fruit coloring and response to the synthesis and transformation of nutrients bénard et al 2009 4 water deficits can stimulate the mrna expression related to sugar metabolism as a result the activities of sugar metabolism enzymes are enhanced which promotes the accumulation and transformation of sugar deluc et al 2009 on the other hand the content of aba and ethylene are also increased which are related to the initiation and promotion of fruit ripening zaharah et al 2013 in practice a trade off between high yield and good quality has to be made in the irrigation decision process quantitatively modeling the interactive relationship between water yield quality of cash crops is the key to realize iryq wang et al 2011 iryq strategy should consider the effects of irrigation on both yield and quality and their combined effects on economic returns iryq has also been applied in joint optimization of irrigation scheduling and planting patterns for seed maize fig 4 in addition to the high yield producing more seeds with high vigor is also important for seed maize kernel number and weight that determine the seed maize yield are affected by the interactions of irrigation relative planting time and the ratio of female to male plants therefore the irrigation scheduling should be jointly optimized incorporating the planting pattern of female and male plants to have kernels as many as possible with the kernel weight within a specific range to achieve the ultimate goals of water saving good quality and high efficiency to do that a model that can accurately simulate kernel numbers and weight under different water conditions has to be constructed wang et al 2017 2018 the flowering model proposed by lizaso et al 2003 was used to simulate kernel number formation by flowering characteristics under sufficient water supply adapted from the flowering model the water flowering model can simulate the kernel number formation under different water conditions for seed maize wang et al 2017 2018 specifically the model modified the pollination silking and kernel formation module of the flowering model by incorporating the effect of water stress during the vegetative and flowering stages on the pollen shedding and silking and the effect of seed set capacity sc on the kernel formation kernel weight of maize is closely related to the source sink ratio after flowering ssr however studies have shown that kernel weight could differ by as much as 100 mg per kernel with the same ssr tanaka and maddonni 2008 to reduce the risk of seed germination failure the upper and lower limit of kernel weight ulkw a simulation model for the lower limit of kernel weight at different ssr levels was developed wang et al 2019 the joint optimization of irrigation scheduling of iryq and planting pattern for seed maize become feasible with kernel number and weight model available fig 4 a joint optimization system of irrigation scheduling and planting pattern joipp for seed maize was established based on the water flowering model and ulkw model in the water flowering model the pollen shedding and silking time under sufficient irrigation were transformed into functions of the relative planting time of male to female plants and the planting density of male and female plants into the function of plant row spacing and the ratio of male to female plants the optimization objectives were to maximize the yield and the number of kernels with kernel weight within a specific range and minimize irrigation water use the multi objectives were transformed into a single objective by summing the weighted objectives compared with the planting pattern adopted by farmers the optimized planting pattern could increase the yield by 10 and wue by 7 3 wang et al 2020 iryq is a step forward from conventional irrigation scheduling based on water balance and water yield models moving toward the development of high efficient irrigation strategies that are based on both clwr and water yield quality interactions zhou et al 2020 due to the complexity of iryq further research and improvements are needed 7 conclusions and prospect an integrated strategy for improving wue based on physiological mechanisms of crops responding to water deficit and innovative field water regulation technologies was presented in the review this strategy involves understanding of physiological mechanisms of crop responding to water deficit and wue improvement precise regulation of field water based on accurate monitoring and diagnosis of water status precise measurement and estimation of crop life water requirements construction of water yield quality models under water stress and integration of the physiological mechanisms with innovative field water regulation the strategy is expected to save water improve quality and increase efficiency and be the approach for achieving modern sustainable water saving agriculture in the future however mechanisms of crop drought tolerance and wue are complex involving many physiological processes signal transduction pathways and network and gene encodings such as a light reaction and carbon fixation in photosynthesis and plant hormones and their associated pathways stomata functioning etc schulz et al 2021 to improve wue requires the coordinated improvement of wue at different spatio temporal scales which asks for close cooperation among physiologists agronomists soil scientists irrigation scientists and engineers to promote the development and continuous improvement of the strategy and to put forward an integrated solution in the future further studies are needed in the following five topics 1 to identify crops drought tolerance genes to help screen out and develop new varieties capable of saving water or high efficient water use and investigate the relations between wue and various physiological processes based on bioinformatics to help understand the key processes controlling crop wue 2 to examine the relationships and relative importance of wue with soil water nutrients gases heat and crop planting structure and density root shoot ratio and rhizosphere microorganisms to help put forward a multi factor coordinated wue improvement solution 3 to develop high throughput technologies of crop responding to water deficit based on space air ground infrared thermal imaging fluorescence imaging multispectral and hyperspectral imaging and lidar to improve the accuracy of parameters inversion and to explore the feasibility of field water regulation at multiple scales and regional water resources optimal allocation based on crop phenotype data 4 to construct smart irrigation strategies based on more precise water yield quality for different types and cultivar at different growth periods under different soils climates hydrological years and agronomic management practices and 5 to build climate adaptive agronomy smart water saving crop systems according to the balance between water and land in the region incorporating the uncertainties of climate change scenarios and model parameters to develop a plan for improving wue in the future and provide integrative solutions for sustainable agricultural development in the future water shortage areas

9983,the water footprint wf of crop production indicates the water consumption for crop growth in a specific area over a certain time enabling comprehensive water use efficiency assessments to be achieved for different types of water in an irrigation district daily and monthly blue irrigation water and green rainfall water resources are unevenly distributed in monsoon climate areas however the intra annual evolution of the wf of crop production for a monsoon irrigation district is lacking in the current study maize and wheat production in the baojixia irrigation district bid of shaanxi in china selected as the case study for the period 2008 2017 where the wf of crop production was analyzed based on a regional distributed hydrological model and the associated meteorological driving factors on daily monthly and yearly scales were identified results reveal that the method of wf of crop production established in the study can be applied to hydrological simulation of irrigated areas without drainage system the blue wfs of maize and wheat production accounted for 34 and 36 of the irrigation water supplies respectively on a yearly scale precipitation had the greatest impact on the green and blue wfs of maize while sunshine hours and temperature had the greatest impact on those of wheat respectively on daily and monthly scales different meteorological factors played key roles in the wf of crop production in different typical years the time scale effect existed in the impact of meteorological driving factors on the wf of crop production reaching its maximum on a monthly scale both water shortages and water waste coexist in bid the irrigated area should rationally allocate blue water and effectively utilize green water resource to improve crop yield meanwhile the time scale effect in the wf assessment of crop production and driving factors cannot be neglected the irrigation strategy should be adjusted to cope with the impact of meteorological conditions according to the results and actual situation graphical abstract ga1 keywords time scale effect irrigation district distributed hydrological model wheat maize 1 introduction irrigation accounts for 70 of the total water withdrawal globally fao 2011 grafton et al 2018 irrigation districts are the center of food production and agricultural water use in many regions with reliable water sources and a complete irrigation system for centralized irrigation and management wen et al 2020 irrigated districts are semi artificial ecosystems that are greatly affected by human activities with complex hydrological process of farmland in recent decades the production of irrigated areas has greatly improved global agricultural productivity and yield although irrigated agriculture only accounts for 17 of the global arable land it produces 42 of cereal yields fao 2011 thus irrigation districts have already played an irreplaceable role in ensuring food security for society to promote efficient agricultural production it is necessary to ensure water security and to realize efficient water use in irrigated areas cao et al 2020a the accurate quantification of water consumption for crop production in irrigated areas is the basis for determining crop water consumption evaluating water use efficiency and for controlling crop water consumption in order to achieve the efficient water use and agricultural production the water footprint wf of crop production refers to the appropriation of water resources for growing crops in a specific area over a certain time the crop wf consists of green wf the effective precipitation consumed during crop growth blue wf the irrigation water consumed in crop production and grey wf the amount of fresh water required to assimilate the pollution caused by the crop growth to meet local water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 it is useful to understand the water consumption status at different spatial and temporal scales through wf assessment and analysis karandish and šimůnek 2019 as it enables the clarification of different types of water resources consumption the measurement of water efficiency reasonable actions to be taken to reduce wf and the control of water consumption the wf of crop production has become a dynamic concept of water resources management in the agricultural sector bazrafshan et al 2020 which provides a new decision making basis for the rational utilization of agricultural water use li et al 2020 currently most of the methods account for the wf of crop production which can distinguish specific crops are based on the wf accounting framework developed by the water footprint network hoekstra et al 2011 through crop water productivity models such as aquacrop e g chukalla et al 2015 karandish et al 2018 wang et al 2019 cropwat e g aldaya et al 2010 novoa et al 2019 su et al 2015 or dssat e g shrestha et al 2017 these models account for the wf over multiple spatial scales including the global e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 pfister and bayer 2014 national e g bulsink et al 2010 govere et al 2020 cao et al 2020b wang et al 2019 basin e g zhuo et al 2016 and irrigation area scales e g muratoglu 2019 the above mentioned models are based on the soil water balances vertically at site bases therefore they fail to reflect any regional distributed hydrological effects caused by the complexity of regional underlying surface and environmental changes therefore scholars have begun to try to solve this problem by using distributed hydrological models in recent years luan et al 2018 xie et al 2020 such distributed hydrological models have been widely used to simulate the evapotranspiration et of crops as the hydrological effect is thoroughly investigated by partitioning the entire study area to different computing units according to the underlying surfaces becker et al 2019 immerzeel and droogers 2008 liu et al 2015 zou et al 2017 luan et al 2018 quantified the multi year average wf of crop production in the hetao irrigation district hid based on the distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat taking the water losses of canal delivery into account by simplifying the delivery canals and using the kriging spatial interposition method the hid has a complete irrigation system with drainage ditches which can discharge excess water effectively regulate the water condition in farmland and control the underground water level however most other irrigation districts on the loess plateau e g the baojixia irrigation district bid and the jinghuiqu irrigation district do not have drainage canals because of the deep soil layer and deep underground water level meaning the excess water naturally percolates through the soil for this type of irrigated area research on quantifying the wf of crop production by applying the hydrological model is lacking meanwhile in traditional irrigation schedule and allocation analysis daily scale is the foundation however in the field of wf assessment most studies used the estimated total et and effective precipitation at monthly scale to generate blue and green wf at annual scales eg kongboon and sampattagul 2012 sun et al 2013 ma et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2020 although recently there have been studies accounted the crop wf based on daily soil water balances eg wang et al 2019 xie et al 2020 li et al 2021 the shown results are generally limited to annual scales apparently a comprehensive analysis of the variability of the wf of irrigated crop production and the associated meteorological drivers on a daily and monthly scale is lacking according to the study by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 there are significant differences in monthly blue water resources in many regions for instance in the western part of the united states southern europe and north china there are many areas experiencing moderate to severe water scarcity in the spring summer period moreover rosa et al 2020 found that 68 of the global irrigated croplands face blue water scarcity for 1 month a year and 37 experience it for 5 months of the year therefore studies on the evolution of the wf of crop production on multiple temporal scales daily monthly and yearly are crucial for the efficient use of green water resources and rational allocation of blue water resources in irrigated areas in the monsoon climate zone in order to achieve efficient production this study aims to fill the above research gaps through the case study of summer maize and winter wheat production in the bid of shaanxi province in china over 2008 2017 through the set up of a swat model based on the hydrological cycle coupled with the soil water balance model to obtain the green and blue wfs of the crops then combined with the traditional quantification method of water delivery losses the wfs of crops in bid were completely considered next the variability in the annual wfs of crops during the study period was analyzed and three typical years dry normal and wet were selected to analyze the wfs of crops on daily monthly and spatial scales path analysis wright 1921 was used to determine the impact of meteorological factors on the wfs of crops at different temporal scales compared with existing studies the characteristics of this study were mainly reflected in the following aspects first the applicability of the swat model to quantify the wf of crop production in irrigated districts without drainage ditches was further explored second the variability of the wfs of crops on daily monthly scales as well as spatial scales was investigated in typical years lastly the impact of meteorological factors on the wfs of crops at different temporal scales was quantified and the time scale effect noted in the impact was also preliminarily explored thus the temporal and spatial variabilities of the wfs of irrigated crops at different temporal scales can be further understood and the inter and intra annual water consumption of irrigated areas can be quantified precisely then the water efficiency can be clarified and the irrigation schedule and management can be optimized to achieve accurate water allocation and efficient water use 2 methods and data 2 1 study area the bid is located in the western part of guanzhong shaanxi province china fig 1 it is the largest irrigation area in shaanxi province and one of the top 10 largest irrigated districts in china the irrigation area is 181 km from east to west 14 km from north to south and over 40 km at its widest point the effective irrigated area covers about 189 000 ha and it is responsible for farmland irrigation in 14 counties of baoji xianyang and xi an the irrigation water is diverted from the wei river a tributary of the yellow river and the irrigation area has two water diversion hubs and six medium sized reservoirs the irrigation systems include 107 main canals and branch canals with a total length of 1161 48 km bid 2019 the irrigation area is located in the sub humid area of the monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 570 mm 1954 2010 which is unevenly distributed over the seasons in spring march may and winter december february in

grown are winter wheat and summer maize the growth period of wheat is between october and may while the maize is between june and september irrigation was performed three times per year in january april and august 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 swat model setup swat is a semi distributed watershed hydrological model that simulates the hydrological cycle process on a daily time step according to the principle of water balance it was mainly developed to simulate the effects of human activities on hydrology and sediment in regional scale considering the digital elevation model dem soil types land use categories and meteorology the basin is divided into multiple subbasins and hydrologic response units hrus with hru as the basis the hydrological components are aggregated to subbasins and reached the outlet of the watershed through the streams arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2001 gassman et al 2007 luo et al 2008 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the water balance equation can be expressed as follows eq 1 when applied to an irrigation district 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t pre i irr i ro i et i dp i gw i where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw 0 is the initial soil water content mm t stands for the time days i is the time counter day p re i is the precipitation mm on day i irr is the net irrigation quota mm on day i ro i is the surface runoff mm on day i et i is the actual et mm on day i dp i is the percolation and bypass flow exiting the soil profile bottom mm on day i and gw i is the water from shallow aquifer that enters the main stream mm on day i compared with other models swat integrates the characteristics of paddy fields ponds and reservoirs modules and then performs better when applied to irrigation districts cui and liu 2015 many studies have verified the applicability of the swat model for irrigation districts immerzeel and droogers 2008 luo et al 2008 chaubey et al 2010 liu et al 2015 salmoral et al 2018 becker et al 2019 in this study there are no drainage canals in the bid so the irrigation district is divided into 33 subbasins by pre defined streams that combine the actual irrigation canals and streams based on dem wang et al 2017 then the subbasins are divided into 171 hrus according to the soil types land use types and irrigation management practices the soil conservation services curve number scs cn method mishra and singh 2013 and penman monteith method eagleman 1967 was used to simulate runoff and potential evapotranspiration respectively in the irrigation management module designated pre defined streams as the irrigation water resources and set the schedule of crop sowing irrigation and harvest according to the field operations table a1 in the bid we took 2006 2007 as the warmup period 2 2 2 swat model calibration and validation by using the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 2007a 2007b the measured runoff data from the xianyang station for 2008 2013 was used for calibration and that for 2014 2017 was used for validation the coefficient of determination r2 eq 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 3 were greater than 0 6 and 0 5 respectively which means that the simulation results were acceptable nash and sutcliffe 1970 cui and liu 2015 xie et al 2020 2 r 2 j 1 n q m q m q s q s 2 j 1 n q m q m 2 j 1

of crop production in irrigation districts the crop production wf includes three parts eq 4 4 wf wf g w f b wf b l where wf m³ t 1 is the wf of crop production wf g m³ t 1 is green wf wf b m³ t 1 is blue wf and wf b l m³ t 1 is the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses following zhuo et al 2016 chukalla et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and xie et al 2020 the improved formulas eqs 5 and 6 were obtained and the green and blue wfs of crop production were calculated eq 7 in the calculations the initial value of sw g and sw b were assumed to the green water consumed by crop at the first day and 0 mm

day i los s i mm is the amount of water lost in the hydrological cycle on day i et g i mm and et b i mm is green and blue water consumption on day i respectively y t ha 1 is the crop yield and 10 is the unit conversion factor due to ageing and damage to the irrigation canals coupled with a limited amount of management irrigation delivery losses will occur during the process of water transmission it will be evaporated from water surface in the canals or be percolated to the downstream and then reused after some time that is it can be reused for larger spatial temporal scales however as the wf of crop production indicates water consumption during crop growth in a given geographical area at a certain time hoekstra 2003 wang et al 2019 therefore the blue wf generated by irrigation delivery losses is considered as a part of the wf of crop production within the irrigation districts gao et al 2021 schyns and hoekstra 2014 wu et al 2017 2019 due to the lack of more detailed data about irrigation canals the map of irrigation system was digitized by arcgis then the irrigation delivery losses eq 8 wang 2010 were allocated by the ratio of canal length in each county to the total canal length of the irrigation system as shown in table 1 the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses in each county eq 9 was obtained 8 loss b w 1 η 9 wf b l α loss b y where loss b m³ is the total irrigation delivery loss η is the irrigation efficiency w m³ is the amount of water diversion and α is the ratio of canal length in each county to the total canal length of irrigation system 2 4 meteorological driving factors impact assessment on wf of crop production meteorological conditions affect the wf of crop production as they have an effect on crop water consumption and crop yield lamastra et al 2014 sun et al 2013 zheng et al 2020 zou et al 2017 to evaluate this impact on different temporal scales five meteorological factors precipitation pre mm temperature tem relative humidity rhu wind speed win m s 1 and sunshine hours ssd h were selected as the variables to analysis the statistical analysis were shown in table a2 statistical product and service solutions spss 19 0 software was used for path analysis wright 1921 to determine the impacts of meteorological factors on the green and blue wf of crop production on daily monthly and yearly scales path analysis is a multivariate statistical analysis method used to study the relationship between variables it decomposes the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect path coefficients to reveal the direct and indirect influence of the independent variables on the dependent ones the principle is as follows shipley 2000 wright 1934 10 1 r x 1 x 2 r x 2 x 1 1 r x 1 x n r x 2 x n r x n x 1 r x n x 2 1 p wf x 1 p wf x 2 p wf x n r x 1 wf r x 2 wf r x n wf where r x i x j i j 1 2 n is the simple correlation coefficient of x i and x j r x i wf is the simple correlation coefficient of x i and wf and p wf x i is the direct path coefficient of x i to wf which can be expressed by eq 11 11 p wf x i b i σ x i σ wf where b i is the partial regression coefficient of wf to x i σ x i and σ wf are the standard deviations of x i and wf respectively 2 5 data data used in the swat model dem at a 90 m resolution in 2000 was obtained from the geospatial data cloud site cas 2018a and land use data of 2015 at a 30 m resolution was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences cas 2018b meteorological data in the study period was obtained from the china meteorological data service center cmdc 2019 and the soil map was obtained from the china soil scientific database cas 2019 the runoff data from the xianyang hydrological station used in the model calibration was from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc 2019 the boundaries of the irrigation district counties and irrigation canals fig 1 were obtained digitally from the irrigation district planning map the planning map the areas and distributions of crops irrigation schedule net irrigation quota irrigation efficiency and crop yield were provided by the bid administration bid 2019 the initial value of sw g was obtained from the output of swat model the remote sensing data used to verify the et was obtained from running et al 2019 according to the rainfall data 1953 2018 of the weather stations in the bid fig 1 2013 476 8 mm 2008 554 7 mm and 2014 713 5 mm were identified as the dry normal and wet years by plotting the cumulative frequency curve zhan et al 2010 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the parameter sensitivity analysis made by swat cup showed that the cn2 esco sol awc sol z alpha bf ch n2 were more sensitive to the results table 2 after several rounds of calibration and validation the discrepancy between the simulated and measured runoff values of the xianyang hydrological station was greatly improved fig 2 during calibration the values of r2 and nse were 0 81 and 0 74 respectively while those during validation were 0 73 and 0 78 which meet the evaluation criteria of the swat model calibration also the mod16a2gf version 6 evapotranspiration product at a 500 m pixel resolution issued by running et al 2019 was used to verify the calculation results this product is a year end gap filled 8 days composite dataset the subbasins partitioned by swat were extracted from this product to compare them with the monthly evapotranspiration et values in typical years obtained by swat fig 3 the results show that the differences are mostly within the range of 20 which is considered as acceptable therefore the established swat model is considered as reliable and suitable for bid 3 2 wfs of crop production 3 2 1 variabilities of wfs of crop production at multiple temporal scales the wfs of crop production have different performances at different temporal scales as shown in fig 4 a the total wf of maize rose from 436 m3 t 1 in 2008 576 m3 t 1 in 2017 with an annual average of 560 m3 t 1 the green wf and blue wf showed upward trends accounting for 80 10 of the total wf on average respectively and the annual average wf of delivery losses was 59 m3 t 1 the unit yield of maize was 4 t ha 1 in 2009 and 4 1 t ha 1 in 2017 with little difference during which the change in wf was mainly affected by the changes in et of maize in 2008 except for the influence of crop water consumption the unit yield was slightly higher than that of other years reaching 5 2 t ha 1 which led to a significant decrease in the green wf and a lower total wf the total wf of wheat fig 4b showed a slow rising trend increasing by 9 from 719 m3 t 1 in 2008 784 m3 t 1 in 2017 the average annual total wf was 776 m3 t 1 the green and blue wfs both increased accounting for 70 and 15 of the total wf on average respectively and the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses accounted for 15 with a downwards trend the change in unit yield of wheat was only small from 4 4 t ha 1 in 2008 3 9 t ha 1 in 2017 and the wf of wheat was mainly affected by water consumption on daily and monthly time scales in the typical years the wfs of crop production only include green and blue wfs in crop fields because the amount of canal delivery losses on these scales are not available similarly to the yearly scale the green blue wfs of crops were still mainly affected by the change in green wfs from the perspective of monthly scale as shown in fig 5 a in 2013 the average green wf of maize was 56 m3 t 1 accounting for 87 9 of the green blue wf with the highest proportion in june 37 1 the blue wf got the largest in august 46 8 and the smallest in july 6 5 in 2008 the average green blue wf was 50 4 m3 t 1 with the green wf accounting for 87 8 of it on average with a downwards trend in september as the maize gradually matured and stopped growing the proportion of green wf was the smallest 16 3 in the remaining months the proportion of green wf was relatively high in july 28 6 during which the maize growth was vigorous when irrigated in august the blue wf increased significantly accounting for the highest proportion 44 in 2014 both the green and blue wfs showed upward trends with an average green wf of 56 4 m3 t 1 accounting for 88 1 of the total green blue wf the proportion of green wf was the highest in august 26 6 and september 27 7 because of the abundant precipitation also the blue wf accounted for the largest proportion 58 3 in august as shown in fig 5 b the green and blue wfs of wheat showed upward trends in 2012 2013 with an average green wf of 34 8 m3 t 1 accounting for 82 3 of the total green blue wf the green wf increased as crop growth while the blue wf began to rise after irrigation in january so that as of may it accounted for 97 5 of the total blue wf in 2007 2008 from november to december and march to april wheat growth was flourishing and the proportion of green wf was the highest reaching 15 5 14 5 16 7 and 15 8 respectively the remaining months were in the wintering or maturing stage and the green wf was approximately 10 same as previous year to may the blue wf accounted for 95 of the total blue wf after irrigation in january in 2013 2014 the green wf increased slowly with an average of 34 6 m3 t 1 accounting for 80 4 of the total green blue wf the blue wf showed an upward trend with an average of 8 4 m3 t 1 the proportion of green wf in each month was approximately same between 10 and 15 and the blue wf accounted for 97 from january to may on a daily scale the wf trends of maize and wheat were consistent with those on the monthly scale but the fluctuations were larger than those on the monthly scale because of the significantly increasing blue wf after irrigation from the daily varying trends of the wfs of maize in typical years as shown in fig 6 a generally the water consumption of maize generally increased during the seedling stage reaching a peak at the end of this stage then the green wf dropped down in the jointing stage until it rose again in the booting stage from the filling stage to the maturation stage the crop growth gradually stopped and the water consumption showed a downwards trend fig 6 b shows the daily varying trends in the wfs of wheat in 2012 2013 the green and blue wfs of wheat both showed increasing trends with an average of 2 3 m3 t 1 and 0 5 m3 t 1 respectively in 2007 2008 similarly the green and blue wf increased slowly with an average green wf of 2 1 m3 t 1 from the seedling stage to the tillering stage wheat gradually began to grow and water consumption presented an upward trend after winter irrigation in the wintering stage the climate turned cold water consumption decreased gradually before entering the returning green stage then the climate warmed and water consumption increased gradually during the filling to maturing stage wheat stopped growing and water consumption decreased gradually in 2013 2014 the green wf of wheat showed a slow increased trend with an average of 2 3 m3 t 1 also after irrigation the blue wf rose greatly due to the large increase in blue water consumption 3 2 2 spatial evolution of wfs of crop production in typical years fig 7 a shows the spatial evolution of the wf of maize in each county within the irrigated area in typical years from dry year to normal and wet years the blue wf had a decrease in most counties yangling had the highest blue wf every year followed by weicheng and qian county had the lowest blue wf averaging at 29 m3 t 1 per year overall the blue wf of maize in the south of the irrigated area was relatively higher than that in the north similarly the green wf of maize in most counties showed downwards trends in 2013 weicheng and qian county had the lowest and highest green wf respectively in 2008 and 2014 yangling had the lowest green wf and liquan had the highest during the typical years the annual blue wf of irrigation delivery losses of qian county was the lowest whereas that of yangling was the highest the total wf of maize was the lowest in mei county in 2008 and 2014 and the lowest in jingyang in 2013 in 2013 yangling had the highest total wf and that in weicheng was the highest in 2013 and 2008 which was mainly caused by the high blue wf and blue wf of irrigation delivery losses as shown in fig 7 b the annual blue wf of yangling was the highest followed by weicheng and the lowest occurred in the qian county in all typical years the green wf was the lowest in mei county in 2007 2008 and in the other two years it was the lowest in jingyang the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses was the lowest in qian county and the highest in yangling the total wfs of most counties were rising yangling was the highest which was mainly caused by the high blue wf and blue wf of irrigation delivery losses the total wf of jingyang fufeng and liquan got the lowest in three typical years respectively the difference of the green wf in each county was mainly caused by the distribution of meteorological factors and the variation of yield while that of blue wf not only effected by these factors also by the net irrigation quota and delivery losses which allocated by the canal system 3 3 meteorological driving factors impact assessment on wf of crop production in this study maize and wheat were mainly planted in the irrigated area maize is a c4 plant and prefers warm environments its growth period is from june to september and its photosynthesis is strong wheat is a c3 plant meaning it must go through vernalization and its growth period is from october to may of the following year wang et al 2012 bid 2019 the two crops are physiologically different and have different meteorological conditions corresponding to the growth period identifying the impacts of meteorological factors on the two crops is helpful to clarify the specific impacts of meteorological factors on them and to adjust the management measures pertinently according to the crops fig 8 shows the fluctuation range of total influence of meteorological factors on crop wfs across yearly monthly and daily scales as shown in fig 8 a for maize production the fluctuations in the influence of meteorological factors on the green wf are higher than those of blue wf precipitation has positive effects on the green wf whereas precipitation temperature and wind speed have negative effects on the blue wf in fig 9 a on a yearly scale precipitation has the greatest positive and negative effects on the green and blue wfs respectively however the main meteorological factors that play key roles in the wf of maize are not the same in different typical years on an intra annual scale temperature and precipitation had the greatest positive and negative influences on the green and blue wfs respectively in the dry year in the normal year temperature and humidity had the greatest positive influences on the green and blue wfs in the wet year humidity and temperature had the greatest positive and negative influence on the green wfs at monthly scale and daily scales respectively while wind speed and precipitation had the greatest negative influences on the blue wfs at monthly and daily scales the variations in the total influence of each factor depend on the direct and indirect impacts of each factor on the wfs of crop production see table a3 for details as for wheat sunshine hours temperature and wind speed all have positive influences on the green and blue wfs fig 8b as shown in fig 9 b on a yearly scale sunshine hours and temperature have the greatest negative and positive effects on the green and blue wfs of wheat respectively on daily and monthly scales humidity in the dry year had the greatest negative influence on the green wf sunshine hour in the normal year had the greatest positive influence on the blue wf while precipitation in the wet year had the greatest positive influence on the blue and green wf at monthly and daily scales respectively other main factors that had the greatest impact on the green and blue wfs on daily and monthly scales lack consistent rules see table a4 at different temporal scales meteorological factors have different influences on the wfs of crop production fig 9 for the green and blue wf of maize on the daily scale the influences generated by each meteorological factor range within 0 06 0 23 and 0 14 0 14 respectively in the typical years on the monthly scale the influences range within 0 49 0 56 and 0 51 0 15 respectively the influence of meteorological factors generated at a monthly scale is higher than that on a daily scale and the average level is up to 8 4 times that of the daily scale while there is no obvious time scale effect at the yearly scale similar to the wf of maize production the influences of each meteorological factor on the green and blue wfs of wheat reached the maximum at a monthly scale which ranged from 0 4 0 55 and 0 32 0 86 respectively and the average level reached 1 8 times that of the daily scale 3 4 discussion for the first time the evolution of the wf of crop production and associated meteorological driving factors on an intra annual scale in an irrigation district was analyzed the time scale effect noted in the influence of these factors was preliminarily explored it should be noted to completely quantify and show the water consumption in the baojixia irrigation district the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses was described at the yearly scale however the green and blue wfs were described respectively in each temporal scales the blue wf of delivery losses was also showed separately at the spatial scale and the meteorological driving factors analysis was based on the green and blue wfs at different temporal scales excluding the effects of blue wf of delivery losses in the comparison between monthly et based on swat and mod 16 some of the et values differed from each other which may be due to the assumption that all farmland is maize and wheat rotation in this study even though fruit trees and vegetables are planted in some areas of the bid meanwhile the schedules of crop plant irrigation and harvest that are set in the swat are different with the actual values every year thus the crop growth periods do not completely correspond to the actual periods meaning the results contain certain errors precipitation had a positive effect on the blue wf of wheat production mainly because the actual irrigation water and irrigation schedules were not adjusted according to the actual precipitation other meteorological conditions and crop water requirements for example 2014 was a wet year meaning the increase in precipitation was accompanied by a much higher amount of irrigation water which over the dry year of 2008 46 the fluctuations of meteorological factors effect on the blue wf of wheat were greater than that of maize because the irrigation frequency and irrigation water of wheat were much greater than that of maize while there is a wintering period in which irrigation water exists in the field for a long time in different typical years the main meteorological factors that play key roles in the wfs of crops are not the same the promoting effect of these meteorological factors needs to be within a certain range otherwise there will be an inhibition effect and all factors act together on crop transpiration and growth development coupled with the interference of management operations e g irrigation and fertilization in irrigation districts resulting in a change in the main factors that play key roles in the wfs of crop production in different typical years the impact analysis on a daily scale was obtained from the daily wf corresponding to daily meteorological factors which was theoretically the most accurate on a monthly scale meteorological factors have the greatest effect and the average level is as high as several times that of the daily scale which is mainly caused by the significant change in meteorological factors between the months on a yearly scale the impact showed no obvious consistent change which is likely due to the fluctuation of meteorological factors will be greatly reduced and the obvious change between months will be weakened at the same time different meteorological factors have different effects on the wfs of maize and wheat at different temporal scales which also verified the necessity of separating maize and wheat to identify the meteorological factors when the wf of crop production of the best 10 of producers with the highest water productivity was set as the wf benchmark for the crop mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 found that the green blue wf benchmark of wheat was 592 m3 t 1 and that of maize was 503 m3 t 1 during 1996 2005 by contrast on a multi year average the maize production in bid are efficient and the wheat production have a little gap with efficient production however the wf of crop fluctuated every year for instance the wf of wheat production in 2013 exceeds the benchmark 15 because of the low unit yield compared with related research ding et al 2013 calculated the annual average crop water requirements of maize and wheat in the bid to be 469 mm and 447 mm respectively which were 219 mm and 258 mm in this study respectively this confirms that crop water consumption in the bid was far less than the crop water requirement which led to crop yield not reaching the optimal level the critical stages for the water demand of wheat are successively the returning green stage 140 160 days the jointing period 160 190 days and the wintering stage 70 140 days wang 2010 irrigation was carried out in the wintering stage and the jointing stage in the bid and water could be appropriately allocated for irrigation in the returning green stage to further improve crop yield at the same time crop varieties with high yield and good disease resistance are selected to increase crop yield as shown in fig 10 the irrigation water efficiency did not change significantly with an average of 54 which higher than the national average level but still exists an obvious gap with developed countries which was 70 90 zhu et al 2013 the blue wfs of maize and wheat accounted for 34 and 36 of the irrigation water supplies respectively on average meanwhile flood irrigation is mostly used in bid so micro irrigation e g drip irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation can be used according to the actual meteorological and production conditions to achieve precise irrigation and improve the water use efficiency appropriate tillage proper application and timing of manure or artificial fertilizer can manage the soil nutrients promote the absorption of water by crops and reduce the invalid evaporation mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 which effectively reduces the wf of crop production due to the lack of data like reservoir storage water surface area and discharge the swat model did not set the reservoirs in detail however the net irrigation quota used in the simulation including the irrigation water provided by the reservoirs therefore the influence of the reservoirs on the bid had been mainly considered in the hydrological cycle process because of the complex distribution of canal system and the lack of effective utilization coefficient of irrigation below the main canals the canal losses was assumed to allocate according to the ratio of canal length in each county to the total length subbasins were divided by pre defined streams because of the uncompleted irrigation systems in bid which leading to the division not be critically fitted with the boundary of irrigation district and its counties in the future research subbasins could be defined according to the actual situation field measured data can be used to improve the simulation accuracy and socio economical factors can be considered if the data available meanwhile the time scale effect existed in the grey wf wu et al 2021 in order to improve the evaluation of different types of water use in the irrigated area the grey wf and its effect on temporal scales can be further explored 4 conclusion by constructing a regional swat model and considering the water losses of canal delivery we quantified the wf of crop production in bid at daily monthly and yearly scales and analyzed the variations in wfs and associated meteorological factors the following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the method of wf of crop production established in the study can be applied to hydrological simulation of irrigated areas without drainage system 2 in general the green wf of maize was relatively higher from june to august seeding booting stage the lowest in september filling maturing stage the green wf of wheat from november to december tillering wintering stage and march to april returning green heading stage in the normal year was relatively large 3 the blue wfs of maize and wheat accounted for 34 and 36 of the irrigation water supplies respectively on average 4 the key meteorological factors that have an effect on the wf of crop production differ among typical years on a yearly scale precipitation has the greatest positive and negative impacts on the green and blue wf of maize respectively sunshine hours and temperature had the greatest negative and positive impacts on the green and blue wf of wheat respectively on the daily and monthly scales for maize production temperature and precipitation generated the largest positive and negative impact on green and blue wf in dry year whereas temperature and humidity both had the largest positive impacts on the green and blue wf in normal years respectively for the production of wheat humidity had the largest negative influence on the green wf in the dry year whereas sunshine hours had the greatest positive impact on the blue wf in the normal year 5 time scale effects existed in the influences of meteorological factors on the wf of crop production the calculation on the daily scale is the most accurate in theory yet the effect on the monthly scale has the maximum impact 6 the irrigation water

9983,the water footprint wf of crop production indicates the water consumption for crop growth in a specific area over a certain time enabling comprehensive water use efficiency assessments to be achieved for different types of water in an irrigation district daily and monthly blue irrigation water and green rainfall water resources are unevenly distributed in monsoon climate areas however the intra annual evolution of the wf of crop production for a monsoon irrigation district is lacking in the current study maize and wheat production in the baojixia irrigation district bid of shaanxi in china selected as the case study for the period 2008 2017 where the wf of crop production was analyzed based on a regional distributed hydrological model and the associated meteorological driving factors on daily monthly and yearly scales were identified results reveal that the method of wf of crop production established in the study can be applied to hydrological simulation of irrigated areas without drainage system the blue wfs of maize and wheat production accounted for 34 and 36 of the irrigation water supplies respectively on a yearly scale precipitation had the greatest impact on the green and blue wfs of maize while sunshine hours and temperature had the greatest impact on those of wheat respectively on daily and monthly scales different meteorological factors played key roles in the wf of crop production in different typical years the time scale effect existed in the impact of meteorological driving factors on the wf of crop production reaching its maximum on a monthly scale both water shortages and water waste coexist in bid the irrigated area should rationally allocate blue water and effectively utilize green water resource to improve crop yield meanwhile the time scale effect in the wf assessment of crop production and driving factors cannot be neglected the irrigation strategy should be adjusted to cope with the impact of meteorological conditions according to the results and actual situation graphical abstract ga1 keywords time scale effect irrigation district distributed hydrological model wheat maize 1 introduction irrigation accounts for 70 of the total water withdrawal globally fao 2011 grafton et al 2018 irrigation districts are the center of food production and agricultural water use in many regions with reliable water sources and a complete irrigation system for centralized irrigation and management wen et al 2020 irrigated districts are semi artificial ecosystems that are greatly affected by human activities with complex hydrological process of farmland in recent decades the production of irrigated areas has greatly improved global agricultural productivity and yield although irrigated agriculture only accounts for 17 of the global arable land it produces 42 of cereal yields fao 2011 thus irrigation districts have already played an irreplaceable role in ensuring food security for society to promote efficient agricultural production it is necessary to ensure water security and to realize efficient water use in irrigated areas cao et al 2020a the accurate quantification of water consumption for crop production in irrigated areas is the basis for determining crop water consumption evaluating water use efficiency and for controlling crop water consumption in order to achieve the efficient water use and agricultural production the water footprint wf of crop production refers to the appropriation of water resources for growing crops in a specific area over a certain time the crop wf consists of green wf the effective precipitation consumed during crop growth blue wf the irrigation water consumed in crop production and grey wf the amount of fresh water required to assimilate the pollution caused by the crop growth to meet local water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 it is useful to understand the water consumption status at different spatial and temporal scales through wf assessment and analysis karandish and šimůnek 2019 as it enables the clarification of different types of water resources consumption the measurement of water efficiency reasonable actions to be taken to reduce wf and the control of water consumption the wf of crop production has become a dynamic concept of water resources management in the agricultural sector bazrafshan et al 2020 which provides a new decision making basis for the rational utilization of agricultural water use li et al 2020 currently most of the methods account for the wf of crop production which can distinguish specific crops are based on the wf accounting framework developed by the water footprint network hoekstra et al 2011 through crop water productivity models such as aquacrop e g chukalla et al 2015 karandish et al 2018 wang et al 2019 cropwat e g aldaya et al 2010 novoa et al 2019 su et al 2015 or dssat e g shrestha et al 2017 these models account for the wf over multiple spatial scales including the global e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 pfister and bayer 2014 national e g bulsink et al 2010 govere et al 2020 cao et al 2020b wang et al 2019 basin e g zhuo et al 2016 and irrigation area scales e g muratoglu 2019 the above mentioned models are based on the soil water balances vertically at site bases therefore they fail to reflect any regional distributed hydrological effects caused by the complexity of regional underlying surface and environmental changes therefore scholars have begun to try to solve this problem by using distributed hydrological models in recent years luan et al 2018 xie et al 2020 such distributed hydrological models have been widely used to simulate the evapotranspiration et of crops as the hydrological effect is thoroughly investigated by partitioning the entire study area to different computing units according to the underlying surfaces becker et al 2019 immerzeel and droogers 2008 liu et al 2015 zou et al 2017 luan et al 2018 quantified the multi year average wf of crop production in the hetao irrigation district hid based on the distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat taking the water losses of canal delivery into account by simplifying the delivery canals and using the kriging spatial interposition method the hid has a complete irrigation system with drainage ditches which can discharge excess water effectively regulate the water condition in farmland and control the underground water level however most other irrigation districts on the loess plateau e g the baojixia irrigation district bid and the jinghuiqu irrigation district do not have drainage canals because of the deep soil layer and deep underground water level meaning the excess water naturally percolates through the soil for this type of irrigated area research on quantifying the wf of crop production by applying the hydrological model is lacking meanwhile in traditional irrigation schedule and allocation analysis daily scale is the foundation however in the field of wf assessment most studies used the estimated total et and effective precipitation at monthly scale to generate blue and green wf at annual scales eg kongboon and sampattagul 2012 sun et al 2013 ma et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2020 although recently there have been studies accounted the crop wf based on daily soil water balances eg wang et al 2019 xie et al 2020 li et al 2021 the shown results are generally limited to annual scales apparently a comprehensive analysis of the variability of the wf of irrigated crop production and the associated meteorological drivers on a daily and monthly scale is lacking according to the study by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 there are significant differences in monthly blue water resources in many regions for instance in the western part of the united states southern europe and north china there are many areas experiencing moderate to severe water scarcity in the spring summer period moreover rosa et al 2020 found that 68 of the global irrigated croplands face blue water scarcity for 1 month a year and 37 experience it for 5 months of the year therefore studies on the evolution of the wf of crop production on multiple temporal scales daily monthly and yearly are crucial for the efficient use of green water resources and rational allocation of blue water resources in irrigated areas in the monsoon climate zone in order to achieve efficient production this study aims to fill the above research gaps through the case study of summer maize and winter wheat production in the bid of shaanxi province in china over 2008 2017 through the set up of a swat model based on the hydrological cycle coupled with the soil water balance model to obtain the green and blue wfs of the crops then combined with the traditional quantification method of water delivery losses the wfs of crops in bid were completely considered next the variability in the annual wfs of crops during the study period was analyzed and three typical years dry normal and wet were selected to analyze the wfs of crops on daily monthly and spatial scales path analysis wright 1921 was used to determine the impact of meteorological factors on the wfs of crops at different temporal scales compared with existing studies the characteristics of this study were mainly reflected in the following aspects first the applicability of the swat model to quantify the wf of crop production in irrigated districts without drainage ditches was further explored second the variability of the wfs of crops on daily monthly scales as well as spatial scales was investigated in typical years lastly the impact of meteorological factors on the wfs of crops at different temporal scales was quantified and the time scale effect noted in the impact was also preliminarily explored thus the temporal and spatial variabilities of the wfs of irrigated crops at different temporal scales can be further understood and the inter and intra annual water consumption of irrigated areas can be quantified precisely then the water efficiency can be clarified and the irrigation schedule and management can be optimized to achieve accurate water allocation and efficient water use 2 methods and data 2 1 study area the bid is located in the western part of guanzhong shaanxi province china fig 1 it is the largest irrigation area in shaanxi province and one of the top 10 largest irrigated districts in china the irrigation area is 181 km from east to west 14 km from north to south and over 40 km at its widest point the effective irrigated area covers about 189 000 ha and it is responsible for farmland irrigation in 14 counties of baoji xianyang and xi an the irrigation water is diverted from the wei river a tributary of the yellow river and the irrigation area has

april and august 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 swat model setup swat is a semi distributed watershed hydrological model that simulates the hydrological cycle process on a daily time step according to the principle of water balance it was mainly developed to simulate the effects of human activities on hydrology and sediment in regional scale considering the digital elevation model dem soil types land use categories and meteorology the basin is divided into multiple subbasins and hydrologic response units hrus with hru as the basis the hydrological components are aggregated to subbasins and reached the outlet of the watershed through the streams arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2001 gassman et al 2007 luo et al 2008 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the water balance equation can be expressed as follows eq 1 when applied to an irrigation district 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t pre i irr i ro i et i dp i gw i where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw 0 is the initial soil water content mm t stands

dp i is the percolation and bypass flow exiting the soil profile bottom mm on day i and gw i is the water from shallow aquifer that enters the main stream mm on day i compared with other models swat integrates the characteristics of paddy fields ponds and reservoirs modules and then performs better when applied to irrigation districts cui and liu 2015 many studies have verified the applicability of the swat model for irrigation districts immerzeel and droogers 2008 luo et al 2008 chaubey et al 2010 liu et al 2015 salmoral et al 2018 becker et al 2019 in this study there are no drainage canals in the bid so the irrigation district is divided into 33 subbasins by pre defined streams that combine the actual irrigation canals and streams based on dem wang et al 2017 then the subbasins are divided into 171 hrus according to the soil types land use types and irrigation management practices the soil conservation services curve number scs cn method mishra and singh 2013 and penman monteith method eagleman 1967 was used to simulate runoff and potential evapotranspiration respectively in the irrigation management module designated pre defined streams as the irrigation water resources and set the schedule of crop sowing irrigation and harvest according to the field operations table a1 in the bid we took 2006 2007 as the warmup period 2 2 2 swat model calibration and validation by using the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 2007a 2007b the measured runoff data from the xianyang station for 2008 2013 was used for calibration and that for 2014 2017 was used for validation the coefficient of determination r2 eq 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 3 were greater than 0 6 and 0 5 respectively which means that the simulation results were acceptable nash and sutcliffe 1970 cui and liu 2015 xie et al 2020 2 r 2 j 1 n q m q m q s q s 2 j 1 n q m q m 2 j 1

of crop production in irrigation districts the crop production wf includes three parts eq 4 4 wf wf g w f b wf b l where wf m³ t 1 is the wf of crop production wf g m³ t 1 is green wf wf b m³ t 1 is blue wf and wf b l m³ t 1 is the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses following zhuo et al 2016 chukalla et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and xie et al 2020 the improved formulas eqs 5 and 6 were obtained and the green and blue wfs of crop production were calculated eq 7 in the calculations the initial value of sw g and sw b were assumed to the green water consumed by crop at the first day and 0 mm

day i los s i mm is the amount of water lost in the hydrological cycle on day i et g i mm and et b i mm is green and blue water consumption on day i respectively y t ha 1 is the crop yield and 10 is the unit conversion factor due to ageing and damage to the irrigation canals coupled with a limited amount of management irrigation delivery losses will occur during the process of water transmission it will be evaporated from water surface in the canals or be percolated to the downstream and then reused after some time that is it can be reused for larger spatial temporal scales however as the wf of crop production indicates water consumption during crop growth in a given geographical area at a certain time hoekstra 2003 wang et al 2019 therefore the blue wf generated by irrigation delivery losses is considered as a part of the wf of crop production within the irrigation districts gao et al 2021 schyns and hoekstra 2014 wu et al 2017 2019 due to the lack of more detailed data about irrigation canals the map of irrigation system was digitized by arcgis then the irrigation delivery losses eq 8 wang 2010 were allocated by the ratio of canal length in each county to the total canal length of the irrigation system as shown in table 1 the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses in each county eq 9 was obtained 8 loss b w 1 η 9 wf b l α loss b y where loss b m³ is the total irrigation delivery loss η is the irrigation efficiency w m³ is the amount of water diversion and α is the ratio of canal length in each county to the total canal length of irrigation system 2 4 meteorological driving factors impact assessment on wf of crop production meteorological conditions affect the wf of crop production as they have an effect on crop water consumption and crop yield lamastra et al 2014 sun et al 2013 zheng et al 2020 zou et al 2017 to evaluate this impact on different temporal scales five meteorological factors precipitation pre mm temperature tem relative humidity rhu wind speed win m s 1 and sunshine hours ssd h were selected as the variables to analysis the statistical analysis were shown in table a2 statistical product and service solutions spss 19 0 software was used for path analysis wright 1921 to determine the impacts of meteorological factors on the green and blue wf of crop production on daily monthly and yearly scales path analysis is a multivariate statistical analysis method used to study the relationship between variables it decomposes the correlation coefficient into direct and indirect path coefficients to reveal the direct and indirect influence of the independent variables on the dependent ones the principle is as follows shipley 2000 wright 1934 10 1 r x 1 x 2 r x 2 x 1 1 r x 1 x n r x 2 x n r x n x 1 r x n x 2 1 p wf x 1 p wf x 2 p wf x n r x 1 wf r x 2 wf r x n wf where r x i x j i j 1 2 n is the simple correlation coefficient of x i and x j r x i wf is the simple correlation coefficient of x i and wf and p wf x i is the direct path coefficient of x i to wf which can be expressed by eq 11 11 p wf x i b i σ x i σ wf where b i is the partial regression coefficient of wf to x i σ x i and σ wf are the standard deviations of x i and wf respectively 2 5 data data used in the swat model dem at a 90 m resolution in 2000 was obtained from the geospatial data cloud site cas 2018a and land use data of 2015 at a 30 m resolution was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences cas 2018b meteorological data in the study period was obtained from the china meteorological data service center cmdc 2019 and the soil map was obtained from the china soil scientific database cas 2019 the runoff data from the xianyang hydrological station used in the model calibration was from the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc 2019 the boundaries of the irrigation district counties and irrigation canals fig 1 were obtained digitally from the irrigation district planning map the planning map the areas and distributions of crops irrigation schedule net irrigation quota irrigation efficiency and crop yield were provided by the bid administration bid 2019 the initial value of sw g was obtained from the output of swat model the remote sensing data used to verify the et was obtained from running et al 2019 according to the rainfall data 1953 2018 of the weather stations in the bid fig 1 2013 476 8 mm 2008 554 7 mm and 2014 713 5 mm were identified as the dry normal and wet years by plotting the cumulative frequency curve zhan et al 2010 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the parameter sensitivity analysis made by swat cup showed that the cn2 esco sol awc sol z alpha bf ch n2 were more sensitive to the results table 2 after several rounds of calibration and validation the discrepancy between the simulated and measured runoff values of the xianyang hydrological station was greatly improved fig 2 during calibration the values of r2 and nse were 0 81 and 0 74 respectively while those during validation were 0 73 and 0 78 which meet the evaluation criteria of the swat model calibration also the mod16a2gf version 6 evapotranspiration product at a 500 m pixel resolution issued by running et al 2019 was used to verify the calculation results this product is a year end gap filled 8 days composite dataset the subbasins partitioned by swat were extracted from this product to compare them with the monthly evapotranspiration et values in typical years obtained by swat fig 3 the results show that the differences are mostly within the range of 20 which is considered as acceptable therefore the established swat model is considered as reliable and suitable for bid 3 2 wfs of crop production 3 2 1 variabilities of wfs of crop production at multiple temporal scales the wfs of crop production have different performances at different temporal scales as shown in fig 4 a the total wf of maize rose from 436 m3 t 1 in 2008 576 m3 t 1 in 2017 with an annual average of 560 m3 t 1 the green wf and blue wf showed upward trends accounting for 80 10 of the total wf on average respectively and the annual average wf of delivery losses was 59 m3 t 1 the unit yield of maize was 4 t ha 1 in 2009 and 4 1 t ha 1 in 2017 with little difference during which the change in wf was mainly affected by the changes in et of maize in 2008 except for the influence of crop water consumption the unit yield was slightly higher than that of other years reaching 5 2 t ha 1 which led to a significant decrease in the green wf and a lower total wf the total wf of wheat fig 4b showed a slow rising trend increasing by 9 from 719 m3 t 1 in 2008 784 m3 t 1 in 2017 the average annual total wf was 776 m3 t 1 the green and blue wfs both increased accounting for 70 and 15 of the total wf on average respectively and the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses accounted for 15 with a downwards trend the change in unit yield of wheat was only small from 4 4 t ha 1 in 2008 3 9 t ha 1 in 2017 and the wf of wheat was mainly affected by water consumption on daily and monthly time scales in the typical years the wfs of crop production only include green and blue wfs in crop fields because the amount of canal delivery losses on these scales are not available similarly to the yearly scale the green blue wfs of crops were still mainly affected by the change in green wfs from the perspective of monthly scale as shown in fig 5 a in 2013 the average green wf of maize was 56 m3 t 1 accounting for 87 9 of the green blue wf with the highest proportion in june 37 1 the blue wf got the largest in august 46 8 and the smallest in july 6 5 in 2008 the average green blue wf was 50 4 m3 t 1 with the green wf accounting for 87 8 of it on average with a downwards trend in september as the maize gradually matured and stopped growing the proportion of green wf was the smallest 16 3 in the remaining months the proportion of green wf was relatively high in july 28 6 during which the maize growth was vigorous when irrigated in august the blue wf increased significantly accounting for the highest proportion 44 in 2014 both the green and blue wfs showed upward trends with an average green wf of 56 4 m3 t 1 accounting for 88 1 of the total green blue wf the proportion of green wf was the highest in august 26 6 and september 27 7 because of the abundant precipitation also the blue wf accounted for the largest proportion 58 3 in august as shown in fig 5 b the green and blue wfs of wheat showed upward trends in 2012 2013 with an average green wf of 34 8 m3 t 1 accounting for 82 3 of the total green blue wf the green wf increased as crop growth while the blue wf began to rise after irrigation in january so that as of may it accounted for 97 5 of the total blue wf in 2007 2008 from november to december and march to april wheat growth was flourishing and the proportion of green wf was the highest reaching 15 5 14 5 16 7 and 15 8 respectively the remaining months were in the wintering or maturing stage and the green wf was approximately 10 same as previous year to may the blue wf accounted for 95 of the total blue wf after irrigation in january in 2013 2014 the green wf increased slowly with an average of 34 6 m3 t 1 accounting for 80 4 of the total green blue wf the blue wf showed an upward trend with an average of 8 4 m3 t 1 the proportion of green wf in each month was approximately same between 10 and 15 and the blue wf accounted for 97 from january to may on a daily scale the wf trends of maize and wheat were consistent with those on the monthly scale but the fluctuations were larger than those on the monthly scale because of the significantly increasing blue wf after irrigation from the daily varying trends of the wfs of maize in typical years as shown in fig 6 a generally the water consumption of maize generally increased during the seedling stage reaching a peak at the end of this stage then the green wf dropped down in the jointing stage until it rose again in the booting stage from the filling stage to the maturation stage the crop growth gradually stopped and the water consumption showed a downwards trend fig 6 b shows the daily varying trends in the wfs of wheat in 2012 2013 the green and blue wfs of wheat both showed increasing trends with an average of 2 3 m3 t 1 and 0 5 m3 t 1 respectively in 2007 2008 similarly the green and blue wf increased slowly with an average green wf of 2 1 m3 t 1 from the seedling stage to the tillering stage wheat gradually began to grow and water consumption presented an upward trend after winter irrigation in the wintering stage the climate turned cold water consumption decreased gradually before entering the returning green stage then the climate warmed and water consumption increased gradually during the filling to maturing stage wheat stopped growing and water consumption decreased gradually in 2013 2014 the green wf of wheat showed a slow increased trend with an average of 2 3 m3 t 1 also after irrigation the blue wf rose greatly due to the large increase in blue water consumption 3 2 2 spatial evolution of wfs of crop production in typical years fig 7 a shows the spatial evolution of the wf of maize in each county within the irrigated area in typical years from dry year to normal and wet years the blue wf had a decrease in most counties yangling had the highest blue wf every year followed by weicheng and qian county had the lowest blue wf averaging at 29 m3 t 1 per year overall the blue wf of maize in the south of the irrigated area was relatively higher than that in the north similarly the green wf of maize in most counties showed downwards trends in 2013 weicheng and qian county had the lowest and highest green wf respectively in 2008 and 2014 yangling had the lowest green wf and liquan had the highest during the typical years the annual blue wf of irrigation delivery losses of qian county was the lowest whereas that of yangling was the highest the total wf of maize was the lowest in mei county in 2008 and 2014 and the lowest in jingyang in 2013 in 2013 yangling had the highest total wf and that in weicheng was the highest in 2013 and 2008 which was mainly caused by the high blue wf and blue wf of irrigation delivery losses as shown in fig 7 b the annual blue wf of yangling was the highest followed by weicheng and the lowest occurred in the qian county in all typical years the green wf was the lowest in mei county in 2007 2008 and in the other two years it was the lowest in jingyang the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses was the lowest in qian county and the highest in yangling the total wfs of most counties were rising yangling was the highest which was mainly caused by the high blue wf and blue wf of irrigation delivery losses the total wf of jingyang fufeng and liquan got the lowest in three typical years respectively the difference of the green wf in each county was mainly caused by the distribution of meteorological factors and the variation of yield while that of blue wf not only effected by these factors also by the net irrigation quota and delivery losses which allocated by the canal system 3 3 meteorological driving factors impact assessment on wf of crop production in this study maize and wheat were mainly planted in the irrigated area maize is a c4 plant and prefers warm environments its growth period is from june to september and its photosynthesis is strong wheat is a c3 plant meaning it must go through vernalization and its growth period is from october to may of the following year wang et al 2012 bid 2019 the two crops are physiologically different and have different meteorological conditions corresponding to the growth period identifying the impacts of meteorological factors on the two crops is helpful to clarify the specific impacts of meteorological factors on them and to adjust the management measures pertinently according to the crops fig 8 shows the fluctuation range of total influence of meteorological factors on crop wfs across yearly monthly and daily scales as shown in fig 8 a for maize production the fluctuations in the influence of meteorological factors on the green wf are higher than those of blue wf precipitation has positive effects on the green wf whereas precipitation temperature and wind speed have negative effects on the blue wf in fig 9 a on a yearly scale precipitation has the greatest positive and negative effects on the green and blue wfs respectively however the main meteorological factors that play key roles in the wf of maize are not the same in different typical years on an intra annual scale temperature and precipitation had the greatest positive and negative influences on the green and blue wfs respectively in the dry year in the normal year temperature and humidity had the greatest positive influences on the green and blue wfs in the wet year humidity and temperature had the greatest positive and negative influence on the green wfs at monthly scale and daily scales respectively while wind speed and precipitation had the greatest negative influences on the blue wfs at monthly and daily scales the variations in the total influence of each factor depend on the direct and indirect impacts of each factor on the wfs of crop production see table a3 for details as for wheat sunshine hours temperature and wind speed all have positive influences on the green and blue wfs fig 8b as shown in fig 9 b on a yearly scale sunshine hours and temperature have the greatest negative and positive effects on the green and blue wfs of wheat respectively on daily and monthly scales humidity in the dry year had the greatest negative influence on the green wf sunshine hour in the normal year had the greatest positive influence on the blue wf while precipitation in the wet year had the greatest positive influence on the blue and green wf at monthly and daily scales respectively other main factors that had the greatest impact on the green and blue wfs on daily and monthly scales lack consistent rules see table a4 at different temporal scales meteorological factors have different influences on the wfs of crop production fig 9 for the green and blue wf of maize on the daily scale the influences generated by each meteorological factor range within 0 06 0 23 and 0 14 0 14 respectively in the typical years on the monthly scale the influences range within 0 49 0 56 and 0 51 0 15 respectively the influence of meteorological factors generated at a monthly scale is higher than that on a daily scale and the average level is up to 8 4 times that of the daily scale while there is no obvious time scale effect at the yearly scale similar to the wf of maize production the influences of each meteorological factor on the green and blue wfs of wheat reached the maximum at a monthly scale which ranged from 0 4 0 55 and 0 32 0 86 respectively and the average level reached 1 8 times that of the daily scale 3 4 discussion for the first time the evolution of the wf of crop production and associated meteorological driving factors on an intra annual scale in an irrigation district was analyzed the time scale effect noted in the influence of these factors was preliminarily explored it should be noted to completely quantify and show the water consumption in the baojixia irrigation district the blue wf of irrigation delivery losses was described at the yearly scale however the green and blue wfs were described respectively in each temporal scales the blue wf of delivery losses was also showed separately at the spatial scale and the meteorological driving factors analysis was based on the green and blue wfs at different temporal scales excluding the effects of blue wf of delivery losses in the comparison between monthly et based on swat and mod 16 some of the et values differed from each other which may be due to the assumption that all farmland is maize and wheat rotation in this study even though fruit trees and vegetables are planted in some areas of the bid meanwhile the schedules of crop plant irrigation and harvest that are set in the swat are different with the actual values every year thus the crop growth periods do not completely correspond to the actual periods meaning the results contain certain errors precipitation had a positive effect on the blue wf of wheat production mainly because the actual irrigation water and irrigation schedules were not adjusted according to the actual precipitation other meteorological conditions and crop water requirements for example 2014 was a wet year meaning the increase in precipitation was accompanied by a much higher amount of irrigation water which over the dry year of 2008 46 the fluctuations of meteorological factors effect on the blue wf of wheat were greater than that of maize because the irrigation frequency and irrigation water of wheat were much greater than that of maize while there is a wintering period in which irrigation water exists in the field for a long time in different typical years the main meteorological factors that play key roles in the wfs of crops are not the same the promoting effect of these meteorological factors needs to be within a certain range otherwise there will be an inhibition effect and all factors act together on crop transpiration and growth development coupled with the interference of management operations e g irrigation and fertilization in irrigation districts resulting in a change in the main factors that play key roles in the wfs of crop production in different typical years the impact analysis on a daily scale was obtained from the daily wf corresponding to daily meteorological factors which was theoretically the most accurate on a monthly scale meteorological factors have the greatest effect and the average level is as high as several times that of the daily scale which is mainly caused by the significant change in meteorological factors between the months on a yearly scale the impact showed no obvious consistent change which is likely due to the fluctuation of meteorological factors will be greatly reduced and the obvious change between months will be weakened at the same time different meteorological factors have different effects on the wfs of maize and wheat at different temporal scales which also verified the necessity of separating maize and wheat to identify the meteorological factors when the wf of crop production of the best 10 of producers with the highest water productivity was set as the wf benchmark for the crop mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 found that the green blue wf benchmark of wheat was 592 m3 t 1 and that of maize was 503 m3 t 1 during 1996 2005 by contrast on a multi year average the maize production in bid are efficient and the wheat production have a little gap with efficient production however the wf of crop fluctuated every year for instance the wf of wheat production in 2013 exceeds the benchmark 15 because of the low unit yield compared with related research ding et al 2013 calculated the annual average crop water requirements of maize and wheat in the bid to be 469 mm and 447 mm respectively which were 219 mm and 258 mm in this study respectively this confirms that crop water consumption in the bid was far less than the crop water requirement which led to crop yield not reaching the optimal level the critical stages for the water demand of wheat are successively the returning green stage 140 160 days the jointing period 160 190 days and the wintering stage 70 140 days wang 2010 irrigation was carried out in the wintering stage and the jointing stage in the bid and water could be appropriately allocated for irrigation in the returning green stage to further improve crop yield at the same time crop varieties with high yield and good disease resistance are selected to increase crop yield as shown in fig 10 the irrigation water efficiency did not change significantly with an average of 54 which higher than the national average level but still exists an obvious gap with developed countries which was 70 90 zhu et al 2013 the blue wfs of maize and wheat accounted for 34 and 36 of the irrigation water supplies respectively on average meanwhile flood irrigation is mostly used in bid so micro irrigation e g drip irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation can be used according to the actual meteorological and production conditions to achieve precise irrigation and improve the water use efficiency appropriate tillage proper application and timing of manure or artificial fertilizer can manage the soil nutrients promote the absorption of water by crops and reduce the invalid evaporation mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 which effectively reduces the wf of crop production due to the lack of data like reservoir storage water surface area and discharge the swat model did not set the reservoirs in detail however the net irrigation quota used in the simulation including the irrigation water provided by the reservoirs therefore the influence of the reservoirs on the bid had been mainly considered in the hydrological cycle process because of the complex distribution of canal system and the lack of effective utilization coefficient of irrigation below the main canals the canal losses was assumed to allocate according to the ratio of canal length in each county to the total length subbasins were divided by pre defined streams because of the uncompleted irrigation systems in bid which leading to the division not be critically fitted with the boundary of irrigation district and its counties in the future research subbasins could be defined according to the actual situation field measured data can be used to improve the simulation accuracy and socio economical factors can be considered if the data available meanwhile the time scale effect existed in the grey wf wu et al 2021 in order to improve the evaluation of different types of water use in the irrigated area the grey wf and its effect on temporal scales can be further explored 4 conclusion by constructing a regional swat model and considering the water losses of canal delivery we quantified the wf of crop production in bid at daily monthly and yearly scales and analyzed the variations in wfs and associated meteorological factors the following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the method of wf of crop production established in the study can be applied to hydrological simulation of irrigated areas without drainage system 2 in general the green wf of maize was relatively higher from june to august seeding booting stage the lowest in september filling maturing stage the green wf of wheat from november to december tillering wintering stage and march to april returning green heading stage in the normal year was relatively large 3 the blue wfs of maize and wheat accounted for 34 and 36 of the irrigation water supplies respectively on average 4 the key meteorological factors that have an effect on the wf of crop production differ among typical years on a yearly scale precipitation has the greatest positive and negative impacts on the green and blue wf of maize respectively sunshine hours and temperature had the greatest negative and positive impacts on the green and blue wf of wheat respectively on the daily and monthly scales for maize production temperature and precipitation generated the largest positive and negative impact on green and blue wf in dry year whereas temperature and humidity both had the largest positive impacts on the green and blue wf in normal years respectively for the production of wheat humidity had the largest negative influence on the green wf in the dry year whereas sunshine hours had the greatest positive impact on the blue wf in the normal year 5 time scale effects existed in the influences of meteorological factors on the wf of crop production the calculation on the daily scale is the most accurate in theory yet the effect on the monthly scale has the maximum impact 6 the irrigation water

9984,in recent decades due to the water shortage around the world and the importance of groundwater in agriculture the role of water user associations wuas well known farmer associations that manage collective irrigation in agricultural districts in groundwater management has received much attention to ensure sustainable groundwater management in these organizations it is imperative to analyze the effects of the driving mechanisms such as the legal and institutional socio cultural social capital economic infrastructure and farmers participation factors on the collective management of agricultural water this study proposes a theoretical framework to analyze how and to what extent these factors influence agricultural water management in a case study of wuas of tafresh county iran where irrigated agriculture strongly relies on groundwater to validate this framework questionnaires with 53 questions indicators related to these factors have been supplied to 264 associated farmers and then statistically processed using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem methods the measurement model has confirmed the validity of the questionnaire the structural model has demonstrated that all the identified factors are significantly effective in driving the wuas performance this effectiveness was shown by the high indexes of reliability over 0 821 against an acceptance limit of 0 7 and convergent validity over 0 511 against a limit of 0 5 socio cultural and social capital factors had a higher impact confirmed by path coefficients of about 0 80 while the economic factors played a lower effect on groundwater management path coefficient of 0 534 moreover the pearson matrix showed statistically significant p 0 01 and positive r2 from 0 238 to 0 804 correlations among all the evaluated factors based on this framework some actions for improving the groundwater management at the collective level are suggested such as i the implementation of new water management technologies to increase the efficiency in extraction distribution and consumption of irrigation water ii strengthening the importance of social and cultural participation in the management of wuas in order to create formal and informal contexts for enhancing individual participation in the short and long term iii designing appropriate financing factors and diversification of

of several developing countries e g in the middle east north africa indian sub continent and self sufficiency in food production poverty reduction and adaptation to climate change in these countries aggarwal and singh 2010 connolly boutin and smit 2016 connor 2015 the effective use of irrigation water has a vital role in reducing the effects of water scarcity due to global warming kartal et al 2019 2020a b and allows increasing crop production efficiency at a low cost arslan et al 2019 in some countries low efficiency in agricultural water management is one of the most important reasons for water shortage due to a lack of infrastructure and suitable management systems grey and sadoff 2007 since the production units are mainly small scale and low income farms and much of the production is destined for self consumption these countries must face great food insecurity due to their crop production vulnerability this is the case of the arid and semi arid areas of middle east countries which suffer from a severe water deficit and are rich in a history of water wars biswas 2004 gürsoy and jacques 2014 for instance in iran s agricultural lands the dramatic water scarcity affecting the irrigated agriculture mainly depends on the inadequacy of the water distribution and irrigation systems due to infrastructural operation and organization inefficiency faramarzi et al 2010 it has been estimated that in iran nearly 90 of the food needs require 92 of the total freshwater resources and this country shows the lowest water productivity and economic efficiency among the middle east countries mesgaran et al 2017 zargan and waez mousavi 2016 the need to increase water productivity and the profitability of agricultural activities requires moving towards collective water management in many countries collective organizations such as irrigation associations cooperatives and farmer unions have been appointed of supplying conveying and distribution of water resources for irrigation their importance increases in areas where irrigation water is scarce kartal 2021 collective water management is often a forced solution when groundwater is the main water resource for irrigation in those areas with scarcity of surface water bodies gorton et al 2009 van steenbergen 2006 since the 1980s water resources management has progressively shifted from government centric to collective and participatory irrigation policies by non governmental organizations such as water user associations wuas and other private institutions in more than 60 countries including iran garces restrepo et al 2007 moreover the creation of associations to exploit groundwater has been encouraged in several national programs and laws lopez gunn and cortina 2006 wuas are worldwide well known types of farmers association that manage collective irrigation in agricultural districts the main purpose of these local organizations is the supply distribution and delivery of irrigation water to the associated farmers zema et al 2018a b often farmers participate in water management activities such as irrigation planning water allocation construction and maintenance of water facilities and this participation is believed to increase the overall infrastructural and economic performances of wuas arslan et al 2020 uysal and atış 2010 zema et al 2015 2019 according to burger 1998 and bosa 2015 if wuas are well managed the farmers coordinated activities add a surplus to individual management therefore wuas play a crucial role when groundwater management adopts a participatory approach connor 2015 pan and xu 2018 iran has a long and successful history in managing and allocating water in the agriculture sector but the participatory approaches are relatively young since wuas were first established in 1996 the efficiency of agricultural water management at the collective level depends on several factors such as the legislation farmers participation socio economic situation infrastructure and so on several pieces of research have highlighted the importance of some of these factors on the collective management in the irrigation sector and the related impacts of the management operations of wuas for sustainable water resources exploitation gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 nazari et al 2018 osooli et al 2011 pan and xu 2018 rezadoost and allahyari 2014 samian et al 2015 to summarize some of these studies in france rouillard and rinaudo 2020 assessed that formulation of water allocation by wuas improves the environmental economic and social performance of water management since users consider their local economic and social priorities the temporal and spatial dynamics of local groundwater resources as well as considering the efficiency and equity in water distribution in iran nazari et al 2018 identified the most critical factors of water management which mainly suffers from the low level of social factors lack of a comprehensive plan to prioritize social capital lack of sufficient economic and non economic incentives in agriculture and dependence of financial support on the government according to abdelgalil and bushara 2018 in sudan wuas fully participate in water distribution but partially contribute to financing provision concerning social capital nilsson et al 2012 stated that low social capital leads to less trust among members of farmers cooperatives which implies less participation and cooperation with an inability to solve collective action problems and hence severe impacts on the performance of the agricultural cooperatives the study conducted by gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 in uzbekistan tajikistan and the kyrgyz republic found that newly established institutional structures and internal activities in the irrigation field and other important factors including the farm profitability and a broader economic background have a decisive effect on overall irrigation performance however this large body of literature has so far investigated such impacts individually or limited the attention to no more than one or two factors in addition groundwater resources participatory management has been neglected therefore it is necessary to evaluate the comprehensive impacts of the socio cultural legal institutional infrastructural and economic factors driving groundwater management efficiency for irrigation purposes at the collective level a broader and better understanding of these factors and their sub elements is useful to prepare effective strategies to improve the collective management of groundwater in the irrigated croplands and more in general the overall wua s performances to fill this gap this study proposes a theoretical framework to analyze the factors that influence groundwater management in wuas this framework was tested between february and april 2020 in tafresh county iran where the wuas rely almost totally on groundwater management for irrigation through a farmer participatory approach but show the possibility of improvements in collective irrigation sustainability the proposed framework consists of the following steps i a preliminary investigation on the socio cultural and agricultural characteristics of the individual farms of the analyzed wuas ii identification of the management factors legal and institutional socio cultural social capital infrastructural economic and participatory that impact on groundwater management through questionnaires and iii statistical analysis based on partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem methods combining principal component analysis and multiple linear regression of the relationships among these factors and their effects on the wuas performance the two working hypotheses are the following i all the identified factors are significantly effective in driving groundwater management and ii all factors have direct and positive effects on each other 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and water user associations wuas tafresh county is located in the markazi province of iran about 222 km southwest of tehran the county consists of 101 villages with 3364 farmers surrounded by iran s central mountain crown from the east south and west fig 1 the average annual precipitation and temperature of the area are 303 mm and 13 4 c respectively the agriculture in markazi province is thriving thanks to the fertile soil the main herbaceous crops are wheat barley and alfalfa and the main fruit products include almonds walnuts apples cherries and grapes drought and frost in recent years have caused severe damage to the productions which in turn has brought economic hardship for farmers due to the small scale productions the studied wuas are thirty with a total of 914 associated farmers and cover a total area of 5853 km2 each wua has a board of five trustees who coordinate and oversee water management sci 2018 the cultivated area is split into 3571 plots each one of approximately 16 ha of these plots 661 plots are dryland 4500 ha while the remaining 2910 plots are irrigated 11 500 ha which shows the great importance of water in this area sci 2018 water is supplied and delivered to croplands by a total of 355 wells with depths from 20 up to more than 50 m 419 springs 285 permanent 134 seasonal and 324 qanats 240 active and 84 inactive a qanat is an underground canal that transports water from the aquifer or water well to the surface and lower lands farmers use the qanats based on a document of ownership and water right in circulation 2 2 the conceptual framework following the indications of literature khalkheili and zamani 2009 nazari et al 2018 pan and xu 2018 takayama et al 2018 the evaluation framework of factors influencing groundwater management in wuas proposed in this study consists of the following six categories fig 2 and table 1 1 legal and institutional factors 2 socio cultural factors 3 social capital factors 4 infrastructural factors 5 economic factors 6 participatory factors 2 2 1 legal and institutional factors the legal and institutional factors consist of institutionalization and approval of rules and regulations necessary for water users participation in the optimal irrigation network management joy 2007 these factors are based on the tragedy of the commons concept which was started by hardin 2009 according to this concept users of a common resource are unable to prioritize the collective interest over their benefits therefore the resource s position is constantly threatened by a behavioral response hardin also suggested that the common resource must be shared either between members or left to the government however this theory has not been accepted worldwide contrarily to hardin s theory ostrom 2010 showed that people with common sense are able to manage shared resources if rules have features which are defined authorities and responsibilities designed at the local level by using the knowledge of users transparent and acceptable to users and able to manage local conflicts and violations to ensure that all participants follow social rules local people will automatically be responsible for managing resources resulting in active participation in maintaining and making optimal use of shared resources ostrom 2010 schlager and lópez gunn 2006 2 2 2 socio cultural factors in order to manage and protect water resources special attention should be paid to personal characteristics and socio cultural factors that influence farmers intentions to adopt behaviors and technologies related to water protection huang et al 2016 these socio cultural factors consist of those relationships among the members of a local association who are engaged in communication educational and cultural activities related to the interests of that community these activities can establish a sense of social belonging and social motivation between members via their participatory actions and activities this can be considered as a catalyst for a sense of individual responsibility and ultimately greater social cooperation and participation which is an essential dimension of social capital in participatory irrigation management anselin and griffith 1988 chandran and chackacherry 2006 cicognani et al 2008 hayami 2009 nakano et al 2015 putnam 1995 1993 the result of this engagement in socio cultural activities is the success of any collective action that in the case of wuas improves their management abedi 2006 2 2 3 social capital factors the social capital factors consist of a formal and informal network along with common norms beliefs thoughts values and perceptions that can support the sustainability of natural resource management in communities at the local level in addition to appropriate technologies rasmussen and meinzen dick 1995 in this network simplified collaborations within and between groups based on mutual trust altruism goodwill sacrifice empathy and social interaction enable participants to be more effective in achieving common goals coleman 1988 durlauf 2002 hassanzadeh et al 2016 healy and côté 2001 putnam 1993 woolcock 1998 therefore by recognizing using and directing these social capitals in the desired direction it is possible to increase social interactions and help members active participation in wuas for groundwater management collier 2002 nilsson et al 2012 2 2 4 infrastructural factors the lack of adequate irrigation infrastructure and systems due to infrastructural and financial constraints worsens irrigation management s performance and leads to poor irrigation water efficiency the infrastructural factors consist of those irrigation factors that refer to the infrastructural managerial and financial participation of water users in proper maintenance and operation of irrigation and agricultural infrastructure these factors are important since the world s irrigation networks have been destroyed due to various reasons such as mismanagement the latter has weakened irrigation networks performance and reduced their useful life resulting in low irrigation water efficiency 2 2 5 economic factors the economic factors consist of those factors that are essential in strengthening the managerial capabilities of wuas control and provide irrigation services that in addition to sustainability and conservation of water resources lead to economic productivity facon 2000 peter 2004 2 2 6 participatory factors the overall efficiency of water resources management in irrigation areas is mainly influenced by improving the management environment and strengthening farmers participatory factors pan and xu 2018 the participatory factors consist of those factors linked to the public participation of stakeholders in water management which should lead to social development economic growth environmental stability and equal access to water which are critical goals of water resources management jingling et al 2010 perret et al 2006 according to pretty and ward 2001 people can properly manage water resources when they are collectively involved in managing that resource the benefits of farmers participation in resource management include reducing government spending on repairing and maintaining the infrastructure needed increasing the sense of ownership and responsibility improving farmers irrigation knowledge and water efficiency qiao et al 2009 2 3 validation of the evaluation framework in the case study 2 3 1 data collection in the present study the survey was carried out between february and april 2020 in tafresh county first a questionnaire was prepared to measure farmers aptitudes and opinions about the impact of the framework factors on groundwater management improvement in the wuas in tafresh county this questionnaire consisted of six questions hereinafter indicated also as indicators about legal institutional factors twelve for indicators socio cultural and twelve for social capital factors ten for participatory factors eight for infrastructural factors and five for economic factors table 1 this questionnaire was given to the target population n 914 consisting of tafresh county farmers to achieve the desired samples fitting the features of the farmers of tafresh county a simple two stage random sampling was used since the total statistical population of the study area was not clear cochran 1963 formula has been utilized to designate the sample size using the following equation n t 2 p q n n 1 d 2 t 2 p q where n is the size of the statistical population or the number of farmers t is the statistic considered at the 95 confidence level p and q are equal to 0 5 d is also the desired precision equal to 0 05 and n is the sample size therefore by employing this equation the desired sample size was determined as 270 to increase the accuracy of calculations we gathered 300 questionnaires through face to face in depth interviews of which 264 were fully completed furthermore to exclude any ambiguities in the wording of the questions we did a pilot survey at first for this purpose the questionnaire was provided to the members of the department of agricultural management and development of the university of tehran to test its reliability and efficacy and the suggestions given by the staff were included in the revised questionnaire another additional test for the questionnaire was carried out as a pilot of 30 farmers to remove possible ambiguities in the wording of questions 2 3 2 questionnaire characteristics the questionnaire consisted of two parts the first part contained the professional and socio economic characteristics of the individual farms farmers and the second part contained six classes of factors for a total of 53 indicators table 2 each question was quantitatively evaluated using the likert type scale with five points ranging from 1 very low to 5 very high likert scale questionnaires are the most commonly used type of instruments for measuring variables such as motivation and self efficacy since these questionnaires allow researchers to easily gather large amounts of data nemoto and beglar 2014 2 3 3 data processing each indicator was first analyzed by descriptive statistics mean standard deviation maximum and minimum values then a confirmatory factor analysis harrington 2009 was carried out to identify possible relationships between latent variables and confirm all model assumptions finally a pearson correlation analysis was adopted to evaluate the dependency levels among the variables and their reciprocal impacts the resulting correlation coefficients were evaluated using davis conventional description as follows davis 1971 poor 0 01 0 09 weak 0 10 0 29 medium 0 30 0 49 strong 0 50 0 69 very strong 0 70 this data analysis was carried out using smartpls software which also thanks to a user friendly graphical interface implements variance based structural equation modeling sem by the partial least squares pls path modeling method 2 3 4 confirmatory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis is a method based on quantitative data that examines the validity of a prior hypothesis mueller and hancock 2001 in applying this method to this study the underlying premises were the following each factor represents a latent variable that is a variable that cannot be directly measured but could be identified by tracing its effects on one or more observed variables alasuutari et al 2008 each latent variable is associated with observed variables i e the variables that can be measured directly in our case the indicators of each factor therefore the confirmatory factor analysis can be considered as a validation tool of the questionnaire and therefore it may represent the validity of a measurement model in other words the latter determines whether and how the latent variables can be measured in the form of a larger number of observed variables a structural model is also assumed which instead assesses the latent variables causal relationships schreiber et al 2006 in our study first the accuracy of the relationships in the measurement model was tested using reliability and validity criteria the fitting level of the measurement model to the questionnaire was assessed using a reliability index as well as convergent validity and divergent validity criteria the reliability index includes the ii cronbach s alpha cα ii composite reliability cr and iii ρ coefficient in more detail cα provides an estimate of reliability based on the internal correlation of the indicators if cα is greater than 0 7 the questionnaire indicators have a good internal correlation and are thus reliable hair et al 2016 cr is calculated according to the correlation of the individual factors the appropriate value of cr is above 0 7 hair et al 2016 ρ which is basically a coefficient of determination between the indicators must be over 0 7 as criteria to measure the convergent and divergent validity the average variance extracted ave and the fornell and larcker 1981 s criteria fal were used respectively the standard value of ave is above 0 5 henseler et al 2009 with regard to fal these authors suggested that the divergent validity is acceptable when the ave for each factor is higher than the shared variance between that factor and the other factors in the model this control is performed by a matrix in which each cell contains the correlation coefficient between the factor and the square root of the ave value of each factor after checking the reliability and validity of the measurement model the causal relationships between the factors the latent variables in the structural model were examined using three criteria i t values ii r2 and iii q2 or stone geyser stone criterion geisser 1974 stone 1974 in more detail if the t value is greater than 1 96 the relationship between the factors is accurate and thus the research hypotheses can be confirmed at the 95 confidence level r2 is used to connect both the measurement and structural models showing how predictive the structural model factors are chin 1998 introduces three values 0 19 0 33 and 0 67 for the criteria of r2 which indicate weak medium and strong prediction capacity for q2 or stone geisser criterion henseler et al 2009 suggested three values of 0 02 0 15 and 0 35 as weak moderate and strong predictive power respectively for the models overall fit the goodness of fit gof criterion as the geometric mean of the average communality and average r2 for all latent variables was used this criterion determines the overall predictive power of the large complex model by accounting for both measurement and structural parameters performance according to chin 2010 this indicator provides the pls model performance in both measurement and structural modeling with a focus on the overall performance of the model prediction tenenhaus et al 2004 and also indicates how much of the variability of the indicators are explained by the related factor akter et al 2011 gof is defined as 1 g o f a v e r 2 where the overlined symbols indicate the mean of the variables the gof is strong if higher than 0 36 acceptable if lower than 0 36 but higher than 0 25 and weak if lower than 0 25 akter et al 2011 wetzels et al 2009 finally the path coefficients or β values of the factors were examined to test our study s two main hypotheses the path coefficient analysis represents the dependent variable s response to a unit change in an explanatory variable when other variables in the model are kept constant a positive path coefficient means that a unit increase in the measure of one structure leads to a direct increase in the measure of structures it projects to which is proportional to the size of the coefficient conversely a negative coefficient means that an increase in the measure in one structure leads to a direct and proportional decrease in the measure of structures it projects to mclntosh and gonzalez lima 1994 all the coefficients and indicators calculated in this study except gof were directly calculated by smartpls software 2 3 5 pearson correlation analysis pearson analysis was targeted to evaluate what effect a factor plays on another factor and whether this effect is synergistic or not which is the purpose of the second hypothesis of this study to perform pearson correlation analysis the questionnaire s indicators were given scores and the correlation coefficients above the related factors were computed according to swinscow and campbell 2002 the correlation was considered very strong strong moderate modest or weak if the correlation coefficient is between 0 80 and 1 00 0 60 and 0 79 0 40 and 0 59 0 20 and 0 39 or 0 and 0 19 respectively 3 results 3 1 analysis of descriptive statistics the mean age of farmers was 54 years while their mean length of stay in their village was 49 4 years the farmers had a work experience of 21 1 years with the title of ordinary members of wuas for 21 years on average some farmers were on their board of trustees for on average 16 years each farmer worked on an average number of 7 7 plots of arable land with a mean area per plot of 0 48 ha the farms were of low income since their average income was about 19 million rials per year corresponding to about 456 dollars table 2 most of the farmers 76 9 had an undergraduate education less than a diploma in comparison only 7 5 had a bachelor s degree or higher education level agriculture was the main occupation 62 5 of the farmers while for the remaining part 37 5 it was a part time job the descriptive statistics about the structure of the wuas in tafresh county iran showed a long farmers experience managing wuas however farmers are getting old at the same time which indicates a decrease in generational substitution and a lack of inclination of the younger generation towards agriculture molina et al 2006 due to their low capacity for using updated knowledge the farmers have little motivation to transform the wuas structures according to modern science therefore the association of young human resources with higher education levels could be an occasion to renovate the structure of the existing wuas and the methods of water management since the farmers are in general smallholders the consequent great number and dispersion of plots are another factor of the poor agriculture productivity which the descriptive results have indicated therefore for reasons such as low production product fluctuations and input price in the marketplace a low income level has complained as a consequence of the wuas life farmers are less inclined to economic participate in improving water management due to income risks and financial weakness these results reflect a traditional small and illiterate community among farmers in tafresh county therefore local authorities should optimize their informal training methods for groundwater management following farmers characteristics and conditions kumar et al 2008 hence the first step may be the assessment of the educational needs of farmers such as familiarity with modern pressurized irrigation methods groundwater feeding methods familiarity with the principles of application of irrigation economics familiarity with how to use advanced irrigation equipment compatible with dispersion and small scale farming and familiarity with the water demands of agricultural products irrigation program and maintenance skills and the use of irrigation systems burton et al 2007 kaplan et al 2003 ojo et al 2011 rai and singh 2016 to carry out the training and transfer of professional knowledge of agricultural water management the principles of adult education from educational methods to high interaction such as face to face visits on farm demonstration and training workshops should be used otherwise training on issues related to agricultural water management could lose its efficiency and effectiveness 3 2 analysis of the questionnaires about the factors and indicators 3 2 1 legal and institutional factors clarifying the powers and responsibilities of government bodies in the water affairs the stability of water resources management laws and regulations and the legal status of wuas in the current laws were the first to third priority for the interviewed farmers while enhancing the water dispute resolution institutions between owners was the last choice table 3 3 2 2 socio cultural factors the questions of increase of trust between landowners improvement of farmer s awareness of procurement water distribution and collected fees and visiting the on farm demonstration ranked first to third respectively moreover helping to resolve local conflicts and disputes between landlords socially ethnically being native of a village etc and preventing inappropriate water extraction practices such as water theft were identified as the latest eleventh and twelfth priorities table 3 3 2 3 social capital factors from the farmers point of view the indicators increasing the trust between the members of wuas in water sharing and distribution the use of farmers views for water management decisions and increasing intimate meetings and conversations of members in the outside of the association were the most important ranks one to three by contrast the indicators contributing to resolving disagreements over daily irrigation issues increasing the trust of the board of trustees and landowners to the government and finally strengthening and exchanging water management information with the board of trustees were less important with the eleventh and twelfth priorities table 3 3 2 4 infrastructural factors according to table 3 faster construction of creeks canals and qanats the use of thin polyethylene films pipes for conveying water to the farm instead of the creek and the percentage of metallic water distribution valves along the waterway were considered the most important infrastructural factors while the indicator suitability of installation of valves along the waterway was in the last eighth rank 3 2 5 economic factors among the economic factors attracting state aid for the reconstruction of the qanat the amount of credit to cover and dredge the creeks qanats and canals and increasing farmers income ranked first to third respectively the indicator obtaining credit and banking facilities and receiving incentives such as tax breaks for active water companies was instead the fifth and last priority table 3 3 2 6 participatory factors the interviewed farmers were mainly involved in collecting the association s shared costs repairing and rebuilding valves and repairing and dredging creeks respectively first to the third rank conversely the level of cooperation of farmers with the water and agricultural organization to implement regulations and water management was the lowest tenth priority table 3 3 3 confirmatory factor analysis according to table 4 the values of the reliability and convergent validity indicators evaluated for each factor latent variable is over the acceptable limits as a matter of fact the minimum values of cα ρ and cr are is over 0 821 0 826 and 0 874 respectively thus all over 0 7 therefore we conclude that the measurement model is reliable for the research table 4 shows that ave whose minimum value was 0 511 is over the acceptance limit of 0 5 from table 5 it is evident that the square root of the ave value of each factor was higher than the squared variance between the factor and the other factors in the model therefore the convergent and divergent validities of the measurement model are proven all the t values of the relationships between the factors and indicators were higher than 1 96 fig 3 thus the corresponding relations are significant at the 95 confidence level moreover r2 is higher than 0 33 fig 4 and q2 is higher than 0 35 fig 5 therefore all these indicators measure with reliability the factors predicted in the questionnaire thus the relationship among the factors is accurate and the factors in the structural model show an acceptable predictive capacity confirming that the structural model has strong predictive power finally the overall fit of the model gof is equal to 0 51 and therefore it is higher than the critical point of 0 36 defined by wetzels et al 2009 the socio cultural and social capital factors had the highest path coefficients β 0 812 and 0 791 respectively within the factors related to groundwater management in contrast the economic factor β 0 534 had a minimum direct effect on groundwater management therefore the relationships among the groundwater management on one side and legal and institutional socio cultural social capital infrastructural economic and participatory factors on the other side were significant indicating that groundwater management is influenced directly and positively by all these factors table 6 3 4 pearson s matrix analysis the correlations between the groundwater management factors of wuas showing their reciprocal impact on each other were statistically confirmed at a 95 confidence level at p 0 01 the highest correlation coefficients were detected between the farmers participatory factor and the legal and institutional factor r 0 603 which can only be considered strong the other coefficients were lower and moderate only for the correlations among the farmers participation on one side and the social capital r 0 559 socio cultural r 0 535 and economic r 0 521 factors on the other side as well as for the couples of legal and institutional and economic factors r 0 553 social capital and socio cultural factors r 0 489 and socio cultural and infrastructural factors r 0 421 all the remaining correlations were modest or weak table 7 4 discussions among the institutional and legal factors the clarifying the powers and responsibilities of government bodies in the water affairs indicator was the first priority in our study since this factor regulates the effects of all duties and actions related to water whose clarity would be of interest for both the governance and water users the stability of water resources management laws and regulations second priority among the analyzed institutional and legal factors ensures a long lasting implementation of these laws among wuas and government organizations but also the sustainability of environmental resources in organized management of the irrigation networks boyer et al 2011 for instance irrigated agriculture in iran suffers from the aggressive use of water resources and wells continuous deepening this is mainly due to the knowledge of laws and regulations related to irrigation water management by those poor farmers whose only occupation is agriculture is not enough this insufficient knowledge can lead to the instability of water resources and agricultural production in this case the rules must be set in such a way as to prevent an exceeding extraction of water from wells compared to the permitted amounts which causes water shortage and instability of water resources nazari et al 2018 the legal status of wuas in the current laws is the third prioritized indicator within the institutional and legal factor because the associated farmers are aware of sufficient rights and powers to exercise management this awareness undoubtedly gives farmers a strong incentive to conserve water resources pan and xu 2018 as a result this leads to the provision of appropriate irrigation services sustainable use of water resources and irrigation facilities and the promotion of agricultural water productivity gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 finally the strengthening the water dispute resolution institutions between owners indicator which has been considered of great importance in the studies of speelman et al 2010 and boyer et al 2011 gained the last priority in our research presumably because to the high social capital among tafresh farmers they usually resolve disputes between themselves without asking for external help paying attention to socio cultural factors the farmers prioritized increasing the trust between landowners because a high trust in efficient groundwater management in farmers paves the way for cooperation and group actions among associated individuals who are satisfied with the various water management operations boyer et al 2011 this is confirmed by the high rank of the improving the farmer s awareness of procurement water distribution and collected fees indicator that was the second priority among the socio cultural factors the visit of the on farm demonstration indicator which was the third priority in this study leads the members of the associations to larger access to knowledge resources such as the modern irrigation methods samian et al 2015 towards optimal use of water and an increased farm production osooli et al 2011 preventing inappropriate water extraction practices such as water theft was the last priority among the socio cultural factors presumably due to the high security of farmers in this area and their close and friendly relations with each other concerning the social capital factors increasing the trust between the members of wuas in water sharing and distribution ranked the first priority because this commonality in agricultural water management leads to the creation of a dialog among the farmers and expansion of social relations with other people in the community biresaw 2019 nilsson et al 2012 rasmussen and meinzen dick 1995 this indicator s importance is further stressed by another indicator within the social capital factors increasing intimate meetings and conversations of members outside of the association that ranked as the third priority as a matter of fact the exchange of information between farmers can make their participation in water management more conscious also in the social life out of the work approaches takayama et al 2018 the use of farmers views for water management decisions is another crucial social capital indicator and it got the second priority because it makes the associated users aware of the benefits of decisions and requirements for the implementation of agricultural water management and encourages farmers to participate more actively in the implementation of these decisions on the other hand strengthening and exchanging water management information with the board of trustees was the last rank and thus is considered a less important factor this is a critical issue in the wuas and deserves more attention because the exchange of information among farmers and trustees would make farmers aware of the board s decisions and monitor and cooperate in implementing management actions moreover thanks to this information exchange board members could know the legal infrastructural economic and even social problems of farmers and make their own management decisions with more insight and effectiveness among the infrastructural factors the faster construction of creeks canals and qanats the use of thin polyethylene films pipes for conveying water to the farm instead of the creek and the percentage of metallic water distribution valves along the waterway are the first to third priority because all these actions ensure promptness in providing irrigation water to croplands reduces water losses for evaporation from free surface networks preventing water wastage and thus increasing water consumption efficiency in qanats and canals and avoiding lowering qanats these factors if implemented with effectiveness and promptness allow a significant increase in the volume of available water resources for the production cycle with a presumable improvement of quality and quantity of the agricultural production gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 rezadoost and allahyari 2014 samian et al 2015 the last priority attributed by farmers to the suitability of the installation of valves along the waterway is that most of the canals in this area are made of earth and irrigation uses surface methods that do not require valves there are farmers in the area who do not use modern irrigation equipment e g pressured networks with valves instead of free surface canals for economic reasons or lack of familiarity among the economic factors of water management attracting state aid for the reconstruction of the qanat the amount of credit to cover and dredge the creeks qanats and canals and increasing farmers income were first second and third priorities respectively and these results were somewhere expected improving the condition of aqueducts and irrigation canals enhances water access and distribution among farmers and ultimately increases the net worth of water resources wichelns 2002 however due to the high costs required by the improvement actions and the diffuse condition of low income smallholder for most of the farmers interviewed attracting financial assistance from the government increasing fund availability from the credit and saving part of product revenues for the renovation of qanats and irrigation canals are considered of the utmost importance obtaining credit and banking facilities and receiving incentives such as tax breaks for active water companies was the last priority although this would increase the level of welfare of farmers rezadoost and allahyari 2014 samian et al 2015 and lead to more investments in irrigation systems pan and xu 2018 however due to the very high costs of modernization of irrigation facilities and the lack of legal support in the financial support of water user organizations by the government the renovation of these canals and irrigation equipment and its financing by the government was the first priority according to the iranian laws about the wuas support policies it is stipulated that to invest in infrastructures 0 85 of the expenses should be provided by the government and the remaining 0 15 by the wuas members however based on the agricultural organization experts comments in tafresh county and the landlords the government will cover about 40 or more of the repair costs as much as possible and the rest will be the responsibility of the wuas members although in the case of a government budget deficit all estimated costs will be covered by the owners therefore it takes precedence over tax incentives and incentives for farmers especially due to the high administrative bureaucracy in iran and lack of knowledge about the benefits of tax breaks access to banking facilities and tax exemptions is difficult for the old and illiterate farmers of the county the outcomes of interviews about the prioritization of farmers participatory factors show that collecting the association s shared costs first priority repairing and rebuilding valves second priority and repairing and dredging creeks third priority is of the highest importance in agricultural water management for farmers since low government budgets and facilities do not cover the high costs of water management strengthening farmers participation in reconstruction and improvement of the irrigation systems also by a personal involvement through the provision of infrastructural services including the family working would lead to the enhancement of the irrigation performance increase in the operational efficiency of wuas and finally improvement of water management in wuas moreover an efficient collection of due water fees as payment of the irrigation service provided by wuas is considered essential to fund the wuas and this is in close accordance with the results of the studies carried out elsewhere zema et al 2018a b 2015 which demonstrated how the financial self sufficiency of wuas is able to ensure an efficient collective irrigation service cooperation of farmers with the water and agricultural organization to implement regulations related to water management was the last priority of these factors presumably due to the lack of farmers knowledge of the related benefits the confirmatory factor analysis to test the main hypothesis revealed that all factors positively and significantly affect groundwater management among these factors based on the sem results socio cultural social capital participatory legal and institutional infrastructural and economic factors have the greatest impact respectively as a result the main hypothesis that these factors improve groundwater management can be confirmed however the relationships among these factors show that the county infrastructural current agricultural situation is not a favorable environment for implementing efficient and desirable water management and this situation requires more attention and a particular focus on these factors boyer et al 2011 more specifically precise planning to strengthen socio cultural and improve social capital relations among farmers creation of economic incentives and financial and credit support from relevant agencies solving problems and inadequacies of irrigation systems the infrastructural and principled maintenance of irrigation networks through increased participation of users and a more efficient water fee collection from the associated farmers could be suggested by this analysis to improve groundwater management and the sustainability of wuas nazari et al 2018 osooli et al 2011 pan and xu 2018 on the other hand social capital and legal and institutional factors among farmers must be renovated to avoid gradual obsolescence and inefficiency with the implementation of formal education in the local communities as stated by some relevant studies about the impacts of social capital factors on the improvement of water resources systems akolgo and ayentimi 2020 moreover according to khalkheili and zamani 2009 social factors are not related to farmers participation regarding the impact of economic factors undoubtedly all factors may indirectly affect water management zema et al 2020 but the analysis of the indirect relations among these factors went beyond the scope of our study for instance it should be important to analyze whether all factors affect groundwater management through the economic factor which would require separate and more complete research pearson correlation analysis which tested the second hypothesis that all factors would directly and positively affect each other and showed significant relationships among all six factors showed significant relationships between all six factors it should be noted that the correlation coefficient between two variables can show the type and extent of the relationship between the two variables linearly but cannot be used to show the effect of one variable on another variable however we find that the results of this test give wuas the ability to make more informed decisions to improve water management in wuas by knowing the degree of correlation between the factors shown in the research framework it also gives managers the ability to predict changes in other variables by examining changes in each model factor the critical point is the degree of correlation and strong relationship between participatory and the legal and institutional factors this relationship points out that in order to better promote water management in wuas and improve their performance in water management planning politicians must invest more than anything else in the legal and institutional and participatory factors overall the confirmation of both working hypotheses suggests comprehensive attention to all the evaluated factors as a management strategy to enhance the optimal management of agricultural water in wuas 5 conclusions the study has shown that in the wuas of tafresh county iran the legal and institutional socio cultural social capital infrastructural factors as well as the farmers participation not only are strongly interrelated but are also able to improve groundwater management the analysis of the indicators nested into these factors has indicated the need for actions to strengthen an efficient use and share of irrigation resources which should be implemented according to the priorities socio cultural social capital participatory legal and institutional infrastructural economic factors as given by the confirmatory factor analysis therefore from this study it is evident that in the case study the prerequisites for improving the management of the wuas are basically four i providing members with new water management technologies that can be provided directly or through the government in order to increase the efficiency in extraction distribution and consumption of irrigation water ii strengthening the role and importance of social and cultural participation in the management of wuas through a better understanding of the barriers to the social involvement and the impact of cultural capital in order to create formal and informal contexts for enhancing individual participation in the short and long term iii designing appropriate financing factors and diversification of the sources of revenue to execute projects on shared water resources vi involving young human resources with higher education levels into the existing wuas and agricultural water management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9984,in recent decades due to the water shortage around the world and the importance of groundwater in agriculture the role of water user associations wuas well known farmer associations that manage collective irrigation in agricultural districts in groundwater management has received much attention to ensure sustainable groundwater management in these organizations it is imperative to analyze the effects of the driving mechanisms such as the legal and institutional socio cultural social capital economic infrastructure and farmers participation factors on the collective management of agricultural water this study proposes a theoretical framework to analyze how and to what extent these factors influence agricultural water management in a case study of wuas of tafresh county iran where irrigated agriculture strongly relies on groundwater to validate this framework questionnaires with 53 questions indicators related to these factors have been supplied to 264 associated farmers and then statistically processed using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem methods the measurement model has confirmed the validity of the questionnaire the structural model has demonstrated that all the identified factors are significantly effective in driving the wuas performance this effectiveness was shown by the high indexes of reliability over 0 821 against an acceptance limit of 0 7 and convergent validity over 0 511 against a limit of 0 5 socio cultural and social capital factors had a higher impact confirmed by path coefficients of about 0 80 while the economic factors played a lower effect on groundwater management path coefficient of 0 534 moreover the pearson matrix showed statistically significant p 0 01 and positive r2 from 0 238 to 0 804 correlations among all the evaluated factors based on this framework some actions for improving the groundwater management at the collective level are suggested such as i the implementation of new water management technologies to increase the efficiency in extraction distribution and consumption of irrigation water ii strengthening the importance of social and cultural participation in the management of wuas in order to create formal and informal contexts for enhancing individual participation in the short and long term iii designing appropriate financing factors and diversification of the sources of revenue to execute projects on shared water resources keywords collective irrigation legal and institutional factors socio cultural factors social capital factors economic factors infrastructural factors farmers participation factors partial least squares structural equation modeling 1 introduction water availability plays a vital role in the development of agricultural lands of several developing countries e g in the middle east north africa indian sub continent and self sufficiency in food production poverty reduction and adaptation to climate change in these countries aggarwal and singh 2010 connolly boutin and smit 2016 connor 2015 the effective use of irrigation water has a vital role in reducing the effects of water scarcity due to global warming kartal et al 2019 2020a b and allows increasing crop production efficiency at a low cost arslan et al 2019 in some countries low efficiency in agricultural water management is one of the most important reasons for water shortage due to a lack of infrastructure and suitable management systems grey and sadoff 2007 since the production units are mainly small scale and low income farms and much of the production is destined for self consumption these countries must face great food insecurity due to their crop production vulnerability this is the case of the arid and semi arid areas of middle east countries which suffer from a severe water deficit and are rich in a history of water wars biswas 2004 gürsoy and jacques 2014 for instance in iran s agricultural lands the dramatic water scarcity affecting the irrigated agriculture mainly depends on the inadequacy of the water distribution and irrigation systems due to infrastructural operation and organization inefficiency faramarzi et al 2010 it has been estimated that in iran nearly 90 of the food needs require 92 of the total freshwater resources and this country shows the lowest water productivity and economic efficiency among the middle east countries mesgaran et al 2017 zargan and waez mousavi 2016 the need to increase water productivity and the profitability of agricultural activities requires moving towards collective water management in many countries collective organizations such as irrigation associations cooperatives and farmer unions have been appointed of supplying conveying and distribution of water resources for irrigation their importance increases in areas where irrigation water is scarce kartal 2021 collective water management is often a forced solution when groundwater is the main water resource for irrigation in those areas with scarcity of surface water bodies gorton et al 2009 van steenbergen 2006 since the 1980s water resources management has progressively shifted from government centric to collective and participatory irrigation policies by non governmental organizations such as water user associations wuas and other private institutions in more than 60 countries including iran garces restrepo et al 2007 moreover the creation of associations to exploit groundwater has been encouraged in several national programs and laws lopez gunn and cortina 2006 wuas are worldwide well known types of farmers association that manage collective irrigation in agricultural districts the main purpose of these local organizations is the supply distribution and delivery of irrigation water to the associated farmers zema et al 2018a b often farmers participate in water management activities such as irrigation planning water allocation construction and maintenance of water facilities and this participation is believed to increase the overall infrastructural and economic performances of wuas arslan et al 2020 uysal and atış 2010 zema et al 2015 2019 according to burger 1998 and bosa 2015 if wuas are well managed the farmers coordinated activities add a surplus to individual management therefore wuas play a crucial role when groundwater management adopts a participatory approach connor 2015 pan and xu 2018 iran has a long and successful history in managing and allocating water in the agriculture sector but the participatory approaches are relatively young since wuas were first established in 1996 the efficiency of agricultural water management at the collective level depends on several factors such as the legislation farmers participation socio economic situation infrastructure and so on several pieces of research have highlighted the importance of some of these factors on the collective management in the irrigation sector and the related impacts of the management operations of wuas for sustainable water resources exploitation gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 nazari et al 2018 osooli et al 2011 pan and xu 2018 rezadoost and allahyari 2014 samian et al 2015 to summarize some of these studies in france rouillard and rinaudo 2020 assessed that formulation of water allocation by wuas improves the environmental economic and social performance of water management since users consider their local economic and social priorities the temporal and spatial dynamics of local groundwater resources as well as considering the efficiency and equity in water distribution in iran nazari et al 2018 identified the most critical factors of water management which mainly suffers from the low level of social factors lack of a comprehensive plan to prioritize social capital lack of sufficient economic and non economic incentives in agriculture and dependence of financial support on the government according to abdelgalil and bushara 2018 in sudan wuas fully participate in water distribution but partially contribute to financing provision concerning social capital nilsson et al 2012 stated that low social capital leads to less trust among members of farmers cooperatives which implies less participation and cooperation with an inability to solve collective action problems and hence severe impacts on the performance of the agricultural cooperatives the study conducted by gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 in uzbekistan tajikistan and the kyrgyz republic found that newly established institutional structures and internal activities in the irrigation field and other important factors including the farm profitability and a broader economic background have a decisive effect on overall irrigation performance however this large body of literature has so far investigated such impacts individually or limited the attention to no more than one or two factors in addition groundwater resources participatory management has been neglected therefore it is necessary to evaluate the comprehensive impacts of the socio cultural legal institutional infrastructural and economic factors driving groundwater management efficiency for irrigation purposes at the collective level a broader and better understanding of these factors and their sub elements is useful to prepare effective strategies to improve the collective management of groundwater in the irrigated croplands and more in general the overall wua s performances to fill this gap this study proposes a theoretical framework to analyze the factors that influence groundwater management in wuas this framework was tested between february and april 2020 in tafresh county iran where the wuas rely almost totally on groundwater management for irrigation through a farmer participatory approach but show the possibility of improvements in collective irrigation sustainability the proposed framework consists of the following steps i a preliminary investigation on the socio cultural and agricultural characteristics of the individual farms of the analyzed wuas ii identification of the management factors legal and institutional socio cultural social capital infrastructural economic and participatory that impact on groundwater management through questionnaires and iii statistical analysis based on partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem methods combining principal component analysis and multiple linear regression of the relationships among these factors and their effects on the wuas performance the two working hypotheses are the following i all the identified factors are significantly effective in driving groundwater management and ii all factors have direct and positive effects on each other 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and water user associations wuas tafresh county is located in the markazi province of iran about 222 km southwest of tehran the county consists of 101 villages with 3364 farmers surrounded by iran s central mountain crown from the east south and west fig 1 the average annual precipitation and temperature of the area are 303 mm and 13 4 c respectively the agriculture in markazi province is thriving thanks to the fertile soil the main herbaceous crops are wheat barley and alfalfa and the main fruit products include almonds walnuts apples cherries and grapes drought and frost in recent years have caused severe damage to the productions which in turn has brought economic hardship for farmers due to the small scale productions the studied wuas are thirty with a total of 914 associated farmers and cover a total area of 5853 km2 each wua has a board of five trustees who coordinate and oversee water management sci 2018 the cultivated area is split into 3571 plots each one of approximately 16 ha of these plots 661 plots are dryland 4500 ha while the remaining 2910 plots are irrigated 11 500 ha which shows the great importance of water in this area sci 2018 water is supplied and delivered to croplands by a total of 355 wells with depths from 20 up to more than 50 m 419 springs 285 permanent 134 seasonal and 324 qanats 240 active and 84 inactive a qanat is an underground canal that transports water from the aquifer or water well to the surface and lower lands farmers use the qanats based on a document of ownership and water right in circulation 2 2 the conceptual framework following the indications of literature khalkheili and zamani 2009 nazari et al 2018 pan and xu 2018 takayama et al 2018 the evaluation framework of factors influencing groundwater management in wuas proposed in this study consists of the following six categories fig 2 and table 1 1 legal and institutional factors 2 socio cultural factors 3 social capital factors 4 infrastructural factors 5 economic factors 6 participatory factors 2 2 1 legal and institutional factors the legal and institutional factors consist of institutionalization and approval of rules and regulations necessary for water users participation in the optimal irrigation network management joy 2007 these factors are based on the tragedy of the commons concept which was started by hardin 2009 according to this concept users of a common resource are unable to prioritize the collective interest over their benefits therefore the resource s position is constantly threatened by a behavioral response hardin also suggested that the common resource must be shared either between members or left to the government however this theory has not been accepted worldwide contrarily to hardin s theory ostrom 2010 showed that people with common sense are able to manage shared resources if rules have features which are defined authorities and responsibilities designed at the local level by using the knowledge of users transparent and acceptable to users and able to manage local conflicts and violations to ensure that all participants follow social rules local people will automatically be responsible for managing resources resulting in active participation in maintaining and making optimal use of shared resources ostrom 2010 schlager and lópez gunn 2006 2 2 2 socio cultural factors in order to manage and protect water resources special attention should be paid to personal characteristics and socio cultural factors that influence farmers intentions to adopt behaviors and technologies related to water protection huang et al 2016 these socio cultural factors consist of those relationships among the members of a local association who are engaged in communication educational and cultural activities related to the interests of that community these activities can establish a sense of social belonging and social motivation between members via their participatory actions and activities this can be considered as a catalyst for a sense of individual responsibility and ultimately greater social cooperation and participation which is an essential dimension of social capital in participatory irrigation management anselin and griffith 1988 chandran and chackacherry 2006 cicognani et al 2008 hayami 2009 nakano et al 2015 putnam 1995 1993 the result of this engagement in socio cultural activities is the success of any collective action that in the case of wuas improves their management abedi 2006 2 2 3 social capital factors the social capital factors consist of a formal and informal network along with common norms beliefs thoughts values and perceptions that can support the sustainability of natural resource management in communities at the local level in addition to appropriate technologies rasmussen and meinzen dick 1995 in this network simplified collaborations within and between groups based on mutual trust altruism goodwill sacrifice empathy and social interaction enable participants to be more effective in achieving common goals coleman 1988 durlauf 2002 hassanzadeh et al 2016 healy and côté 2001 putnam 1993 woolcock 1998 therefore by recognizing using and directing these social capitals in the desired direction it is possible to increase social interactions and help members active participation in wuas for groundwater management collier 2002 nilsson et al 2012 2 2 4 infrastructural factors the lack of adequate irrigation infrastructure and systems due to infrastructural and financial constraints worsens irrigation management s performance and leads to poor irrigation water efficiency the infrastructural factors consist of those irrigation factors that refer to the infrastructural managerial and financial participation of water users in proper maintenance and operation of irrigation and agricultural infrastructure these factors are important since the world s irrigation networks have been destroyed due to various reasons such as mismanagement the latter has weakened irrigation networks performance and reduced their useful life resulting in low irrigation water efficiency 2 2 5 economic factors the economic factors consist of those factors that are essential in strengthening the managerial capabilities of wuas control and provide irrigation services that in addition to sustainability and conservation of water resources lead to economic productivity facon 2000 peter 2004 2 2 6 participatory factors the overall efficiency of water resources management in irrigation areas is mainly influenced by improving the management environment and strengthening farmers participatory factors pan and xu 2018 the participatory factors consist of those factors linked to the public participation of stakeholders in water management which should lead to social development economic growth environmental stability and equal access to water which are critical goals of water resources management jingling et al 2010 perret et al 2006 according to pretty and ward 2001 people can properly manage water resources when they are collectively involved in managing that resource the benefits of farmers participation in resource management include reducing government spending on repairing and maintaining the infrastructure needed increasing the sense of ownership and responsibility improving farmers irrigation knowledge and water efficiency qiao et al 2009 2 3 validation of the evaluation framework in the case study 2 3 1 data collection in the present study the survey was carried out between february and april 2020 in tafresh county first a questionnaire was prepared to measure farmers aptitudes and opinions about the impact of the framework factors on groundwater management improvement in the wuas in tafresh county this questionnaire consisted of six questions hereinafter indicated also as indicators about legal institutional factors twelve for indicators socio cultural and twelve for social capital factors ten for participatory factors eight for infrastructural factors and five for economic factors table 1 this questionnaire was given to the target population n 914 consisting of tafresh county farmers to achieve the desired samples fitting the features of the farmers of tafresh county a simple two stage random sampling was used since the total statistical population of the study area was not clear cochran 1963 formula has been utilized to designate the sample size using the following equation n t 2 p q n n 1 d 2 t 2 p q where n is the size of the statistical population or the number of farmers t is the statistic considered at the 95 confidence level p and q are equal to 0 5 d is also the desired precision equal to 0 05 and n is the sample size therefore by employing this equation the desired sample size was determined as 270 to increase the accuracy of calculations we gathered 300 questionnaires through face to face in depth interviews of which 264 were fully completed furthermore to exclude any ambiguities in the wording of the questions we did a pilot survey at first for this purpose the questionnaire was provided to the members of the department of agricultural management and development of the university of tehran to test its reliability and efficacy and the suggestions given by the staff were included in the revised questionnaire another additional test for the questionnaire was carried out as a pilot of 30 farmers to remove possible ambiguities in the wording of questions 2 3 2 questionnaire characteristics the questionnaire consisted of two parts the first part contained the professional and socio economic characteristics of the individual farms farmers and the second part contained six classes of factors for a total of 53 indicators table 2 each question was quantitatively evaluated using the likert type scale with five points ranging from 1 very low to 5 very high likert scale questionnaires are the most commonly used type of instruments for measuring variables such as motivation and self efficacy since these questionnaires allow researchers to easily gather large amounts of data nemoto and beglar 2014 2 3 3 data processing each indicator was first analyzed by descriptive statistics mean standard deviation maximum and minimum values then a confirmatory factor analysis harrington 2009 was carried out to identify possible relationships between latent variables and confirm all model assumptions finally a pearson correlation analysis was adopted to evaluate the dependency levels among the variables and their reciprocal impacts the resulting correlation coefficients were evaluated using davis conventional description as follows davis 1971 poor 0 01 0 09 weak 0 10 0 29 medium 0 30 0 49 strong 0 50 0 69 very strong 0 70 this data analysis was carried out using smartpls software which also thanks to a user friendly graphical interface implements variance based structural equation modeling sem by the partial least squares pls path modeling method 2 3 4 confirmatory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis is a method based on quantitative data that examines the validity of a prior hypothesis mueller and hancock 2001 in applying this method to this study the underlying premises were the following each factor represents a latent variable that is a variable that cannot be directly measured but could be identified by tracing its effects on one or more observed variables alasuutari et al 2008 each latent variable is associated with observed variables i e the variables that can be measured directly in our case the indicators of each factor therefore the confirmatory factor analysis can be considered as a validation tool of the questionnaire and therefore it may represent the validity of a measurement model in other words the latter determines whether and how the latent variables can be measured in the form of a larger number of observed variables a structural model is also assumed which instead assesses the latent variables causal relationships schreiber et al 2006 in our study first the accuracy of the relationships in the measurement model was tested using reliability and validity criteria the fitting level of the measurement model to the questionnaire was assessed using a reliability index as well as convergent validity and divergent validity criteria the reliability index includes the ii cronbach s alpha cα ii composite reliability cr and iii ρ coefficient in more detail cα provides an estimate of reliability based on the internal correlation of the indicators if cα is greater than 0 7 the questionnaire indicators have a good internal correlation and are thus reliable hair et al 2016 cr is calculated according to the correlation of the individual factors the appropriate value of cr is above 0 7 hair et al 2016 ρ which is basically a coefficient of determination between the indicators must be over 0 7 as criteria to measure the convergent and divergent validity the average variance extracted ave and the fornell and larcker 1981 s criteria fal were used respectively the standard value of ave is above 0 5 henseler et al 2009 with regard to fal these authors suggested that the divergent validity is acceptable when the ave for each factor is higher than the shared variance between that factor and the other factors in the model this control is performed by a matrix in which each cell contains the correlation coefficient between the factor and the square root of the ave value of each factor after checking the reliability and validity of the measurement model the causal relationships between the factors the latent variables in the structural model were examined using three criteria i t values ii r2 and iii q2 or stone geyser stone criterion geisser 1974 stone 1974 in more detail if the t value is greater than 1 96 the relationship between the factors is accurate and thus the research hypotheses can be confirmed at the 95 confidence level r2 is used to connect both the measurement and structural models showing how predictive the structural model factors are chin 1998 introduces three values 0 19 0 33 and 0 67 for the criteria of r2 which indicate weak medium and strong prediction capacity for q2 or stone geisser criterion henseler et al 2009 suggested three values of 0 02 0 15 and 0 35 as weak moderate and strong predictive power respectively for the models overall fit the goodness of fit gof criterion as the geometric mean of the average communality and average r2 for all latent variables was used this criterion determines the overall predictive power of the large complex model by accounting for both measurement and structural parameters performance according to chin 2010 this indicator provides the pls model performance in both measurement and structural modeling with a focus on the overall performance of the model prediction tenenhaus et al 2004 and also indicates how much of the variability of the indicators are explained by the related factor akter et al 2011 gof is defined as 1 g o f a v e r 2 where the overlined symbols indicate the mean of the variables the gof is strong if higher than 0 36 acceptable if lower than 0 36 but higher than 0 25 and weak if lower than 0 25 akter et al 2011 wetzels et al 2009 finally the path coefficients or β values of the factors were examined to test our study s two main hypotheses the path coefficient analysis represents the dependent variable s response to a unit change in an explanatory variable when other variables in the model are kept constant a positive path coefficient means that a unit increase in the measure of one structure leads to a direct increase in the measure of structures it projects to which is proportional to the size of the coefficient conversely a negative coefficient means that an increase in the measure in one structure leads to a direct and proportional decrease in the measure of structures it projects to mclntosh and gonzalez lima 1994 all the coefficients and indicators calculated in this study except gof were directly calculated by smartpls software 2 3 5 pearson correlation analysis pearson analysis was targeted to evaluate what effect a factor plays on another factor and whether this effect is synergistic or not which is the purpose of the second hypothesis of this study to perform pearson correlation analysis the questionnaire s indicators were given scores and the correlation coefficients above the related factors were computed according to swinscow and campbell 2002 the correlation was considered very strong strong moderate modest or weak if the correlation coefficient is between 0 80 and 1 00 0 60 and 0 79 0 40 and 0 59 0 20 and 0 39 or 0 and 0 19 respectively 3 results 3 1 analysis of descriptive statistics the mean age of farmers was 54 years while their mean length of stay in their village was 49 4 years the farmers had a work experience of 21 1 years with the title of ordinary members of wuas for 21 years on average some farmers were on their board of trustees for on average 16 years each farmer worked on an average number of 7 7 plots of arable land with a mean area per plot of 0 48 ha the farms were of low income since their average income was about 19 million rials per year corresponding to about 456 dollars table 2 most of the farmers 76 9 had an undergraduate education less than a diploma in comparison only 7 5 had a bachelor s degree or higher education level agriculture was the main occupation 62 5 of the farmers while for the remaining part 37 5 it was a part time job the descriptive statistics about the structure of the wuas in tafresh county iran showed a long farmers experience managing wuas however farmers are getting old at the same time which indicates a decrease in generational substitution and a lack of inclination of the younger generation towards agriculture molina et al 2006 due to their low capacity for using updated knowledge the farmers have little motivation to transform the wuas structures according to modern science therefore the association of young human resources with higher education levels could be an occasion to renovate the structure of the existing wuas and the methods of water management since the farmers are in general smallholders the consequent great number and dispersion of plots are another factor of the poor agriculture productivity which the descriptive results have indicated therefore for reasons such as low production product fluctuations and input price in the marketplace a low income level has complained as a consequence of the wuas life farmers are less inclined to economic participate in improving water management due to income risks and financial weakness these results reflect a traditional small and illiterate community among farmers in tafresh county therefore local authorities should optimize their informal training methods for groundwater management following farmers characteristics and conditions kumar et al 2008 hence the first step may be the assessment of the educational needs of farmers such as familiarity with modern pressurized irrigation methods groundwater feeding methods familiarity with the principles of application of irrigation economics familiarity with how to use advanced irrigation equipment compatible with dispersion and small scale farming and familiarity with the water demands of agricultural products irrigation program and maintenance skills and the use of irrigation systems burton et al 2007 kaplan et al 2003 ojo et al 2011 rai and singh 2016 to carry out the training and transfer of professional knowledge of agricultural water management the principles of adult education from educational methods to high interaction such as face to face visits on farm demonstration and training workshops should be used otherwise training on issues related to agricultural water management could lose its efficiency and effectiveness 3 2 analysis of the questionnaires about the factors and indicators 3 2 1 legal and institutional factors clarifying the powers and responsibilities of government bodies in the water affairs the stability of water resources management laws and regulations and the legal status of wuas in the current laws were the first to third priority for the interviewed farmers while enhancing the water dispute resolution institutions between owners was the last choice table 3 3 2 2 socio cultural factors the questions of increase of trust between landowners improvement of farmer s awareness of procurement water distribution and collected fees and visiting the on farm demonstration ranked first to third respectively moreover helping to resolve local conflicts and disputes between landlords socially ethnically being native of a village etc and preventing inappropriate water extraction practices such as water theft were identified as the latest eleventh and twelfth priorities table 3 3 2 3 social capital factors from the farmers point of view the indicators increasing the trust between the members of wuas in water sharing and distribution the use of farmers views for water management decisions and increasing intimate meetings and conversations of members in the outside of the association were the most important ranks one to three by contrast the indicators contributing to resolving disagreements over daily irrigation issues increasing the trust of the board of trustees and landowners to the government and finally strengthening and exchanging water management information with the board of trustees were less important with the eleventh and twelfth priorities table 3 3 2 4 infrastructural factors according to table 3 faster construction of creeks canals and qanats the use of thin polyethylene films pipes for conveying water to the farm instead of the creek and the percentage of metallic water distribution valves along the waterway were considered the most important infrastructural factors while the indicator suitability of installation of valves along the waterway was in the last eighth rank 3 2 5 economic factors among the economic factors attracting state aid for the reconstruction of the qanat the amount of credit to cover and dredge the creeks qanats and canals and increasing farmers income ranked first to third respectively the indicator obtaining credit and banking facilities and receiving incentives such as tax breaks for active water companies was instead the fifth and last priority table 3 3 2 6 participatory factors the interviewed farmers were mainly involved in collecting the association s shared costs repairing and rebuilding valves and repairing and dredging creeks respectively first to the third rank conversely the level of cooperation of farmers with the water and agricultural organization to implement regulations and water management was the lowest tenth priority table 3 3 3 confirmatory factor analysis according to table 4 the values of the reliability and convergent validity indicators evaluated for each factor latent variable is over the acceptable limits as a matter of fact the minimum values of cα ρ and cr are is over 0 821 0 826 and 0 874 respectively thus all over 0 7 therefore we conclude that the measurement model is reliable for the research table 4 shows that ave whose minimum value was 0 511 is over the acceptance limit of 0 5 from table 5 it is evident that the square root of the ave value of each factor was higher than the squared variance between the factor and the other factors in the model therefore the convergent and divergent validities of the measurement model are proven all the t values of the relationships between the factors and indicators were higher than 1 96 fig 3 thus the corresponding relations are significant at the 95 confidence level moreover r2 is higher than 0 33 fig 4 and q2 is higher than 0 35 fig 5 therefore all these indicators measure with reliability the factors predicted in the questionnaire thus the relationship among the factors is accurate and the factors in the structural model show an acceptable predictive capacity confirming that the structural model has strong predictive power finally the overall fit of the model gof is equal to 0 51 and therefore it is higher than the critical point of 0 36 defined by wetzels et al 2009 the socio cultural and social capital factors had the highest path coefficients β 0 812 and 0 791 respectively within the factors related to groundwater management in contrast the economic factor β 0 534 had a minimum direct effect on groundwater management therefore the relationships among the groundwater management on one side and legal and institutional socio cultural social capital infrastructural economic and participatory factors on the other side were significant indicating that groundwater management is influenced directly and positively by all these factors table 6 3 4 pearson s matrix analysis the correlations between the groundwater management factors of wuas showing their reciprocal impact on each other were statistically confirmed at a 95 confidence level at p 0 01 the highest correlation coefficients were detected between the farmers participatory factor and the legal and institutional factor r 0 603 which can only be considered strong the other coefficients were lower and moderate only for the correlations among the farmers participation on one side and the social capital r 0 559 socio cultural r 0 535 and economic r 0 521 factors on the other side as well as for the couples of legal and institutional and economic factors r 0 553 social capital and socio cultural factors r 0 489 and socio cultural and infrastructural factors r 0 421 all the remaining correlations were modest or weak table 7 4 discussions among the institutional and legal factors the clarifying the powers and responsibilities of government bodies in the water affairs indicator was the first priority in our study since this factor regulates the effects of all duties and actions related to water whose clarity would be of interest for both the governance and water users the stability of water resources management laws and regulations second priority among the analyzed institutional and legal factors ensures a long lasting implementation of these laws among wuas and government organizations but also the sustainability of environmental resources in organized management of the irrigation networks boyer et al 2011 for instance irrigated agriculture in iran suffers from the aggressive use of water resources and wells continuous deepening this is mainly due to the knowledge of laws and regulations related to irrigation water management by those poor farmers whose only occupation is agriculture is not enough this insufficient knowledge can lead to the instability of water resources and agricultural production in this case the rules must be set in such a way as to prevent an exceeding extraction of water from wells compared to the permitted amounts which causes water shortage and instability of water resources nazari et al 2018 the legal status of wuas in the current laws is the third prioritized indicator within the institutional and legal factor because the associated farmers are aware of sufficient rights and powers to exercise management this awareness undoubtedly gives farmers a strong incentive to conserve water resources pan and xu 2018 as a result this leads to the provision of appropriate irrigation services sustainable use of water resources and irrigation facilities and the promotion of agricultural water productivity gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 finally the strengthening the water dispute resolution institutions between owners indicator which has been considered of great importance in the studies of speelman et al 2010 and boyer et al 2011 gained the last priority in our research presumably because to the high social capital among tafresh farmers they usually resolve disputes between themselves without asking for external help paying attention to socio cultural factors the farmers prioritized increasing the trust between landowners because a high trust in efficient groundwater management in farmers paves the way for cooperation and group actions among associated individuals who are satisfied with the various water management operations boyer et al 2011 this is confirmed by the high rank of the improving the farmer s awareness of procurement water distribution and collected fees indicator that was the second priority among the socio cultural factors the visit of the on farm demonstration indicator which was the third priority in this study leads the members of the associations to larger access to knowledge resources such as the modern irrigation methods samian et al 2015 towards optimal use of water and an increased farm production osooli et al 2011 preventing inappropriate water extraction practices such as water theft was the last priority among the socio cultural factors presumably due to the high security of farmers in this area and their close and friendly relations with each other concerning the social capital factors increasing the trust between the members of wuas in water sharing and distribution ranked the first priority because this commonality in agricultural water management leads to the creation of a dialog among the farmers and expansion of social relations with other people in the community biresaw 2019 nilsson et al 2012 rasmussen and meinzen dick 1995 this indicator s importance is further stressed by another indicator within the social capital factors increasing intimate meetings and conversations of members outside of the association that ranked as the third priority as a matter of fact the exchange of information between farmers can make their participation in water management more conscious also in the social life out of the work approaches takayama et al 2018 the use of farmers views for water management decisions is another crucial social capital indicator and it got the second priority because it makes the associated users aware of the benefits of decisions and requirements for the implementation of agricultural water management and encourages farmers to participate more actively in the implementation of these decisions on the other hand strengthening and exchanging water management information with the board of trustees was the last rank and thus is considered a less important factor this is a critical issue in the wuas and deserves more attention because the exchange of information among farmers and trustees would make farmers aware of the board s decisions and monitor and cooperate in implementing management actions moreover thanks to this information exchange board members could know the legal infrastructural economic and even social problems of farmers and make their own management decisions with more insight and effectiveness among the infrastructural factors the faster construction of creeks canals and qanats the use of thin polyethylene films pipes for conveying water to the farm instead of the creek and the percentage of metallic water distribution valves along the waterway are the first to third priority because all these actions ensure promptness in providing irrigation water to croplands reduces water losses for evaporation from free surface networks preventing water wastage and thus increasing water consumption efficiency in qanats and canals and avoiding lowering qanats these factors if implemented with effectiveness and promptness allow a significant increase in the volume of available water resources for the production cycle with a presumable improvement of quality and quantity of the agricultural production gunchinmaa and yakubov 2010 rezadoost and allahyari 2014 samian et al 2015 the last priority attributed by farmers to the suitability of the installation of valves along the waterway is that most of the canals in this area are made of earth and irrigation uses surface methods that do not require valves there are farmers in the area who do not use modern irrigation equipment e g pressured networks with valves instead of free surface canals for economic reasons or lack of familiarity among the economic factors of water management attracting state aid for the reconstruction of the qanat the amount of credit to cover and dredge the creeks qanats and canals and increasing farmers income were first second and third priorities respectively and these results were somewhere expected improving the condition of aqueducts and irrigation canals enhances water access and distribution among farmers and ultimately increases the net worth of water resources wichelns 2002 however due to the high costs required by the improvement actions and the diffuse condition of low income smallholder for most of the farmers interviewed attracting financial assistance from the government increasing fund availability from the credit and saving part of product revenues for the renovation of qanats and irrigation canals are considered of the utmost importance obtaining credit and banking facilities and receiving incentives such as tax breaks for active water companies was the last priority although this would increase the level of welfare of farmers rezadoost and allahyari 2014 samian et al 2015 and lead to more investments in irrigation systems pan and xu 2018 however due to the very high costs of modernization of irrigation facilities and the lack of legal support in the financial support of water user organizations by the government the renovation of these canals and irrigation equipment and its financing by the government was the first priority according to the iranian laws about the wuas support policies it is stipulated that to invest in infrastructures 0 85 of the expenses should be provided by the government and the remaining 0 15 by the wuas members however based on the agricultural organization experts comments in tafresh county and the landlords the government will cover about 40 or more of the repair costs as much as possible and the rest will be the responsibility of the wuas members although in the case of a government budget deficit all estimated costs will be covered by the owners therefore it takes precedence over tax incentives and incentives for farmers especially due to the high administrative bureaucracy in iran and lack of knowledge about the benefits of tax breaks access to banking facilities and tax exemptions is difficult for the old and illiterate farmers of the county the outcomes of interviews about the prioritization of farmers participatory factors show that collecting the association s shared costs first priority repairing and rebuilding valves second priority and repairing and dredging creeks third priority is of the highest importance in agricultural water management for farmers since low government budgets and facilities do not cover the high costs of water management strengthening farmers participation in reconstruction and improvement of the irrigation systems also by a personal involvement through the provision of infrastructural services including the family working would lead to the enhancement of the irrigation performance increase in the operational efficiency of wuas and finally improvement of water management in wuas moreover an efficient collection of due water fees as payment of the irrigation service provided by wuas is considered essential to fund the wuas and this is in close accordance with the results of the studies carried out elsewhere zema et al 2018a b 2015 which demonstrated how the financial self sufficiency of wuas is able to ensure an efficient collective irrigation service cooperation of farmers with the water and agricultural organization to implement regulations related to water management was the last priority of these factors presumably due to the lack of farmers knowledge of the related benefits the confirmatory factor analysis to test the main hypothesis revealed that all factors positively and significantly affect groundwater management among these factors based on the sem results socio cultural social capital participatory legal and institutional infrastructural and economic factors have the greatest impact respectively as a result the main hypothesis that these factors improve groundwater management can be confirmed however the relationships among these factors show that the county infrastructural current agricultural situation is not a favorable environment for implementing efficient and desirable water management and this situation requires more attention and a particular focus on these factors boyer et al 2011 more specifically precise planning to strengthen socio cultural and improve social capital relations among farmers creation of economic incentives and financial and credit support from relevant agencies solving problems and inadequacies of irrigation systems the infrastructural and principled maintenance of irrigation networks through increased participation of users and a more efficient water fee collection from the associated farmers could be suggested by this analysis to improve groundwater management and the sustainability of wuas nazari et al 2018 osooli et al 2011 pan and xu 2018 on the other hand social capital and legal and institutional factors among farmers must be renovated to avoid gradual obsolescence and inefficiency with the implementation of formal education in the local communities as stated by some relevant studies about the impacts of social capital factors on the improvement of water resources systems akolgo and ayentimi 2020 moreover according to khalkheili and zamani 2009 social factors are not related to farmers participation regarding the impact of economic factors undoubtedly all factors may indirectly affect water management zema et al 2020 but the analysis of the indirect relations among these factors went beyond the scope of our study for instance it should be important to analyze whether all factors affect groundwater management through the economic factor which would require separate and more complete research pearson correlation analysis which tested the second hypothesis that all factors would directly and positively affect each other and showed significant relationships among all six factors showed significant relationships between all six factors it should be noted that the correlation coefficient between two variables can show the type and extent of the relationship between the two variables linearly but cannot be used to show the effect of one variable on another variable however we find that the results of this test give wuas the ability to make more informed decisions to improve water management in wuas by knowing the degree of correlation between the factors shown in the research framework it also gives managers the ability to predict changes in other variables by examining changes in each model factor the critical point is the degree of correlation and strong relationship between participatory and the legal and institutional factors this relationship points out that in order to better promote water management in wuas and improve their performance in water management planning politicians must invest more than anything else in the legal and institutional and participatory factors overall the confirmation of both working hypotheses suggests comprehensive attention to all the evaluated factors as a management strategy to enhance the optimal management of agricultural water in wuas 5 conclusions the study has shown that in the wuas of tafresh county iran the legal and institutional socio cultural social capital infrastructural factors as well as the farmers participation not only are strongly interrelated but are also able to improve groundwater management the analysis of the indicators nested into these factors has indicated the need for actions to strengthen an efficient use and share of irrigation resources which should be implemented according to the priorities socio cultural social capital participatory legal and institutional infrastructural economic factors as given by the confirmatory factor analysis therefore from this study it is evident that in the case study the prerequisites for improving the management of the wuas are basically four i providing members with new water management technologies that can be provided directly or through the government in order to increase the efficiency in extraction distribution and consumption of irrigation water ii strengthening the role and importance of social and cultural participation in the management of wuas through a better understanding of the barriers to the social involvement and the impact of cultural capital in order to create formal and informal contexts for enhancing individual participation in the short and long term iii designing appropriate financing factors and diversification of the sources of revenue to execute projects on shared water resources vi involving young human resources with higher education levels into the existing wuas and agricultural water management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
